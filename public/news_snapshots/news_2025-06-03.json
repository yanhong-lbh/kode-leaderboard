    "title": "Lead detective’s text messages cast shadow over Karen Read murder trial",
    "article_text": "Karen Read leaves Norfolk Superior Courthouse at the end of Day 24 of her trial in Dedham, Massachusetts on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Richard Beetham for Fox News Digital) Special prosecutor Hank Brennan may have dulled the impact of inappropriate text messages the lead homicide detective sent regardingKaren Readdays before she was charged with the murder of John O'Keefe – but they're still damaging to the state's case and not just because he used vulgar and obscene language, experts say. The texts were a bomb that blew up the first trial when they were read with Michael Proctor on the witness stand, and it ended with a deadlocked jury last year. This time around, prosecutors decided not to call him as a witness, and it was his childhood friend Jonathan Diamandis who – visibly uncomfortable – walked the jury through the conversation. But beyond the crass remarks about Read, experts say less explosive messages about Proctor's early opinions of the investigation could be damning. \"Proctor is mentally begging [the defense] to call him,\" retiredMassachusetts Superior CourtJudge and Boston College law professor Jack Lu told Fox News Digital. \"Now that the texts are in, they will not call Proctor unless they are convinced they have lost – the old ‘Hail Mary’ pass.\" KAREN READ UPDATE: FIRED LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON WITNESS LIST FOR 2ND TRIAL IN BOSTON COP JOHN O'KEEFE'S DEATH Karen Read sits with her defense team, from left, Robert Alessi, Elizabeth Little, Alan Jackson, and David Yannetti during her murder retrial in Norfolk Superior Court, in Dedham, Mass., Monday, June 2, 2025.(Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool) Lu said the defense team gained some ground with Diamandis on the stand, but with Brennan facing the text chain head-on, the messages were likely not a significant shift in Read’s favor. \"Will the jury be truly shocked by abusive texts from a police officer investigating a person they think is a murderer?\" Lu said. \"I doubt it.\" Read is accused of hitting her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O’Keefe, with her Lexus SUV during a drunken argument before leaving himto freeze to deathin the front yard of a friend’s home in the early morning hours of Jan. 29, 2022. Diamandis testified he has been in a group chat with Proctor for more than a decade and was privy to text messages sent during the investigation into O’Keefe’s death. KAREN READ CASE: MASSACHUSETTS TROOPER MICHAEL PROCTOR 'TERMINATED' FROM STATE POLICE Jonathan Diamandis, a longtime friend of Michael Proctor, testifies for the defense during the murder retrial of Karen Read in Norfolk Superior Court, in Dedham, Mass., on Monday, June 2, 2025.(Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool) The Massachusetts State Police fired Proctor in March after an internal investigation found he had shared sensitive and confidential information about the case with people outside of law enforcement. Read’s first trial revealed inappropriate text messages the lead investigator sent as thecase was unfolding. \"The messages prove one thing, and that Michael is human – not corrupt, not incompetent in his role as a homicide detective and certainly not unfit to continue to be a Massachusetts State Trooper,\" his sister, Courtney Proctor, previously said in a statement. On cross-examination, Brennan asked Diamandis to read to the jury Proctor’s messages from the day O’Keefe’s body was discovered.

He sent them around 11 p.m. on Jan. 29, 2022 – the day O'keefe had been found. An autopsy wasn't completed until two days later. \"These text messages were from the night of John O’Keefe’s death, and it appears that Michael Proctor has already come to a conclusion about the case – before the medical examiner's report,\" Edwards told Fox News Digital. \"His conclusion was premature.\" Proctor’s alleged rush to implicate Read could have caused him to ignore evidence pointing to other possibilities surrounding the cause of O’Keefe’s death, according to Edwards. \"Michael Proctor is not qualified to make a determination about how John O'Keefe died,\" Edwards said. \"That is what we have medical examiners for. Based on the text messages, Michael Proctor had come to that conclusion all on his own within hours of O’Keefe’s death.\" KAREN READ JUDGE BLOCKS SANDRA BIRCHMORE MENTIONS; EXPERT SAYS CASES SHOULD BE WAKE-UP CALL FOR POLICE Officer John O’Keefe poses for his official headshot. O’Keefe’s girlfriend, Karen Reed, is currently on trial for murder after he was found dead outside of a Massachusetts home in January 2022.(Boston Police Department) Criminal defense attorney Mark Bederow also pointed to Proctor’s professional inability to determine what – or who – killed O’Keefe, and how the immediate assumption could have been detrimental to the investigation. \"[Proctor] is not qualified to say that,\" Bederow told Fox News Digital. \"There is an abundance of evidence of Proctor’s investigative tunnel vision and bias.\" As the tone of the texts shifted, Diamandis told the courtroom he did not want to continue reading the messages aloud because they contained \"uncomfortable words,\" prompting Brennan to read them and ask Diamandis to confirm that what he was reading was an accurate depiction of the texts on the chain. Karen Read and John O'Keefe pose for an undated photograph.(Karen Read) GET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THETRUE CRIME HUB \"Yeah, she’s a babe,\" Proctor wrote. \"Weird Fall River accent though. No a--.\" The text chain turned obscene at points, including mocking Read over a purported medical issue. Proctor is subject to witness sequestration and declined to comment. FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X Proctor is on the defense witness list, but Read's team called Diamandis instead, in what Edwards believes is a risky move by the defense. \"Brennan has now taken the wind out of the sails of the defense because the reading of those texts did not have the impact that they did during the first trial when Michael Proctor read them himself,\" Edwards said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The choice to call Proctor’s childhood friend could be viewed as a safe way for the defense team to drop the bombshell text chain withoutrisking cross-examinationby the state. On the other hand, the defense can now point to the fact that prosecutors declined to put their lead investigator on the witness stand, Bederow said. \"They’ll likely pursue a ‘missing witness’ instruction from the court in which the judge will inform jurors they may draw an adverse inference against prosecution for their failure to call Proctor,\" he said. \"It is virtually unheard of for the prosecution not to call the lead investigator in a murder case, but of course it's also extraordinarily rare that the lead investigator was terminated for unprofessional behavior and bias on [the same] case.\" Julia Bonavita is a U.S. Writer for Fox News Digital and a Fox Flight Team drone pilot.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Jesse Watters highlights some of President Donald Trump's accomplishments in his first 100 days in office on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Nearly six months into his second term, PresidentDonald Trumphas a new portrait posted to the White House website. White Houseofficials posted an eight-second video to social media on Monday, showing the new portrait being hung on the wall at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House Campus. In his previous presidential portrait, which was unveiled just days before taking the oath of office for his second term, Trump could be seen wearing a blue suit coat, white button-up shirt and blue tie. The president showed no expression in the previous portrait, compared to an official portrait taken of him in 2017, in which he was smiling. LIZ PEEK: DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO Official portrait of President Donald Trump unveiled in June 2025.(White House) In the portrait unveiled on Monday, Trump is wearing a blue suit coat, white button-up shirt and a red tie. In both images, he has an American Flag pinned to his coat. The president also shows little expression in the new portrait. White House officials told Fox News Digital the photo was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok. TRUMP PORTRAIT HE CLAIMED WAS 'PURPOSEFULLY DISTORTED' TO BE TAKEN DOWN FROM COLORADO CAPITOL As of Monday evening, the photo is hanging in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, and it will eventually start rolling out to other offices and federal buildings. Trump’s new portrait was unveiled just days after he announced that he was firingKim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, for being a \"strong supporter\" of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). He announced Sajet’s termination in a post on Truth Social on Friday afternoon. DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI President Donald Trump's first portrait for his second term in the Oval Office was unveiled just days before his inauguration.(Trump-Vance Transition Team) \"Upon the request and recommendation of many people, I am hereby terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,\" the president wrote. \"She is a highly partisan person, and astrong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position. Her replacement will be named shortly. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" A White House official told Fox News Digital that Sajet had donated $3,982 to Democrats, including the presidential campaigns of former President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. Sajet also reportedly donated to other Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The White House also pointed to the gallery's photo of Trump, which was curated by Sajet. The caption of the photo reads, \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\" Greg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

Dubbed\"Golf's Longest Day,\"Homa was one of numerous golfers, including Rickie Fowler, Cameron Young, Bud Cauley, Jake Knapp, Padraig Harrington, and Adam Hadwin attempting to qualify for Oakmont at 10 different locations across the country. Kinsale Golf and Fitness Club was home to six of the qualifying spots, and the golfers were in for two rounds on Monday. But on his 36th hole, a three-putt put Homa into a five-man playoff, along with Fowler, Young, Eric Cole, and Chase Johnson. Young grabbed the final spot with a birdie on hole 38.

    "title": "MI5 neo-Nazi spy: Judge had 'no confidence' in Security Service's account of false evidence",
    "article_text": "MI5 is facing fresh scrutiny in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent after a High Court judge said he had \"no confidence\" in the Security Service's account of how a senior officer gave false evidence. Ahead of a court hearing on Tuesday, the BBC can reveal Mr Justice Chamberlain ordered MI5 to hand over secret documents about the case. He also said there was a further issue about the \"correctness\" of new evidence provided by a very senior MI5 officer. Tuesday's hearing comes four months after the BBC revealedMI5 had lied to three courts about a misogynistic agent known as X. The agent used his MI5 role to coerce and terrorise his girlfriend, attacking her with a machete. The most senior judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr, and the President of the King's Bench Division Dame Victoria Sharp, will now join Mr Justice Chamberlain to consider what, if any, action should be taken about MI5's false evidence. There are a range of potential options, from accepting the conclusions of MI5's investigations to initiating contempt of court proceedings against MI5 itself or individual officers - or both. Usually, contempt of court proceedings are referred to the Attorney General, currently Lord Hermer, but in this case, he is technically representing MI5. Details about MI5's internal investigation into how it came to give the false evidence, which were included in the secret documents given to the court, may also be made public on Tuesday. MI5 gave the evidence in 2022 after then-Attorney General Suella Braverman sought an injunction to stop a BBC investigation about X. She won him legal anonymity butfailed to prevent the story being published. During that case, a senior spy known only as Witness A said MI5 had stuck to its policy to \"neither confirm nor deny\" (NCND) that X was an MI5 agent during conversations with me in 2020, when I was investigating X's conduct. But, in February this year, the BBC was able to reveal Witness A's evidence was false. In fact, MI5 had disclosed X's status in phone calls to me, which I had made notes of and recorded, as the Security Service tried to persuade me to drop my investigation. MI5's false claim was repeated in two other courts considering a legal claim against the Security Service by X's former girlfriend, known publicly as \"Beth\". During hearings in recent weeks, Mr Justice Chamberlain raised the new concerns regarding MI5's account of how it came to give the false evidence. These concerns centred on accounts of the two investigations launched after the BBC exposed MI5's false claims in February this year - an internal one, and an external review by the government's former chief lawyer Sir Jonathan Jones KC, commissioned by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. In April, the court and the BBC were provided with a witness statement by the very senior MI5 officer - known as Witness B - purporting to summarise the investigations. They were also given an open, non-secret version of Sir Jonathan's external review. Although the court can receive sensitive information - and had security-cleared barristers, known as special advocates, acting on behalf of the BBC - it was not given a secret, closed version of the external review, nor a copy of the internal investigation report and its underlying documents. After a request by the special advocates, Mr Justice Chamberlain made clear he wanted disclosure of the closed version of the external review. During a later hearing he ordered that MI5 also hand over the internal investigation report described by Witness B, as well as policy documents and interview notes with MI5 officers. He also raised concerns about whether the open, non-secret documents originally provided to the court and the BBC were an accurate reflection of the closed versions. He said Witness B had claimed the original open version of the report was a \"fair and accurate\" reflection of the closed version. But, having read the closed report, Mr Justice Chamberlain gave his provisional view that: The court will also hear on Tuesday whether MI5 will be able to continue to apply its policy of NCND in relation to the agent status of X within the legal case itself, despite publicly accepting it had departed from the policy in phone calls to me. The NCND policy has allowed MI5 to withhold material from the BBC as well as the separate case brought by X's former girlfriend Beth. She had complained about MI5 to a specialist court, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), and then sought a judicial review in a third court of an IPT ruling that allowed MI5 to apply NCND. It meant that material confirming X's agent status has been confined to secret hearings, where she was represented by the tribunal's own barristers and her lawyers were excluded. The scheme aims to help park staff safely address harassment of women and girls when they see it. Gloucestershire Police hopes to improve the way it reports violence against women - placing responsibility on perpetrators.

    "article_text": "The UK government has threatened to sue former Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich to make sure the money from the club's sale goes to Ukraine. The £2.5bn in proceeds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, with Mr Abramovich sanctioned after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The UK government wants the money to be for Ukrainian humanitarian aid, but Mr Abramovich has said he wants it to go to \"all victims of the war in Ukraine\". In a joint statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: \"While the door for negotiations will remain open, we are fully prepared to pursue this through the courts if required.\" They said they wanted \"to ensure people suffering in Ukraine can benefit from these proceeds as soon as possible\". They added: \"The government is determined to see the proceeds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club reach humanitarian causes in Ukraine, following Russia's illegal full-scale invasion. \"We are deeply frustrated that it has not been possible to reach agreement on this with Mr Abramovich so far\". The delay in releasing the fundscentres on a disagreement between the UK government and his lawyers. Mr Abramovich - a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas - was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale. He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied. He cannot access the £2.5bn sale proceeds under UK sanctions but the money still legally belongs to him. When he announced his decision to sell the club, he said proceeds from the sale would be donated via a foundation \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine\", which would include those in Russia. The UK government has pushed back and argued that the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine. A House of Lords committee said last year said it was \"incomprehensible\" that Mr Abramovich's promise to use the funds to support Ukraine remained unfulfilled, and that the assets remained frozen. \"This impasse reflects badly on both Mr Abramovich and the government, which ought to have pushed for a more binding commitment,\" the report said. Funds worth £2.5bn - meant to help Ukrainians - remain frozen in a UK bank account over a row about how to use them. A group of MPs is urging an investigation into £1bn that could be owed by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. Scheme to avoid tax on offshore billions may have been botched because money was managed from the UK, BBC learns. Shell companies were used to charter the sanctioned oligarch’s yachts to himself, evading VAT, BBC reveals. A money trail emerges after the former Chelsea owner denied a financial relationship with Russian leader.",

    "title": "UN calls for investigation into killings near Gaza aid distribution site",
    "article_text": "The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution centre in Gaza on Sunday, amid disputed reports that Israeli forces had opened fire on people waiting to collect aid. Witnesses reported being shot at while waiting for food from the centre in Rafah run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Red Cross said its hospital received 179 casualties, 21 of whom were dead. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency put the death toll at 31. On Sunday, the Israeli military denied its troops fired at civilians near or within the site and said reports to this effect were false. The GHF said the reports were \"outright fabrications\" and that it was yet to see evidence of an attack at or near its facility. Israel does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza, making verifying what is happening in the territory difficult. UN Secretary-General Guterres said in a statement on Monday: \"I am appalled by the reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza yesterday. \"I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.\" Israel's foreign ministry responded by branding his comments a \"disgrace\" in a post on X, and criticised him for not mentioning Hamas. Later on Monday, UN human rights chief Volker Turk told the BBC the way humanitarian aid is now being delivered is \"unacceptable\" and \"dehumanising\". \"I think what it shows is utter disregard for civilians. Can you imagine people that have been absolutely desperate for food, for medicine, for almost three months and then they have to run for it or try to get it in the most desperate circumstances? Mr Turk told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. \"It does show a huge dehumanisation of the people who are desperately in need.\" The Civil Defence agency said 31 people were killed and 176 wounded \"after Israeli gunfire targeted thousands of civilians near the American aid centre in Rafah\" early on Sunday morning. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah received a \"mass casualty influx\" of 179 cases, including women and children, at that time. The majority suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds, and 21 were declared dead upon arrival, it said, adding \"all patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site\". Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its teams at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis also treated people with serious injuries, some of whom were in a critical condition. It added the patients \"reported being shot at from all sides by Israeli drones, helicopters, boats, tanks and soldiers\", and that one staff member's brother was \"killed while attempting to collect aid from the distribution centre\". A journalist in Rafah told the BBC a crowd of Palestinians had gathered near al-Alam roundabout in Rafah, close to the GHF's site, when Israeli tanks approached and opened fire. One video posted online on Sunday morning appeared to show Palestinians taking cover in an open area of sandy terrain while what sounds like automatic gunfire rings out. However, the BBC was unable to verify the location because there are not enough features visible. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) put out a statement on Sunday afternoon that said an initial inquiry indicated its troops \"did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the humanitarian aid distribution site and that reports to this effect are false\". Spokesman Brig Gen Effie Defrin accused Hamas of \"spreading rumours\" and \"trying bluntly and violently to stop the people of Gaza from reaching those distribution centres\". The IDF also released drone video it said showed armed men firing at civilians on their way to collect aid, although the BBC was unable to verify where or when it was filmed. Later on Sunday, an Israeli military official briefed reporters that soldiers had acted to \"prevent a number of suspects from approaching the forces\" approximately 1km from the GHF site, before it opened. \"Warning shots were fired,\" the official said, before insisting there was \"no connection between the incident in question and the false allegations against the IDF\". The GHF said in a statement on Monday that the reports were \"the most egregious in terms of outright fabrications and misinformation fed to the international media community. \"There were no injuries, fatalities or incidents during our operations yesterday. Period. We have yet to see any evidence that there was an attack at or near our facility.\" The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, accused major news outlets of \"reckless and irresponsible reporting\" on the matter. \"Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos,\" he said on Monday. \"The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,\" he added. Meanwhile on Monday, health officials and local media reported that another three Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near the same GHF centre in Rafah's Tal al-Sultan area. A Red Cross spokesman told the Associated Press that its field hospital in Rafah received 50 wounded people, mostly with gunshot and shrapnel wounds, including two declared dead on arrival, while Nasser hospital in nearby Khan Younis said it received a third body. The Israeli military said in a statement that \"warning shots were fired toward several suspects who advanced toward\" troops approximately 1km from the site. The military added it was \"aware of reports regarding casualties, and the details of the incident are being thoroughly looked into\". Also on Monday, the Civil Defence reported that 14 people, including six children and three women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in the northern town of Jabalia. More than 20 others were believed to be missing under the rubble of the destroyed building, it said. There was no immediate comment from the IDF, but it said in a statement that its aircraft had struck dozens of targets across Gaza over the past day, including \"military structures belonging to terror organisations\", underground tunnels, and weapons stores. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would see troops \"take control of all areas\" of Gaza. The following day, he said Israel would also temporarily ease the blockade and allow a \"basic\" amount of food into Gaza. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,470 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,201 since Israel resumed its offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Hamdi al-Najjar's wife and 11-year-old son Adam, who was severely injured, are the only survivors in their family. Reports say an incident occurred in Rafah in the early hours of Sunday as people were queueing for aid. The response is seen as neither an explicit rejection nor clear acceptance of the proposal, but US envoy Steve Witkoff has branded it \"unacceptable\". Touted as a vital lifeline for Gazans facing  starvation, the first week of the new plan has been beset by chaos. Tom Fletcher, the under-secretary general of humanitarian affairs, says \"we're seeing food set on the borders and not being allowed in\".",

    "article_text": "Several front pages focus on the new searches in Portugal by detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, 18 years after she vanished while on holiday there. The Telegraph says the operation is believed to bea \"final push\"to secure evidence needed to bring the prime suspect Christian Brueckner to court. The Daily Mirror says officerswill scour rural land close to his former homewith \"wells, ruins and water storage tanks\" among the places set to be examined. According to The Sun,ground-penetrating radarwill be used to search trenches dug for works that were taking place at the time the three-year-old went missing, but have since been filled in. The Times reports on a call from Sir Tony Blair for Britain tolead the way with AIdoctors and nurses or risk being left behind in what he describes as the biggest upheaval since the Industrial Revolution. The former prime minister made the comments at a festival in London where he urged the government to embrace artificial intelligence in every department, warning the UK couldn't afford to be squeamish about the technology. The paper says the technology secretary Peter Kyle told the same event he was willing to take risks on AI because it was a greater risk to resist change. With the headline\"Tory warnings over backdoor blasphemy law\", the Daily Mail highlights concerns expressed by Kemi Badenoch, following the conviction of a protestor who burned a copy of the Koran. It says the Conservative leader believes the case should go to appeal after she said she would defend freedom of belief and freedom not to believe until her dying day. When asked about the case last night, the prime minister's spokesman said there were no blasphemy laws in England and there were no plans to introduce any. The Guardian claims to have learned that the recent airstrikes on school buildings being used to shelter displaced Palestinians in Gaza are part ofa deliberate bombing strategyby the Israelis and more schools have been identified as targets. It says the Israel Defence Forces insists it operates on the grounds of military necessity and within international law. Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "title": "High-rise, high expectations: is Casablanca’s finance hub a model for African development?",
    "article_text": "For centuries, Casablanca was a significant trading hub for merchants from across the breadth of the Atlantic coast, given its geographical position betweenAfrica, the Middle East and Europe. These days, Morocco’s economic capital is merging those historical roots with a strong modern commercial identity. One such manifestation is the Casablanca Finance City (CFC) district, whose high-rise buildings stand as a symbol of the city’s dream of being a main gateway for international investment into Africa. Since the district launched in December 2010, its attractive tax regime has brought in entities from across the globe. There was a slowdown in sign-ups to the hub during the Covid-19 pandemic but it now hosts 240 companies, including Huawei and Schneider Electric, accounting for more than 7,000 jobs. “We welcome companies from multiple sectors … [and] we also support them in their development into the continent,” said Lamia Merzouki, its chief operating officer. Over the past decade, Moroccan investment across Africa has sharply risen: from $100m in 2014 to $2.8bn in 2024. As of March 2025, it was ranked fourth in the Middle East and Africa region and 57th out of 119 overall on the Global Financial Centres Index. Brigitte Labou, the head of customs practice for Francophone Africa at KPMG Avocats, based in Paris, says hubs such as the CFC are “important levers for accelerating the industrialisation of Africa. “The financial hub that the CFC represents, as well as the related tax advantages, are assets that can attract the relocation of production chains to Morocco and Africa,” she added. Representing a key entry point for business into Africa, the CFC is seen by the Moroccan government as a valuable component of theAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a trade agreement with the promise of a unified African market of 1.4 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4tn. It was approved by the African Union in 2012 and launched seven years later, but implementation has been slow. But in a time of global tariff wars, African economists are hoping agreements such as AfCFTA can help. In May, as hundreds of African business executives in various shades of suits converged in Abidjan inIvory Coastfor the Africa CEO Forum, intracontinental trade during tariff disruption topped the agenda. The South African president,Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking during an all-presidential panel in Abidjan, proposed more collaboration on the continent as a solution. “We would like the private sector to follow in tandem with the public sector, and to embrace the AfCFTA and also be active participants … [AfCFTA] is going to be the pathfinder”, he told more than 2,800 delegates. Merzouki agrees. “In this context of trade wars, the African free trade area is really a must,” she said after the session. “We need to accelerate the momentum. Regional integration is a must for us, and this is something that we have been nourishing since the beginning.” There is criticism that the CFC’s focus on attracting foreign capital has done little to address deep-seated inequalities within Morocco. Recent trade data for 2024 also shows that the EU – rather than Africa – is still a destination for at least two-thirds of Moroccan exports. In response to this discrepancy, Merzouki said the data “should not overshadow the dynamic cooperation between Morocco and the rest of Africa”. There is also regular criticism of Morocco’s constitutional monarchy system, but supporters say this has projected an image of calm that seems to have benefited Casablanca, compared with other African hubs. “Even if there are lots of different trade wars and economic upheavals and so on, Morocco remains a stable platform,” said Merzouki. “There is political stability, macroeconomic stability. We have a lot of international players that give us this feedback. They want to come to Casablanca because it remains stable.” Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion It is now marketing this profile of a haven within chaos to draw in more entities amid one of the biggest global trade disruptions in decades. Since Donald Trump resumed his second term as US president, he has upended trade deals and hiked tariffs, including for all of Africa. The CFC is also cooperating with two dozen African investment promotion agencies, including those of Nigeria and Ivory Coast, seeking new opportunities to increase infrastructural development. It also hosts the Africa50 fund, a vehicle launched in 2015 by theAfrican Development Bank, with initial capital of $700m from 20 member states, to spur infrastructure development across the continent. The district is also pivoting to accommodate its interest in artificial intelligence – having launched an Africa Innovation Lab to support fintechs – and sustainable financing. Currently, Africa generates only 2% of its potential in carbon credits, which are permits countries or companies can exchange to fund initiatives that reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Merzouki, a former chair of the UN Development Programme’s Financial Centres for Sustainability Network, thinks the continent can become an energy powerhouse with the right conditions: technology transfer, capacity building, financing. Last September, the CFC signed an agreement with another Moroccan agency to launch a voluntary carbon market for private entities as part of a push to start a carbon-efficient ecosystem. Still, there are limits to African financial hubs such as the CFC: doing business is notoriously difficult in many African countries and red tape and archaic policies continue to stymie the flow of cash and workers across borders. Bright Simons, the vice-president of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education in Accra, Ghana, says the hubs are merely short-term solutions that cloud the big picture. “The unique selling point for the hubs is to try and concentrate resources in a manner that tries to circumvent some of those [logistical and infrastructural] barriers,” he said. “African governments, rather than go the long route of trying to actually fix these problems, are trying to look for shortcuts, and perhaps hubs have become the cleverest but most visible way.”",

    "title": "Vanuatu criticises Australia for extending gas project while making Cop31 bid",
    "article_text": "Vanuatu’s climate minister has expressed disappointment over Australia’s decision to extend one of the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas projects and said it raises questions over its bid to co-host the Cop31 summit with Pacific nations. The UN is expected to announce which country will host the major climate summit in the coming weeks, with Australia pushing for the event to be held in Adelaide as part of a “Pacific Cop”. Speaking to the Guardian, Vanuatu’s minister for climate adaptation Ralph Regenvanu said Pacific leaders who have supported the co-hosting proposal now have “questions raised” followingAustralia’s decision to greenlight Woodside’s North West Shelf gas project until 2070. Scientists and activists have said the life extension could be linked to up to 6bn tonnes of greenhouse gases being emitted in the decades ahead. “This is not the leadership we want to see from Australia, if they are to be the host of Cop at the same time,” Regenvanu told the Guardian. Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, visited Vanuatu the week before her government approved the extension of theWoodsidegas plant. While there, she said Australia had been “a very emissions-intensive economy” and that “[we] have to turn that around”. Regenvanu called this “double speak from Australia” and feared the same would take place during Cop. “It’s bewildering for those of us in the Pacific to hear one message and then to see the actions completely contradict what the government is saying to us,” Regenvanu told the Guardian. Despite his concerns around Australia’s support for the fossil fuel industry, Regenvanu said he continued to back the Australian government on the Cop31 bid. “We continue to stand with Australia, but we feel very disappointed in what’s happened,” Regenvanu said. “It raises, obviously, questions about whether Australia really is a partner of choice and whether it really is a friend of the Pacific.” Cop, or the “Conference of parties on climate change”, includes meetings where governments negotiate how to respond to climate change while developing treaties like the Paris agreement to curtail rising global temperatures. The UN climate talkshave been criticisedin the past for being held in major fossil fuel producing countries, with some experts calling for hosts to first prove their climate credentials. Pacific leaders have supported Australia’s bid to host a Pacific Cop in 2026, saying the conference would help highlight the crisis Pacific nations face as a result of a warming climate and help them advocate for more ambitious global action. But regional leaders have also criticised Australia’s continued reliance on fossil fuels. Palau’s president, Surangel Whipps Jr, has saidthe “merit and credibility” of Australia’s bid relies in part on its commitment to shift away from new gas and coal developments. Tuvalu’s minister for home affairs, climate change and environment, Maina Talia, said Australia’s decision to extend the North West Gas shelf project was “threatening our survival and violating the spirit of the Pacific-Australia climate partnership”.",

    "article_text": "Follow today’s news live Anthony Albanese shrugs off Dorinda Cox’s sharp criticism of Labor before party switch Get ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcast The Greens have been accused of “losing their way” after senator Dorinda Cox defected to Labor in the aftermath of the party’s tough election result,AAPreports. The prime minister said her values had become more aligned with those of his government, and noted the Greens had previously voted against Labor’s legislation to boost housing supply and had drifted from its environmental foundations to other issues. “We know that the Greens have lost their way,” Albanese told ABC radio earlier today, adding: I think having to sit in the Senate while the Greens blocked funding for public housing would grate against anyone who regards themselves as progressive. More on Victoria’s warmest autumn on record, with temperatures 1.9C above average The BoMsaid yesterdaythat Victoria had its warmest autumn on record, surpassing a record last set in 2016. Temperatures were 1.9C above average for the season. But things were balmy around the entire country, which saw its fourth-warmest autumn since national observations began in 1910. Weatherzone’s Anthony Sharwoodwritesthe levels are notable for several reasons: No part of Australia saw below-average temperatures this autumn; temperatures in NSW were above average overall despite heavy rainfall and flooding in some ares; and a large patch of southern Australia spanning Victoria, SA and NSW all saw record-breaking or much higher than average temperatures. A large swath of southern Australia also saw rainfall very much below average. In Victoria, it was the ninth-driest autumn on record. Pressed for more details on the $3bn in savings measures,Symesoutlined a range of other cost strategies, such as corporate savings through “automation” and by ending “lapsing programs”.Puglielliasks whether the use of automation included job losses due to artificial intelligence. Symes said: I wouldn’t probably characterise it like that. We’re not replacing humans with robots, but we are certainly looking at efficiencies and technology and ensuring that people can do their job as effectively as possible. In relation to the opportunities for AI, I think the ability for people to be assisted to do their job, I think there’s some great opportunities in that respect. Back to the Victorian budget estimates The treasurer,Jacyln Symes, was asked earlier about the government’s review into the public service, being led byHelen Silver. Symes says there are $3bn worth of savings measures in her budget that are a result of interim recommendations of Silver’s, including from measures such as “consolidation of accommodation”. But she refused to detail the interim recommendations, saying they will remain confidential until Silver submits her final report on 30 June: Greens MPAiv Pugliellithen refers toa report in Guardian Australiathis morning about the “Gold Review” – put together by public servants suggesting that widespread job losses could be avoided by “culling” executive-level roles.

The text message fromBetzillo, sent minutes before kick off, was sent to people who said they had never interacted with the company before: State of Origin kicks off shortly! Get $20 if QLD wears maroon coloured jerseys + $50 Free Bet on top. Ends at kick off. The ad included a link to a website that offers live in-play betting, which is not permitted in Australia. Betzillo’s website describes itself as “Australia’s number one gambling site”, but it is not included on theAustralian Communications and Media Authority’s (Acma) list of registered online gambling companies. Acma believes Betzillo, which has been contacted for comment, is licensed overseas. It launched an investigation into the company shortly after being notified of the messages. An Acma spokesperson has urged people to avoid offshore gambling companies, which often give an impression they are based in Australia. Under the Spam Act 2003, it is illegal to send commercial electronic messages such as promotional SMS without consent. Commercial messages must also identify the sender, include a way to contact them, and provide a way to opt out or unsubscribe from further messages. Some prohibited online gambling services look like they’re legal in Australia and some even target Australian players. If people use an illegal service, Australian regulators will not be able to help if the service provider withholds winnings.

Bradfield recount likely to end in coming days, election-watcher says The recount for the NSW seat of Bradfield is likely to end late tomorrow or sometime Thursday, election-watcherKevin Bonhamsays after an AEC briefing. Bonhamnoted on his blogthat despite that timeline, the level of challenges from election scrutineers can be unpredictable. He also said a recent changes in the margin linked to a polling booth in Turramurra was not the result of any data issue, but a large number of formality changes. He added that data suggests the number of multiple votes was low, possibly in the single digits. At the current margin, the AEC would probably not lodge a challenge, Bonham wrote. The margin sits at 33 votes in favour of independent Nicolette Boele. Sydney’s M5 East Tunnel isclosed in both directionsafter a crane crashed inside it, according to Live Traffic NSW. Motorists are being diverted around the tunnel on to other roadways or the M8. It’s unclear if the accident will be cleared before the afternoon rush hour. An alert reads: Avoid the area and can consider using the D5 detour instead in both directions. Due to the nature of the incident, there is no forecast as to when all lanes will reopen. Free AFL tickets for Victorian children for round 21 As the Victorian government gets grilled in budget estimates today, the sports minister,Steve Dimopolus, held a press conference to announce free AFL tickets for kids in round 21. Kicking off 31 July, AFL round 21 tickets will be free for children aged 14 and under in Victoria. Dimopoulous says it will mean more families can enjoy a weekend of footy, including five matches across Melbourne and Geelong. It comes after the government made a similar announcement last year for round 24. Legal group ‘deeply concerned’ over uni expulsions linked to pro-Palestine demonstrations The Human Rights Law Centre says it is “deeply concerned” at the “repressive measures” taken by universities around the country after thefirst formal expulsion of pro-Palestine student activistssincewaves of campus demonstrationsbegan in 2023. On Monday, four students at the University of Melbourne (UoM) had their enrolments terminated and two were suspended for six months after taking part in a pro-Palestine demonstration at an academic’s office last October. Sarah Schwartz, legal director at the centre, said students who wished to “peacefully stand up for human rights” should be “welcome and free to do so”. Schwartz said: The UoM’s new draconiananti-protest and surveillance measureswill have a chilling effect on campus life. They jeopardise the role of universities as places where students, staff and the broader community can freely express ideas, gather peacefully, and have challenging conversations. The vice-chancellor of the UoM,Emma Johnston, told Guardian Australia universities were places where “free and open debate must take place”. But she said “the safety of our students and staff must also be protected as this is integral to enabling free and open debate”. Ian Roberts slams Run It Straight challenge, says hits can have ‘catastrophic’ effects More fromIan Robertsthis morning. The former NRL player said he was deeply concerned about the Run It Straight social media trend, saying science had shown repeated head trauma can be harmful to health. He told Nine’s Today: All this stuff gets airtime. But it’s really dangerous stuff. … Repeated head knocks and concussions: Like I was saying earlier, the science is already out there, mate. That’s damaging long term. There are consequences long term. A New Zealand teen died last month after playing a tackling game believed to be inspired by the challenge. Victorian premier describes neo-Nazi protest as ‘disgusting’ Jacinta Allan, has condemned a group of neo-Nazis who gathered outside Northland shopping centre and unfurled a racist banner, describing them as “cowards”. Police are investigating the demonstration by the National Socialist Network, after an alleged fight between “rival youth gangs” last month that forced the centre into lockdown. In response to that incident, the state government moved to fast-track a ban on the sale of machetes. Guardian Australia has chosen not to publish the wording on the banner. Allan said: “This is disgusting behaviour by a group of cowards who seek to do nothing more than intimidate and spread hatred – we will not stand for it.I strongly condemn this hateful, extremist behaviour and it has no place here in Victoria. Allan says the Victorian government has recently passed tougher hate speech laws, which give “more powers for police to deal with people who whip up hate and fear against Victorians because of who they are”. These powers and tougher penalties, however, won’t come into effect until September. She also pointed to existing bans on Nazi symbols and gestures and the government’s proposed protest laws that will prohibit the wearing of face coverings at demonstrations and empower police to demand their removal. Allan says: “Now we are unmasking Nazis through our protest laws, and we are making it impossible for them to function by putting their vilifying threats and incitements in the Crimes Act – where they belong.",

We’re waiting for the jury to return to the court room in Morwell Prior to the lunch break, the prosecution asked to raise an issue in the absence of the jury. We’ll bring you more updates once theErinPattersontrial resumes. The court has adjourned until 2.15pm. Catch up on the morning’s proceedings thanks to our justice and courts reporter,Nino Bucci. She says the lead-up to it was a “process over several months”. She says she was confident she knew what the field and horse mushrooms she had picked were. I cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it. They tasted good and I didn’t get sick. Patterson said sometimes she would put foraged mushrooms in meals she ate with her children. I chopped them up very, very small so they couldn’t pick them out. Patterson recalls a time walking in the Korumburra area when her dog ate some mushrooms. I picked all the mushrooms that I could see because I wanted to try to figure out what they were. She says she wanted to work out if the mushrooms would be a “problem” for her dog. She says she discovered some were edible but she had concerns about one fungi species – inocybe. BarristerColinMandySC turns to question his client about mushrooms. Mandy shows Patterson photos she sent to her Facebook friends of mushrooms laid on a dehydrator shelf. Patterson remarks about one photo: “looks like they’re at the end of the cycle.” Asked if she developed an interest in wild mushrooms, she replies: “yes, I did.” Patterson says her interest in mushrooms began during Covid in early 2020 when she would go for walks in the Korumburra Botanic Gardens with her children and noticed them. Mandy asks Patterson why she has enjoyed eating mushrooms. They taste good and they’re very healthy. Asked about wild mushrooms, Patterson says they “just taste more interesting.” It’s more flavour. Patterson says she would purchase mushrooms at Woolworths and at markets. She says she would sometimes purchase dried mushrooms from Asian grocers while staying at her Mount Waverley home with her children. She says she would use store-bought dried mushrooms in curries, pasta dishes and soups. BarristerColinMandySC turns to askErinPattersonabout her body image issues.

BarristerColinMandySC shows the jury messages from 16 December 2022 betweenSimonandErinPatterson, while she was on a trip to New Zealand with their children. Erin says at this point the child support and school fees issue had been sorted. Erin says that when she returned from New Zealand, she had a good relationship with Simon and his father,DonPatterson. She recalls attending a Patterson family event with the kids upon their return which was “great”. Mandy shows the court messages between Erin and Simon on 18 December 2022 where she asks Simon to help because a tree had fallen across a fence at her property and one of her goats was in a neighbour’s yard. Mandy says the tone in the couple’s messages by 18 December 2022 is conciliatory. “It is, that’s true,” Patterson replies. BarristerColinMandySC takesErinPattersonto another message on 6 December 2022 to her Facebook friends when she wrote “at least I know they’re [Simon’s parents] a lost cause.” In another message Patterson wrote “I’m sick of this shit” and “so fuck em”. I did, I wrote that. Mandy asks why she sent the message. Patterson sighs and begins to sniff before she answers. I needed to vent. She says the alternative was to “go into the paddock and tell the sheep”. Asked if she meant the words she used, Patterson says “no” as she becomes visibly emotional. I regret the language I used. Patterson says she knew her Facebook friends would rally around her. I probably played up the emotion a bit to get that support. In another message on 5 December 2022, Erin messages a group chat on Signal with her estranged husbandSimonPatterson, as well as his parentsDonandGailPatterson. In one message, she says Don’s suggestion that Simon can change his tax return after he listed himself as single is “mind boggling”. BarristerColinMandySC then shows messages between Erin and her Facebook friends. In one on 6 December, Erin says her in-laws told her they could not adjudicate her conversations with Simon. “This family I swear to fucking god,” Erin wrote. Mandy asks Erin how she was feeling when she sent this message. I was really hurt and I was really frustrated and felt a little bit desperate. Erin says the group Facebook chat was created four years before she sent this message. She says the group discussed “absolutely everything” including what their children were doing, meals they were cooking and current affairs. It became a safe venting space for all of us. Mandy asks how Erin feels about the message now. I wish I’d never said it.. I feel ashamed for saying it and I wish the family didn’t have to hear that I said that. They didn’t deserve it. Erin Patterson says son struggled in ‘a lot of aspects of his life’ BarristerColinMandySC takes Erin to messages exchanged with her estranged husband Simon on 6 December 2022. In one message, Simon says he understands Erin has invited his parents to her house the prior day to discuss how their son is going and “finances for our kids”. Erin says she askedDonandGailPattersonfor a discussion because she was “struggling to achieve good communication with Simon about a few things”. I was wanting or hoping Don and Gail might help mediate that a little bit. Erin says her in-laws had previously meditated between the couple. She says her son was struggling in “a lot of aspects of his life”, including school. Erin also wanted to discuss the school fees for the children. She says prior to the child support disagreement in late 2022, Simon had been paying their school fees. After this, Simon wanted her to pay all of the school fees, Erin says. Erin says when Don and Gail visited on 5 December 2022 they offered to pay the children’s school fees if money was an issue. “Which wasn’t what I needed,” she says. She says they encouraged the couple to discuss the issue between them. They didn’t want to become official mediators. Erin Patterson recalls first conflict about money with estranged husband Simon BarristerColinMandySC then asks Patterson about messages between her and Simon in November 2022. In the messages, previously shown to the court, Patterson tells Simon she has applied for child support payments. The court previously heard that when Patterson sent Simon an anaesthetist fee for their son the same month, he said he had been advised by the government department overseeing child support payments not to provide money for things like that. “I understood what he was trying to communicate but I didn’t think what he was saying was right,” Patterson says. She recalls how she was feeling. I was hurt. We’d never had a conflict with money that I could remember before that. BarristerColin MandySC shows the court messages, previously tendered, on the app Signal between Erin and Simon from October 2022. In the messages, Simon asks Erin if she is attending his mother’s birthday. Erin replies that she was unaware of the birthday event. Erin tells the court she felt hurt: I was annoyed with myself because I had forgotten that it was a big birthday coming up for Gail ... I was hurt. In one message exchange on 14 October 2022, Erin says she is “sorry” for shouting at Simon that afternoon. Simon replies and apologises for raising his voice. He says he “wouldn’t call what either of us did shouting.” Asked by Mandy if the interaction was typical for the couple. Patterson replies: This is a really good example of how we normally solved it. What happened in this exchange was a typical kind of ... I might feel hurt about something ... Simon maybe doesn’t get feelings so well.. I would feel hurt ... we’d be annoyed at each other for a day or two and then we’d calm down and apologise. Erin Patterson says she and estranged husband Simon had financial disagreements BarristerColinMandySC asks Patterson about a child support dispute between her andSimon Pattersonin late 2022. Patterson says the topic of child support first came up in October 2022 as she was preparing her tax return. She says she learned Simon had listed himself as “single” on his tax return form. Patterson says she was frustrated she had not been told about it earlier when she could have applied for the family tax benefit as a single parent. From my perspective that was the only annoyance. Under questioning by Mandy, Patterson agrees the disagreement snowballed into other issues about finances. Erin Patterson also recalls a “traumatic” health issue where her daughter required a nasogastric tube and was screaming in hospital. She says her daughter still remembers this. ColinMandySC asks about photographs previously shown to the jury of search history extracted from a computer police seized from Patterson’s house. He says this shows Patterson was Googling symptoms she thought she had. “That’s correct,” Patterson says. Erin Patterson says she was told she was an ‘overly anxious mother’ Patterson says her family’s health history added to her concern about potentially having ovarian cancer. She touches on the health issues of her daughter with an ovarian mass. She says her daughter was diagnosed with an ovarian mass when she was eight months old. Right from when she was born, I thought there was something wrong. She cried a lot but not normal crying. She says doctors told her she was an “overly anxious mother who should relax”. Patterson’s voice cracks as she recalls feeling “something” when giving her daughter a massage. They still dismissed me. She says doctors said her daughter probably had a “very full bladder”. She says the experience “considerably damaged my faith in the health system”.",

    "title": "‘They didn’t deserve it’: emotional Erin Patterson tells murder trial of shame over messages about family",
    "article_text": "Erin Patterson has told a court she wishes she never told her Facebook friends in a private group chat “this family I swear to fucking god” in relation to her in-laws, saying she felt ashamed but hoped that sharing her frustrations would mean she had a “big cheer squad” for her problems. Patterson also told the jury in her triple murder trial thatshe was never diagnosed with ovarian cancerand had a history of “consulting Dr Google”, and hoped to bring her family back together despite a formal separation with her estranged husband, Simon, seven years earlier. In hersecond day in the witness box, Patterson was also asked about her relationship with Simon changing after a dispute about child support which arose the year before the alleged murders. Patterson, 50, faces three charges of murder and one charge of attempted murder relating to poisoning her four lunch guests – relatives of Simon – with a beef wellington served at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, and attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Simon’s uncle and Heather’s husband. Lawyers for Patterson say the death cap mushroom poisoning was a tragic and terrible accident. Under questioning from her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, on Tuesday, Patterson spoke about a time in late 2022 when she was in discussion with Simon and Don and Gail about two issues within the family: finances for their children, and the struggles of their son. Don and Gail were asked by Patterson to mediate between her and Simon, as they had done so before, she said. The court was shown a series of messages about these issues, including Don apologising for possibly misrepresenting Simon, and Patterson saying she appreciates it is uncomfortable. “Simon seems to be under the misapprehension that a child support assessment covers every expense for the children under the sun,” Patterson wrote in December 2022. Patterson was also asked about a “heated” exchange she and Simon had after she felt she had not been invited to a pub lunch for Gail’s 70th. Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson. Patterson serves beef wellington. All four lunch guests are admitted to hospital with gastro-like symptoms. Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson die in hospital. Don Patterson dies in hospital. Victoria police search Erin Patterson’s home and interview her. Ian Wilkinson is discharged from hospital after weeks in intensive care. Police again search Erin Patterson’s home, and she is arrested and interviewed. She is charged with three counts of murder relating to the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson. Jury is sworn in. Murder trial begins. Jury hears that charges of attempting to murder her estranged husband Simon are dropped. At the same time she was discussing these issues with Simon and his parents, Patterson was posting to her friends on a group chat. She said she sent the messages because “I was really hurt and really frustrated and felt a little bit desperate” in the Facebook chat, which “became a safe venting space for all of us”. Of a message previously read to the court, in which she said “this family, I swear to fucking god”, Patterson told the court: “I wish I’d never said it, I feel ashamed for saying it, and I wish that the family didn’t have to hear that I said that. “They didn’t deserve it.” Members of the Patterson and Wilkinson families, including Ian Wilkinson, were in court on Tuesday. Patterson, who was also asked about a separate message whenshe wrote she was “sick of this shit”, wanted nothing to do with the Pattersons, and wrote “fuck em”, said that she shared her frustrations as “I knew that the women would probably support me being annoyed about those things, and so I said that to them, knowing that they would latch on, and then it [becomes] a big cheer squad for your problem, if that makes sense”. In the early afternoon, Mandy said: “I’m going to ask you some questions now about mushrooms.” Patterson said she started to become interested in wild mushrooms in early 2020, as she noticed them while walking during Covid lockdowns around Korumburra. “Had you always liked eating mushrooms,” Mandy asked. “Yeah I had,” she responded. “They taste good, and they’re very healthy.” She said at one point she found mushrooms growing on the three-acre property where she was living at the time, and decided to test if it was safe to eat. “I fried it up with some butter, ate it, saw what happened … [it] tasted good,” she said. Patterson said she then started using these mushrooms in other dishes, including some fed to her children. Patterson also spoke about receiving inheritances from her grandmother and mother, which allowed her to loan about $1.2m to Simon’s siblings and their partners, and for her to buy several properties and travel extensively overseas. The court heard Patterson had opened a second-hand bookshop in the Western Australian town of Pemberton before she moved back toVictoriawith Simon and their son while she was pregnant with the couple’s daughter. The reason for the move, she said, was to be closer to Don and Gail after the birth, and because their son loved spending time with his “nanna and papa” and cousins. Another series of separations between her and Simon continued, until a “formal” separation in late 2015. Patterson said that despite this she included his name on the title of the Leongatha property which she moved into in 2022, as she wanted to show him something “tangible” about her desire for the family to reunite. “That was what I wanted. I did that because I wanted some way to demonstrate with Simon that’s what I really believed and wanted,” she said. Patterson appeared to become emotional when she was asked how her relationship with Don and Gail changed after this “formal” separation. “It never changed,” she said. “I was just their daughter in law, and they just continued to love me.” Patterson also told the court about a history of health issues she and her children had which eroded her faith in the medical system. She never had ovarian cancer, nor a needle biopsy, she said. The court has previously heard about text messages she exchanged with Gail about the biopsy, and it is the prosecution case that Patterson used a cancer diagnosis as a “false pretence” for the lunch. Patterson said both sides of her family had a history of ovarian cancer, and she feared she also had it. “I’d been having, for a few months by then, a multitude of symptoms,” Patterson said. “I felt very fatigued. I had ongoing abdominal pain. I had chronic headaches. I put on a lot of weight, in quite a short period of time, and like my feet and my hands seemed to retain a lot of fluid.” She said what “sent me over the edge” to go to a GP was that her wedding rings wouldn’t fit any more, and that when she then went to pick them up from the jeweller, after having them resized, they again didn’t fit. At this time, and at another occasion when she feared she had a brain tumour, she “consulted Dr Google”. She came to realise, she said, that doing this wasted her time, and the time of medical professionals, but she had come to distrust the medical system because of how it had handled issues with her children. Patterson was also asked about a history of issues with food, which she said started when her mother forced her to be weighed every week as a child to ensure she had not put on weight. In her 20s, she said she started binge eating, with its intensity sometimes meaning it occurred every day. She ate everything she could get her hands on, and then vomited it up again, she said. Patterson’s evidence continues.",

    "title": "RBA ready to use rapid-fire rate cuts if Trump policies rattle Australia’s economy, minutes reveal",
    "article_text": "TheReserve Bank of Australiais prepared to “respond decisively” to any deterioration in the global economy, paving the way for rapid-fire cash rate cuts if Donald Trump’s tariffs spark further market upheaval. The 20 May RBA meeting minutes, released on Tuesday, show the rate-setting board discussed implementing a bumper 50 basis point cut last month. But they decided such a move was not yet warranted because there were no immediate signs the economy had been significantly affected by the US trade policy. The RBA decided on aquarter point cutinstead, amid falling inflation and weak household consumption. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “A 25 basis point reduction would ensure that monetary policy settings remained predictable at a time of heightened uncertainty, given market expectations,” the minutes said. “And it would leave the board well-placed to respond as needed as the economy evolved.” The RBA noted it would “respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation” in Australia. In that scenario, the RBA would cut rates faster than currently forecast to support the Australian economy. The May minutes will inflate the hopes of mortgage holders of another near-term reprieve in lending rates. This marks a stark change in tone from RBA meetings earlier this year when the central bankwarned againstexpectations of further cuts. While more rate cuts will be welcomed by indebted mortgage holders, a reduction in borrowing rates threatens to fuel another surge in house prices, making propertyeven more unaffordablefor prospective buyers. The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, acknowledged last month that falling borrowing rates could drive property prices higher, but said the onus was on federal and state governments to resolve housing shortages. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Economists viewed the May rate cut as a shift back towards a neutral rate setting that neither ignites nor constrains the economy after a prolonged period of elevated borrowing costs. After the May meeting, Australia recorded a slightly hotter-than-expectedunderlying inflation reading. While this could temper calls for a rate cut at the next meeting in early July, the market is pricing in a near 80% chance of a 25 basis point cut to 3.6%. The falling cost of home loans has already driven house prices up across every capital city, according to Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac.“The RBA’s latest rate cut [is] adding clear impetus,” Hassan said. “Prices are now up 1.7% since the RBA began easing interest rates in February.”Nearly 3,000 homes went to auction in the last week of May, the second highest figure for 2025, according to property analytics firm Cotality. Surging momentum pushed the auction clearance rate to 65.1% the week before that, the highest since July 2024.Further rate cuts will see buyers force up national home prices at a faster rate than wages over 2025, analysts expect, despite persistent cost-of-living pressures on borrowers.Minimum wages were raised 3.5% on Tuesdayand the Reserve Bank expects national wage growth will sit at just 3.3% by the end of 2025.",

    "title": "Millions of Australian workers to get an above-inflation pay rise as minimum wage lifts by 3.5%",
    "article_text": "The Fair Work Commission says a 3.5% above-inflation increase to the minimum wage was necessary to avoid “entrenched” lower living standards among the millions of Australia’s lowest-paid workers. The president of the FWC, Justice Adam Hatcher, said the decision would help claw back the loss of real incomes over the past few years, even as employer groups warned many smaller businesses would struggle the afford the “generous” pay rise. The new minimum wage from July will be $24.95 an hour, or $948 per week, up from $24.10 and $915.90, respectively – a weekly increase of about $32. Anthony Albanese noted the decision was about 1 percentage point higher than the current rate of inflation, saying the result “will be welcomed by people who keep our economy going, the essential workers who need this wage increase in real terms”. Nearly 3 million employees, or one in five, have their pay set by an award and will be directly affected by the annual minimum wage determination. Affected workers are concentrated in labour-intensive and female-dominated industries such as hospitality, health and social assistance, and administrative services. The number of Australians paid the minimum wage, however, is a fraction of that - below 100,000 people, according to government estimates. The annual determination delivered on Tuesday morning was quickly welcomed by the peak unions body, but was criticised by business groups who had argued for an increase of 2-2.5%. The Reserve Bank recently projected inflation will climb from 2.4% in the year to March, to 3.1% by mid-2026 following the end of government cost of living measures, such as energy subsidies. Hatcher said the “inflation spike” had particularly hurt lower-paid workers, and that fears of further fueling inflation had informed minimum wage decisions in recent years. But with inflation back under control, Hatcher said it was time to make up for that hit to living standards, adding that “we are satisfied that the level of wage increase we have determined is sustainable”. “The principal consideration which has guided our decision is the fact that since July 2021, employees who are reliant upon modern award minimum wages, or the national minimum wage, have suffered a reduction in the real value of their wage rates,” he said when handing down the decision. “This provides us with an opportunity to go at least some of the way towards correcting what has happened over the last four years by awarding a real increase to modern award wages and the national minimum wage.” “We are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this annual wage review, a loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system and the national minimum wage, and a reduction of living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched.” The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, has said the bank anticipates inflation will settle at around the middle of the 2-3% target range over the coming two years. ACTU secretary Sally McManus credited union pressure and the Albanese government’s advocacy for the real minimum wage rise. “This wage increase means those who are paid award wages will start to get ahead again, easing pressure on their weekly budgets and part of the stress that comes from having to cut back on the basics,” McManus said in a statement. The government had argued in favour of a decision that did not send workers’ wages backwards, and the final result falls between the competing demands from the peak union body and business groups. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, said “we think this increase is a generous increase for employees” and that “this decision is being delivered against a backdrop of declining productivity”. Business groups such as ACCI had made the case for an increase of around 2.5% or lower, arguing that firms were struggling with sharp increases in operating costs. Economists said the minimum pay rise would not prevent the RBA from delivering further rate cuts this year, although RBC Capital chief economist Su-Lin Ong said the increase “errs a little high from an economic and sustainability lens”. The FWC, in its ruling, said Australia’s ongoing poor productivity performance had “restrained” the size of minimum pay rises. “Certainly, the productivity problem will not be resolved by the indefinite continuation of the reduction in real wages which has occurred over the last four years,” it said.",

    "title": "UK cancer survival rate doubles since 1970s amid ‘golden age’, report says",
    "article_text": "The proportion of people surviving cancer in the UK has doubled since the 1970s amid a “golden age” of progress in diagnosis and treatment, a report says. Half of those diagnosed will now survive for 10 years or more, up from 24%, according to the first study of 50 years of data on cancer mortality and cases. The rate of people dying from cancer has fallen by 23% since the 1970s, from 328 in every 100,000 people to 252. But cancer remains the UK’s biggest killer, the report byCancerResearch UK (CRUK) says. Progress has not been equal across all cancers, and women have not reaped as many benefits as men. There have been greater improvements in survival for men since the 1970s but survival remains higher in women. Sustained pressure in the NHS means patients wait too long to get diagnosed andstart treatment. In England, only about half of cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, and this proportion has not improved for almost a decade, the 42-page study found. The research will be published on Tuesday, the final day of the world’s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The CRUK chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said: “Over the last 50 years, the proportion of the population dying from cancer has fallen by more than a fifth because of life-saving research into new ways to prevent people developing the disease, detect it earlier when they do and develop new cutting-edge treatments. “Yet cancer remains the UK’s biggest killer, causing around one in four deaths in the UK – far more than other disease groups. For people affected by cancer, this means lost time and fewer precious moments with loved ones. “As this report sets out, it is a time of both optimism and realism. We’re in a golden age for cancer research, with advances in digital, genomics, data science and AI reimagining what’s possible and bringing promise for current and future generations. “However, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment, and cancer survival is improving at its slowest rate in the last 50 years. This is not acceptable.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Cancer cases would increase, not decline, if trends continued, Mitchell said. “Nearly one in two people in the UK will get cancer in their lifetime and our projections suggest that the number of new cancer cases in the UK will rise by almost a third to over half a million every year by 2040.” The report highlights that more than 460 people die from cancer every day in the UK. “If we want to change that, we need bold action from the UK government,” Mitchell said. A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “It’s promising to see a significant drop in cancer mortality rates, but we know there is still more work to be done. Our Plan for Change is already making an impact, with 90,000 extra patients having cancer diagnosed or ruled out since July than in the previous year – and the highest ever proportion of patients getting a diagnosis or an all-clear within four weeks in February.”",

    "title": "‘I was let out’: New Orleans man who escaped jail pleads case on social media",
    "article_text": "A man still at large after escaping from a New Orleans jail last month appears to have taken to social mediato plead his caseto the public. In a video that quickly went viral, the man identifying himself as Antoine Massey – one of 10 prisoners who fled from the Orleans Justice center (OJC) on 16 May – said he was wrongfully accused and held up papers he said corroborate his innocence. “They say that I broke out,” he said, speaking directly to the camera. “I didn’t break out. I was let out.” Authorities have been searching theNew Orleansarea for more than two weeks since the men squeezed through a hole behind a toilet in the jail. Graffiti left on the wall included the message “To Easy LoL” with an arrow pointing to the gap. Eight of the 10 have been apprehended, along with more than a dozen people – many of them friends and family – arrested on allegations of helping the group with food, cash, transportation or shelter, according to court documents. Along with Massey, Derrick Groves has not yet been found. Officials have not yet verified that the person in the footage was Massey. But the man in the video, clad in a sweatsuit and sitting on a stool in a minimally furnished kitchen, has the facial tattoos that match Massey’s. He called for an investigation into his conviction and asked for help from public figures, including Donald Trump and Meek Mill. Holding up a wrinkled paper to the camera, he claimed he had a signed affidavit from a woman he is accused of assaulting saying the allegations are false. “If you was an innocent person,” he said, “why would you stay in jail?” Massey was being held on the theft of a vehicle and for a domestic abuse charge involving strangulation when he escaped. He has a history of both domestic violence charges and escaping from incarceration. At the age of 15 he broke out of a juvenile detention center with five others using metal shackles to break a window and was on the run for weeks, CNNreported. Massey slipped under a fence in the exercise yard of a detention center at age 27. Court records show there was a third attempt, along with several cases alleging he “tampered and/or removed the court-ordered GPS monitor”. Now 32, Massey appears to be claiming this attempt to get out is justified. Meanwhile, the FBI, US Marshals Service, state and local police, and the Orleans parish sheriff’s office have continued the search. As of Monday, the reward was set for $50,000 if information leads to the arrest of Groves or Massey. In a statement, the Orleans parish sheriff’s office said they were aware of the video and encouraged Massey to turn himself in. “If the individual depicted in the video is indeed Antoine Massey, we strongly urge him to come forward and turn himself in to the proper authorities,” the statement said. “Cooperating with law enforcement is in his best interest and may help avoid additional charges. It is important that justice is served appropriately and that due process is followed.” The Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "article_text": "This blog is now closed. Read our latest storyhere New York’s lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, announced on Monday that he is running for governor, setting up a Democratic primary battle against the sitting governor, Kathy Hochul, who selected him for the job as her deputy. In a campaign video posted on YouTube, Delgado introduced himself to voters as “a hip-hop artist, a congressman, a man of faith” with working-class roots in upstate New York and his desire to provide “transformational leadership”. “Listen, the powerful and well-connected have their champions,” Delgado says in the video. “I’m running for governor to be yours.”Delgado gave up a House seat in the Hudson valley to become lieutenant governor to Hochul, a post Hochul herself held until Andrew Cuomo was forced to resign as governor and she inherited the top job in 2021. Hochul narrowly won a full term in 2022 in a race against Republican Lee Zeldin, a former Congressman who is now head of the environmental protection agency. Delgado has refused to rule out a primary challenge against Hochul for months and earlier this year said he would he would not run for reelection alongside her. He broke publicly with the governor on two fights within the Democratic party over the past year. In 2024, when Hochul was a campaign surrogate for Joe Biden, Delgado called on the then president to drop out of the presidential race. Earlier this year, Delgado called for New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, to resign when it became apparent that he had cut a deal with theTrump administrationto have his indictment on federal corruption charges dropped. Hochul, who had the power as governor to depose Adams, chose not to do so. This concludes our live coverage of the day in US politics. We will return on Tuesday to continue chronicling the secondTrump administration, but here are some of Monday’s main developments: Federal and state authorities filed murder and hate crimes charges againstMohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspected attacker in Boulder, Colorado who hurled Molotov cocktails at a demonstration for Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, injuring 12 people. The head of Ice defended his agency’s decision toarrest an 18-year-old Massachusetts high school studenton his way to volleyball practice. US district judgeRichard Stearnslaterordereda 72-hour stay to “provide a fair opportunity for the judge who will be randomly assigned to this case” to review merits and rule on any contested issues in the case ofMarcelo Gomes Da Silva. Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) barred its 2025 class president from attending her graduation ceremony on Friday after she delivered a speech during a commencement event the day before condemning Israel’s war in Gaza and criticizing the university’s ties to Israel. China accused the US of“seriously violating”and undermining the agreements reached in Geneva in May. Prosecutors in Milwaukee charged a man on Monday withfour feloniesfor attempting to frame an undocumented immigrant he is accused of assaulting, by sending forged letters in the immigrant’s name with a threat to kill Donald Trump. New York’s lieutenant governor,Antonio Delgado, announced on Monday that he is running for governor, setting up a Democratic primary battle against the sitting governor,Kathy Hochul, who selected him for the job as her deputy. SenatorChuck Schumer, the Senate’s senior Democrat, released a social media video on Monday in which he seemed to taunt Donald Trump for supposedly being too “chicken” in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. SenatorChuck Schumer, the Senate’s senior Democrat, released a social media video on Monday in which he seemed to tauntDonald Trumpfor supposedly being too weak in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Schumer, a staunch ally of Israeli leaders who oppose any deal to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for that nation’s commitment that it will not build nuclear weapons, seemed to be responding toan Israeli journalist’s reportthat Trump’s negotiators, Steve Witkoff and March Rubio, might be open to letting Iran enrich uranium for civilian purposes. In the video, Schumer referred to rumors that the US might agree, in “a secret side deal”, to let Iran proceed with low-grade enrichment, similar to the level agreed on in the Iran nuclear deal struck during the Obama administration, which Trump pulled out of during his first term. Invoking the phrase “Trump always chickens out”, or Taco, Schumer said, “If Taco Trump is already folding, the American public should know about it Although the international Iran nuclear deal struck by the Obama administration in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, was regarded as a huge success for diplomacy by manyDemocrats, it was strongly opposed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and by some pro-Israel Democrats, including Schumer. In 2015, Schumervoted against the deal. A Boston high school student who was detained by immigration agents on Saturday while he was on his way to volleyball practice must be kept in Massachusetts for at least 72 hours, a federal judge said on Monday. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, 18, entered the United States on a student visa, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf after his arrest. While his student visa status has lapsed, he is eligible for and intends to apply for asylum.

Prosecutors in Milwaukee charged a man on Monday withfour feloniesfor attempting to frame an undocumented immigrant he is accused of assaulting, by sending forged letters in the immigrant’s name with a threat to kill Donald Trump. The handwritten, forged letters were mailed to Wisconsin’s attorney general, Milwaukee police and US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (Ice). WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate in Milwaukee,reportsthat a criminal complaint alleges that Demetric Scott admitted to investigators that he wrote the letters threatening to kill the president in the name of Ramon Morales-Reyes, whom he was previopusly charged with assaulting. Among those who fell for the hoax were Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, who releaseda statementpraising immigration officers for arresting Morales-Reyes on 22 May, one day after the forged letter was received by an Ice field intelligence officer. “Thanks to our ICE officers, this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump is behind bars”, Noem said in a press release. Her department also released an image of the handwritten note to news agencies. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans – we have done more for this country than you white people – you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him”, the letter said. “I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in the head – I will see him at one of his big ralleys”. Last week, one of Morales-Reyes’ childrentold an immigrant rights groupthat he could not have written the letters since he cannot read or write in Spanish, let alone English. Scott is currently in Milwaukee County Jail, charged with armed robbery and aggravated battery. Prosecutors said Morales-Reyes is the victim in that case. According toa transcript of a phone callprosecutors say Scott made while awaiting trial for assaulting Morales-Reyes, Scott framed Ramon Morales-Reyes to keep him from testifying against him. “If he gets picked up by Ice”, Scott allegedly said in the call, “there won’t be a jury trial, so they will probably dismiss it that day. That’s my plan”. Morales-Reyes remains in Ice detention at a facility in Juneau, Wisconsin. After the 2023 assault, Morales-Reyes applied for a U-visa – a special visa provided to undocumented victims of crime that may lead to a pathway to legal residency. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Monday, blocking the Department of Homeland Security from canceling a union contract covering transportation security officers. In her ruling, US District Judge Marsha Pechman in Seattlewrotethat the Trump administration of President Donald Trump likely broke the law by stripping 50,000 TSA officers of the ability to unionize and bargain over their working conditions in a suit brought by the American Federation of Government Employees and other unions. Pechman said that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, had failed to explain why she was reversing the Obama administration’s finding that unionizing would benefit TSA officers, who staff checkpoints at US airports and other transportation hubs, and in turn the public they serve. “The Noem Determination appears to have been undertaken to punish AFGE and its members because AFGE has chosen to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks to federal employment in the courts,” Pechman wrote. AFGE represents about 800,000 federal government employees. Reuters reports that staff of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were left baffled on Monday after the head of the US disaster response agency said during a briefing that he had not been aware the country has a hurricane season, according to four sources familiar with the situation. The US hurricane season officially began on Sunday and lasts through November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast last week that this year’s season is expected to bring as many as 10 hurricanes. The remark was made byDavid Richardson, who has led Fema since early May. It was not clear to staff whether he meant it literally, as a joke, or in some other context. Richardson, a former marine, was suddenly put in charge of Fema four weeks ago, after his predecessor,Cameron Hamilton,told a congressional committeethat he did not “believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency”. Hamilton was removed the next day. According to the Fema website, Richardson took over in the middle of the agency’s “Hurricane Preparedness Week”. Boulder police chiefStephen Redfearnsaid that the suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman “was not on our radar in Boulder” as a potential threat. Mark Michalekof the FBI said that the suspect was not known to his office either. Boulder police chief,Stephen Redfearn, said that there is as yet no video of the suspect approaching the demonstration but officials are piecing together a timeline using video of the attack aftermath and license plate readers. He also appealed to anyone who might have more video to bring it to the police. The Boulder police chief,Stephen Redfearn, said that his force has good relations with the city’s Jewish community and he and other law enforcement officials plan to meet Jewish community leaders shortly. The Boulder police chief,Stephen Redfearn, told the public at the news conference still in progress that the site of the attack on Pearl Street is now safe, after it was scoured by bomb-sniffing dogs last night. The FBI Special agent in chargeMark Michaleksaid at the ongoing news conference in Boulder that the bureau has already interviewed 44 witnesses and is asking the public to come forward with any additional witness accounts or visual evidence. The Boulder County district attorney,Michael Dougherty, just said that there were 16 unused Molotov cocktails recovered by officers in the aftermath of the attack. Dougherty explained that his office will be prosecuting the suspect for 16 counts of attempted murder and other charges in parallel to the federal hate crimes prosecution. If convicted, Soliman would be jailed for the rest of his life, with a cumulative of over 600 years. He also said that there were 12 victims in total. A news conference on the Boulder attack just started with a statement from acting US Attorney for the District ofColorado, J. Bishop Grewell. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged with a federal hate crime, Grewell said. He added that Soliman claimed to have been planning the attack for a year on what he called a “Zionist group” demonstrating in support of Israelis held hostage in Gaza. Grewell also said that Soliman told investigators that he had resorted to Molotov cocktails when he had been unable to buy a gun.",

US district judge Richard Stearnsorderedthe 72-hour stay on Monday to “provide a fair opportunity for the judge who will be randomly assigned to this case” to review merits and rule on any contested issues. Nonetheless, the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Monday defended his agency’s actions, saying the teen in question was “in this country illegally and we’re not going to walk away from anybody”. Gomes’s attorney asked for his immediate release. Attorney Miriam Conrad, in afilingon Sunday, said that Gomes “has no criminal history anywhere in the world” in asking for his release. Gomes was arrested on Saturday in Milford, Massachusetts, where he lives. Ice’s acting director, Todd Lyons, and Patricia Hyde – who directs the agency’s enforcement and removal operations in Boston – acknowledged Gomes was not the target of theimmigrationinvestigation that led to his arrest and that authorities instead were seeking his father, who remains at large. But the Milford high school student had been driving his father’s vehicle when he was arrested following a traffic stop, Lyons said. Lyons said that when authorities encounter someone in the country illegally, “we will take action on that”. “We’re doing the job that Ice should have been doing all along,” he said. “We enforce all immigration laws.” The state’s Democratic governor, Maura Healey, said she was “disturbed and outraged” by Gomes’s arrest. And hundreds rallied in Milford on Sundayto protestagainst Gomes’s detention. A federal judge issued an emergency order on Sunday preventing authorities from transferring Gomes out of Massachusetts for at least 72 hours in response to his lawsuit arguing that he was unlawfully detained.

    "title": "US man charged for framing immigrant in fake plot to kill Trump",
    "article_text": "Prosecutors in Milwaukee have charged a man withfour feloniesfor attempting to frame an undocumented immigrant he is accused of assaulting, by sending forged letters in the immigrant’s name with a threat to kill Donald Trump. The handwritten, forged letters were mailed to Wisconsin’s attorney general,Milwaukeepolice and US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (Ice). The story received a flood of media attention and was highlighted by the White House and Trump’s allies, but appears to have been a hoax. WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate in Milwaukee,reported on Mondaythat a criminal complaint alleges Demetric Scott admitted to investigators he wrote the letters threatening to kill the president in the name of Ramon Morales-Reyes, whom he was previously charged with assaulting. Among those who fell for the hoax were Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, who releaseda statementpraising immigration officers for arresting Morales-Reyes on 22 May, one day after the forged letter was received by an Ice field intelligence officer. “Thanks to our ICE officers, this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump is behind bars,” Noem said in a press release. Her department also released to news agencies an image of the handwritten note in light blue ink, expressing anger over Trump’s deportations and threatening to shoot him in the head with a rifle at a rally. Noem also shared the letter on X along with a photo of Morales-Reyes, and the White House also shared it on its social media accounts. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans – we have done more for this country than you white people – you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him,” the letter said. “I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in the head – I will see him at one of his big ralleys.” But the claimsoon beganto unravel. Last week, one of Morales-Reyes’ childrentold an immigrant rights groupthat he could not have written the letters since he cannot read or write in Spanish, let alone English. As part of the investigation, officials asked Morales-Reyes for a handwriting sample and concluded his handwriting and the threatening letter didn’t match and that the threat was not credible, a source familiar with the investigation told the Associated Press. Scott is currently in Milwaukee county jail, charged with armed robbery and aggravated battery. Prosecutors said Morales-Reyes is the victim in that case; he was allegedly assaulted in September 2023 with a box cutter during an attempted theft of his bike. As the case prepared to go to trial, Ice this month received the letter threatening to assassinate Trump. According toa transcript of a phone callprosecutors say Scott made while awaiting trial for assaulting Morales-Reyes, Scott framed Morales-Reyes to keep him from testifying against him. “If he gets picked up by Ice,” Scott allegedly said in the call, “there won’t be a jury trial, so they will probably dismiss it that day. That’s my plan.” Morales-Reyes works as a dishwasher in Milwaukee, where he lives with his wife and three children. He had recently applied for a U visa, which is carved out for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes, according to his attorney. Morales-Reyes remains in Ice detention at a facility in Juneau, Wisconsin. José Olivares and Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "Suspect charged with federal hate crime in attack on Colorado rally for Israeli hostages",
    "article_text": "A man has been charged with a federal hate crime andmultiple other feloniesafter he allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices toattack a crowd of peoplewho were raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring 12 victims. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowdon Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported. At a press conference on Monday the Boulder county district attorney said Soliman would be prosecuted for a federal hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder. If convicted, he would be jailed for the rest of his life, with a cumulative of more than 600 years. At the press conference, US attorney for the district ofColoradosaid in a statement that Soliman had resorted to molotov cocktails when he wasn’t able to obtain a gun. There were at least 16 unused molotov cocktails recovered from the scene, according to the US attorney’s office, district of Colorado. An FBI affidavit said Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday’s attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again. Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White HouseclaimedSoliman was in the US without legal status. Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”. Four additional victims had minor injuries but were not hospitalized. The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel. Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire. Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said. She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting. “Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,’” Coffman said. Alex Osante, from San Diego,told the Associated Presshe was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming. In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack. After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed. The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor. “She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,”said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, wascriticized in Marchafter he shared a post by a white supremacist. Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect. “It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses. Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”. Soliman is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries. On his Truth Social platform Monday, Donald Trumpsaidthe attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The US president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”. Ina post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden’s presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit. CNN, citing law enforcement officials,reportedthat Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency. Soliman had previouslyapplied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005. Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”. In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman’s presence in the US to “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security,said Solimanwas “illegally in our country”. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said. The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes. It followsthe fatal shootingof two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel. Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Donald Trump’s administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel’s war on Gaza have taken place. Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.",

    "title": "‘Forgotten by the world’: Disability deepens sisters’ struggle in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Shati refugee camp, Gaza –Inside a stifling tent in Shati, one of Gaza’s overcrowded displacement camps, 30-year-old Raneem Abu Al-Eish cares for her sisters, Aseel, 51, and Afaf, 33. They sit close to Raneem, laughing at times and at others growing agitated when the cries of children playing outside get too loud. Aseel and Afaf suffer from celiac disease and intellectual disabilities that impair their speech, understanding, and behaviour – conditions that have only deepened under the strain of war and displacement. They struggle to express themselves, often overwhelmed by their environment, Raneem explains. While she doesn’t know the medical term for their condition, the symptoms at times mirror Tourette syndrome. The cramped tent shelters seven family members: Raneem, her two sisters, their elderly parents, and another sister with her husband. Raneem’s mother is frail, and her father is still recovering from an injury sustained in Israel’s relentless war on Gaza, leaving Raneem to shoulder their care alone. The family used to live in Jabalia camp’s Block 2, until Israel destroyed their home eight months ago. Since then, they have moved from relatives’ homes to makeshift shelters, then to an overcrowded United Nations school. Now they are in this tent, which traps sweltering heat by midday and lets the bitter cold seep through its thin walls in the night. Privacy and dignity are nearly impossible in the crowded tent. “When they need to change, we try to get the others to step out,” Raneem says. “But it’s not always possible.” Yet that is only part of the ordeal for Aseel and Afaf, who are bullied daily due to their conditions. “People don’t understand what my sisters go through,” Raneem says softly. “They judge by appearances, assuming they’re fine. But they aren’t. They need care, patience, dignity.” Life in the camp overwhelms Aseel. “She finds it hard to cope with noise or sudden changes,” Raneem explains. “When that happens, she gets distressed – she shouts, cries, sometimes lashes out.” Afaf, meanwhile, struggles with involuntary movements and impulsive behaviours. “A small argument or loud voice can trigger her,” Raneem adds. “She doesn’t know how to control it,” she says, which makes it all the more sad that Afaf is frequently targeted for mockery, especially by children. Using communal bathrooms brings repeated humiliation. “Every bathroom visit becomes a spectacle. People laugh, make cruel remarks, and it devastates them,” Raneem says. The family’s greatest blow came six months ago, when Mohammad, Raneem’s 22-year-old brother, was taken by Israel. Mohammad had gone to Kamal Adwan Hospital for surgery after a hand injury. While he was there, Israel raided the hospital on October 25 and seized Mohammad. Since then, the family knows nothing about his whereabouts. Mohammad was the sibling most adept at navigating the outside world. “He got their medicines, managed hospital visits, dealt with aid agencies,” Raneem explains. “Without him, we’re completely alone.” Since his detention, the sisters face worsening food shortages and a lack of medical care. “He was their protector,” Raneem says, her voice breaking. “Now we have no one.” Between March and May, intensified bombing again displaced 436,000 Palestinians, many for the second, third or fourth time since the October 2023 beginning of the war. For families like Raneem’s – already in tents or shelters – each new wave of violence means starting over again, often without food or medicine. For Aseel and Afaf, even basic nutrition is rife with threats. Celiac sufferers cannot eat gluten, which damages their small intestines. In a starving Gaza where there is little to eat other than wheat-flour bread, which contains gluten, there is little chance that Raneem can find vegetables or meat for the sisters, especially with Mohammad detained. Without gluten-free flour, Aseel and Afaf risk severe malnutrition, and they have gotten a dismally small amount of the 80 tonnes of gluten-free flour that aid agencies have thus far delivered to Gaza. Much of it was blocked by closed borders, damaged roads, and broken distribution systems. “The little that reaches us is too expensive or too late,” Raneem says. Before the war, Aseel and Afaf had routine medical care at Kamal Adwan Hospital. Their conditions required special diets, medication, and regular therapy, needs now nearly impossible to meet. Psychological specialist Dr Sara al-Wahidi says the war has sharply worsened the marginalisation of people with disabilities in Gaza. “We’ve seen people with disabilities become separated from [their families in] displacement areas – some missing for long periods, sadly later found deceased,” she explains. A 2025 report estimates that at least 15 percent of Gaza’s displaced population lives with a disability, and they have to navigate the makeshift shelters, whether in encampments, schools, or hospitals, that lack functioning ramps, adapted toilets and basic accessibility. Raneem also battles social stigma, and despite her efforts – talking with neighbours, seeking support from community elders – ignorance persists. “People provoke them, mock them. All we ask is understanding,” she says. Some elders occasionally invite the sisters to their tents for a visit, brief moments of respite in a daily reality where they have no consistent medical or social support. “We’ve been displaced again and again, from Jabalia to the west, then Gaza City,” Raneem recounts. “Every new place, we have to start over, explaining their condition, begging for patience. “These aren’t just war victims,” she pleads. “They’re vulnerable people forgotten by the world.”",

    "title": "No ‘Pikachu’: Why is Japan at war against unconventional, ‘glittery’ names?",
    "article_text": "Japan has introduced new rules restricting how names are spelled and pronounced. The new regulations, announced last week, aim to quell a growing practice of Japanese parents giving their babies unconventional names, known as “kira kira”, or glittery, in kanji, one of Japan’s major writing systems. But why are such names a problem for Japanese authorities? And do the new rules spell disaster for parents who want to break the mould and name their children Nike, the shoe brand, or Pikachu, the little lagomorphic animated character with lightning powers, which is part of the Japanese media franchise Pokemon? A kira kira name is a non-traditional name where the pronunciation is unusual or does not match the standard or phonetic pronunciation in kanji. Japan primarily uses three systems of writing: hiragana, katakana and kanji. Kanji employs Chinese characters and is used in writing names. Parents in Japan can choose from among 2,999 kanji characters to name their child – out of these, 2,136 characters are commonly used. Hiragana and katakana can also be used. Kira kira names, while relatively uncommon, started to grow in popularity in Japan in the 1980s, influenced by pop culture, brands and popular games like Pokemon or characters from the world of Tokyo-based animation houseStudioGhibli. Parents pick what they want to call their child – say, Pikachu or the fictional character Hello Kitty. Then, they try to piece together kanji characters that sound like the name they picked. But often, the kanji pronunciation is nowhere near what the name is supposed to sound like. The names are spelled a certain way, but are meant to be pronounced very differently, making it difficult even for Japanese speakers to read the name correctly, causing confusion at places like hospitals and schools. Take a name written like “今鹿” in kanji characters. Those letters suggest a pronunciation like “imashika”, typically a family name, said John Maher, a linguist at Temple University’s Japan campus who specialises in the sociolinguistics and languages of the country. However, what the parents might have intended is the given name “Naushika,” inspired by the titular character ofHayao Miyazaki’s1984 animated Studio Ghibli film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. “A primary school teacher taking roll stares at the kanji of the little girl in the front row and scratches her head. ‘Huh? Naushika?! Are you kidding me?’ It’s the name of a Ghibli studio anime film,” Maher told Al Jazeera. He cited another example — “七音,” which is pronounced as “nanane,” typically a given name. However, it is supposed to be pronounced like “doremi” – either a nod to the early 2000s anime, Ojamajo Doremi, or to a character in the manga series Doraemon. “It’s causing a public fuss for one basic reason: frustration in everyday life. Schoolteachers cannot figure out how to pronounce their pupils’ names. Bosses cannot figure out their worker names,” said Maher. The “glittery” names appear to represent an effort to subvert tradition. A study using data from Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance from 1913 to 2015 revealed that variations in naming patterns were growing over the course of the century. Still, “until the government’s National Institute for the Japanese Language conducts an objective study, we don’t have the numbers”, Maher said. The National Institute for the Japanese Language (NINJAL) is a Tokyo-based independent research institute for the Japanese language, established in 1948 with the purpose of researching the Japanese language and making recommendations about its correct usage. Linguist and author Adam Aleksic said he believed the trend represented a pushback against tradition. “There used to be traditional names and these names are a reaction against those cultural heirlooms,” Aleksic told Al Jazeera. But he added that this phenomenon was not restricted to Japan. “There are pop culture names everywhere,” Aleksic said, citing the example of how many parents around the world named their children Katniss after the popularity of the dystopian book series, the Hunger Games, and the resulting films. In Japan, he said, the rise in kira kira names might represent a cultural trend towards individuality, “probably because of Western influence, whereas historically, it [Japan] was more of a collectivist culture”. The recent law was an amendment to a family registry law originally passed on June 2, 2023, Jay Allen, a Tokyo-based journalist for a publication called Unseen Japan, told Al Jazeera. The revised law, which came into effect on May 26, requires families to register furigana readings of names on the family register. A furigana reading is a smaller script comprising syllabaries in hiragana and katakana to indicate the phonetic reading of kanji names. Previously, the furigana was not notarised on the family register. Allen explained that the change would allow authorities to check for any mismatches between spelling and pronunciation. Now, Japanese authorities will mail notifications to households to confirm the phonetic readings of the names of the members. This will be done not only for newborns, but for every household member with existing registered names. While older people with kira kira names will not have to change names, experts said, this exercise would help the government know exactly how all names are supposed to be pronounced. Those who want to correct the phonetic readings of their names will need to submit corrections within a year of receiving the notification. Parents of newborns may have to explain the pronunciation of their children, and local media have reported that they may be referred to legal bureaus. The government has not directly banned kira kira names, but the new law seeks to restrict parents from using unorthodox pronunciations of kanji characters. “If they’re using kanji, which most Japanese parents do, then they have to show that the pronunciations they chose somehow relate to common pronunciations for those kanji.” Allen explained that the new law rejects names that have no relationship to the kanji spelling; and names that are easy to mispronounce. Aleksic said that he believes that the new law could lead to a decrease in non-standard pronunciations. However, he added that parents might find other ways to make their children’s names unique and interesting, “maybe [using] rare characters, maybe focusing more on katakana”. “I strongly believe that the desire for individuality wins out in the end and these parents will find other ways to make their [children’s] names unique, and then that will still annoy the old guard.”",

    "title": "Acting head of FEMA said he wasn't aware of hurricane season, sources say",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 10:19 PM EDT/ CBS News Staff of theFederal Emergency Management Agencywere confused and dispirited on Monday after the acting head of the agency said during a daily briefing that he had not been aware the country has ahurricane season, according to three sources familiar with the meeting. The remark was made by David Richardson at the conclusion of an 8:30 a.m. daily operational briefing typically attended by hundreds of FEMA staffers and interagency partners. Reuters was first to report the comment. Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer, hasled FEMA since early May. It was not clear to staff whether he meant it literally or as a joke, but current and former employees who spoke with CBS News said the comment flustered many who genuinely believe Richardson was truly surprised to learn thathurricane seasonhad started. Others suggested that any joke made by the leader about the upcoming season was delivered in poor taste, offending agency staff already suffering from low morale amid a flurry of resignations, firings, leadership overhauls and polygraph tests distributed to staffers. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson later suggested the comment wasn't serious. \"Despite meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season. FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people,\" the spokesperson said. The Atlantichurricane seasonofficially began on June 1 and lasts through November. NOAA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, recently predicted it will be anabove-average hurricane seasonthat could bring 13 to 19 named storms, with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five strengthening intomajor hurricanes.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 2, 2025 / 9:14 PM EDT/ CBS/AP South Koreansare voting for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster ofYoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who is facing rebellion charges over hisshort-lived imposition of martial lawlate last year. Voting began at 6 a.m. local time Tuesday at more than 14,000 polling stations nationwide, the election commission said. Voting ends at 8 p.m. local time, and observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight. More than 15 million people had already voted during a two-day early voting period last week, accounting for nearly 35% of the country's 44.4 million eligible voters. Pre-election surveys suggest Yoon's liberal archrival, Lee Jae-myung, appears headed for an easy win, riding a wave of public frustration over conservatives in the wake of Yoon's martial law debacle. In a Facebook post, Lee called for voters to \"deliver a stern and resolute judgement\" against conservatives following the months of political turmoil. Meanwhile, the main conservative candidate, Kim Moon-soo, has struggled to win over moderate, swing voters. This election serves as another defining moment in the country's resilient democracy, but observers worry a domestic divide worsened by Yoon is far from over and could pose a big political burden on the new president. The winning candidate will immediately be sworn in as president for a single, full term of five years without the typical two-month transition period. The new president will face major challenges, including a slowing economy, President Trump's America-first policies andNorth Korea's evolving nuclear threats. Lee has preached patience overMr. Trump's tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington. Kim has said he would meet Mr. Trump as soon as possible. In his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee promised to revitalize the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him, arguing that a win by Kim would allow Yoon's \"rebellion forces\" to return. \"If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people's human rights, the normalization of martial law and our country's downfall into a backward, third-world nation,\" Lee told the crowd gathered at a Seoul park. Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament. Lee \"is now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,\" Kim told a rally in the southeastern city of Busan. Relations with North Korea remain badly strained since 2019, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogue with South Korea and the U.S. Since his second term began in January, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leaderKim Jong Un, but Kim has so far ignored the offer while making Russia his priority in foreign policy. Lee, who wants warmer ties with North Korea, recently acknowledged it would be \"very difficult\" to realize a summit with Kim Jong Un anytime soon. Lee said he would support Mr. Trump's push to restart talks with Kim Jong Un, which he believed would eventually allow South Korea to be involved in some projects in North Korea. Foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn't much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea, said Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University. He said Lee also doesn't share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-2022 term. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Big Bear eaglet takes flight from nest",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 2, 2025 / 8:45 PM EDT/ KCAL News Big Bear's famed bald eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow, are getting closer to being empty-nesters as one of their two eaglets took flight from the comforts of the nest on Monday. At about 10:46 a.m., one of the eaglets was perched on a branch when she appeared to jump off, flap her wings and fly away. Friends of Big Bear Valley Executive Director Sandy Steers told KCAL News on Monday that it was Sunny who left the nest, while Gizmo stayed behind. \"I feel elated that Sunny made it and is flying and is successful,\" Steers said. It's not yet clear where Sunny flew off too, but young eagles oftentimes return to the nest relatively quickly after their first flight, Steers said. The eaglets were born in March and are nearly 13 weeks old, making it prime-fledging time. Viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam have been anticipating the moment when eaglets Sunny and Gizmo would brave flight. \"Fledge watch\" began around May 13, as bald eagles are between 10 to 12 weeks old when they leave their nest. Sunny's flight on Monday was the result of days of practice. Friends of Big Bear Valley noted on Facebook posts that the pair had been flapping and jumping, preparing for their flight as they stood on the outer rails of their nest. \"The birds show signs of flight as they start flapping their wings hard and fast enough to feel their feet lift slightly off the nest. They will then likely start venturing out onto the outer branches of the nest tree and also practice there,\" FOBBV wrote on Facebook. Once confident, they will take off, likely near a perch tree where Jackie and Shadow have been hanging out. As of Monday, Gizmo was yet to leave the nest with her sister. Steers said Gizmo was slower developing than Sunny, so it's not yet clear if she'll be ready in the next few days. Gizmo and Sunny were both determined to be female, based on quick growth. Both will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, and FOBBV said they will likely be in and out of the nest during this time. \"By fall, they will take off on their own. Since they aren't banded, we will have no way to know if they stay together, or for how long,\" FOBBV wrote on Facebook. It is also not known if they will recognize each other. The organization noted that there is some evidence that bald eagles can memorize, but there have not been any specific studies to verify that information. Most eagles reach maturity around 5 years old, with a white head and tail and bright yellow beaks and eyes. Julie Sharp is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

    "article_text": "At his restaurant inBeijing, Geng Xiaoyun used to offer a special dish of salt-baked chicken feet — or “phoenix talons” as they are called in China — imported from America. With prices climbing 30% from March due to tariffs, the owner of Kunyuan restaurant had to pull the Chinese delicacy from the menu. “American chicken feet are so beautiful,” Geng said. “They’re spongy so they taste great. Chinese [chicken] feet just aren’t as good.” Geng can now source chicken feet from Brazil or Russia but said they just don’t stand up to the American ones. He keeps a small stash for himself but hopes to serve his American phoenix talons once again. “The price of American chicken feet will come back down,” he said, “as long as there are no big changes in the world’s political situation.” But the90-day tariff pauseagreed by China and the U.S. in Geneva in May is now under threat as both sides have accused each other of breaching the terms. On Monday, the ChineseCommerce Ministryresponded to PresidentDonald Trump’sclaimthat the country “totally violated its agreement.” The ministry pointed at recent U.S. artificial intelligence chipexport controlsas actions that “severely undermine” the Geneva pact. As the world waits and watches, American agricultural products have been vanishing from Chinese stores and restaurants and losing ground to other imports. U.S. Department of Agriculture grade beef has been a draw for years at Home Plate, a Beijing restaurant known locally for its American-style barbecue. However, staff said the restaurant stopped serving American beef last month. Dishes like “The Great American” burger are made with beef imported from Australia. Australian beef has zero duty under the terms of theChina-Australia Free Trade Agreement, though China does maintain the right to a safeguard limit on those imports. Liu Li, a beef supplier at the Sanyuanli market for three decades, said the tariffs have disrupted supply, hiking the price of U.S. beef by 50% compared to before the tariff fight. “U.S. beef is fattier and tastier,” Li said. “It’s a shame we’re in a trade war. The high price is just too much to bear.”",

    "article_text": "Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson was joking when he said at a meeting Monday that he was not aware of the upcoming hurricane season, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Reuters reportedthat Richardson said at a briefing that he was not aware the United States has a hurricane season, confusing staffers. The report, which said it was unclear if Richardson was serious or joking, cited four unnamed sources familiar with the situation. “Despite meanspirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season. FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people,” a spokesperson for DHS said. The spokesperson added that Richardson is “activated in preparation for Hurricane Season.” Richardson took the reins at FEMA last month. The previous acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton,was removed from his jobafter he told lawmakers at a congressional hearing that he did not believe the agency should be eliminated. DHS has denied that Hamilton's ouster was related to his testimony. FEMA is responsible for coordinating the government’s emergency response to areas affected by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. Hurricane season runs from June through November. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted there is a60% chance of an above-normal seasonthis year, during which the United States could get six to 10 hurricanes, three to five of which could be “major.” Democrats blasted Richardson following the report about the meeting. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., referred to the Reuters report when hewrote on X, \"And I’m unaware of why he hasn’t been fired yet.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., also took aim at Richardson,writing on X, \"Bare minimum requirement for the leader of FEMA: know when hurricane season is.\" President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly floated the idea of terminating the emergency disaster agency. During a visit to North Carolina in January to survey the damage of Hurricane Helene, which swept across the state late last year, Trump suggestedoverhauling or doing away with FEMA, calling it “very bureaucratic” and “very slow.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also suggested that FEMA should be eliminated. But without an alternative plan and with hurricane season approaching, Noem has also quietly made efforts to keep the agency running, sources familiar with the situationhave told NBC News.",

    "article_text": "Ashley Anderson was hiking in with her two kids and her dogs on Memorial Day when she heard yelling. \"I look over and I didn't even know what I was looking at at first,\" she said. \"It took me a second to register that it was a body.\" A 64-year-old grandfather had fallen 20 feet down waterfall in Utah's Adams Canyon. Anderson, a school nurse, sprang into action and used her training to help him. She told NBC affiliateKSL of Salt Lake Citythat the man had an \"obviously broken\" leg and that his head was \"sliced open and bleeding.\" When Anderson arrived, she and other hikers who had pitched in to help moved him out of the cold water that was covering him. She then began first aid. She said she told the group she needed something to stop bleeding on the man's head. \"This guy rips off his shirt and throws it on me, so we put that on his head, and several of us picked him up and moved him to a dry area over on the rocks,\" Anderson recalled. Rescue teams responded, using a helicopter to drop rescuers into the canyon before they lifted the man back up to safety. Authorities said that the man was hiking with his children and grandchildren and that he fell after they got separated, KSL reported. Anderson told the station the man's family said he slipped and fell into the canyon. The station reported he shattered his kneecap and broke his femur but is expected to make a full recovery. \"I kind of think that I did what anyone would do,\" Anderson said. \"I don't feel like I did anything like more heroic or more incredible.\"",

    "article_text": "It was a day of celebration (and perhaps some tears of joy) for fans of the Big Bear, California, eaglets as Sunny took flight and left the family nest for the first time. For the last couple of months, animal lovers have become enamored and fascinated with wild female and male bald eagle couple Jackie and Shadow’s journey. From the laying of their eggs to thehatching of three eaglets,to now one of their offspring flying off to explore its surroundings. Three eaglets hatched in early March, with onedying mid-month.People have been able to watch the two surviving eaglets, named Sunny and Gizmo, every day on theFriends of Big Bear Valley (FOBBV) 24-hour livestream. One of the eaglets, Sunny, had a major milestone moment on Monday, when she flapped her wings and flew from the nest. “At 10:46 am this morning, Sunny flew from the upper Y-branch right out into the world! She put up her wings to catch the wind and then jumped up and let those beautiful wings carry her,” Friends of Big Bear Valley wrote on its website andInstagram page. “She circled back around toward Shadow and Jackie’s favorite roost tree…Gizmo watched the whole thing from right beside Sunny.” The video shows Sunny making the big leap, with the camera angle changing and finding the eaglet perched near the top of a roost tree. The organization noted that Sunny “may return to the nest…Jackie and Shadow’s previous eaglets have all done that. It is all up to her at this point.” By 2:45 p.m. PT, Jackie and Shadow were seen in the nest with Gizmo eating some food they caught. At publishing time, Sunny had yet to return to the nest. News of Sunny’s first flight comes days after FOBBV determined that the two eagletswere females. During the last few days, Sunny had been venturing out further onto the branches of the tree where the nest is, at times hovering just above.On Saturday, the cameras captured the brave eaglethovering for about 2.5 seconds.",

    "title": "Lone wolf attacks in Boulder and D.C. highlight the difficulties in securing public spaces",
    "article_text": "BOULDER, Colo. — Once again, the war in Gaza has come home to America. A man using what police called a \"makeshift flamethrower\" launched a gruesome attack on demonstrators in Boulder on Sunday, raising questions about why security wasn't stronger in the wake of an earlier attack in Washington, D.C. Run for Their Lives, the organization behind the long-standing demonstration that advocated for the return of Israeli hostages, had anticipated that its members would have safety concerns. The group offered principles to make the events safer, including \"don't protest,\" \"be polite and peaceful\" and \"don't disturb your neighbors.\" \"Focus on humanity,\"the guidance on its websitesays. \"This is about innocent children, women, the elderly, and other civilians being held by terrorists—not about the war.\" The Boulder chapter of Run for Their Lives has been holding regular demonstrations demanding that Hamas release the hostages seized during theterrorist attack on Israelon Oct. 7, 2023. Kyle and Elizabeth Shorter, who live in a Denver suburb and were taking their wedding pictures in Boulder when the attack happened, said the Run for Their Lives demonstrators had become fixtures on the street. “Every time we’ve come up here the past couple of years, they’ve always been here,” said Elizabeth Shorter, 26. “They’ve never been aggressive or chanting, just simply walking.” And that, an expert said, could make them harder to protect from a terrorist. “Usually, there is a regular detail assigned to protect protesters,” said Brian Higgins, who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and runs a security consulting firm calledGroup 77. “But it’s not uncommon for a mindset to set in that, as time goes on and nothing out of the ordinary happens, that there’s no need to be on high alert.” Higgins, who said he wasn’t aware of what security measures Boulder police had in place Sunday, was taken aback by video that showed the attacker threatening people before police intervened. “That shouldn’t have happened,” Higgins said. “That raises questions for me about how much security there was at this protest.” Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said his department is aware of events taking place later in the month and will plan to provide additional security coverage. “We want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in this community,” he told reporters on Monday. Shira Weiss, global coordinator for Run for Their Lives, said that some chapters have long relied on protection from local police or private security but that it's \"really the individual group leader’s decision how and when they want to use security.\" And while some local chapters have paused to \"recompose themselves and give themselves space to heal\" after the Boulder attack, others have said, \"We won’t stop; we’re going to be right back out there next week,\" Weiss said. “We obviously keep reiterating to our group leaders that safety is the No. 1 priority,” she said. Although clearly frightened by what she witnessed, attack survivor Lisa Turnquist, 66, said she won't be deterred from speaking out against Hamas and on behalf of the Israeli hostages. \"This is when we have to get up and we have to stand out and push back,\" said Turnquist, who spoke to a reporter outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse, where the attack happened. \"We just want the hostages home.\" Adozen people were injured Sunday, eight of whom remain hospitalized, authorities said. Initial calls to police reported people \"being set on fire,\" and officers found multiple victims with burns and other injuries, Boulder's police chief told reporters. Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with attempted murder and a hate crime, among other offenses. The attack happened just 11 days after two Israeli Embassy workers were gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington. In both the Boulder and the Washington attacks, the attackers are alleged to have yelled the same thing: “Free Palestine.” Security experts who spoke with NBC News questioned how the man in Boulder was able to allegedly launch such an attack downtown even amid heightened awareness after the Washington killings. Higgins said his security clients include several major Jewish organizations. And ever since the killings of Israeli Embassy workers Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 22, they have been adding extra layers of security, he said. “Given what’s going on out there and the agitation out there, my recommendation is that there should be an elevated level of security at all Gaza protests,” Higgins said. Run for Their Lives has been holding regular demonstrations outside the county courthouse on Pearl Street since Hamas launched a bloody surprise attack on Israel and took 250 hostages. That spawned an Israeli invasion of Gaza that has left more than 54,000 people dead, many of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Michael Alcazar, a former hostage negotiator with the New York Police Department who also teaches at John Jay, said Pearl Street is a soft target for a terrorist attack. He said the attacker was able to approach the demonstrators because they didn’t appear to be protected. “The police chief dropped the ball not having a uniform presence over there,” Alcazar said. “Is the police chief not aware of what’s going in the world?” The Boulder Police Department didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The Anti-Defamation League said it had been in contact with local law enforcement in Boulder. “We feel at ADL like many across the country feel, which is just vulnerability and both sadness and anger at the violence that we’ve seen,” said Oren Segal, the Anti-Defamation League’s senior vice president for counterextremism and intelligence. “This is a wake-up call — not just for the Jewish community.\" The FBI also said in a statement that \"our goal is always to get ahead of any threats.\" \"We have long warned that lone actors or small groups of conspirators present a great challenge to law enforcement because there may not be a lot of clues about their intentions,\" it said. An affidavit alleged that Soliman, a married father of five, had been planning the attack for over a year and was waiting for one of his daughters to graduate before he set his alleged plan into motion. It didn't specify where his daughter was graduating from. Soliman told investigators during his arrest interview that he researched how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube, according to the affidavit. It alleged that he was also unrepentant about the attack, saying he would do it again to stop Israel from taking over “our land,” referring to the Palestinian territories. Elias Rodriguez, the Chicagoan charged with the deaths of Lischinsky and Milgrim, was also motivated by the Gaza war, authorities said. He told police when he was arrested, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” according to court records and published reports. In his first comments since the attack, President Donald Trump condemned the \"horrific\" incident Monday on Truth Social. Earlier, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller sought to shift blame onto the Biden administration for allowing Soliman in the country. “He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,” Millersaid Sunday on X. “In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, amplified that on X, saying that Soliman \"is illegally in our country\" and that he applied for asylum in September 2022. McLaughlin later told NBC News that Soliman's asylum claim was pending and that while his visa had expired, he hadn't yet exhausted all legal routes to stay in the United States. Deon J. Hampton reported from Boulder, Alicia Victoria Lozano reported from Los Angeles and Elizabeth Chuck and Corky Siemaszko from New York City.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A naturalized U.S. citizen who pleaded guilty toreceiving military training from the Islamic State groupwas sentenced Monday to 10 years in federal prison. Lirim Sylejmani, 49, engaged in at least one battle against U.S.-led forces after he entered Syria in 2015, according to prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C., imposed Sylejmani's prison sentence followed by a lifetime of supervised release. Sylejmani, who was born in Kosovo and moved to Chicago roughly 25 years ago, pleaded guilty last December to one count of receiving military training from a foreign terrorist organization. In November 2015, Sylejmani and his family flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria, where he began training with other IS recruits, according to prosecutors. They said he was injured in a battle with Syrian forces in June 2016 and was captured with his family in Baghouz, Syria, in February 2019. \"The conduct is far more than a single, impulsive act. He chose to jeopardize the safety of his family by bringing them to a war-torn country to join and take up arms for ISIS,\" prosecutors wrote. Sylejmani's attorneys say he isn't a \"committed jihadist\" and doesn't espouse violence. \"He is guilt ridden for his actions and the harm he has visited on his family, who remain detained in a refugee camp in Syria living under terrible conditions,\" his lawyers wrote. \"He wishes only to complete his time and find his wife and children, so he can live an average law-abiding life with them.\"",

We will always remember you.\" Victor appeared in 22 episodes of \"Weeds\" as sassy housekeeper Lupita between 2005 and 2012, among many other TV credits including \"ER,\" \"Matlock\" and \"The Addams Family.\" But she was perhaps best known for what she called the chancla-throwing grandmother in \"Coco,\" the 2017 family-friendly movie that explored death through the journey of a young Mexican boy to the land of the dead. \"I play the part of 'Abuelita,' the chancla throwing grandma that preaches 'No Music!'\" she wrote on Instagram, looking back several years ago. \"Enjoy 'Coco' with your family this Dia de los Muertos and forever more!\" She also looked back at \"The Apostle,\" the 1997 movie that Robert Duvall wrote, directed and starred in. \"He took a chance on me with this film,\" Victor wrote on Instagram. \"This is where I got my nickname 'one take Renée,'\" she said, adding laughter emojis. \"I had a small role but what a great one! Can somebody give me an amen?!\" Born in San Antonio, Texas, on July 25, 1938, Victor began her performing career as a singer and dancer. She moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, according to biography material provided by her representatives, where she launched her career singing with prominent big band leaders Xavier Cugat and Pérez Prado. She also taught Latin dancing, including salsa and the tango. She met her future husband, Ray, during that period, and from 1963 to 1973, they performed together as \"Ray & Renée,\" a variety show that took them around the world — including Australia, where \"they enjoyed particular fame,\" the materials said. In the 1970s, Victor hosted the \"Pacesetters\" public affairs show on KTLA, her representatives said, and by the '80s had moved into TV and film work. Her film credits, other than \"The Apostle,\" included the 2014 horror film \"Paranormal Activity 5: The Marked Ones,\" \"The Doctor\" with William Hurt (1991), and \"A Night in Old Mexico\" (2013), also with Duvall. In 2004, she had a recurring role as Florina Lopez on TV's \"ER,\" and the following year was cast in \"Weeds.\" Other series credits included \"Snowpiercer\" (2020-2021), \"Mayans M.C.\" (2022), \"Dead to Me\" (2020-2022), and Amazon's \"With Love\" (2021-2023). Victor is survived by her daughters, Raquel and Margo Victor, Smith said.",

    "title": "Top Trump officials visit prolific Alaska oil field amid push to expand drilling",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, rips up a piece of paper that had plans from the Biden administration during a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption DEADHORSE, Alaska — President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \"big, beautiful twin,\" a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean. The remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin — visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists. During the trip, Burgum's agency announced plans to repealBiden-era restrictionson future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values. The petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years. Government and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday. For years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project. Oil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape. \"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\" Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day. Those joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik. Matsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption In Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration. Alaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues. Murkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\" Environmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed. Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\" The Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal. The three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump is pushing Senate GOP to get his megabill across the finish line",
    "article_text": "Tamara Keith President Trump uses a cell phone aboard his Marine One helicopter in Leesburg, Va., on April 24, 2025.Alex Wroblewski/AFPhide caption Congressional Republicans face ahigh-stakes fight this monthto get a massive tax bill containing the bulk of their legislative agenda across the finish line. So President Trump is gearing up for what a senior White House official said will be an \"all-out advocacy effort\" to push Republican senators to agree to the broad contours of what their House colleagues passed last month in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" \"You're going to see a succession of big-name administration officials traipsing up to the hill,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the lobbying push. The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said. There are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut. It's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate. So that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.) The bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said. \"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\" But the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority. \"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've got a clue for today'sWordleall typed up and ready to help you win Tuesday's puzzle, designed to nudge you in the right direction without instantly giving the game away. You could also use it right at the start if you like, to supercharge your opening line. And don't worry if those green letters still don't turn up in time—the June 3 (1445) answer is here to save the day. Yellow letters were in plentiful supply today, fresh ones popping up with every new guess. On a good day that would mean I'd quickly find myself a whisker away from the answer, and then celebrate a win the row after. Today? I wish. Let's call this one… an exercise for my fingers. Yes. That's definitely the reason why I almost filled today's board up. Organisation's the key today. This is the shortened form of a word used to represent the work that goes into keeping a system or institution running (or the person doing the work). No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Just a bit of help. The answer to the June 3 (1445) Wordle isADMIN. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

With so much to choose from onNetflix, it's easy to let good shows pass us by. That's why you should make time to watchDept.Q,a fantastic new crime series which has been hailed as a \"grimy, gothic treat\" byThe Guardian. Dept. Qcurrently has an 81%Rotten Tomatoesscore, meaning it can grab a spot on ourbest Netflix showslist. Since its release, it's received a lot of praise from viewers and critics alike, with many binge-watching the nine-part series. Take a look at the trailer below for a peek at what people are raving about. People on social media have praisedDept. Q, highlighting the \"next level\" acting from Matthew Goode. Some have even called for a second season to be greenlit, because it's just that good. Dept Q on Netflix is such a good crime thriller . Matthew Goode's acting was next level !I hope they make season 2 of this series .#DeptQ #DepartmentQ #Netflix pic.twitter.com/KzTdARCO0fMay 30, 2025 I finished the rest of the #Deptq episodes last night.I can't say enough about how good Goode's performance is in this one. I think with a better overall mystery, this show has the potential to be one of the best. The ending was emotional and I can't wait for another season. pic.twitter.com/dldDTlnP0TMay 31, 2025 While we currently have no word onDept. Q's future, it would definitely be nice to see it return to one of thebest streaming services. I've always been a huge fan of police dramas, most recently the outstanding BBC seriesLine of Duty, and one of its stars, Kelly Macdonald, appears inDept. Qas well. She joins a brilliant cast alongside Goode, Mark Bonnar, Jamie Sives, Shirley Henderson, and Kate Dickie, whose performances really do elevate this gritty, nail-biting drama. The series follows the creation of a new police unit, a cold-case division formed \"in hopes of generating good press for a beleaguered Edinburgh police department.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It was created by Scott Frank, who co-created the brilliant Netflix showThe Queen's Gambit, and it's safe to say he's done it again here. While the two shows are very different, he's definitely had people glued to their television sets, and we can only hope thatDept. Qcomes back for another round.

    "article_text": "Activists from the Greenpeace environmental pressure group have stolen a wax statue of President Emmanuel Macron from Paris’s Grevin Museum and placed it outside the Russian embassy in a protest against what they claimed to be the French leader’s insufficient support for Kiev. France has become one of Kiev’s key backers since the escalation of the conflict in February 2022, as well as one of the primary proponents of the idea to deploy a military force into Ukraine – repeatedly floated by Macron. Paris also cut most economic ties and has consistently pushed for harsher sanctions against Moscow. However, Greenpeace France’s executive director, Jean-François Julliard, nevertheless accused the French leader of“playing a double game,”following the group’s stunt on Monday. Three Greenpeace members entered the Grevin Museum posing as tourists on Monday morning, according to AFP sources. They then disguised themselves as staff, swiftly removed the €40,000 wax figure of Macron, and transported it to the Russian embassy in Paris’s 16th arrondissement, all while filming the stunt on video. 📹 Ce matin, la statue d’Emmanuel Macron a été dérobée au musée Grévin 🤣🤣En toute décontraction, sous les yeux de tous, puis les activistes de Greenpeace l’ont déposée devant l’ambassade de Russie.On vit vraiment dans une époque formidable.pic.twitter.com/qKUSmukN4N The protesters displayed the statue alongside banners criticizing France’s ongoing imports of Russian liquefied natural gas and fertilizers. The eco-activists claimed in a statement that they had“borrowed”the statue temporarily and indicated plans to return it, but did not specify when. Des militants de Greenpeace ont volé la statue de cire d’Emmanuel Macron au Musée Grévin et sont repartis en camion avec. Ce pays est vraiment un divertissement au quotidien.. 🙄Si seulement, ils avaient pu voler l’original plutôt. 😅😅pic.twitter.com/23FL6G59sX The Paris prosecutor’s office told Politico that an investigation has been opened into“theft to the detriment of the museum,”but no arrests have been reported. The Grevin Museum has not officially commented on the incident. Russia designated Greenpeace International as an“undesirable organization”back in May 2023, citing the eco-activist group’s record of pushing a political agenda and meddling in domestic affairs with the goal of causing economic damage.",

South Korean rapper G-Dragon has denied that he is dating Sana of K-pop group Twice. The two became the subject of dating rumours after G-Dragon, whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong, tagged Sana in an Instagram post following Twice's special guest performance at Coldplay's Seoul concerts in April. G-Dragon, 36, had attended the Apr 22 concert, following which he shared a video of Twice's performance on Instagram.What drew attention was that he tagged only Sana’s Instagram account and not anyone else in Twice, sparking rumours that the two were dating. The rapper's agency, Galaxy Corporation, released a statement on Monday (Jun 2) denying the dating rumours, reported South Korean publications. His agency clarified that the Instagram post was simply a friendly gesture because the two of them had been involved in the filming of the YouTube web show Dex And Sana's Fridge Interview that took place onApr 14. “He posted a photo from the concert and tagged Sana's personal account as a friendly gesture, since it had not been long since the shoot,” the agency said, adding that they didn't explain earlier because they thought it could be a spoiler for the show.

    "title": "Australian woman accused of triple mushroom murders breaks down in court",
    "article_text": "World World A member of media films outsides the Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court building in Morwell, where an Australian woman accused of murdering three people with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington faces trial on Apr 30, 2025 in a case that has grabbed global attention. (File photo: AFP/Martin Keep) SYDNEY: An Australian womanaccused of murdering three of her estranged husband's elderly relativeswith a meal laced with poisonous mushrooms wept as she was questioned over expletive-laden messages about the victims on Tuesday (Jun 3), in a case that has captivated the country. Erin Patterson, 50, is charged with the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband. The prosecution alleges she knowingly served the guests beef Wellington that contained lethal death cap mushrooms at her home in Leongatha, a town of around 6,000 people some 135km from Melbourne. Patterson denies the charges, with her defence saying the deaths were a \"terrible accident\". She faces a life sentence if found guilty. Appearing as a witness for her own defence, Erin Patterson was questioned on Tuesday by her barrister Colin Mandy about a series of expletive-laden messages sent to friends regarding the Patterson family. The court previously heard that the relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, deteriorated shortly before the alleged murders due to a disagreement over child support. \"I wish I'd never said it. I feel ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn't have to hear that I said that,\" she said of the messages, that the court has previously heard in the prosecution's case. \"I was really frustrated with Simon but it wasn't Don and Gail's fault,\" she told the court through tears. Erin Patterson is the first witness for the defence after the prosecution rested its case on Monday, following a month of evidence from witnesses, including relatives and medical, forensic and mushroom experts. The accused began her testimony on Monday afternoon. It is unknown how long she will give evidence for or whether she will be cross-examined by the prosecution. The trial, which began on Apr 29, has seen intense interest from Australian and international media, with podcasters, journalists and documentary-makers descending on the town of Morwell, around two hours east of Melbourne, where the trial is being held. State broadcaster ABC's daily podcast about proceedings is currently the most popular in the country, with two others also high in the charts. The trial continues.

Postecoglou guided Tottenham to Europa League victory last month, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought, but they also endured their worst domestic season for nearly half a century and finished 17th in the Premier League. The 59-year-old said last month he remained unsure of his future, with reports in British media on Monday saying Tottenham are set to make their decision this week. Former Swiss international Ramon Vega, who made 64 league appearances for Tottenham, said letting the Australian go would be one of the biggest mistakes the club could make.

Mr Wong, who is also the finance minister, will take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Rizal Monument - a memorial for Filipino nationalist Jose Rizal - and receive a ceremonial welcome at Malacanang Palace, the president's official residence, said the PMO. Mr Wong will also have a delegation meeting with President Marcos Jr, who will host an official dinner in his honour. \"The visit reaffirms Singapore’s commitment to strengthening our excellent partnership with the Philippines and provides an opportunity for the Leaders to exchange views on deepening bilateral ties, as well as regional and global developments,\" said the PMO.Joining Mr Wong on the trip are his wife, Ms Loo Tze Lui, Senior Minister of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs Sim Ann, as well as officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PMO. This will be Mr Wong's first bilateral trip since his reappointment as prime minister after thePeople's Action Party won the May 3 general election. The Philippines' Presidential Communications Office said in a release on Monday that the two leaders will \"discuss the strengthening of Philippines-Singapore relations and explore opportunities for deeper cooperation across various sectors\" during bilateral talks on Wednesday. These will include sectors such as health, climate change mitigation and civil service cooperation. \"President Marcos and Prime Minister Wong are also expected to exchange views on key political and economic developments in the region, reaffirming their shared commitment to regional stability and prosperity,\" said the office.

Xu served two consecutive terms on the Communist Party's highest military command body between 2012 and 2022, as Xi came to power. Before that, he spent decades in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) air force, rising to Air Force Commander in 2007 after a stint in the PLA General Staff Department. Xu was described as an \"outstanding member of the Communist Party\" and an \"outstanding leader of the People's Liberation Army\" in a short obituary published on Monday by state news agency Xinhua. He was the first Central Military Commission (CMC) vice chair not to have been from the land forces, a sign of Beijing's growing emphasis on different branches of the military as the PLA pursues combat integration and modernisation.

    "title": "Climate strategies of agri-food giants insufficient: Study",
    "article_text": "Sustainability Sustainability The company's logo is seen at a Nestle plant in Konolfingen, Switzerland, on Sep 28, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann) PARIS: Nestle, PepsiCo and other agri-food giants are \"unlikely\" to bring about meaningful greenhouse gas reductions in the sector with their current climate policies, according to a report published on Tuesday (Jun 3). The annual report by the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch analysed the climate strategies of five of the world's top 10 food and agriculture corporations. US group PepsiCo and Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS were slapped with the lowest rating of \"very poor\", while Mars and Nestle were ranked \"poor\". French brand Danone was given a \"moderate\" rating. \"We find that agrifood companies present measures that are unlikely to lead to structural, deep emission reductions in the sector,\" the report said. The study identified five key areas for reducing emissions: commitments to fight deforestation, a transition to more plant-based proteins, reducing chemical fertilisers, reducing waste, and the energy transition of industrial sites, packaging and transport. But it found that plant-based protein products were seen as \"merely add-ons, rather than substitutes for dairy and meat products\" - which would reduce farming emissions - at JBS, a meat specialist, and Nestle, a key player in the dairy industry. \"Danone is the only one of the five assessed companies with a quantitative methane reduction target ... associated with fresh milk production,\" the authors wrote. Agricultural emissions are mainly due to livestock farming, particularly cattle, which give off methane when they burp, and the use of fertilisers, which release nitrous oxide - the third most potent greenhouse gas after methane and CO2. PepsiCo and Nestle are doing fairly well with their deforestation goals, but \"there is likely to be a mismatch between companies' reported progress ... and actual rates of deforestation in their supply chains, due to a lack of data transparency,\" the report said. The study pointed to persistent illegal deforestation linked to the JBS supply chain, with large areas of forest razed to make way for livestock. \"None of the five assessed agrifood companies acknowledges the need to reduce fertiliser use on farms,\" the authors said, adding that Nestle and Danone only mention replacing synthetic fertilisers with natural ones. Regarding food waste, \"only Danone has a credible and ambitious food loss and waste target\", it said. \"Commitments and progress on reducing food loss and waste are noticeably absent from companies' decarbonisation strategies.\" Reduction targets are also threatened by \"offsetting\" mechanisms, in which emissions are compensated for by investment into environmental projects. The report said emissions avoided through offsetting mechanisms should be counted separately from a company's own emissions reductions and those of its supply chain. \"Nestle, for example, has indicated that up to 80 per cent of its target could be met using land-based removals,\" it said. \"This raises concerns about the transparency and robustness of already claimed emission reductions.\" Danone's rating was also downgraded this year as the group \"is now explicit about its intention to count\" offsetting to achieve its reduction target. The report called on bodies that certify companies' climate strategies, such as SBTi or GHG Protocol, to clarify how firms can use offsetting mechanisms to reach their targets.

After a period of relative calm on the tariff front, Donald Trump at the weekend accused Beijing of violating last month's deal to slashhuge tit-for-tat leviesand threatened to double tolls on steel and aluminium. The moves jolted Asian markets on Monday, but hopes that the US president will speak with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping - possibly this week - has given investors some hope for a positive outcome.

Seoul was closed fora presidential election. The advances followed a positive day on Wall Street led by tech giants in the wake of a forecast-beating earnings report from chip titan Nvidia. Still, National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril remained nervous afterTrump's latest salvos. \"The lift in tariffs is creating another layer of uncertainty and tension,\" he wrote in a commentary. \"European articles suggest the lift in tariffs doesn't bode well for negotiations with the region (and) UK steelmakers call Trump doubling tariffs 'another body blow',\" he added. \"The steel and aluminium tariffs also apply to Canada, so they will likely elicit some form of retaliation from there and while US-China trade negotiations are deteriorating due to rare earth, student visas and tech restrictions, steel tariffs will also affect China.\" Separately, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday voiced optimism fora trade deal with India\"in the not too distant future\", adding that he was \"very optimistic\". And Japanese trade point man Ryosei Akazawa is eyeing another trip to Washington for more negotiations amid speculation of a deal as early as this month. Also in focus is Trump's signature \"big, beautiful bill\" that is headlined by tax cuts slated to add up to US$3 trillion to the nation's debt. Senators have started weeks of what is certain to be fierce debate over the mammoth policy package, which partially covers an extension of Trump's 2017 tax relief through budget cuts projected to strip health care from millions of low-income Americans. Oil prices extended Monday's surge that saw West Texas Intermediate briefly jump 5 per cent on concerns about an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and suggestions Washington could hit Moscow with stricter sanctions. That compounded news that the OPEC+ producers' grouping had agreed a smaller-than-expected increase in crude production. Traders were also monitoring tensions over Iran's nuclear programme after Tehran said it would not accept an agreement that deprives it of what it calls \"peaceful activities\".

    "article_text": "World World French police stand in front of the Grand Mosque of Paris as security was reinforced around places of worship within France following days of protests over the war in Gaza, on Oct 13, 2023. (Photo: REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier) NICE: French prosecutors were on Monday (Jun 2) probing a terror motive after a man who had posted racist videos shot dead his Tunisian neighbour and badly wounded a Turkish man in the south of France. The shooting late on Saturday in Puget-sur-Argens, in the southern region of Var, came after a Malian man was stabbed to death in April in a mosque, also in southern France, as concern grows over hate crimes against Muslims. The shooting was initially investigated by regional prosecutors as a suspected murder motivated by the victim's ethnicity or religion. But French national anti-terror prosecutors, known by their French acronym PNAT, announced on Monday that they would be taking over the investigation. The suspect wanted to \"disrupt public order through terror\", according to a source close to the case. The suspected killer, a Frenchman born in 1971, fled the scene in a car but was arrested not far away after his partner alerted police. He posted videos with racist content before and after the shooting late on Saturday, according to regional prosecutor Pierre Couttenier. The victim, who was born in 1979, was shot five times. The Turkish national was wounded in the hand and needed hospital treatment, the prosecutor said. The suspect, a sports shooting enthusiast, \"posted two videos on his social media account containing racist and hateful content before and after his attack\", the prosecutor said. According to French daily Le Parisien, the suspect said he \"swore allegiance to the French flag\" and called on the French to \"shoot\" people of foreign origin in one of his videos posted on social media. The PNAT prosecutors said on Monday that they had opened an investigation into a \"terrorist plot\" motivated by the race or religion of the victims. \"The racist nature of this double crime is beyond doubt, given the hateful remarks made by the killer,\" said SOS Racisme, an anti-discrimination NGO. \"This tragedy echoes a series of racist crimes that have occurred in recent months,\" it said, denouncing a \"poisonous climate\" in the country including the \"trivialisation of racist rhetoric\". Aboubakar Cisse of Mali was stabbed dozens of times while attending prayers at the mosque in the southern French town of La Grand-Combe on Apr 25. A French national of Bosnian origin accused of carrying out the attack surrendered to Italian authorities after three days on the run. Italy then extradited him to France to face justice. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was bitterly criticised for never travelling to the scene of that crime to show solidarity, while PNAT anti-terror prosecutors also came under fire for not taking over the case and instead leaving it to regular criminal prosecutors. On Monday, Retailleau denounced the murder of a Tunisian man, calling it a \"racist act\". \"Racism in France and elsewhere is a poison, and we can see that it is a poison that kills,\" Retailleau told reporters. \"Every racist act is an anti-French act.\" He added that he had spoken on the phone with the Tunisian ambassador to France. He later spoke to his Tunisian counterpart, Khaled Nouri, who \"condemned a terrorist crime\", according to an official government statement. Nouri urged French authorities to \"ensure the protection of the Tunisian community on French territory\", the Tunisian statement added.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Lim Yuen Li faces the death penalty. State Courts of Singapore. (File photo: CNA/Jeremy Long) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A 44-year-old man was on Tuesday (Jun 3) charged with the murder of a 79-year-old woman in Sengkang. Lim Yuen Li was handed one count of murder – which carries the death penalty – at the State Courts. He is said to have caused the death of Ms Wang How Khiew sometime between 1.59am and 10.30am on Sunday at a unit at Block 465B Fernvale Road. CNA understands that she was Lim's mother. Appearing in court via video link, Lim, a Singaporean, requested to use his mobile phone to make calls and deal with some administrative or financial matters. He was unrepresented, and told the court that he wanted to apply for a \"state lawyer\". He also said that he wanted to attend the woman's funeral. Lim was ordered to be remanded for psychiatric assessment at the prosecution's application. In a press release on Monday, the police said they received a call for assistance at a residential unit along Fernvale Road at about 11.50am on Sunday. When the police arrived at the scene, they found the woman lying motionless inside the unit. She was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Lim was arrested at the scene, with preliminary investigations revealing that the two had known each other. He will next appear in court on Jun 24.

    "title": "Beach Road chopper attack: Man jailed 19 years, caned for attempted murder of wife",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore The judge said Cheng Guoyuan's attack on his wife was premeditated and committed out of malice. Footage of the incident showed the man wielding a chopper at 75 Beach Road on Apr 14, 2022. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: The man who hacked his wife with a chopper outside a Beach Road restaurant in 2022 was sentenced to 19 years in jail and eight strokes of the cane on Tuesday (Jun 3). Cheng Guoyuan, 49, previously pleaded guilty to asingle charge of attempted murder. This carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment with caning. Justice Audrey Lim also took into consideration two charges of intimidating bystanders with the chopperwhen sentencing him. She agreed with the prosecution that Cheng's attack on his wife was premeditated and committed out of malice. She cited the fact that Cheng came up with a plan to kill the victim two days before the attack, took a cleaver from his workplace and drafted WeChat notes to justify the killing. The WeChat notes, which he meant to be read in the event he died together with his wife, spoke about wanting to \"settle the matter\" between them and wanting her to \"pay the price for betraying\" him. \"The line between mere rumination and premeditation is not always clear,\" said Justice Lim. But in this case, she found that Cheng's acts showed premeditation. She also noted the \"extremely vicious and cruel\" nature of Cheng's attack. He repeatedly slashed at his wife's head with a cleaver and did not stop even after the blade broke off from the handle. Cheng continued attacking the victim, finding a new cleaver and pursuing her when she got away, even though she was already seriously injured and would not have been able to defend herself, said Justice Lim. However, she found that it did not fall within the worst type of such cases, and hence did not warrant the maximum sentence. Cheng, who followed proceedings through a Mandarin interpreter, kept his head bowed as the judge read out her decision. Videos of the brutal attack on Apr 14, 2022 were circulated widely online. Multiple bystanders had tried tofend Cheng off by throwing things or holding him off with a ladder. The prosecution argued that the public disquiet caused by Cheng's violence was amplified because the incident was widely reported in the media and received significant public attention. Justice Lim said this factor could not be ignored, but should not be given too much weight in assessing the harm caused by Cheng's offence. The victim, 44-year-old Han Hongli, suffered severe blood loss and took 1.5 years to recover and adjust to her life-threatening injuries. These included deep lacerations across her body, open fractures and amputation of her ring finger. She no longer has sight in her left eye, has a permanently disfigured face and her arms are permanently partially impaired. Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Jun Chong and Koh Yi Wen had urged the court to jail Cheng for life and impose eight to 12 strokes of the cane. Cheng's lawyers Johannes Hadi and Wei Ziqiang, who were appointed pro bono, had argued for 15 years' jail and five strokes of the cane. Cheng was likely motivated by vengeance, according to his psychiatric assessment at the Institute of Mental Health. Cheng and Ms Han, both Chinese nationals, were married in 2009. Ms Han has a daughter from a previous marriage and a son with Cheng. Ms Han came to Singapore to work in 2016 and would remit money home. The couple's relationship became strained over time, and Cheng felt Ms Han looked down on him for earning less than her. Sometime in April 2021, Ms Han discovered that Cheng had done something wrong to her daughter. The wrongdoing was not revealed in court. When Ms Han confronted Cheng about it, he admitted to the wrongdoing but felt that it would not affect Ms Han's daughter. He also pleaded with his wife not to report it to the police and promised to compensate the daughter. Ms Han eventually agreed for Cheng to pay the daughter 40,000 yuan (US$5,552) as compensation, but their relationship worsened. Cheng managed to borrow the money but subsequently fell into financial difficulty. By then, Ms Han had stopped remitting money to Cheng, in part because she was not able to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cheng \"believed that his reputation and his family's reputation were more important than his life, and would rather die than 'losing (his) face'\", prosecutors said. He sought assurance from Ms Han that she would not tell his relatives and friends about his wrongdoing, and kept asking her to let the matter rest. He also asked her not to divorce him. In September 2021, Cheng came to Singapore to work as a cleaner. Ms Han did not know he was in Singapore, and was shocked when he turned up at her workplace in November that year. Later that month, Cheng threatened to kill Ms Han and not let her live in peace if she did not reconcile with him. Ms Han reported these threats on Nov 28, 2021, and police investigated Cheng and warned him not to look for her. Cheng returned to China in January 2022. In April that year, he found work at a restaurant and returned to Singapore, again without informing his wife. On Apr 12, 2022, Cheng \"concluded that he might end up with nothing if the victim were to reveal the wrongdoing to anyone\", said prosecutors. \"He was angry with the victim as she refused to forgive him for the wrongdoing even though he loved her and felt that she had done things which let him down,\" they said. Cheng also hated that the victim \"had control over his future\". To settle the matter, Cheng came up with a plan to kill his wife if she refused to confirm that she would not reveal the wrongdoing. He went to the Beach Road restaurant where she worked, but returned to his dormitory when he could not find her. The next day, he took a cleaver to the restaurant again and saw her from afar, but did not attack her. On Apr 14, 2022, Cheng did not go to work. At about 5.20pm that day, he went to the restaurant where Ms Han worked. She was shocked to see him, and asked him to go to a back lane where they could speak. Based on Ms Han's attitude and responses, Cheng felt that she \"could not be trusted to keep the wrongdoing a secret, and that she might reveal it to the Chinese police and his relatives\", prosecutors said. \"He became very angry as he felt that she was not going to give him a chance even though he had already compensated their daughter for the wrongdoing,\" they added. Pulling out the cleaver from his bag, he told her: \"If I am not living well, you should not think about living.\" He repeatedly slashed her with the chopper, chasing her when she tried to escape and pursuing her despite bystanders attempting to intervene. Cheng was finally subdued after police arrived and fired a Taser at him. He later admitted to attacking his wife out of anger. He knew it was wrong to try to kill her, but did not want her to risk exposing his wrongdoing. According to a psychiatric assessment in 2022, Cheng would need to be closely monitored in prison, as he was at risk of developing an adjustment disorder due to his concerns about receiving a severe penalty.

(File photo: REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz) WASHINGTON: US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday (Jun 2) voiced optimism for a trade deal soon with India to avoid tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump. \"You should expect a deal between the United States and India in the not-too-distant future,\" he told the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, which promotes relations between the two countries, calling himself \"very optimistic.\" Trump has set a delayed deadline of Jul 9 for countries to avoid sweeping tariffs, as he seeks to shake up the global economy to correct what he says is unfairness to the United States. Lutnick, a strong advocate of tariffs, said he was a \"great fan\" of India – but voiced longstanding concern about the emerging economy's use of tariffs. On tariff negotiations with India, \"bringing them down to a level that is reasonable and appropriate so we can be great trading partners with each other, I think is absolutely on the table\", Lutnick said. \"There were certain things that the Indian government did that generally rubbed the United States the wrong way. For instance, they generally buy military gear from Russia,\" he said. But he said that Trump believed in raising concerns and \"the Indian government is addressing it specifically and directly\".

REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo HSINCHU, Taiwan :U.S. tariffs are having some impact but demand for artificial intelligence (AI) remains strong and continues to outpace supply, the chief executive of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC said on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have created much uncertainty for the global chip industry and TSMC, the top producer of the world's most advanced semiconductors whose customers include Apple and Nvidia. C.C. Wei, speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, said they have not seen any changes in customer behaviour due to tariff uncertainty and the situation may become clearer in coming months. \"Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women People Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Buyers' Guide Singapore Singapore Style & Beauty People Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining People Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Entertainment Entertainment After the shooting, authorities arrested 56-year-old Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja and charged him with murder in Joss’ death. Voice actor Jonathan Joss. (Photo: Bang Showbiz) Jonathan Joss, a voice actor best known for his work on the animated television series King Of The Hill, was fatally shot near his Texas home, authorities said Monday (Jun 2). Police were dispatched to a home in south San Antonio about 7pm Sunday on a shooting in progress call. When officers arrived at the scene, they found the wounded 59-year-old near the street. “The officers attempted life saving measures until EMS arrived. EMS pronounced the victim deceased,” San Antonio police said in a statement. Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, confirmed the actor's death to The Associated Press in a text. The two were married earlier this year on Valentine’s Day. In an email, San Antonio police did not immediately provide any information on what prompted the shooting. In a statement, de Gonzales said he and Joss had previously faced harassment, much of it “openly homophobic”. Joss' husband said the person who killed the actor yelled “violent homophobic slurs” before opening fire. “He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other,” de Gonzales said. Before the shooting, de Gonzales and Joss were checking mail at Joss’ home, which had been heavily damaged during a January fire that claimed the lives of their three dogs. A man approached the two and threatened them with a gun, de Gonzales said. “Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,” de Gonzales said in a statement. After the shooting, authorities arrested 56-year-old Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja and charged him with murder in Joss’ death. Court records did not list an attorney who could speak on behalf of Ceja, who was being held in the Bexar County Adult Detention Center. In a statement, San Antonio police said its investigation “has found no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr Joss’s murder was related to his sexual orientation\". “We take such allegations very seriously and have thoroughly reviewed all available information. Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly,\" police said. Joss, who grew up in San Antonio, was best known as the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular King Of The Hill animated series that ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show is set to start in August. Joss also had a recurring role on the television show Parks And Recreation, playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series Tulsa King in 2022. A GoFundMe page had been set up in January for Joss after the house fire. According to the page, Joss had lost all of his belongings in the fire, including his vehicle. Before he was fatally shot, Joss had been in Austin, located about 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of San Antonio, for events related to a sneak peak of the King Of The Hill revival. On Saturday, Joss had posted a video on Instagram in which he said he was signing autographs at a comic book store in Austin. “The fans get to revisit King Of The Hill again, which I think is an amazing thing because it’s a great show,” Joss said in the video, adding he had already done voice work on four episodes of the revival. Joss' husband said Joss was grateful for his fans. “To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family,” de Gonzales said.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy A56 review: Capable mid-ranger with some rough edges",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women People Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Buyers' Guide Singapore Singapore Style & Beauty People Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining People Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Singapore Buyers' Guide Buyers' Guide Great display, premium finish, good battery life and software support but the Samsung Galaxy A56’s camera array and gaming performance fall short. This article contains affiliate links. If you buy through these links, we may earn a small commission. Photo: Samsung This audio is generated by an AI tool. The Samsung Galaxy A56 is a capable mid-tier device that ticks several boxes for users. While flagships grab all the attention, modern mid-range phones offer plenty of power for day-to-day tasks. Here are my impressions of this mid-range device – kudos, caveats and all. TheSamsung Galaxy A56looks and feels like a premium product with its metal case, brushed aluminium finish and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ front and back. The 6.7-inch display is slightly larger and has thinner bezels than last year’s A55. Its peak brightness of 1,200 nits makes viewing content easy, even in bright sunlight. The FHD+ (1,080 x 2,340) Super Amoled display is sharp and offers deep blacks and vibrant colours. Its 120Hz refresh rate(adjustable to 60Hz to save battery)offers smooth scrolling. This is a great screen for watching video content, viewing photos and reading text. The A56 includes a four-lens camera array that’s a mixed bag. It has 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide and 5MP macro lenses. It also has a 12MP selfie camera. The main and ultra-wide cameras capture sharp, detailed photos under good lighting. This softens slightly as the light decreases. Both lenses are prone to clipping (when highlights are blown out and appear white) under extremely bright sunlight. Portrait mode produces sharp, unnatural bokeh (background blur) transitions. The macro lens is poor and works only in a narrow window. Get the distance to your object and lighting right and you can capture decent images. Otherwise, macro images are grainy and noisy. The selfie camera captures detailed, vibrant photos. It is also subject to clipping against bright backgrounds, though. The A56 is equipped with 12GB RAM, 256GB storage and a mid-range Exynos 1580 chipset. It performs everyday tasks – scrolling socials and videos, editing images, chats and browsing – smoothly. It responds snappily to light multitasking.However, it struggles with demanding games like Real Racing 3 and Call of Duty, especially at high graphics settings. The 5,000 mAh battery offers plenty of juice for daily use. In my case this included four to five hours of surfing, listening to music and watching videos. I never worried about battery life and typically ended the day with about a 30 per cent charge. It supports 45W wired charging with a compatible PD charger. From an empty battery, it charged to 50 per cent in about 28 minutes and was fully charged in about 1 hour and 18 minutes. While it lacks the full Galaxy AI suite, it includes useful tools like Circle to Search, Object Erase and Best Face. Samsung promises sixgenerations of OS upgrades and six years of security updates. This isa plus for anyone planning to keep the phone that long or resell it after a few years. TheSamsung Galaxy A56offers a premium look and a great 6.7-inch display. Good battery life rounds out the package but there are some caveats. The camera array is a mixed bag with a decent main camera but poor macro lens. The mid-range processor lacks the power for more demanding games. It lacks the entire Galaxy AI suite but has commonly used AI tools that should keep non-power users happy. Pros:Great screen, premium-looking finish, good battery life Cons:Mixed camera array, processor can’t handle demanding games Get it if:You want a stylish mid-range phone with a great screen and good battery life The mid-range smartphone segment is extremely competitive with several capable choices.

    "article_text": "Republican Sen. Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league’s latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick’s 'Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich.' U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., called onthe WNBAand the Indiana Fever to apologize to Fever fans after the league’s investigation failed to find evidence that corroborated allegations of racial comments directed at Angel Reese during a recent game. The league investigated the allegations involving theChicago Skystar last month after a May 17 game hosted by the Fever. Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese (5) reacts to a flagrant foul from Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) May 17, 2025, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.(Grace Smith/IndyStar/USA Today Network via Imagn Images) \"Based on information gathered to date, including from relevant fans, team and arena staff, as well as audio and video review of the game, we have not substantiated [the report,]\" the league said in a statement.

Jim Banks believes all parties involved – especially the Fever – owe fans an apology. \"(Reese) accused the Indiana Fever fan base of being racists. They investigated it. They said those accusations were false. The least that she could do is apologize to our great state and the fans that show up at these games and say, ‘I’m sorry, I was wrong.’ Obviously, she’s not going to do that,\" Banks said Tuesday during an appearance on OutKick’s\"Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich.\" U.S. Sen.

They weren’t true. The fans weren’t shouting racial slurs towardsAngel Reeseor opposing players. I mean, where is Caitlin Clark? Where is the Indiana Fever? Where is the WNBA saying that that investigation – there shouldn’t have been an investigation. The allegations were false. Where’s the apology? It’s disappointing.\" It is unclear whether Reese notified the WNBA to prompt the investigation. Sky head coach Tyler Marsh found out about the reports \"when everyone else did.\" However, Reese has said in the past that Fever and Iowa fans have been racist toward her. \"It’s so demeaning to our state and to the fan base to go through something like that. The least they can do is apologize to the fans,\" Banks added. \"That’s the kind of garbage that gets thrown around all the time.\" Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese reacts after a foul call against the Phoenix Mercury in the first half at Footprint Center Phoenix, Ariz., May 27, 2025.(Rick Scuteri/Imagn Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Before the start of the 2025 season, the WNBA launched No Space for Hate, described as \"a multi-dimensional platform designed to combat hate and promote respect across all WNBA spaces.\" The initiative includes \"unified messaging\" during games and through social media content and the use of AI-powered technology to monitor social media activity.

    "title": "Grassley alleges FBI used biased sources in anti-traditional Catholic memos under Biden administration",
    "article_text": "Former FBI Agent Stuart Kaplan analyzes the Boulder, Colorado, terror attack on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' The FBI hid the extent of what some lawmakers have called an anti-Catholic operation targeting churchgoers during the Biden administration, despite then-agency Director Christopher Wray telling Congress that the matter was limited to a single 2023 memo, according to documents released Tuesday. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who serves as the Senate Judiciary Committee chair, released documents that he said show the FBI engaged in the investigation of traditional Catholics. During his tenure, Wray characterized the matter as part of a memo prepared by the FBI's office in Richmond, Virginia. \"I’m determined to get to the bottom of the Richmond memo, and of the FBI’s contempt for oversight in the last administration,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"I look forward to continuing to work with you to restore the FBI to excellence and prove once again that justice can and must be fairly and evenly administered, blind to whether we are Democrats or Republicans, believers or nonbelievers.\" FBI TOP BOSS KASH PATEL SAYS BUREAU RAN COVER FOR HILLARY BUT IT ALL ENDS UNDER TRUMP Former FBI Director Christopher Wray in 2017(Alex Wong/Getty Images) In a letter Tuesday to FBI Director Kash Patel, Grassley presented his findings while expressing frustration at the agency's handling of the \"anti-Catholic\" memo under Wray and its alleged lack of transparency. Wray had told congressional lawmakers the memo was a single product by a single field office. Despite Wray's claims that the memo was a single product, the FBI found at least 13 additional FBI documents and five FBI attachments that used the terminology \"radical traditionalist Catholic\" and cited the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), Grassley said. The FBI told Fox News Digital that it received Grassley's letter but declined to comment further. During his testimony to lawmakers, Wray didn't reveal the existence of a second draft product on the same topic. \"It was a product by one field office, which, of course, we have scores and scores of these products, and when we found out about it, we took action,\" Wray told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about the memo in March 2023. 'RADICAL' FBI PRACTICES ON DEI 'ENDANGERED' AMERICANS, BLACKBURN SAYS IN LETTER DEMANDING ANSWERS FROM WRAY Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, right, is criticizing former FBI Director Christopher Wray regarding a 2023 memo about the agency's targeting of Catholic groups during the Biden administration.(Getty Images) The memo became known when a whistleblower brought it to light. The memo, titled \"Interest of Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical-Traditionalist Catholic Ideology Almost Certainly Presents New Mitigation Opportunities,\" drew instant criticism from Republicans, who demanded immediate answers from the agency. A second FBI memo drafted by the FBI Richmond Field Office for bureau-wide distribution repeated the unfounded link between traditional Catholicism and violent extremism, Grassley said, noting that it was never published due to backlash after the public disclosure of the first memo. The new documents released by Grassley show that the Richmond memo was distributed to more than 1,000 FBI employees nationwide. One email exchange shows the FBI's field office in Buffalo, New York, expressing concerns about hate groups identified by the SPLC, mentioned in the Richmond memo, being in its area of responsibility. Grassley said the FBI may have relied on \"deeply-biased sources\" used in the memo. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These letters focused on the preparation of the memo, its dissemination, the use of biased sources such as the radical Southern Poverty Law Center, and later, the FBI's misleading representations to Congress, including those of former Director Wray,\" Grassley wrote.

    "article_text": "OutKick host Tomi Lahren discusses violent rhetoric on the left, the criticism of Bill Belichick's relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson and allegations against Nike. RisingDemocratic Partystar Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who sparked controversy earlier this year with remarks about Elon Musk and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, formally launched her bid for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee Tuesday. \"These are not normal times — and this cannot be a business-as-usual moment,\"Crockett saidin a post on X. The House Oversight Committee is responsible for holding the executive branch of the federal government and PresidentDonald Trumpaccountable in Congress. The committee's last ranking member, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., died May 21 after battling cancer. He was elected to the position in 2023. \"Since the start of the 119th Congress, the late ranking member, Gerry Connolly, led Oversight Democrats in the fight to hold the Trump Administration accountable and it was my distinct privilege and absolute honor to serve alongside him as the Vice Ranking Member,\" Crockett said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues. JASMINE CROCKETT AGREES DURING TOWN HALL THAT 'REPUBLICANS WANT POOR PEOPLE TO DIE' U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, said President Donald Trump is \"terrified\" of a \"smart, bold Black woman.\"(Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn) Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Tuesday aspecial election to replaceConnolly in the House. His death May 21 also left a leadership gap on the House Oversight Committee, and House Democrats are now tasked with electing a new leader to challenge Trump. Connolly designated Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., as interim ranking member, and the race is on among House Democrats for the open leadership position. Democratic representatives Robert Garcia of California and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland have announced their own bids to lead the committee. Crockett had signaled her intention to run for ranking member, and the Texas congresswoman's letter to Democrats Tuesday made her bid official.

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, speaks during a hearing with the Subcommittee on Delivering On Government Efficiency in the U.S. Capitol Feb. 26, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"In this moment, Americans are demanding a more strategic, aggressive, and energetic fight,\" Crockett said. \"Understanding that fierce urgency, I formally announce my candidacy for Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — with a focus on standing up for American families, defending the Constitution and the rule of law, and ensuring the government serves the people, not the privileged few.\" Crockett has risen to the national stage for her viral moments in the House, building name recognition among Democrats and a reputation among Republicans. Earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi accused Crockett of \"threatening lives\" and said sheshould apologize for her rhetoricagainst Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for saying, \"All I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down.\" Crockett said she was referring to \"nonviolent\" resistance. Crockett was also criticized this year for calling Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, who is in a wheelchair, \"Governor Hot Wheels.\" She walked back the comments after herremarks went viral, calling the outrage a \"distraction.\" And the Texas congresswoman dominated headlines last year when her campaign trademarked the phrase\"bleach blonde, bad built, butch body\"after a verbal dispute with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. Her viral moments have even caught the attention of Trump, whocalled Crocketta \"low I.Q. person.\" President Donald Trump waves as he arrives on Air Force One at Miami International Airport April 3, 2025, in Miami.(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) \"Our country is in an existential crisis driven by an out-of-control Executive with a flagrant disregard for our Constitution, our way of governance, and our very way of life as citizens of a democratic republic,\" Crockett said in her letter to House Democrats. \"The Administration has refused to respect congressional authority, abide by lawful judicial orders, or respond to public outrage.\" \"The magnitude of these unprecedented times warrants a resistance and tactics never before seen. We must pull back the curtain on the unmitigated chaos under Trump 2.0 and translate our findings to the American people in a way they can digest,\" Crockett added. In the letter, Crockett praised PresidentJoe Biden, touted her own achievements during her first two terms in the House and asked for her colleagues' support. Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another rising Democratic Party star, said earlier this year she would not seek the top Democratic position on the House Oversight Committee. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,\" Ocasio-Cortez's spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital in a statementfirst reported by NBC. Ocasio-Cortez lost her House Oversight bid to Connolly late last year.

The Tuesday motion comes ahead of Mangione’s scheduled court appearance on June 26. The request, submitted to Justice Gregory Carro of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, calls for Mangione to be allowed to sit at the defense table with unshackled hands and in standard courtroom attire. His legal team argues that the security measures, particularly the use of shackles and a bulletproof vest, serve no legitimate safety function and instead reinforce a damaging public narrative that depicts Mangione as dangerous. They argue that the visual impact of such restraints, frequently captured by the media, undermines his presumption of innocence.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on the America First Committee and Iran’s nuclear enrichment on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’ PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday evening looked to reaffirm his administration’s position when it comes to nuclear negotiations with Iran and said Tehran will not be allowed \"any enrichment of uranium.\" His message, which surfaced on multiple social media platforms, appeared to be a direct response to areport by Axioswhich cited two sources with \"direct knowledge\" of a secret proposal that Washington provided to Tehran, allegedly said the U.S. would agree to permit \"limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time.\" WHITE HOUSE URGES IRAN TO ACCEPT NUCLEAR DEAL AS IAEA REPORTS URANIUM ENRICHMENT SPIKE Fox News Digital could not independently verify the details of the proposal, but if the decision to grant Tehran some uranium enrichment were granted, it would directlycontradict public commentsissued by lead negotiator Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump. Iran has repeatedly said it willnot agree to a uranium enrichment ban, arguing it has the right to the process, which is also vital for nuclear energy. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on Monday reiterated this point in a press conference from Egypt, and, according to the Tasnim News Agency, said he plans to respond to the U.S. proposal soon. Araqchi did not comment on the specifics of the agreement but said his \"response will be based on the principles of the Iranian nation.\" The proposal also reportedly included the notion thatIrancould join a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as a solution to its enrichment needs. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei on Monday reportedly argued that this wasnot a new solution, nor an adequate substitute.

The White House has not said how long it will attempt to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program, as security officials have repeatedly warned that Iran could be playing for time as the threat of U.N. snapback sanctions is set to expire come October.

    "title": "Challenges posed by Trump and Putin push UK to adopt new NATO first defense policy",
    "article_text": "Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on Ukraine and Russia meeting for peace talks in Turkey and senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane breaks down Ukraine's largest attack on Russia since the beginning of the war. The U.K. on Monday announced new plans to overhaul its defensive posture in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and potential challenges posed by PresidentDonald Trump's threat to withdraw U.S. troops from the continent. British Prime MinisterKeir Starmersaid he would bring his country to \"war-fighting readiness\" by investing dozens of billions of dollars in the building of 12 submarines, weapons and munitions manufacturing, AI and other tech, and most notably, a significant investment in nuclear deterrence. The announcement came after a Strategic Defense Review by an external board found several areas in the U.K. that need to improve in order to effectively deter aggressors likeRussia, as well as North Korea, Iran and China. MACRON CHIDES TRUMP, CHINA OVER TRADE, UKRAINE, GAZA: POLICIES 'WILL KILL GLOBAL ORDER' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, Monday, June 2, 2025.(Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP) While the review heavily focused on changes that need to be made to the U.K.’s defense readiness, it also identified a need to bolster societal resilience and support. \"Our response cannot be confined to increasing defense spending,\" Starmer said in a statement from the report. \"We also need to see the biggest shift in mindset in my lifetime: to put security and defense front and center—to make it the fundamental organizing principle of government.\" The144-page planreleased by the British government on Monday laid out a new defense strategy to tackle threats \"more serious and less predictable than at any time since the Cold War.\" However, the biggest investment the U.K. revealed in its defense overhaul is a near $20.3 billion commitment to its nuclear warhead program in a move to expand its deterrence level, which, the report said, \"sends the ultimate warning to anyone who seeks to do us harm.\" The push has been described as a \"NATO first\" policy that will heavily focus on the immediate threats posed by Russia to the European continent. However, the plan is not a \"NATO only\" policy. UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE TALKS YIELD NO CEASEFIRE, ZELENSKYY WARNS PUTIN SHOULD NOT BE 'REWARDED' From left to right, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron hold a meeting during a summit at Lancaster House in central London, on March 2, 2025, as concern remains over whether the U.S. will back Ukraine amid Russia's invasion.(JUSTIN TALLIS/Pool via REUTERS) The U.K. plans to produce a new submarine every 18 months until it secures a fleet of up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines under theAUKUS program, which is a trilateral security partnership between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. – which focuses on security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the face of increased Chinese aggression in the region. Defense Secretary John Healey said, \"We are in a new era of threat, which demands a new era for U.K. defense.\" Starmer ordered the review last summer, shortly after he secured the top job. Security experts have warned that the threat Russia poses as it advances its war machine is assessed to be a generational threat, and one that will likely out-live the war in Ukraine or even aPutin presidency, and European nations have been scrambling to react to the new reality. The re-election of Trump became another challenge European leaders have grappled with. Though Trump pushedNATOleaders to increase their defense spending during his first term, most nations did not meet their GDP defense spending commitments under NATO until after Russia invaded Ukraine. Now, just eight of the 32 NATO nations do not meet the 2% GDP spending commitments, while five nations, including the U.S. spend more than 3%.

While theU.K. has pledgedto spend 2.5% of its GDP on defense by 2027, with an increase to 3% by 2030, Trump has called for NATO nations to spend 5% -- though the alliance has not yet agreed to such a plan, which the U.S. also falls short on, spending 3.38% according to figures released in 2024. The U.K. is also looking to take more of a leadership role in NATO, particularly as the reliability of the U.S. has been called into question amid the war in Russia, and amid threats by Trump that he maydrawdown troopnumbers in Europe.

    "article_text": "‘The Ben Shapiro Show’ host Ben Shapiro discusses the changing immigration policies in Europe and more on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ The party of populistDutchpolitical leader Geert Wilders abruptly left the country's governing coalition on Tuesday over a dispute about immigration, a move that brings down the government after less than a year in office, which will now likely trigger snap elections. Wilders, who leads the Party for Freedom (PVV) and is a hardlineron immigration, was demanding 10 tougher asylum measures — including a freeze on applications and limits on family reunification — which were not agreed to by the other three coalition partners. In a stunning move, Wilders said his party was pulling out because the other three ruling parties were not willing to support his ideas on halting asylum migration. The party of populist Dutch political leader Geert Wilders abruptly left the country's governing coalition on Tuesday over a dispute about immigration, a move that brings down the government after less than a year in office.(AP Photo/Peter Dejong) POLISH CONSERVATIVE KAROL NAWROCKI WINS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO SUCCEED DUDA \"No signature under our asylum plans… The PVV leaves the coalition,\" Wilders said in a post on X. Wilders, the so-called\"Dutch Donald Trump,\"said he had informed Prime Minister Dick Schoof that all ministers from his PVV party would quit the government. Schoof has not yet reacted to the resignation. Some proposals Wilders was pushing were already part of government policy, like enhanced border controls, but he also demanded the stripping of citizenship from people with a double passport, a proposal critics said undermined fundamental rights, according to the Dutch outletde Volkskrant. Wilders also grew frustrated with the lack of progress from his own asylum minister, Marjolein Faber, who was responsible for delaying the repeal of the scatter bill -- a law designed to distribute asylum seekers more evenly across municipalities -- and the House is still awaiting consideration of its first asylum laws, the outlet reported. Wilders viewed the scatter bill as a symbol of a failed asylum policy and a threat to Dutch identity. Asylum seekers arrive in the Westelijk Havengebied, to be accommodated on the cruise ship MS Galaxy in Amsterdam on Oct. 4, 2022.( Ramon van Flymen / ANP / AFP) GERMANY POISED TO GET NEW CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR FRIEDRICH MERZ Last week, Wilders demanded that the army be used to guard land borders and turn away all asylum-seekers. He said at the time that if immigration policy is not toughened up, his party \"is out of the Cabinet\" and made good on the pledge on Tuesday. \"I signed up for the toughest asylum policy and not the downfall of the Netherlands,\" Wilders told reporters. It was unclear what would happen next. The government could attempt to remain in power as a minority administration or call new elections for later this year. Schoof called an emergency Cabinet meeting for early afternoon. Wilderswon the most recent electionin November 2023 with a surprisingly wide margin of 23% of the vote, but recent polls indicate he has lost some support since joining the government. Polls put his party at around 20% of the vote now, on par roughly with the Labour/Green combination that is currently the second-largest in parliament. Dilan Yesilgöz, leader of the right-wing People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, said Wilder’s move was \"super-irresponsible\" and said he was \"shocked\" by it.

    "article_text": "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee tells Fox News Digital that the revisionist campaign against the Jewish state's historic ties to the Holy Land is ‘absurd.’ (Video: Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL for Fox News Digital.) EXCLUSIVE:U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabeestressed the importance of acknowledging the Jewish people's historic connection to the Land of Israel, describing global efforts to deny this link as \"absurd.\" \"First of all, archeology is a daily reminder of the connection between this land and the Jewish people going all the way back to 3,500 to 3,800 years, whether it’s Shilo, whether it's Jerusalem,\" Huckabee told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview in Jerusalem on Thursday. His comments came as Jews worldwide celebrate Shavuot, the biblical holiday commemorating God's giving of the Torah to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai. BATTLE FOR BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY INTENSIFIES AS ISRAELI RESEARCHERS FACE ACADEMIC BOYCOTT Visitors arrive at Sebastia National Park in Samaria. Sebastia was the Israelite kingdom during the reigns of Omri and Ahab.(Hillel Maeir/TPS-IL) Huckabee pointed to archaeological evidence as strong support for the biblical account. \"The excavations at theCity of Davidalone are a validation of the biblical record of what really did happen here. Sometimes people on the far-left love to say 'follow the science, follow the science,' and I would say to them, as it relates to the land and the connections to the Jewish people, follow the science of archaeology.\" The remarks come amid an ongoing diplomatic war by the Palestinian Authority — which was granted non-member observer state status at the United Nations in 2012 — to revise historical narratives in international forums where anti-Israel majorities are common. For example, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2016 registered the Cave of the Patriarchs — the burial site of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah, located in Hebron—under the name of the \"State of Palestine\" on its \"List of World Heritage in Danger.\" RARE 2,300-YEAR-OLD GOLD RING DISCOVERED IN JERUSALEM'S CITY OF DAVID The Cave of the Patriarchs, also known as the Cave of Machpelah.

General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution in 2021 referring to the Temple Mount — Judaism’s holiest site, located in Jerusalem but beyond the 1967 borders — solely by its Islamic name, \"Haram al-Sharif.\" \"For 20 years, I have been pushing back against an effort from the PA, Hamas, European-funded anti-Israel NGOs, and the U.N. to try and prevent excavations from coming to life,\" said Doron Spielman, author of the new book \"When the Stones Speak: The Remarkable Discovery of the City of David and What Israel's Enemies Don't Want You to Know,\" a book that shows the historical andindigenous connectionto the Holy Land of the Jews. \"There are thousands of discoveries that prove the connection of the Jewish people to thebiblical heartland, but in particular the clay seal impressions of Yehuchal—the son of Shelemiah—and Gedaliah—the son of Pashur—that were found at the site believed to be King David’s palace,\" explained Spielman. \"They are directly quoted in the Bible as having attempted to kill the prophet Jeremiah.\" U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee places a note in the Western Wall as Holy Week and Passover come to a close.(@USAmbIsrael/X) In 2008, Israeli archaeologistEilat Mazarrevealed the discovery of a clay seal impression, or bulla, bearing the name Gedaliah, son of Pashhur. The artifact was unearthed during a dig in the City of David, located just south of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The bulla was found close to where, in 2005, a similar seal inscribed with the name Yehuchal had been discovered. Both individuals are known from the bible as officials who served under King Zedekiah, the final monarch of the Kingdom of Judah before the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem and the First Temple in 587 B.C. LEADING EVANGELICALS IN PUSH TO HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER ‘BIBLICAL HEARTLAND’ \"The bullas can be seen, they are on display at the Israel Museum and in traveling exhibitions. They have gone from one side of the world to the other because the Palestinians created a narrative attempting to erase any connection between Jews, and by extension Christians, to the Land of Israel,\" continued Spielman. Huckabee emphasized thatarchaeological discoveriescontinue to affirm the scriptural narrative connecting the Jewish people to the land. A picture taken on October 12, 2017 shows the logo of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization headquarters in Paris.(JACQUES DEMARTHON/AFP via Getty Images) \"Every time some new discovery is unearthed it validates the biblical record, so the proof is pretty strong that that connection is not something that goes back to 1948 or 1917 the Balfour Declaration - it goes all the way back to the time of Abraham. That’s pretty far back,\" he said. For his part, Spielman voiced concern that the message isn’t resonating with the mainstream, particularlyamong younger generations. \"On campuses in the U.S., people are chanting 'From the River to the Sea,' and calling the Jews colonizers,\" he said, in reference to the mantra calling for the \"liberation\" of \"Palestine\" through the elimination of Israel.

    "article_text": "In a heated exchange, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called remarks by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, \"a patent lie\" and said he was \"sick and tired\" of \"heated partisan rhetoric\" over judge safety. Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas., sparred Tuesday over the uptick in threats made to federal court judges during PresidentDonald Trump’ssecond term. Their heated standoff comes as federal judges have issued a record number of injunctions against the flurry of executive actions by the president. The testy exchange took place during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing titled \"The Supposedly Least Dangerous Branch: District Judges v. Trump.\" Cruz, the subcommittee chair, used his remarks at the outset of the hearing to take aim at Democrats on the subcommittee, who he said were \"utterly silent\" about judicial threats under the Biden administration, includingafter threats were made againstconservative Supreme Court justices. TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY Booker speaks in the U.S. Senate.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Cruz took aim at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for \"unleashing\" protesters who gathered outside the homes of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh prior to their decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization – the landmark ruling that overturned a 50-year-oldabortion rights precedent– which he later said was ironic given the current \"pearl-clutching\" stance of Democrats on the panel. His remarks sparked a quick rebuke from Booker, who said, \"Something you said is actually dangerous, and it needs to be addressed.\" \"This implication that there was silence [from Democrats on the panel] at a time there were threats on people's houses is absolutely absurd,\" he continued. \"I remember the rhetoric and the comments, the concern from [Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.],\" Booker said. \"I actually distinctly remember you, chairman, on more than one occasion, condemning those attacks on Republican-appointed jurists.\" TRUMP NOMINATES FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY EMIL BOVE FOR FEDERAL APPEALS COURT VACANCY Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \"To say things like that just feeds the partisanship in this institution, and it feeds the fiery rhetoric. And it's just plain not true,\" Booker added. In response, Cruz argued the \"angry mobs\" that appeared outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court justices prior to their decision in Dobbs were in violation of U.S.C. Section 1507. That law prohibits picketing outside the homes of judges or justices' homes in a way that could influence their decision or otherwise obstruct justice. Despite the protests, Cruz said, the Biden-led Justice Department \"prosecuted nobody.\" \"I really appreciate that you have now shifted the accusation you made earlier,\" Booker shot back. \"Your accusation was that we were silent in the face of protests at Supreme Court justices' homes. Again, we joined together in a bipartisan way, not only to condemn that but to pass legislation to extend round-the-clock security protection. So if you’re saying we didn’t criticize –\" he started before Cruz interjected. \"Did the Biden DOJ go out and arrest a single person under this law?\" theTexas lawmakerasked. Booker attempted to respond before Cruz interrupted again,\"Did the Biden DOJ arrest even one [person]? Again, the answer is no.\" 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP 2ND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT Law enforcement officers stand guard as protesters march past Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home in Chevy Chase, Md., on June 8, 2022.(Nathan Howard/Getty Images) Booker attempted once more to respond before Cruz interrupted again, prompting Booker to raise his voice. \"I did not interrupt you, sir,I would appreciate it if you would let me finish,\" he told Cruz. \"I am sick and tired of hearing the kind of heated partisan rhetoric, which is one of the reasons why we have such divisions in this country,\" Booker continued, prompting Cruz to laugh openly in response. \"The attacks we see from the president of the United States of America, trolling and dragging judges through is what we should be talking about,\" Booker said. \"I'm simply taking issue with the claim that you made at the top, that people on the Democratic side of the aisle do not care about the safety and the security of judges and said nothing,\" he continued, adding that the notion that his Democrat colleagues said nothing in the face of Supreme Court justice threats \"is a patent lie.\" WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? The two continued arguing before Cruz said, \"Let the record reflect that Spartacus did not answer the question and did not tell us whether the criminal law\" under U.S.C. Section 1507 should be enforced, \"because he knows the answer is yes.\" The hearing comes as the number of threats against federal judges hasspiked duringTrump's second term, which has seen hundreds of federal lawsuits filed in courts across the country seeking to either pause or halt the flurry of sweeping executive orders and actions taken by the president. Trump has repeatedly criticized what he called \"activist judges,\" prompting Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public warning. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. Marshals Service said last week that it has investigated more than 370 threats against federal judges since Trump's inauguration in January, which is a sharp rise from 2024, when 509 people were investigated during the entire year. Democrats on the panel used Tuesday's hearing to renew requests for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate an uptick in anonymous \"pizza deliveries\" sent to federal judges, which can be used as a threat or warning to let judges know their home address is known.

    "article_text": "Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C., exposes how vitamin and supplement retailer GNC, now owned by the Chinese Communist Party, is embedded on U.S. military bases. He vows to kick them off and shut the door on CCP influence: \"We're not going to give up.\" Arizona Democratic Gov.Katie Hobbs, who is up for reelection this year, garnered backlash Tuesday after vetoing a bill aimed at preventing China from buying up land next to strategic assets, such as military bases. Arizona state Senate Majority Leader Janae Shamp said the \"politically motivated veto\" was \"utterly insane,\" blaming Hobbs for being \"an obstructionist against safeguarding our citizens from threats.\" However, Hobbs said the bill, S.B. 1109, was \"ineffective at counter-espionage\" and did not \"directly protect\" American military assets in the state. TEXAS PUSHES BACK AGAINST FOREIGN LAND GRAB WITH 'STRONGEST BILL IN THE NATION' AGAINST CHINA, IRAN, RUSSIA Chinese investment in land nearmilitary baseshas become an increasing concern for national security hawks. Shamp, in her efforts to get the now-vetoed bill passed, cited recent Chinese attempts to lease buildings alongside Arizona's Luke Air Force Base, where the military trains fighter pilots.

The base is known for training fighter pilots.(Photo by DIRK WAEM/BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images) \"Governor Hobbs’s veto of SB 1109 hangs an 'Open for the CCP' sign on Arizona’s front door, allowing Communist China to buy up American land near critical assets like Luke Air Force Base, Palo Verde nuclear power plant, and Taiwan Semiconductor’s growing fabrication footprint,\" said Michael Lucci, the CEO and founder of State Armor Action, a conservative group with a mission to develop and enact state-level solutions to global security threats. \"Allowing Communist China to buy up land near our critical assets is anational securityrisk, plain and simple, and Governor Hobbs is substantively and completely wrong when she says that SB 1109 ‘is ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets,’\" Lucci added. Lucci pointed toUkraine's recent drone attacksthat destroyed significant numbers of Russian military aircraft, noting that \"proximity produces peril in asymmetric warfare.\" AFTER UKRAINE’S SURPRISE DRONE ASSAULT ON RUSSIA, NEW ATTENTION DRAWN TO SENSITIVE SITES STATESIDE Chinese land grabs in the United States have been an ongoing concern for lawmakers. Currently, Congress is considering multiple bills related to the matter, while almost two dozen states have already passed legislation to implement changes around foreign land purchases in their states.(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) S.B. 1109, which can still pass if the Arizona legislature overrides Hobbs' veto, would have prohibited thePeople's Republic of Chinafrom having a 30%, or more, stake in Arizona property. Hobbs, in her defense of the veto, added that in addition to being ineffective at countering Chinese espionage efforts, the bill lacked \"clear implementation criteria,\" which opened the door for \"arbitrary enforcement.\" However, the bill went through a bipartisan amendment process in an effort to assuage those concerns that the legislation might lead to discrimination in land sales, according to local outlet the AZ Mirror. The initial version of the bill banned certain people and entities deemed to be national security threats from buying up land in Arizona, but following subsequent amendments the bill only sought to ban Chinese government-linked entities and its subsidiaries. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said that not only was the bill an \"ineffective\" way to try to counter Chinese espionage efforts, but it also lacked \"clear implementation criteria\" which Hobbs complained could open the door to \"arbitrary enforcement.\"(GETTY IMAGES) In addition to Arizona, other states have proposed or passed legislation aimed at curtailing Chinese land grabs in the United States. Congress has also taken steps in an effort to effectuate change through national policy.

TheWhite Houseis pushing back against Newark Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka, who has hit interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba with alawsuit this weekafter he was arrested and briefly charged with criminal trespassing last month outside an ICE facility. Baraka, who is one of the leading Democratic candidates for New Jersey governor, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Habba, accusing her of \"false arrest and malicious prosecution\" in connection with his May 9 arrest and chargesoutside a federal immigration center. He was one of several public officials, including Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver and Bonnie Watson Coleman, from the New Jersey congressional delegation, all of whom had massed outside the facility in protest. The U.S. attorney's office said 13 days after it brought charges against Baraka that it was dismissing the case against him \"for the sake of moving forward.\" The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accuses Habba of acting politically in Baraka's May 9 arrest outside the Delaney Hall detention center, near Newark Liberty International Airport. Baraka was arrested during a protest outside the facility after being accused of trespassing and ignoring warnings from law enforcement officials to leave. He was held in custody for several hours before being released.

In the lawsuit, Baraka's lawyers accused Habba of acting as \"a political operative, outside of any function intimately related to the judicial process, and in her individual personal capacity.\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, responded to Baraka’s move by calling it a \"meritless lawsuit\" and a \"desperate attempt\" to stay relevant.

    "article_text": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defends President Donald Trump's spending bill despite Elon Musk's harsh criticism, highlighting GOP divisions over wasteful spending and national debt. A cohort of Senate Republicans already troubled by the House GOP’s version of President Donald Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill\" found a common ally inElon Musk, who again trashed the legislation on Tuesday. Musk, who just exited his tenure as Trump’s efficiency bloodhound leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, doubled down on his position that the House’s reconciliation package was an \"abomination.\" WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY TAX BILL AFTER MUSK CALLS IT A 'DISGUSTING ABOMINATION' Elon Musk, left, and President Trump held a joint press conference following Musk’s exit from the Department of Government Efficiency and his criticism of Trump’s latest spending bill.(Getty Images) \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,\" Musk said on X. \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\" \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he continued. \"You know it.\" SenateRepublicanshave already vowed to make changes to the colossal bill, which includes the president’s desires on tax, energy, immigration, defense and national debt policies. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thune, R-S.D., lauded Musk for his work with DOGE, but noted that the Senate GOP and the tech-billionaire had \"a difference of opinion.\" ELON MUSK CRITICISM OF TRUMP TAX BILL FRUSTRATES SOME REPUBLICANS: 'NO PLACE IN CONGRESS' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks with reporters about his plans to advance President Donald Trump's spending and tax bill at the Capitol in Washington on Jun. 2, 2025.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) He didn’t believe that Musk’s comments would derail the bill entirely in the upper chamber, either. Thune has pledged to get the bill to the president's desk by Independence Day. \"The legislation, as passed by the House, can be approved here in the Senate, can be strengthened in the Senate, in a number of ways,\" Thune said. \"We intend to do that, but when it's all said and done, we'll send it back to the House and hope that they can pass it and put it on the president's desk.\" Still, fractures have emerged among lawmakers, with some viewing the bill through the same lens as Musk. \"Well, he has some of the same skepticism I have, you know, towards the big, beautiful bill,\" said Sen.Rand Paul, R-Ky.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is opposed to the reconciliation package because of the debt-limit increase, does a TV news interview at the Capitol in Washington on Jun. 3, 2025.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Paul has vowed not to support the bill as is without a serious overhaul to the legislation that would nix a $5 trillion increase to the nation’s debt ceiling — a stance that has gotten him into hot water with Trump. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has similarly pledged not to support the bill unless much steeper spending cuts are achieved. The House’s product includes $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade, but Johnson would like to see a return to pre-pandemic spending levels, which would effectively amount to a roughly $6 trillion cut in spending. \"I share his concerns,\" Johnson said of Musk. \"I also appreciate what he and President Trump did with his DOGE effort.\" And Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a fiscal hawk whose views are closely aligned with Johnson’s, argued in response to the tech billionaire’s social media post that \"federal spending has become excessive.\" \"The resulting inflation harms Americans and weaponizes government,\" Lee said on X. \"The Senate can make this bill better. It must now do so.\" Other Senate Republicans, including those with outstanding concerns with the current legislation, were much less receptive to Musk’s tirade against the bill. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has remained steadfast in his position that he would not support the current Medicaid proposals in the House’s bill, especially if they cut benefits to his constituents and people across the country. When asked his reaction to Musk’s rant, he shrugged, \"Well, he's entitled to his opinion, it's a free country.\" Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.V., who has expressed reservations on the contents of the megabill, was more blunt. \"My reaction to that is just simply this — and y'all may like this or not like this — but you know, Donald Trump is our president, not Elon Musk,\" he said.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) parked a custom-wrapped food truck in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters inWashington, D.C.,in an effort to troll President Trump over his tariff policies. The stunt received widespread mockery from conservatives. The DNC used the acronym TACO for \"Trump Always Chickens Out\" to provoke Trump's ire.

    "article_text": "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt defends President Donald Trump's spending bill despite Elon Musk's harsh criticism, highlighting GOP divisions over wasteful spending and national debt. The House GOP is quietly mounting a pressure campaign on the Senate to accept its version of PresidentDonald Trump's\"one big, beautiful bill\" even as lawmakers in the upper chamber signal they'll be making changes. Tensions are simmering between Republicans in the two chambers as they work to pass a massive tax, immigration and energy bill via the budget reconciliation process. The House Budget Committee held a staff-level communications briefing on Monday, two sources told Fox News Digital, the same day the Senate returned from the Memorial Day week recess to begin consideration of the massive bill. Senate Republicans have vowed to tweak the House’s offering to varying degrees, with some wanting to tackle even deeper spending cuts and others wanting to soften the blows to Medicaid and green energy subsidies. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE Senate Majority Leader John Thune, left, President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson.(Getty Images) While lawmakers in the upper chamber are still working out the kinks of their approach, they agree the bill will be different. Both sources interpreted the meeting as a way to get ahead of Senate Republicans' criticism of certain aspects of the bill. Documents viewed by Fox News Digital that were handed to House Republican aides show specific talking points about the bill's taxpayer savings, Medicaid provisions and green energy subsidy rollbacks, among other topics. The document pushed back on the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Office(CBO) estimate that the bill would add more than $2 trillion to the deficit over a decade. \"The cost of the bill ($4.12 trillion) is surpassed by the savings ($4.29 trillion) associated with mandatory spending reforms ($1.7 trillion) and economic growth ($2.6 trillion),\" the document said. It suggested House Republicans assume 2.6% economic growth over 10 years rather than the CBO's unprecedentedly low 1.8%. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE \"House Budget is desperately circling the wagons with staff and members to make sure they do not forget the fight is not over on messaging why their bill is better than their Senate rivals,\" one House GOP aide told Fox News Digital. \"They got jammed with the Senate version in the blueprint round and are using every tool at their disposal to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" A senior House GOP aide also told Fox News Digital, \"The Senate should heed President Trump's wishes to get [the bill] to his desk before July 4th.\" The House passed its version of the legislation late last month after a marathon all-night session full of debate and Democrat procedural motions to delay. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington said \"we've got to get the votes.\"(Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images/File) The mammoth bill is aimed at permanently extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while also including new tax relief for senior citizens and eliminating taxes on tipped and overtime wages. It would also send new funding to the U.S.-Mexico border and to enhance Immigrations and Customs Enforcement while rolling back a significant portion of thegreen energysubsidies from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). To save money and cut down on what Republicans see as waste, fraud and abuse of government safety nets, the bill would introduce Medicaid work requirements for certain able-bodied recipients beginning in December 2026. It would penalize states that allowed illegal immigrants into the Affordable Care Act-expanded Medicaid population while rewarding states that did not. Both the IRA subsidies and Medicaid reforms are emerging as pain points for the Senate GOP's three-seat majority. The document obtained by Fox News Digital appears to target specific senators' concerns. For example, one portion of the Q&A specifically said, \"No,\" the bill does not put rural hospitals at risk. \"The bill reinvests funds to reopen rural emergency hospitals and ensure cost-effective care access,\" the messaging guidance said. HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT On the rescinded IRA funds, it said, \"The bill targets unused or duplicative funds from programs such as the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants and sustainable jet fuel. These projects aligned more with ideological goals than infrastructure priorities.\" Another note mentioned the electric vehicle (EV) credit rollback, arguing it would \"ensure all vehicles contribute to the Highway Trust Fund.\" \"EVs cause more wear and tear due to their higher weight but pay no fuel taxes. The bill imposes modest user fees starting no later than the end of FY 2026 and terminates in FY 2035, indexed to inflation,\" it said. But it's not clear that senators with those concerns will heed the House's arguments right now. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters Tuesday, \"It's going to hurt rural hospitals in my state.\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., acknowledged to reporters on Tuesday that while there was discontent over \"individual pieces\" of the bill, Republicans must agree on something that will pass the chamber. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is opposed to the Medicaid cuts in the House bill.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) \"Failure is not an option. We've got to get to 51, so we'll figure out the path forward to do that over the next couple of weeks,\" Thune said. Other senators, meanwhile, have argued they want to make deeper cuts than what the House came up with. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The House bill, they're not even scratching the surface. It's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we need to do to return to a reasonable, pre-pandemic-level spending,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on Fox Business last week. When reached for comment, the House Budget Committee referred Fox News Digital to recent comments by Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas. \"Some senators will say we went too far on entitlement reform and health care and welfare, and then you'll have ... [f]olks like [Sens.] Rick Scott, Ron Johnson, who are dear friends of mine, all well-intentioned, will say we don't cut enough spending,\" Arrington said on Fox News last week. \"Well, the fact is, you can only cut as much as you can get the vote to pass it out of your chamber. And we cut almost $1.7 trillion in spending, which is the largest spending cuts in American history by twofold.\" \"There's always room for improvement, and I welcome that, especially on the fiscal reform side, but we've got to get the votes.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

Permissive laws in deep blue Colorado created an environment in whichlast weekend’s antisemitic attackcould occur, a local district attorney told Fox News Digital. In an interview with Fox News Digital, George Brauchler, a Republican district attorney for Colorado’s 23rd district, said that the state government, which is dominated by Democrats, has been intentionally creating a lax, sanctuary-type environment regarding immigration enforcement. This, he said, emboldens illegals, such asMohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect accused of firebombing pro-Israel activists on Sunday, to act with impunity. A DHS spokeswoman has said Soliman, an Egyptian national, was living in the country illegally at the time of the attack. He entered the United States in August 2022 with a visa that expired in February 2023, the spokeswoman said, noting he applied for asylum during that time. HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AMONG VICTIMS IN BOULDER, COLORADO SUSPECTED TERROR ATTACK In an interview with Fox News Digital, George Brauchler (left), a Republican district attorney for Colorado’s 23rd Judicial District, said that the state government, which is dominated by Democrats, has been intentionally creating a lax environment regarding immigration enforcement. That emboldens illegals, such as Mohamed Sabry Soliman (right), the suspect accused of firebombing pro-Israel activists on Sunday, to act with impunity, he said.(District Attorney for 23rd Judicial District office website and Storyful/KDVR) Soliman allegedly injured eight adults, including a victim who was 88 years old, at an outdoor mall in Boulder, according to the FBI. The suspect was witnessed shouting \"Free Palestine\" during the attack and using a makeshift flamethrower to target the crowd, theFBI said. Police said the victims were hospitalized with burn wounds. They had been participating in a Run for Their Lives protest, which, according to the Anti-Defamation League, is a weekly event attended by members of the Jewish community to support hostages held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists. Discussing the brazen attack, Brauchler said: \"When you have taken the ongoing steps that our state government has taken over the past many years to identify yourself to everyone, both citizen and noncitizen alike, that you are a sanctuary state - and it doesn't matter if they ever say those words, what matters is the policies in place - and when you had put local law enforcement on its heels, when it comes to trying to coordinate with immigration enforcement authorities, you create an environment where someone feels like visa or no visa, I can stay here and do whatever I want, whether it's to try to find a job off the books or to plan for a terrorist act against Jews up in Boulder.\" BOULDER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TERROR SUSPECT’S ’POSSIBLE RADICALIZATION’ PROBED BY AUTHORITIES: RETIRED FBI AGENT Law enforcement officials put on protective gear to investigate an attack on the Pearl Street Mall on Sunday in Boulder, Colorado.(AP) In response to the attack, Brauchler said he expects theTrump administrationmay assume control of the case and \"make an example\" of the perpetrator. CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE \"In the past, you would see some deference by the federal government to local prosecutors who showed an interest in prosecuting high-profile cases,\" he said. \"But in this day and age, with illegal immigration being an issue, with the anti-Semitic terrorist acts being an issue, I can foresee President Trump and Attorney GeneralPam Bondisaying, ‘We're taking this case, we're going to use every tool at our disposal, we're going to highlight this prosecution, we're going to make an example of this guy, and we're going to send a message.’\" Brauchler said that though \"we've seen antisemitic stuff before out here, never in my recollection at this scale or this brazenly having somebody do this.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROMISES JUSTICE FOR SLAIN ISRAELI COUPLE IN DC SHOOTING Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said there was a man arrested on Sunday, Jun.1, 2025.(KDVR) Mohamed Sabry Soliman, terror suspect, is seen with a Molotov cocktail in his right hand.

    "article_text": "Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the Supreme Court's stance on Trump's transgender military ban and the latest on the feud between the president and NY AG Letitia James. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to continue to provide accommodations and care for transgender inmates in federal prisons, saying officials had not provided a serious explanation for why medical treatment for gender dysphoria should be handled differently than other cases. The order Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee, blocks officials from carrying out PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order, which required Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials to stop providing medical procedures related to sex changes. \"Neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\" Lamberth wrote in a 36-page opinion. TWO TRANS INMATES ORDERED BACK TO WOMEN'S PRISONS IN REAGAN-APPOINTED JUDGE'S INJUNCTION A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to continue to provide care and accommodations for hundreds of transgender inmates in federal prisons.(Getty Images) The judge grantedan injunctionrequested by three transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria to block the implementation of Trump's executive order. Lamberth ruled the plaintiffs' merits are likely to succeed under the Administrative Procedure Act. \"The import of the opinion is essentially this: Under the APA, the BOP may not arbitrarily deprive inmates of medications or other lifestyle accommodations that its own medical staff have deemed to be medically appropriate without considering the implications of that decision,\" Lamberth wrote. A BOP spokesperson told Fox News Digital the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation or matters that are the subject of legal proceedings. A White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the \"decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women’s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders. The Trump administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue in court.\" JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA Trump's order mandated the BOP stop providing \"any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\" Prior to Trump'sreversal of BOP gender dysphoria policies, the BOP began funding transgender surgical procedures for transgender inmates in December 2022, with Donna Langan, formerly known as Peter Kevin Langan, becoming the first federal prisoner to undergo taxpayer-funded gender surgery. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue to provide accommodations and care for transgender inmates in federal prisons.(iStock) Langan was convicted in 1997 for involvement in a series of armed bank robberies across the Midwest during the 1990s. Langan was a leader of the Aryan Republican Army, a White supremacist group that carried out these robberies to fund their activities, according tocourt documents.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy and Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, discuss the future of DOGE as Elon Musk steps back from his government role on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, is celebrating PresidentDonald Trump'sleadership in sending aDOGE cuts packageto Congress that he believes will \"finally\" defund NPR and PBS, which he said have become \"nothing more than fake news.\" Jackson claimed the outlets, which receive millions of dollars in federal taxpayer funding, \"have become taxpayer-funded propaganda arms of the radical Left.\" TheWhite Houseis expected to include cuts to both NPR and PBS in the $9.4 billion federal spending cut proposal – called a \"rescissions\" package – it is sending to Congress on Tuesday. It is the latest move by Republican officials to make good on promises to slash government spending, a project spearheaded by the president and theDepartment of Government Efficiency. TRUMP ADMIN ASKS SCOTUS TO ALLOW IT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PLANS TO SLASH FEDERAL WORKFORCE Rep. Ronny Jackson is celebrating a DOGE cuts package that he believes will \"finally\" defund NPR and PBS, which he said have become \"nothing more than fake news.\" An official from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) told Fox News Digital last week that it will primarily target federal funding to NPR, PBS and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Once transmitted to Capitol Hill, lawmakers have 45 days to take up the rescissions package before it's voided. Among the package’s strongest supporters is theHouse Freedom Caucus, which is demanding the House vote on the package the same week it lands. Jackson, who has introduced a bill to defund NPR and PBS in every Congress since he was elected, told Fox News Digital that he strongly supports the rescissions package, which he said is fully in line with his long-standing efforts to defund what he has previously called the \"chronically biased\" media outlets. The congressman said he is \"excited\" to codify the DOGE package that \"finally cuts off their funding.\" 'RED TAPE': TRUMP ADMIN UNLEASHES DOGE-ALIGNED PROCESS TO FIRE FEDERAL WORKERS FOR MISCONDUCT The House Freedom Caucus is pushing for a swift vote on the White House's rescissions package.(Getty Images) \"Since beingelected to Congress, I’ve led the charge to defund NPR and PBS, which have become taxpayer-funded propaganda arms of the radical Left. They are now nothing more than another fake news media outlet,\" said Jackson. He added that under Trump’s leadership, Congress will deliver on \"ending the outrageous practice of forcing hardworking Americans to pay for left-wing attacks on our values, our children, and our president.\" This follows a high-intensity HouseDOGE Subcommittee hearingin March in which NPR’s Katherine Maher and PBS’ Paula Kerger attempted to explain why their outlets still deserve public funding. During the hearing, Maher conceded that NPR botched coverage ofHunter Biden'sinfamous laptop, saying, \"We made a mistake.\" At the time, NPR representatives publicly called the story unserious and a distraction.

    "article_text": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the future of DOGE after Elon Musk's exit and the Trump administration's spending reduction request after claims that additional spending would undermine cuts. The clock will soon start ticking away on Congress to consider PresidentDonald Trump's$9.4 billion request for federal spending cuts. \"Today, we have officially received the rescissions request from the White House to eliminate $9.4 billion in wasteful foreign aid spending at State and USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The House will act quickly on this request,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement Tuesday. \"This rescissions package reflects many of DOGE’s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity. Congress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\" House and Senate Republicans now have 45 days to codify the funding reductions. HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT Under President Donald Trump, the Elon Musk-led DOGE slashed billions in what it deemed as wasteful government spending.(Musk: Reuters / Money: iStock / Trump: Getty) Trump is asking lawmakers to claw back federal funding from NPR, PBS and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). It's the first of what could be several efforts by Congress to follow through on Elon Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The proposal is called a rescissions package, a mechanism allowing the White House to weigh in on Congress' yearly government appropriations process. The process was created under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act as a way to stop the president from unilaterally acting on government funding while giving the executive some say over the spending – albeit with congressional approval. House and Senate GOP leaders have pledged to work swiftly once they receive theWhite House's request. But lawmakers are also working up against another deadline, with Republicans hoping to finish Trump's \"big, beautiful\" tax and immigration bill by July Fourth. The tax bill is being passed under a separate fiscal mechanism calledbudget reconciliation, which allows Congress to amend areas they normally could not touch via the annual appropriations process. But like reconciliation, rescissions allow the party in power to sidestep the minority by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage to 51 instead of 60 votes. Rescissions debates are also capped at two hours in the House and 10 in the Senate. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought told reporters after meeting with Johnson on Monday that more packages could be coming. Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's Office of Management and Budget director, met with Speaker Mike Johnson Monday.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) \"I want to see if it passes. I think we're very interested to make sure it passes both the House and the Senate, but we're very open to sending multiple bills,\" Vought said. Paul Winfree, founder of the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), told Fox News Digital he believed the White House was using this first package as a test run to see how DOGE cuts could be achieved. \"This first rescissions package from President Trump is a test as to whether Congress has the ability to deliver on his mandate by canceling wasteful spending through a filibuster-proof process,\" Winfree said. \"If they can’t, then it’s a signal for the president to turn up the dial with other tools at his disposal.\" And while a wide swath of Republicans is likely to coalesce around cuts to NPR, PBS and USAID – areas long targeted by fiscal conservatives – multiple people told Fox News Digital they could foresee some issues with the GOP's razor-thin, three-seat House majority. MCCAUL TOUTS MONEY IN TRUMP TAX BILL TO PAY TEXAS BACK FOR FIGHTING BIDEN BORDER POLICIES The packages comes as Elon Musk's time heading DOGE draws to a close.(AP/Evan Vucci) \"I get a sense that there will be some that don't want an ad written that they're defunding Big Bird,\" one House Republican told Fox News Digital. \"They've earned cancellation, but I mean, there are some moderates in our conference.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, conservative groups in the House are bearing down hard to get the bill passed. Both the House Freedom Caucus and Republican Study Committee released statements pushing for the spending cuts to be passed as soon as possible. The Freedom Caucus, whose position was first reported by Fox News Digital, called for the House to pass the bill as soon as this week.

Balint told Fox News Digital later Tuesday that in the last four months, the Trump administration \"has repeatedly wrongfully detained, deported, and disappeared people — an immoral violation of fundamental human rights.\" \"He has made immigrants, regardless of status, feel unsafe and targeted all around the country. As Vermonters, we’re so proud that we are seen as a safe place to land. I’m unwavering in my position that immigrants and refugees are welcome in Vermont and that every worker in every job deserves dignity and fair wages — from doctors and scientists to carpenters and farmworkers.\" \"I’ve relentlessly condemned the Trump administration’s cruel practices targeting and separating immigrant families, and I will continue to stand up for the rights of every person in this country,\" Balint said.

    "article_text": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says the U.S. air traffic system is facing a modernization crisis and called on the Senate to pass the Big Beautiful Bill's $12.5 billion transport fix. FIRST ON FOX:TheWhite House launched a websiteTuesday where Americans can tabulate how much the \"big beautiful bill\" will personally save them if lawmakers pass the sweeping legislation, Fox News Digital learned. \"We are preparing your tax cuts,\" the website launched Tuesday declares, alongside a photo of PresidentDonald Trumpand a message celebrating how \"American Industry\" has thrown its support behind the legislation. Senate lawmakers are in the midst of working to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is a multitrillion-dollar piece of legislation that advances Trump's agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. The House passed its version of the legislation in May. Critics say that the bill, which is over 1,000 pages, will add trillions to what is already ballooning government debt ofmore than $36 trillionand deficits. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes this can be managed. The new site features acalculator that tabulatesthe tax savings Americans can expect if the legislation passes. The calculator asks users to input their weekly base pay, weekly tip amount and weekly overtime premium pay to determine the savings. TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER' The White House launched a new website tabulating how much the Big Beautiful Bill is anticipated to save Americans. Fox News Digital found that an individual, for example, receiving $665 in weekly pay, $260 in tips and $100 in overtime premium pay would translate to $2,246 in yearly savings and $187 in monthly savings. If a person takes home $200 a week in base pay, $400 in tips and $200 in overtime, they would see $2,954 in yearly savings and $246 in monthly savings, Fox Digital found. The \"big beautiful bill\" wouldeliminate taxeson overtime and tips, which were two focal points of Trump's tax policies as he rallied voters at the polls in 2024. The new website also touts more than 1,000 endorsements from American industries and organizations, including support from businesses such as Uber and DoorDash. Trump repeatedly has called on lawmakers to pass the sweeping legislation to fund his agenda, touting that it would cut taxes for Americans across the brackets, as well as tighten border security. TRUMP HEADS TO CAPITOL HILL TO PUSH 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' \"Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’ Not only does it cut Taxes for ALL Americans, but it will kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need. The Country will suffer greatly without this Legislation, with their Taxes going up 65%,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on May 16. The White House launched a Big Beautiful Bill calculator for taxpayers.(White House ) \"STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE! It is time to fix the MESS that Biden and the Democrats gave us. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he continued, calling on Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation. A handful ofSenate Republicanshave spoken out that they will not support the legislation as it will increase the nation's debt limit. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul told the media Monday that the bill will raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. \"We have never raised the debt ceiling without actually meeting that target,\" he said Monday, Fox Digital previously reported. \"So you can say it doesn't directly add to the debt, but if you increase the ceiling $5 trillion, you'll meet that. And what it does is it puts it off the back-burner. And then we won't discuss it for a year or two.\" WH STUDY WARNS 9 MILLION AMERICANS COULD LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE IN 'MAJOR' RECESSION IF TRUMP BUDGET BILL FAILS Trump admonished Paul over the weekend as rhetoric mounted that the Republican senator would not support the legislation, arguing Paul was on the verge of siding with the \"Radical Left Democrats\" and encouraging a 68% tax hike on Americans if he votes against the bill. Sen. Rand Paul has said he will not support the \"big beautiful bill.\"(Left: Samuel Corum/Getty Images; Right: Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"Rand will be playing right into the hands of the Democrats, and the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!

So we have to do something. And it's critical that we pass this bill. We're going to work with the House. We're going to get this deal done. The Senate will put their mark of approval on it, but nonetheless, we want to do everything we can as quickly as we can to take care of this so that we can get on to other things. The president has made it very clear he wants to get this done. We want to help in that regard. This is our job.\"",

    "title": "More seniors are using cannabis than ever before despite health risks, research shows",
    "article_text": "Senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses advancements in artificial intelligence aimed at predicting an individual's future risk of breast cancer and the increased health risks from cannabis as users age. New data has revealed thatcannabis useamong older adults is at an all-time high. Researchers at UC San Diego and NYU discovered that marijuana use by Americans aged 65 and older increased by nearly 46% from 2021 to 2023, according to an NYU press release. As more stateslegalize marijuanafor recreational use, as well as for medicinal therapies, accessibility to the drug is more widespread, particularly among aging adults. DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 7% of 15,000 adults in this age range reported using cannabis in the last month, according to 2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This was an increase from 4.8% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022. While marijuana use surged in both men and women, it was more prevalent among women. Marijuana use was found to be more prevalent among women in the study.(iStock) The research found that increased use was associated with health conditionslike hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Those with a college or post-grad degree, an annual income of $75,000 or more, married status and residence in a state with legalized medical cannabis were also more likely to partake. \"Adults with the highest incomes initially had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use versus other income levels, but by 2023, they had the highest prevalence, which may indicate better access to medical cannabis given its costs,\" the researchers noted in the study discussion. OLDER AMERICANS TURN TO MARIJUANA FOR BETTER SLEEP AND PAIN RELIEF: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW \"The substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states.\" The researchers also warned that the use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, could cause complications in chronic disease managementin older adults. New reports continue to find cannabis-related health risks in older users, experts warn.(iStock) The study did not look at the frequency of cannabis use, cannabinoid type or recreational versus medical use. In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, senior author Joseph Palamar, PhD, associate professor of population health at NYU Langone, noted his concern about cannabis use increasing among older populations. DAILY MARIJUANA SMOKERS FACE HIGHER RISK OF HEART ATTACK, STROKE, SAYS AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION STUDY Palamar suggested the increased use is likely due to a combination of greater availability, decreased stigma and previous marijuana users aging into the 65+ cohort. \"My worry is that some of these people may have adversepsychiatric reactions, especially if they use edibles,\" he said. \"It's very easy to accidentally eat too much, and then there's no turning back once it's already ingested.\" Increased use was associated with health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).(iStock) In a previous interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Barbara Krantz, medical director at Caron Treatment Centers in Florida, confirmed that she’s seen a \"significant uptick\" in cannabis use by individuals over 50. \"It is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I'm very disturbed that the elderly are using it.\" While polls have shown that most older Americans use cannabis to improve sleep, reduce pain, alleviate mental health issues and to relax, Krantz shared some potential dangers of the habit. Those include increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, increased hypertension and tachycardia, as well as worsening ofchronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). Cannabis may also lead to interactions with other medications, which can increase their toxicity or decrease their effectiveness, Krantz cautioned. Other potential risks include balance issues, delayed reaction times, increased confusion or cognitive impairment, andheightened anxiety, depression or anger. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER There could also be surgery-related risks, including complications due to anesthesia and delays in healing, the expert noted. \"Seniors should talk to their healthcare provider and their pharmacist before using any marijuana or cannabis product, because there are very real and specific dangers for older adults when using these substances,\" Krantz advised. Researchers and experts encourage older adults to discuss cannabis use with their doctors.(iStock) Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented on these findings during an appearance on \"America’s Newsroom\" on Tuesday, noting that regular use of cannabis can be dangerous if not tracked. \"You might use a gummy to go to bed, and then the next thing, you're using two gummies, or three gummies, and it could increase anxiety, it can increase discombobulation, you're not thinking clearly, ER visits are on the increase,\" he cautioned.

    "article_text": "Senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses advancements in artificial intelligence aimed at predicting an individual's future risk of breast cancer and the increased health risks from cannabis as users age. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first artificial intelligence (AI) tool to predictbreast cancer risk. The authorization was confirmed by digital health tech company Clairity, the developer of Clairity Breast – a novel, image-based prognostic platform designed to predict five-year breast cancer risk from a routine screening mammogram. In a press release, Clairity shared its plans to launch theAI platformacross health systems through 2025. AI DETECTS OVARIAN CANCER BETTER THAN HUMAN EXPERTS IN NEW STUDY Most risk assessment models for breast cancer rely heavily on age and family history, according to Clairity. However, about 85% of cases occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer, likely stemming fromgenetic mutationsthat occur because of aging, health agencies report. Clairity Breast has received FDA authorization for an AI tool that predicts breast cancer risk through mammograms.(iStock) Traditional risk models have also been built on data from predominantly European Caucasian women, which Clairity said has not been \"generalized well\" to diverse backgrounds. The AI tool analyzes subtle images from a screening mammogram that correlate with breast cancer risk, then generates a \"validated five-year risk score\" and delivers it to healthcare providers, the company noted. AI DETECTS WOMAN’S BREAST CANCER AFTER ROUTINE SCREENING MISSED IT: 'DEEPLY GRATEFUL' Dr. Connie Lehman, Clairity founder and breast imaging specialist at Mass General Brigham, stressed the importance of mammograms in early cancer detection. \"Now, advancements inAI and computer visioncan uncover hidden clues in the mammograms – invisible to the human eye – to help predict future risk,\" she said in a press release.

    "article_text": "Riley Gaines, host of the 'Gaines for Girls' podcast, joins 'Fox & Friends' to react after professional Algerian boxer Imane Khelif was named a top female athlete of 2024 by the Associated Press. Olympic gold medalistImane Khelifcelebrated Global Parents Day in an Instagram post amid the boxer's latest gender controversy. \"Today, I became a champion, but it all started long ago! When my parents believed in me, even when the dream felt too big. When they supported me, listened to me, and stood by me. \"Being a parent isn’t easy. There’s no manual. But the love, patience, and trust you give your child can change everything. On this #GlobalDayOfParents, I just want to say thank you.

Together with @unicefalgerie, I’m celebrating these everyday heroes. Because when parents are supported, children can dream and succeed.\" Khelif’s social media post came as a report from3 Wire Sports, citing medical documents from chromosome tests given by the International Boxing Association (IBA) before the 2022 and 2023 world championships, reported that Khelif’s DNA showed \"markers with male karyotypes.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) derecognized the IBA amid concerns about the organization's governance, financial reliance on Russian state energy firm Gazprom and integrity of the bouts. \"Chromosome analysis reveals Male karyotype. No numerical or chromosomal anomalies detected at 450-550 banding resolution,\" a screenshot of the document on 3 Wire Sports read. The test was at an accredited lab in New Delhi, called Dr. Lal PathLabs, before the boxing championships, according to 3 Wire Sports. Fox News Digital reached out to World Boxing, the Algerian Olympic Committee and reps for Khelif for comment. The IOC issued a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning. \"The IOC has always made it clear that eligibility criteria are the responsibility of the respective International Federation,\" the IOC said. \"The factors that matter to sports performance are unique to each sport, discipline, and/or event. We await the full details how sex testing will be implemented in a safe, fair and legally enforceable way.\" Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 championships before a gold medal bout over gender eligibility issues.

Khelif defeated Angela Carini in the initial fight during the Paris Olympics, and the IOC defended Khelif. \"Everyone competing in the women’s category is complying with the competition eligibility rules,\" said IOC spokesperson Mark Adams. \"They are women in their passports, and it’s stated that this is the case, that they are female.\" Then, the IBA doubled down, saying Khelif – along with Taiwan’s Lin Yu-thing – were disqualified from the world championships due to \"a result of their failure to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women’s competition, as set and laid out in the IBA Regulations. This decision, made after a meticulous review, was extremely important and necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition.\" The IBA added that Khelif underwent two tests: one in 2022 and the other in 2023. The IBA said Khelif appealed the decision to the Court for Arbitration of Sport but withdrew during the process, making the \"IBA decision legally binding.\" As the controversy grew, Khelif kept on winning and eventually was awarded a gold medal. Throughout the controversy, Khelif has maintained that their gender is female. Khelif even filed a lawsuit against detractors and critics on social media. Imane Khelif, right, fights Luca Anna Hamori.(Sina Schuldt/picture alliance via Getty Images) Before World Boxing made its decision, Khelif was planning on participating in the 2028 Olympics despite PresidentDonald Trump's \"No Men in Women’s Sports\" executive order was signed. Kheliftold ITVthat the policies do not apply to the boxer. \"I will give you a straightforward answer: the U.S. president issued a decision related to transgender policies in America. I am not transgender. This does not concern me, and it does not intimidate me. That is my response,\" Kheliftold the outlet. \"For me, I see myself as a girl, just like any other girl. I was born a girl, raised as a girl, and have lived my entire life as one.\" World Boxing said last week that Khelif must take a sex test before being able to compete in sanctioned fights. \"Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxing’s rules and testing procedures,\" a letter sent byWorld Boxingto the Algerian Boxing Federation read. The letter also stated that World Boxing decided to adopt mandatory sex tests this month. \"These new eligibility rules were developed with the express purpose of safeguarding athletes in combat sports, particularly given the physical risks associated with Olympic-style boxing,\" the letter read. World Boxing added in a statement that the new policies are \"designed solely to ensure the health and safety of all participants in World Boxing competitions (including Imane Khelif) and is not deemed to in any way pre-judge the outcome of any testing that will be introduced as part of the new policy on ‘Sex, Age and Weight.’\" On Monday, World Boxing apologized to the Algerian Boxing Federation for singling Khelif out in the letter.

    "article_text": "Awake Illinois founder Shannon Adcock spoke in opposition to trans athletes in girls' sports at the Naperville 203 School District board meeting on Monday, June 2. (Credit: Naperville 203 School District) This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). An Illinois school district's board meeting was overtaken by opposing protesters for the second time on Monday night amid erupting tensions overtrans athletesin girls' sports. The community has been embroiled in a growing divide after a junior high trans athlete won three girls' track and field events in May. The Naperville Community Unit District 203's board meeting saw nearly its entire three-hour duration dedicated to impassioned debates over the issue. The district'slast board meetingon May 21 saw the same situation play out, prompting national attention. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM During Monday's gathering, like the last meeting, the seats were packed with community members of conflicting cultures, as half the room wielded transgender pride flags, while the other half raised \"Protect Girls Sports\" signs. Several speeches eventually erupted into loud boisterous lectures, while nearly every speech was met with a roaring applause from half the room. A pro-transgender speaker named Patty Drugan asserted that the conservative activist group Awake Illinois was causing transgender youth to commit suicide in the state, while defending the trans junior high student at the center of the controversy. \"You need to take a look at Awake Illinois' website, and those are the reasons why these children are committing suicide!\" Drugan said. \"The shame is on all of you because for those of you who didn't disrespect that child, those of you who didn't stand up for that child, the shame is all on you!\" Another pro-transgender speaker named James Katchmeric claimed that the rhetoric to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports was \"Nazi stuff.\" \"I learned what happened in World War II, and I found that trans people were the ones who were attacked first. So this is Nazi stuff,\" Katchmeric said. \" The pro-transgender protesters sitting in the front row turned their backs to the \"Protect Girls Sports\" speakers at the lectern during their speeches throughout the night. Multiple speakers there to oppose trans inclusion in girls' sports wore shirts from the activist sportswear brand XX-XY Athletics. ILLINOIS TRANS ATHLETE CONFLICT GROWS AFTER TENSE TRACK MEET AS STATE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR TRUMP'S HELP A Naperville, Illinois, school board meeting saw tension over trans athletes for the second meeting in a row.(Naperville 203 Board of Education) Awake Illinois founder Shannon Adcock wore an XX-XY Athletics shirt, vowed to protect girls' sports and asserted the federal government's authority takes precedence over the state's laws that protect trans inclusion. \"We are going to protect these children and Title IX will reign supreme. Federal supremacy exists, it doesn't matter how many times people wish a certain state statute can overrule federal law, it cannot,\" Adcock said. Illinois law has protected the right of biological males to compete in girls' and women's sports since 2006. After PresidentDonald Trumpsigned the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5, Illinois state GOP lawmakers sent a letter to the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) asking when it would comply with the order. However, the IHSA responded saying Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. So the issue has persisted in the state, while many families and lawmakers are calling for Trump's administration to intervene, as it has in Maine and California so far. Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., addressed a second letter on May 21 to the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice asking for federal intervention into the issue. Miller previously sent a letter in April asking for intervention. Miller's latest letter asks U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to specifically look into the Naperville incident and consider pulling federal funding from the state, as seen in a copy obtained by Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP School board meetings have been a platform for invoking that intervention in the state so far. Currently, there is one federal Title IX probe in Illinois regarding transgenders impeding on female spaces, but it is only against one school. Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S.Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights after middle school girls were allegedly forced by school administrators to change in front of a trans student in the girls' locker room. Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation in March after filing a complaint to the Justice Department and then delivering a school board meeting speech that went viral on social media.

Oregon high school seniorAlexa Anderson garnered national attentionon Saturday when she refused to share the high jump medal podium with a trans athlete at a state track and field championship meet. Viral footage of Anderson and fellow girl athleteReese Eckard stepping downfrom the podium also showed an official gesturing for them to step to the side. Anderson alleges the official ordered her and Eckard to get out of the shot of photos if they were not going to stand on the podium. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"We stepped off the podium in protest and, as you can see, the official kind of told us 'hey, go over there, if you’re not going to participate, get out of the photos,'\" Anderson alleged during an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday night. \"They asked us to move away from the medal stand, so when they took the photos, we weren't even in it at all.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the Oregon School Activities Association for comment. The incident comes weeks after high school sports officials in California allegedly orderedathletes to take off\"Protect Girls Sports\" T-shirts at a postseason meet featuring a trans athlete. Anderson added that Saturday was her first time ever competing against a transgender athlete, but she has opposed trans inclusion in girls' sports prior to that and expressed her belief through social media comments. \"This is the first public stand that I have taken in this issue, but I have privately supported all the girls that have done with positive messages, commenting on posts, just supporting them and letting them know I'm behind them in any way,\" Anderson said.

Anderson and Eckard's situation was only one of many instances of girls having to share competition and medal podiums with biological males at state meets this past weekend.

Jeff Francoeur, in his own words, \"know[s] baseball backwards and forwards.\" A former first-round pick once dubbed \"The Natural,\" Francoeur is now an analyst for his formerAtlanta Braveswhile doubling up as a dad to athletes. An expert of the game, it would be easy for him to take charge of his children's ball games. But he wants to let his kids be kids. \"Take the parents out of [youth sports] and the kids usually have a great time,\" Francoeur told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. \"I coach a 12U travel softball team for my daughter – all the parents think their kid should be hitting third, playing here, being this. If you took all the parents out and asked those girls to make a batting order, I bet you they can do a pretty good job of making what the batting order should be.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Jeff Francoeur(Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) Francoeur knows that there are a ton of parents out there who choose to live vicariously through their kids when it comes to athletics (he even admitted he can \"get carried away\"), and he's not afraid to put those parents to the test. \"The first question I ask a lot of parents is, ‘What do you want out of sports for your kids?’ My mom and dad wanted me to learn to be a great teammate, how to have [a] work ethic, overcome adversity,\" he added. \"Parents now, there are still plenty that look at it like that, but so many look at it as a ‘win at all costs’ at such a young age. [Former Braves pitcher John Smoltz] said it best on the podcast. He said, ‘I wish there were more coaches that have the balls to worry about development over winning, especially at the younger ages.’ That gets lost, man. So many people care about the bottom line and winning. Have you ever thought ‘what’s best for my kid?’\" In fact, one of Francoeur's kids \"hates baseball\" and plays lacrosse. \"Even though I know baseball backwards and forwards, and I’d love for my son to play, this is his passion, this is his dream. Who am I to sit here? I used to have to drag him to baseball practice. Lacrosse, he can have practice from 6 to 8, he’s got his stuff laid out, he’s pumped, man.\" Among his involvement in youth sports, he started the \"Pure Athlete\" podcast, which highlights youth sports, its parents and how it all can be pure once again. His brand recently partnered up with D1 Training to help those younger athletes be in sports for the right reasons. \"When we do this podcast stuff with young athletes, you're trying to kind of navigate that journey. There's so many avenues, right? There's so many places that you can go to train, to do this, people that sell you. For me, [D1 founder] Will [Bartholomew] and those guys, though, they do it the right way, man, and they got the right people connected with them,\" Francoeur said. \"I love how they personalize everything; everything is specific to what you're trying to do. \"If you're looking at trying to get the next step in advance, that's such a big part now. We talk to all these athletes, man, even for my career, if I look back, if there's one thing I could have done better, it’s take care of your body, right? Train better, agility, nutrition, all that. I just think D1’s on the cutting edge of a lot of what they do.\" Former Atlanta Braves player Jeff Francoeur is shown with a Boys & Girls Club member prior to Game 3 of the 2021 World Series between the Braves and the Houston Astros.(Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) Pete Roseis now eligible for the Hall of Fame. If, and likely when, he makes it, he won't see it. He died last September. Rose was placed on baseball's ineligible list in 1989 after it was rumored he bet on baseball while he was with the Cincinnati Reds. Fifteen years after the ban, he finally admitted to doing so as a manager. It's since been reported he gambled as a player, but he denied that. It may be tough for some to give \"Charlie Hustle\" the benefit of the doubt, but Francoeur said he's talked to more Hall of Famers that are on the side of letting him in than not letting him in.\" \"I got so many mixed feelings about that. There’s no right answer to that. It’s kind of like, man, really? You’re going to wait until he died to do that?\" Francoeur said. \"It's so funny, because you remember Pete Rose saidbefore he died, ‘When I die, they'll make me eligible.’ Sure enough, he called it. I mean, they did.\" Rose's Cooperstown fate will likely be decided in 2027 by the Classic Baseball Era Committee, which considers players whose careers ended more than 15 years ago. He would need 12 of the 16 votes to get in. Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose, right, in 1987(Ricky Rogers/The Tennessean/USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) The current collective bargaining agreement expires in December 2026, and the threat of a lockout is certainly real. Players and owners agreed to a deal after a lockout of a little more than three months, from late 2021 into early 2022. After the lockout came numerous rule changes that baseball purists may hate, but the numbers don't lie. Attendance has increased in each of the last two seasons and ratings have been adequate. Francoeur said \"the pitch clock was the greatest thing [MLB Commissioner Rob] Manfred ever did.\" But he said the game cannot fumble the momentum it has gained in recent years. \"To be honest with you, the only thing I think can screw this up are two things. The TV deals, we’ve got [to] make it better for fans to watch baseball again. I still have 1,000 people in Atlanta [saying], ‘How do I watch the Braves?’\" Francoeur said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But it looks like players and owners will be battling for even longer if a deal is not reached in the next year and a half. \"And the second, I hope the union and the owners can figure it out, but it doesn’t sound great after 2026. I know deadlines drive deals, but I wish there would be more dialogue now. Let’s start talking about this now.

    "title": "Archaeologist uncovers 'compelling evidence' of true location where Jesus turned water into wine",
    "article_text": "Actor Tarik Makarem joins 'Fox and Friends Weekend' to discuss his role as Jesus of Nazareth on Fox Nation's 'Jesus Crown of Thorns'. A historian believes he'sfound the locationof Jesus Christ's first miracle – and has newfound evidence to back it up. Scripture gives limited details about Jesus' first miracle, which is said to have taken place at Cana. The Gospel of John states that Jesus turned water into wine during a wedding in the village. \"Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons,\" the gospel states. \"Jesus said to the servants, 'Fill the jars with water,' so they filled them to the brim.\" ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER EARLIEST KNOWN EVIDENCE OF CHRISTIANITY NORTH OF THE ALPS: 'UNUSUAL FOR THIS TIME' The passage continues, \"Then he told them, 'Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.' They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine.\" The prevailing theory states that Kafr Kanna, an Israeli town in the Galilee, was the true location of Cana. Pilgrims have long venerated the site, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914. An archaeologist claims that Khirbet Qana is the site of Jesus' first miracle, after conducting excavations at the site.(Pen News; Getty Images) But historian Tom McCollough says that Cana was actually located five miles north of Kafr Kanna. The site, called Khirbet Qana,was a Jewish villagefrom 323 B.C. to 324 A.D. McCollough taught religion and history at Centre College until his retirement in 2017. He told Pen News that Khirbet Qana presents the most compelling evidence so far. ARCHAEOLOGISTS REVEAL STRANGE INSCRIPTIONS IN ROOM OF THE LAST SUPPER IN JERUSALEM \"[No other village] has the ensemble of evidence that makes such a persuasive case for Khirbet Qana,\" he said. The main piece of evidence is a series of tunnels used by Christians — marked with various crosses and references to Christ, which date back over 1,500 years. Kafr Kanna, seen here, is considered the site of Jesus' first miracle — which a historian is now disputing.(Getty Images) \"We have uncovered a large Christian veneration cave complex that was used by Christian pilgrims who came to veneratethe water-to-wine miracle,\" McCollough said. \"This complex was used beginning in the late fifth or early sixth century and continued to be used by pilgrims into the 12th-century Crusader period.\" During his excavation, McCollough also uncovered an altar and a shelf with a stone vessel. \"Our excavations have shown that this was a thriving Jewish village located in the heart of much of Jesus’ life and ministry.\" He noted that there was space for five additional jars — consistent with the biblical account ofsix stone jars. On the walls of the complex, his team of excavators also uncovered references to Kyrie Iesou, a Koine Greek phrase meaning Lord Jesus. \"The pilgrim texts we have from this period that describe what pilgrims did and saw when they came to Cana of Galilee match very closely what we have exposed as the veneration complex,\" he said. Carvings written in Koine Greek point toward the complex being an ancient pilgrimage site.(Pen News) Speaking to Pen News, McCollough also used the work of Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian, to back up his argument. \"His references to Cana align geographically with the location of Khirbet Qana and align logically with his movements,\" he said. ANCIENT CHRISTIAN FIGURINES DISCOVERED IN 1,500-YEAR-OLD DESERT GRAVE \"The reference to Cana in Josephus, the New Testament and in the rabbinic texts would argue the village was a Jewish village, near the Sea of Galilee and in the region of lower Galilee.\" He added, \"Khirbet Qana fulfills all of these criteria.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle McCollough also argued that Kafr Kanna wasn't recognized as a pilgrimage site for Cana until the 18th century, which disputes the Catholic narrative about the site. The new excavations could bolster the case for the historicity of the Bible, said an expert. The findings could \"warrant at least a reconsideration of the historical value of John’s references to Cana and Jesus.\" Khirbet Qana was a Jewish village from 323 B.C. to 324 A.D. before it became a Christian pilgrimage site.(Pen News) \"At this point, the Franciscans were managing Christian pilgrimage and facilitating easy passage rather than historical accuracy,\" he claimed. All in all, McCollough believes his excavations could bolster the case for the historicity of the Bible, and that his findings \"warrant at least a reconsideration ofthe historical valueof John’s references to Cana and Jesus.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Our excavations have shown that this was in fact a thriving Jewish village located in the heart of much of Jesus’ life and ministry,\" he said. McCollough added, \"For the Gospel of John, Cana [was] in some ways Jesus’ safe place or operational center. It is a place he and his disciples return to when they encounter resistance in Judea.\" Archaeologists found a variety of pilgrim artifacts at the site.(Pen News) The most recent research comes as archaeologists across the world work on uncovering sites from the Bible.

(Source: @mijnmivb via Facebook) Tourists exploring a South Carolina island recently stumbled across \"historically significant\" remains, according to local officials. The Colleton County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) announced the discovery in a May 24 press release. The remains were found the day before near the Jeremy Cay gated community, about half a mile from shore. Edisto Island, south of Charleston, is one of several Sea Islands in the Palmetto State. It was first inhabited by Europeans in the 17th century.

A group of tourists (not pictured) who were exploring Edisto Island recently came into contact with historic human remains.(Getty Images; iStock) When officers arrived, they secured the area and handled the incident like a crime scene – but the circumstances of the remains were not exactly suspicious. Rather, authorities said that the beachgoers found a \"historically significant\" site that likely served as a burial ground. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE' \"The location of the discovery [was] once home to the 19th-century settlement known as Edingsville Beach,\" police said. \"Early indications suggest the remains may originate from a long-forgotten burial site.\" Edisto Island, seen here, is one of South Carolina's several Sea Islands.(Getty Images) The Colleton County Coroner's Office arrived to recover the remains, which were then taken to the Medical University of South Carolina, where they are still being identified and studied. \"At this time, the identity of the individual and the circumstances surrounding their death remain unknown,\" the CCSO noted.

Fox News Digital reached out to CCSO for additional information, but no new details were available. The Edingsville Beach settlement was eventually abandoned after suffering a bad hurricane in 1885.(Getty Images) As one of the original Thirteen Colonies, South Carolina is home to many historic sites.

    "title": "Flying car with 620-mile range scheduled for upcoming launch",
    "article_text": "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses. Have you ever wished you could skip the traffic and just fly to your destination in the same vehicle you drove to the airport? That’s exactly what the Klein Vision AirCar is promising. After more than 30 years of development, this flying car is finally about to become a reality for early buyers. Let’s see what sets the AirCar apart, how it actually works and what the future might hold for this ambitious project. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The story ofAirCarbegins in Slovakia, where designer Štefan Klein and his team have been working on flying cars since the late 1980s. After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year. Customer deliveries are planned for early 2026, and the company even has plans for an amphibious version that could land on water. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RADICAL NEW TECH BRINGS FLYING CARS CLOSER TO REALITY So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ORLANDO'S PLAN FOR FLYING CARS TAKES OFF Under the hood, the production AirCar will offer three engine options, all 3.2-liter V6s from South African company Adept Airmotive. The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel. The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it. This means owners will need both driving and flying licenses, along with access to a runway, to fully experience everything the AirCar can do. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) BEST FATHER'S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD The AirCar is expected to cost between $800,000 and $1.2 million, which puts it in the same category as high-end supercars and small private planes. It is geared toward mega-rich business travelers, air taxi operators and anyone who wants to skip traffic and simply fly over it instead. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production. It is also one of the few with four wheels, making it truly road-legal in most places. While other companies have spent hundreds of millions on similar ideas, Klein Vision has achieved this on a much smaller budget. AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Klein Vision isn't stopping with a two-seater. The company is already working on versions with three or four seats, and there's talk of an amphibious model that could land on water. This would open up even more travel possibilities, such as island hopping or reaching remote lakes. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES AirCar (Klein Vision)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) It's wild to think that flying cars have been a daydream for so long, and now the AirCar is right on the verge of making it real. This is a vehicle you could actually see on the road and in the air pretty soon. Sure, you'll need a pilot's license and a pretty big budget, but the fact that something like this is even possible is pretty amazing. Honestly, the idea that we might spot a car rolling up to a runway and then lifting off in just a year or two is kind of crazy.

    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks talks about liberal policies that 'nuked' Southside Chicago into a 'devastating culture of dependency.' After the Civil Rights victories, many folks on theSouth Side of Chicagoexpected things to get better. It was already a solid working class community with a grocery store, a delicatessen, and other small businesses. Instead the liberal policies that came out of the post-60s era nuked us into a devastating culture of dependency.The one thing that always strikes me is that not one new building since the 1960s has been built in my neighborhood. McDonalds left years ago and so did Walgreens. Both structures sit empty. The projects which take up most of my neighborhood have declined precipitously since its days of providing apartments to working-class families. Nobody owns anything. So the gangsters claimed ownership and renamed the projects after their friend who was gunned down: O-Block.That is why I consider it a miracle that I along with my staff at Project H.O.O.D. have been fortunate to start the building of a nearly 100,000-square foot Leadership and Economic Opportunity Center. To see the construction, the cranes, the daily arrival of construction materials, the cement poured and on has been nothing short of amazing. We are not just building a center but a symbol of hope. A BOLD MOVE TO RESCUE CHICAGO'S YOUTH FROM LEFTIST DEPENDENCY I know this might sound clichéd to the more cynical folks, but there is nothing clichéd about hope in my neighborhood. As I mentioned earlier, we have had generations of children born into a world where they know the government as one of their parents. So, by building this center, we are teaching these children that anything is possible and attainable. The blight they were born into does not have to be permanent. They can be the change, just like I decided one day to be. The beauty of this center, once built, is that it will help them develop into intelligent and developed individuals with ambitions for a good career and life. Inside those beams and boars, there will be job training, financial literacy, trauma counseling, trade school, music and arts center, a STEM lab, entrepreneurship accelerators, and aprivate Christian school for boyswho have been written off by the system. PASTOR COREY BROOKS: A SPECIAL SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO SUCCESS STORY By giving the youths in our neighborhood this opportunity, we are creating the possibility that they will one day be able to follow the path of opportunity of their own choosing. To see the construction, the cranes, the daily arrival of construction materials, the cement poured and on has been nothing short of amazing. We are not just building a center but a symbol of hope. But we still have a ways to go when it comes to finishing the building. We have completed 40% of the progress so far. The steel is up, the cables are being wired, the elevator shafts are being built, the walls are forming, and the floors have been installed. The vision is becoming visible. What started as a rooftop dream is now a street-level revolution. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I have already noticed changes in the neighborhood culture.Moms and Dadsbring their young ones to watch the building being constructed. Kids tell me they can’t wait to visit and that they’re going to bring their friends. The older residents tell me they never thought they would see such a sight in their lifetimes. All of them keep asking me when the center will finally open.I tell them soon, as soon as possible. We have received no government handouts for this work and we have been pushing forward to stretch every dollar with faith, grit, and sacrifice. We still have to raise more funds to build this center as a debt-free enterprise so that every dollar we have goes to our kids, the future of America.Not a day goes by when I don’t thank the people of America for their donations. Their generosity made this miracle possible. I also want to thank the team atFox News Mediafor giving me this platform to speak to America — I can never repay them for their generosity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For those of you who are reading this and are wondering if change is still possible in my neighborhood as well as the greater America — I say look at this building. It’s not just steel and concrete. It is proof. It is proof that when people gather around a purpose, poverty can be pushed back,violence can be replacedwith a purpose, and despair can give way to destiny.Wherever you are in America, you can be the change for a better future.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: Trump must stay strong, US reliance on Chinese minerals and drugs puts Americans at risk",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett reports on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s comments on the China threat and Indo-Pacific politics on ‘Fox Report.’ PresidentDonald Trumpblasted China recently on Truth Social, saying Beijing had \"TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\"Trump furiously concluded,\"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\" Apparently, in return for mutual deescalation of trade tensions, Beijing had committed to again allow the free flow of rare earth minerals to the U.S. However, they did not follow through on that promise. No wonder Trump was angry; he should not, however, have been surprised. The White House will try to resolve this issue, and will hopefully again reduce mutual tariffs. The stock market will celebrate a near-term resolution, business managers will exhale, and shoppers won’t hoard Barbies for Christmas. TRUMP WARNS COURT RULING AGAINST TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO 'ECONOMIC RUINATION' OF US But longer term, the Trump White House must commit to eliminating our dependence on China for essential goods, which gives Beijing a stranglehold on our economy. China is an enemy and cannot be trusted.Relying on them for rare earthsor for other critical goods, like pharmaceuticals, is dangerous. The US and Ukraine signed a key rare earth minerals deal earlier in 2025. FILE: Drag-line excavator mines rare earth materials on Ukrainian soil on February 25, 2025, in the Zhytomyr region of Ukraine.(Photo by Kostiantyn Liberov/Libkos/Getty Images) Rare earths are \"essential\"; we need lanthanum and cerium, for instance, to make camera lenses and catalytic converters, respectively. Indeed, we need rare earths to produce everything from cars to missiles to cell phones.Chinaaccounts for about 60% of global mine output as well as 90% of processed materials. Our economy comes to a virtual standstill without these products. The Chinese know this and will take advantage of that reliance. This is one reason that Trump’s proposal of a joint venture with Ukraine is brilliant. If the two countries can together begin to mine and process rare minerals, the U.S. will have a vested interest in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression (while our presence might presumably deter another assault) and the undertaking would also help alleviate our reliance on China. Ukraine is home to 22 of the 34 minerals classified as \"critical\" by the EU; we need them. PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA IS OPEN TO ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH US ON RARE EARTH MINERALS It is not just rare earths and minerals we should be concerned about. Since the COVID-19 emergency, Americans have become increasingly aware that we also depend on China (and to a lesser degree India) for manyessential pharmaceuticals,a reliance which could prove deadly should Beijing choose to block exports. In last year’s first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001. The shortages sent parents searching high and low for amoxicillin and other prescription drugs for themselves and their kids. The Covid pandemic revealed the downside of not being self-sufficient in medical goods, when Beijing chose to withhold vital drugs and personal protective equipment from Americans. One of the most outrageous derelictions ofJoe Biden’spresidency was not addressing that dangerous vulnerability. At the outset of the pandemic,China controlled roughly halfthe global production of products like face masks and ventilators; though they expanded output 12-fold as Covid spread, they stopped exports to the U.S. The United States, for its part, was importing about 90% of the surgical face masks we used, even though we had invented virus-filtering N95 masks and disposable nitrile gloves. UKRAINE SIGNS DEAL TO GIVE US ACCESS TO RARE MINERALS WITH TRUMP ADMIN 'COMMITTED TO A PEACE PROCESS': BESSENT Between January and March 2020, Chinese exports of critical medical goods to the U.S. fell sharply. China apologists argue (wrongly) that the decline stemmed from tariffs placed on such goods during the first Trump administration. Ventilators, oxygen masks and other medical products were not covered by Trump’s tariffs against China; the fall-off was a purposeful decision by Beijing to restrict U.S. supplies. Reacting to critical shortages, with health workers having to reuse masks and wear garbage bags over their heads for protection, U.S. firms stepped up and began producing the necessary protective gear. But, as the emergency waned, China resorted to its usual practices and flooded our market with cheap products, undercutting U.S. manufacturers.

REUTERS/David Gray That’s when the Biden administration should have stepped in to protect U.S. producers; for an administration that exhibited an almost religious zeal for wearing masks, ensuring domestic output (and availability) would seem a layup. They did not. In April 2025, the New York Times reported, \"Few domestic industries have been as devastated by the flood of cheap Chinese imports as manufacturers of face masks, exam gloves and other disposable medical gear that protects healthcare workers from infectious pathogens.\" At the height of the pandemic, some 107 U.S. companies had started up to produce masks and glove; today only five remain. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It was not just PPE that became scarce. In 2020, the New York Times quoted a Chinese health specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations saying, \"Chinese pharmaceutical companies have supplied more than 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone, as well as 70 percent of acetaminophen and 40 to 45 percent of heparin in recent years.\" ONE STATE’S NATURAL RESOURCES CAN FINALLY PUT AN END TO AMERICA’S RELIANCE ON CHINA Congress, alarmed by revelations of U.S. dependence for PPE and pharmaceuticals, did what they do best: ordered up some studies on the issue and demanded better reporting. During Trump’s last year in office, his administration tried to boostdomestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals,but the effort died in the Biden years. In last year’s first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001. This is a fixable problem. If we can devote hundreds of billions of dollars to boosting domestic production of windmills and semiconductors, surely we should be taking similar steps to end our dependence on Chinese-provided drugs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The New York Times revealed the Biden administration’s multi-billion-dollar solution to drug shortages writing, \"TheWhite Houseearlier this month proposed…  linking Medicare payments to hospitals in part on whether hospitals do a good job buying drugs from companies that demonstrate quality over the long term, rather than just the cheapest price.\" That is not a solution. Instead, a solution would entail reducing our dependence on China for essential goods of all kinds and making domestic manufacturing profitable again through lower taxes, new technology like AI and deregulation. These are policies that dominate the Trump agenda, and they will work to make the U.S. independent again.

    "title": "President Trump’s visa policy thwarts China’s spy network on college campuses – and in Congress",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke to former GOP Congresswoman Michelle Steel about a report suggesting Chinese spies have infiltrated Stanford University A suspectedcommunist Chinese spygot so close to Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell in 2015 that the FBI had to step in to shut down the threat. TheChinese communist agentwas a fundraising \"bundler\" for Swalwell’s congressional re-election, had volunteered for numerous Democratic campaigns and facilitated intern assignments in Swalwell’s office. And it all started with a student visa to a California university. President Donald Trump has taken strong and decisive action to aggressively revoke visas of students linked to the Chinese Communist Party.(Fox News) The Fang Fang case exemplifies a disturbing pattern: Chinese communist spies gaining entry and access to policymakers through seemingly innocuous student visas to U.S. colleges and universities. IS TRUMP RESCUING CHINA'S COMMUNISTS? It's a stark reminder of the urgent need for PresidentDonald Trump's strong and decisive action to aggressively revoke visas of students linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \"Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\"Secretary of State Marco Rubioannounced on Wednesday. \"We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong.\" The new visa policy is long overdue. Beijing thinks in centuries, patiently deploying operatives as students for a payoff years later. In July 2020, FBI Director Chris Wray warned, \"China – the Chinese Communist Party – believes it is in a generational fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership.\" TheSwalwell spy affairisn't an isolated incident. \"She was just one of lots of agents,\" a senior U.S. intelligence official said when news of the Swalwell case broke. At that time, the FBI maintained roughly 2,500 active FBI counterintelligence cases related to China. THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH IN U.S.–CHINA TRADE TALKS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST TARIFFS Chinese communist espionage starts on college campuses, where connections are formed with aspiring political leaders. Fang Fang's path, according to the FBI, was a textbook example: enrollment at California State University, East Bay, followed by active participation in student political organizations, even leading campus chapters of the Chinese Student Association and the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs. Chinese Embassy and consulate officials have helped facilitate 124 chapters of Chinese students and scholars associations. It’s through those verycampus organizationsthat the Chinese spy first made contact with Swalwell and other Democratic politicians. \"CSSAs often attempt to conceal or obscure their ties to the Chinese government, frequently omitting incriminating language from the English-language versions of their websites—the ones typically reviewed by university administrators,\" the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission concluded in 2018. In addition to student associations, China has established joint-venture education programs and institutions in the United States. For years, China built an extensive network of Confucius Institutes on college and university campuses in the United States. WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES Marketed as language learning and cultural programs, the Confucius Institutes acted as a vehicle for Chinese government influence in the United States. Confucius Institute staff were forced to pledge loyalty to protect Chinese national interests. After Congress restricted federal funding to schools with institutes, the institutes have almost all closed, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Closed but the espionage continues. Earlier this month, a bombshell report out ofStanford Universityexposed a sophisticated CCP intelligence operation targeting Stanford students, particularly those in sensitive fields like AI and robotics. U.S. colleges and universities aren’t just a \"soft target\" for Chinese Communist espionage. They are, in many cases, compromised institutions. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As of February 2025, U.S. colleges and universities reported more than $4 billion in foreign funding from China. That’s only the disclosed money. Over the past decade, as much as $60 billion in foreign funds have been funneled into American colleges and universities. In 2023, I served on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which warned about the CCP gaining access to research at UC Berkeley through its Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute The Biden administration ignored our concerns that the Chinese government could gain access to sensitive economic, technological and military research. Thankfully, the Trump administration launched an investigation into UC Berkeley this spring for failing to report $220 million in foreign funds from the Chinese government related to Berkeley’s PRC-backed collaboration with Tsinghua University. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After four years of willful ignorance – or gross incompetence – under the Biden administration, President Trump has wasted no time in directing his administration to take the decisive, necessary action to finally thwart the pervasive and growing threat of Chinese communist espionage on U.S. college campuses. The president’s new visa policy is a critical step in securingAmerica’s national security. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FORMER REP.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Why the world should care about Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai",
    "article_text": "Former Congresswoman Michelle Steel outlines the threats China poses in the Yellow Sea amid South Korea's presidential election. On Thursday, May 29, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation awarded an Honorary Bradley Prize to Jimmy Lai, apolitical prisonerof China’s General SecretaryXi Jinpingand the Chinese Communist Party. Lai was a serial entrepreneur who began with nothing and founded and grew major businesses in China before his imprisonment, where his Hong Kong-based media organizations, including Apple News, prospered and where he had become a symbol of free speech in the embattled city. Lai is also the most prominent persecuted Catholic in the world and should be all thatPope Leo XIVneeds to know about Xi and his sinister plans for the church in China. (Leo should exit the ill-advised agreement his predecessor entered into with the Chinese communists, an agreement that is as sacrilegious as it is dangerous to the worldwide church.) WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY: RELEASE MY FATHER JIMMY LAI, WHO PUBLISHED WHAT CHINA'S LEADERS DID NOT WANT TO HEAR Lai believed deeply in the rights of Hong Kong residents guaranteed them when the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997. At that time the United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of China entered into an agreement, known as theSino-British Joint Declaration,in which the PRC committed to the United Kingdom that Hong Kong citizens would retain their high degree of autonomy and the preservation of their capitalist system and way of life for 50 years. Sebastien Lai holds a photo of his father, Jimmy Lai, at the 2025 Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy.(UN Watch) This included the right to a separate executive, legislative and independent judicial system apart from that of Beijing’s, as well as freedoms of assembly, speech and the press. The world canjudge Xi’s credibility by his actionsvis-à-vis Jimmy Lai. The Bradley Foundation awards its prizes to individuals whose work exemplifies the foundation's mission to promote American exceptionalism and the Western tradition. It recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to scholarship, cultural institutions or public policy, often with a focus on conservative or classical liberal themes. The foundation’s decision to highlight theplight of Jimmy Laiwas an honorable and important step in bringing attention to his captivity in solitary confinement and under harsh conditions. TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT TARGETS CHINA INFLUENCE, KICKS OUT PRO-BEIJING AGITATORS AMID RISING TENSIONS Xi now faces a dilemma. He rightly must conclude that Lai’s case is soaring in the attention it receives around the world and that harsh judgments of Xi by the world’s leaders and its businesses follow attention to the case. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Xi ought also to fear what the martyrdom of Lai would mean in the longer term for China. Who wants to invest in, much less visit, a country so cruel as to imprison a 77-year-old and increasingly frail man of faith? Did Xi learn nothing from the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was preceded by the world’s attention on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, Natan Sharansky and Vladimir Bukovsky? High-profile dissidents are largely forgotten once they are exiled from their countries. The United Kingdom would accept Lai if Xi expelled him, but Xi’s reputation for ruthlessness only increases and thus the world’s wariness only climbs the longer Lai remains imprisoned. MARCO RUBIO TO CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER: TRUMP WILL PUT 'AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST' IN US-CHINA RELATIONS President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have already linked their legacies to the freeing of Lai, and Pope Leo’s is now inextricably connected to the heroic witness for the faith that Lai is living. We can pray the Bradley Foundation has provided the spark the world needed to focus on Lai. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"As you can see, I am not Jimmy Lai,\" Jimmy Lai’s son Sebastian said on accepting the Bradley Prize in his father’s place on May 29. \"Instead of being here with you wonderful people, accepting this prestigious award, my father sits in a maximum-security jail inHong Kongas a high-risk category a prisoner. He’s in jail in Hong Kong for the same reason he is being celebrated here, for courage in the face of oppression.\" We should hope everyone in the world doing business with China realizes they are complicit in theharsh imprisonment of Jimmy Lai.They have the ability to appeal to Xi to #FreeJimmyLai as the hashtag puts it.

A week ago, Anthropic quietly launchedClaude Explains, a new page on its website that’s generated mostly by the company’s AI model family, Claude. Populated by posts on technical topics related to various Claude use cases (e.g. “Simplify complex codebases with Claude”), the blog is intended to be a showcase of sorts for Claude’s writing abilities. It’s not clear just how much of Claude’s raw writing is making its way into Claude Explains posts. According to a spokesperson, the blog is overseen by Anthropic’s “subject matter experts and editorial teams,” who “enhance” Claude’s drafts with “insights, practical examples, and […] contextual knowledge.” “This isn’t just vanilla Claude output — the editorial process requires human expertise and goes through iterations,” the spokesperson said. “From a technical perspective, Claude Explains shows a collaborative approach where Claude [creates] educational content, and our team reviews, refines, and enhances it.” None of this is obvious from Claude Explains’ homepage, which bears the description, “Welcome to the small corner of the Anthropic universe where Claude is writing on every topic under the sun.” One might be easily misled into thinking that Claude is responsible for the blog’s copy end-to-end. Anthropic says it sees Claude Explains as a “demonstration of how human expertise and AI capabilities can work together,” starting with educational resources. “Claude Explains is an early example of how teams can use AI to augment their work and provide greater value to their users,” the spokesperson said. “Rather than replacing human expertise, we’re showing how AI can amplify what subject matter experts can accomplish […] We plan to cover topics ranging from creative writing to data analysis to business strategy.” Anthropic’s experiment with AI-generated copy, which comes just a few months after rival OpenAI said it had developed a modeltailored for creative writing, is far from the first to be articulated. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to develop an end-to-end AI ad tool, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recentlypredictedthat AI could someday handle “95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today.” Elsewhere, publishers have piloted AI newswriting tools in a bid to boost productivity and, in some cases, reduce hiring needs. Gannett has beenespecially aggressive, rolling out AI-generated sports recaps and summaries beneath headlines. Bloomberg added AI-generated summaries to the tops of articles in April. And Business Insider, which laid off 21% of its staff last week, haspushedfor writers to turn to assistive AI tools. Even legacy outlets are investing in AI, or at least making vague overtures that they might. The New York Times isreportedly encouraging staffto use AI to suggest edits, headlines, and even questions to ask during interviews, while The Washington Post issaid to be developingan “AI-powered story editor” called Ember. Yet many of these efforts haven’t gone well, largely because AI today is prone to confidently making things up. Business Insider was forced to apologize to staff after recommending books that don’t appear to exist but instead may have been generated by AI,according to Semafor.Bloomberg has had tocorrect dozensof AI-generated summaries of articles. G/O Media’s error-riddled AI-written features, published against editors’ wishes,attracted widespread ridicule. The Anthropic spokesperson noted that the company is still hiring across marketing, content, and editorial, and “many other fields that involve writing,” despite the company’s dip into AI-powered blog drafting.

Ripplingsued Deel in Marchafter a Rippling employee testified in an Irish court that he was spying on his employer for the rivalin an affidavit that reads like a Hollywood movie.Rippling’s lawsuit alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference, unfair competition, and more, largely based on the spying allegations. Deel hassince countersued, attempting to get the suit dismissed for technical reasons, but also making its own allegations, like that Rippling has also been spying. This amended complaint offers more details on what Deel means by that. Specifically, it alleges that one of Rippling’s employees, who holds the job title of Competitive Intelligence, “spent six months impersonating a legitimate Deel customer to gain unauthorized access to Deel’s systems to meticulously analyze, record, and copy Deel’s global products and the way Deel does business for Rippling’s own benefit and use.” The lawsuit is also full of insults hurled at Rippling’s CEO, Parker Conrad, and mentions his troubles at his previous company, Zenefits. At times, the complaint ventures into psychoanalysis territory. “To understand Conrad is to understand Rippling,” the suit claims. It then goes on to speculate that Rippling has targeted Deel because Conrad is angry at Zenefits’ VC backer, Andreessen Horowitz: “Sadly, it is now apparent that Conrad has made it his life’s goal to exact misguided and petty revenge on those connected with Andreessen, including Deel, in which Andreessen owns a 20% share.” And the complaint alleges that “Rippling has planted false and misleading claims about Deel in the press and with regulators across the country.” This appears to stem from 2023, when U.S. SenatorAdam Schiff posted a public letterasking the U.S. Department of Labor to look into how Deel was classifying workers. This after Business Insiderpublishedan investigation on the matter. Deeldenied wrongdoingat the time and said a discussion with Schiff put the matter to bed. The amended complaint also provides at least one financial tidbit; Deel says it has been profitable for years and is generating over $1 billion in annual revenue. A spokesperson for Rippling says that the company is looking into the specific allegations of how the employee gathered product intelligence as described in the complaint. The spokesperson tells us that “Rippling is unwavering in our commitment to fair competition and the highest ethical standards. We expect full compliance as described clearly in our written policies.” The spokesperson also alleges that the revised complaint “backtracks” from some of the assertions in the original, including removing wording that implied Rippling had somehow obtained access to Deel’s board-level information. While the lawsuit is an entertaining read (here’sa link to it), about the level of a typical Bravo network reality TV show, Deel appears to be attempting to make a tit-for-tat case about corporate spying. But the two sets of allegations are not about the same thing. Rippling is accusing Deel of paying an employee to gather information from Rippling’s internal network. The employee, who confessed to spying, has testified that he gave Deel information that included sales leads, product roadmaps, customer accounts, names of superstar employees, and whatever else was asked for. Deel is accusing Rippling of unfairly learning about its product and features from the product itself as well as the information it gives to its customers. Competitors have been buying each other’s products as a way to keep tabs, one-up, and sell against each other since the beginning of time. So it will be interesting to see how the courts handle Deel’s lawsuit — if they rule that such tactics can go too far. In the meantime, Rippling’s alleged catching of the corporate spy — which involved a trap, a smashed phone, and a honeypot — has already slipped into the tech industry’s cultural lexicon. When Y Combinator grad Cotool launched an agentic security platform last month that, among other things, sets up honeypots, itsad was a spoof on how Rippling’scorporate spy said he was caught.

TAE Technologies said this week it raised another $150 million in a funding round that included investments from existing backers Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise associates. By the nearly 30-year-old company’s counting, it’s TAE’s 12th round of investment. To date, it has raised about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook, making it one of thehighest funded fusion companies. TAE, formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy, worked for years in stealth developing its reactor design. The company initially used a process that started by firing two plasma balls at each other and then spinning the resulting blob with particle beams. The plasma blob — which looks like a hollow cigar — generates its own magnetic field, working alongside the reactor’s magnets to keep the plasma contained. In April, the companyannouncedit no longer needed to fire two plasma balls to kick off a reaction. Instead, it was able to form a plasma, heat it, and stabilize it using the particle beams alone. Eliminating that equipment makes the reactor smaller, cheaper, and easier to operate, TAE said. Google has participated in two rounds of investment in TAE; the previous $250 million round closed in 2022. The tech company has been working with TAE for longer. Since 2014, Google computer scientists have worked with engineers at TAE to use machine learning (a form of AI) to find the ideal settings for a fusion device. Before AI, the optimization process used to take two months — “about 1,000 experiments,” TAE CEO Michl Binderbauertold me in 2022. AI cut that down significantly, reducing the number of experiments by two orders of magnitude, which could be completed in a few hours. Today, TAE’s reactor can create plasmas heated to 70 million degrees Celsius. For its commercial device, the company says it needs to heat plasmas to 1 billion degrees Celsius. Binderbauer toldAxiosthat he is aiming to raise another $50 million before the round closes later this summer. The company is hoping to put electrons on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.

In November 2023, Sam Altman was dismissed from the AI company and resigned from both his position as CEO and his role on the board. The rationale was that the board no longer trusted Altman to lead effectively. However, just five days later, after numerous discussions and negotiations, an agreement was reached, resulting in Altman’s reinstatement. No matter who is cast in this movie, it’ll be fascinating to see how “Artificial” portrays the drama and what the overall reception will be among general audiences, especially considering the increasing prevalence of AI tools like ChatGPT.

Qualcomm cited Google’s Threat Analysis Group, or TAG, which investigates government-backed cyberattacks, saying the three flaws “may be under limited, targeted exploitation.” According to the company’s bulletin, Google’s Android security team reported the three zero-days (CVE-2025-21479, CVE-2025-21480, and CVE-2025-27038) to Qualcomm in February. Zero-days are security vulnerabilities that are not known to the software or hardware maker at the time of their discovery, making themextremely valuablefor cybercriminals and government hackers. Because of Android’s open source and distributed nature, it’s now up to device manufacturers to apply the patches provided by Qualcomm, which means some devices may still be vulnerable for several more weeks, despite the fact that there are patches available.

Qualcomm said in the bulletin that the patches “have been made available to [device makers] in May together with a strong recommendation to deploy the update on affected devices as soon as possible.” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez told TechCrunch that the company’s Pixel devices are not affected by these Qualcomm vulnerabilities. Kimberly Samra, a spokesperson for Google’s TAG did not immediately provide more information about these vulnerabilities, and the circumstances in which TAG found them. Qualcomm acknowledged the fixes. “We encourage end users to apply security updates as they become available from device makers,” said company spokesperson Dave Schefcik. Chipsets found in mobile devices are frequent targets for hackers and zero-day exploit developers because chips generally have wide access to the rest of the operating system, which means hackers can jump from there to other parts of the device that may hold sensitive data. In the last few months, there have been documented cases of exploitation against Qualcomm chipsets.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ben Lamm, the billionaire founder of Colossal Labs, and Sophie Turner spoke about his company’s efforts inreviving the long-extinct dire wolfduring a panel at SXSW’s first London outpost. The wolf re-entered the public consciousness because of the television show “Game of Thrones,” in which Turner was a leading character. It turns out that even she thought dire wolves were mythical creatures. “Were you a fan of ‘Game of Thrones?’” Turner asked. “I was a fan of ‘Game of Thrones,’” Lamm said. “When ‘Game of Thrones’ came out, which was a while ago, I never thought, ‘Oh, by the way, one day we’ll make dragons or dire wolves.” Lamm retold the story of how he and his team at Colossal “brought back” the dire wolf species, which had been extinct for more than 10,000 years. He also provided some updates as to what the company is working on next, including a bio-acoustic project,announced just a few weeks ago. Lamm said his dire wolves started howling at 3 weeks old, responding to human singing and the sounds of owls. The first two, Romulus and Remus, are now around 6 months old. Lamm and his team are looking at ways to use AI to help monitor the behavior of the wolves, identifying patterns of their emotions and “wolf linguistics,” as he put it. “What’s crazy about it is the dire wolves have their own unique pitch and inflection,” Lamm told the crowd. “We’re going to release that later this year,” he said, referring to a bio-acoustic project, which will map out the different types of dire wolf howls. The wolves live on a 2,000-acre preservation in a top-secret location. He referred to the park as “very Yellowstone.” It has an animal hospital, as well as full-time caretakers and full-time security. The wolves are learning socialization tactics that would help them in the wild. “They’re starting to do some light predation on the preserve,” he said. “They’re becoming more and more true wolf-like every day.” He also said that they are about to officially introduce the two wolves to a newly created dire wolf, a female named Khaleesi, who is around 3 months old. The public met Colossal Labs’ efforts to “de-extinct” animals with fascination and skepticism, much of it focused on whether the dire wolves aremerely genetically editedgray wolves. But investors seem quite interested in where Colossal could be headed with its innovation.TechCrunch reportedback in March that the company is looking to “revive” the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo, two other extinct animals. The company announced this year a$200 million Series Cat a $10.2 billion valuation and said in March itgenetically modified miceto grow mammoth-like fur. (Lamm said it impressively took only a month to do.) Turner did ask Lamm a question that he unsurprisingly gets quite often. “What about dinosaurs?” she asked. “Can you bring them back?” His company isn’t focused on that at the moment, as bringing a dinosaur back is quite complicated, Lamm explained. But later in the conversation, he said there might be a new update coming from Colossal soon. “I think maybe this summer, there could be a dodo update that’s interesting,” he said. Update: This story was updated to provide clarity about the skepticism around Colossal’s dire wolf program.Colossal Labs says a link included in this report is inaccurate. “We are in an issue with them because they misquoted Beth Shapiro,” spokesperson Emily Mailaender wrote in an email. “She never said they weren’t dire wolves. We have been working to get it corrected.”TechCrunch will remove the link if the media outlet retracts its story.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Dating apps have developed a bad reputation lately. People ghost others, which means they simply stop responding to someone they once shared frequent correspondence with. There appear to be slim pickings, despite living in big cities like New York. And did we mention a lot of these apps now costmoney? At the inaugural SXSW London, TechCrunch caught up with Jackie Jantos, the CMO and president of Hinge, to talk about how the company is marketing itself to a new generation in what has become a listless dating scene. “This is a generation that has grown up with a deep understanding of how digital experiences are created and what they are trying to get out of them,” Jantos said in an interview with TechCrunch. She listed the traits Gen Zers want most out of their brands, like transparency and authenticity. It’s a diverse generation that spends less time in person than its predecessors. “If you’re not building with inclusion at the center of everything, you’re just not going to build a meaningful product or marketing activation to engage them,” she said. The dating app landscape has evolved over the past few years, seeing companies like Hinge working overtime to try to attract and sustain user attention. Tinder, for example, has struggledwith growthin the past few years, culminating in its CEO stepping down a few weeks ago. Bumbleis also seeinga slowdown in user growth. Hinge and Tinder are both owned by Match Group. The Q1 2025 report released by Match Group shows that Hinge is faring a bit better than its sister company. Thereport showedthat Hinge saw an increase in direct revenue, compared to Tinder, and that the app’s downloads were “strong” across the English-speaking and Western European markets. Jantos said Hinge is implementing and toying around with numerous new features at the moment. For example, it has added a quota on how many chats one person can have at one time so that a user isn’t simply “collecting chats.” “We want to encourage people to close out chats if you’re not interested in someone,” Jantos said, adding that hopefully this encourages people to focus on a smaller number of conversations that can successfully move toward a date. She said Hinge is testing its coaching feature, which looks to give users tips about building their profiles. The Match Group Q1 2025 report said Hinge was also looking to introduce Warm Introductions soon to “highlight shared interests to improve match quality.” Jantos was coy on details, but said there was a new introduction that would hopefully encourage users to “spend a little more time discovering each profile.” “Our recommendations have gotten really strong with the new AI recommender that we recently released,” she added. (Match Group’sQ1 2025 news reportsaid the new feature, launched in March, has already driven a 15% increase in matches and contact exchanges.) Jantos said that Hinge is also hoping to boost its safety features with AI and that overall, tools on the app will “continuously improve because of AI.” “But also new tools will come along the way to coach you along the [dating] journey,” she said. Jantos flew into the inaugural SXSW London to give a talk about the loneliness epidemic impacting Gen Zers. There is no shortage of stories and reports on how young people are connecting less with the outside world, glued to their phones and virtual realities. Jantos told TechCrunch this is one reason Hinge launched its One More Hour fund in 2023. The fund seeks to invest $1 million into organizations tofoster more in-personconnections among Gen Zers. She’s heard feedback from young people on her team that there are barriers to hanging out these days, including how expensive it has become and finding places that feel safe. “We want to lower the barrier so people just want to come out because we know if they build that skill, it’s more likely when they’re on our product, they’ll be more likely to be comfortable meeting someone up for a date,” she said. And, as expected, Hinge is throwing events, filling ads with creators, such as writers, to “meet the audience where they are.” It created azineand campaign about Hinge success stories to hopefully inspire Gen Zers to go find love.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Reddit on Tuesdayannounceda new feature that will offer its users more privacy when it comes to what’s shared on their user profiles. The company says it’s rolling out an update that will introduce a “Content and Activity” setting that allows users to decide which content from the subreddits they participate in will appear on their profiles. This includes both their posting and commenting history. By default, all posts and comments will remain visible, as before. However, the new setting allows users to hide all their public posts and comments, including those made directly on their profiles. Alternately, users can decide to selectively display posts and comments from specific communities on their profile, while keeping others hidden. The setting is available under a new “Curate your profile” section, where users can control their content’s visibility. An option to toggle on or off NSFW content and activity is also available, as is a Followers toggle to show or hide follower count. The update adds a layer of privacy to Reddit that wasn’t available before. Previously, many Reddit users created “throwaway” accounts when they wanted to ask more personal questions. But as Reddit morphs into more of anad-focused tech companypost-IPO, it likely prefers that user data — like engagement and interests — remains associated with a single user profile for better ad targeting. The feature’s addition could also encourage users to participate more on the site, as they’ll now know that they can somewhat obscure their activity from public view. For example, users may want to chime in or ask questions about a topic of a more sensitive nature, like relationship or dating advice, or a health issue they’re facing. Before, they may have chosen to just read through others’ posts but not engage directly in order to keep the information from displaying on their own user profiles. Reddit says that the option to hide or display posts and comments is available only on a per-community basis, not at the individual post or comment level. That makes the settings easier to manage, even if it means you can’t pick and choose which specific comments and posts show up and which don’t. Still, users should know that the curation option doesn’t mean they have true privacy. Their username will still appear next to their posts and comments in the communities themselves. Plus, some moderators will still have access to a user’s public post and comment history for 28 days, regardless of the user’s content visibility settings, Reddit says. This access is helpful to moderators who may need to review a user’s history when they post or comment, as well as when they send “modmail,” like join requests, or requests to join a restricted community. Profile owners will also be able to temporarily see a user’s full post and comment history if another user comments directly on their profile post, the company notes. Alongside this change, Reddit introduced updated personal activity summaries, which provide an overview of a user’s activity, including their Karma count, total contributions, account age, and active communities. The latter will be based on their Content and activity settings. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The social media company will buy all the “clean energy attributes” of Constellation Energy’s Clinton Clean Energy Center, a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in central Illinois, starting in June 2027. Electricity will still flow to the local grid, so Meta’s purchase won’t directly power one of its data centers, though the company does have one about two hours north of Clinton in DeKalb. Rather, the deal is a bit of carbon accounting to lower the company’s overall climate impact. It doesn’t reduce emissions on the grid, but prevents them from potentially increasing. Neither company disclosed exact financial terms, but the multibillion-dollar deal will help Constellation relicense the plant and guarantee a customer for the duration of that license extension. Big Tech companies — Meta included — have recently become vocal backers of the fission industry. Before the recent boom in data center construction, nuclear reactors had faced a grim future as cheap wind, solar, and natural gas undercut their power-generating costs. But the surge in AI and cloud computing has sent tech companies searching for power, which in turn has led to astring of investmentsin nuclear startups. Meta and Constellation have alluded to the deal as a way to save the nuclear power plant from shutdown, though neither said it was at imminent risk of closure. The power provider initially planned to shut down the Clinton reactor inJune 2017as it faced stiff competition from cheap natural gas, but Illinois legislators stepped inwith subsidiesthat encouraged Constellation to keep the lights on. Those subsidies are set to expire in 2027, and Constellation says the Meta deal will help prevent the closure. But since 2017, Constellation has not threatened to shut down the Clinton power plant. Instead, in 2022, the companysaidit would apply to extend the reactor’s operating license through 2047. TechCrunch has asked Constellation about its plans for the Clinton power plant before the Meta deal materialized, and we’ll update this article if we receive a reply. It’s likely that the company would have turned to ratepayers, something Constellation hints at in today’spress release: The deal with Meta “essentially replaces the ZEC [zero-emission credit] program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support.” Meta and its Big Tech peers have fallen head over heels for nuclear power lately. Meta announced earlier this year that it wassoliciting proposals for new nuclear power plantsthat would generate between 1 and 4 gigawatts of power. Today, the company said it has received over 50 qualified submissions for sites in more than 20 states. With the Meta deal, Constellation has landed another Big Tech patron for its nuclear fleet. In September, the power provider said that it wouldrestart a reactorat Three Mile Island after Microsoft agreed to buy all the resulting power. Topics Senior Reporter, Climate Think you know AI?

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Last week, Chinese lab DeepSeek released anupdated version of its R1 reasoning AI modelthat performs well on a number of math and coding benchmarks. The company didn’t reveal the source of the data it used to train the model, but some AI researchers speculate that at least a portion came from Google’s Gemini family of AI. Sam Paech, a Melbourne-based developer who creates “emotional intelligence” evaluations for AI, published what he claims is evidence that DeepSeek’s latest model was trained on outputs from Gemini. DeepSeek’s model, called R1-0528, prefers words and expressions similar to those that Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro favors, said Paech in anX post. If you're wondering why new deepseek r1 sounds a bit different, I think they probably switched from training on synthetic openai to synthetic gemini outputs.pic.twitter.com/Oex9roapNv That’s not a smoking gun. But another developer, the pseudonymous creator of a “free speech eval” for AI calledSpeechMap, noted the DeepSeek model’s traces — the “thoughts” the model generates as it works toward a conclusion — “read like Gemini traces.” DeepSeek has been accused of training on data from rival AI models before. In December, developersobservedthat DeepSeek’s V3 model often identified itself as ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, suggesting that it may’ve been trained on ChatGPT chat logs. Earlier this year,OpenAI told the Financial Timesit found evidence linking DeepSeek to the use of distillation, a technique to train AI models by extracting data from bigger, more capable ones.According to Bloomberg, Microsoft, a close OpenAI collaborator and investor, detected that large amounts of data were being exfiltrated through OpenAI developer accounts in late 2024 — accounts OpenAI believes are affiliated with DeepSeek. Distillation isn’t an uncommon practice, but OpenAI’s terms of service prohibit customers from using the company’s model outputs to build competing AI. To be clear, many modelsmisidentifythemselvesand converge on the same words and turns of phrases. That’s because the open web, which is where AI companies source the bulk of their training data, is becominglitteredwith AIslop. Content farms are using AI to createclickbait, and bots are flooding Reddit andX. This “contamination,” if you will, has made itquite difficultto thoroughly filter AI outputs from training datasets. Still, AI experts like Nathan Lambert, a researcher at the nonprofit AI research institute AI2, don’t think it’s out of the question that DeepSeek trained on data from Google’s Gemini. “If I was DeepSeek, I would definitely create a ton of synthetic data from the best API model out there,” Lambertwrotein a post on X. “[DeepSeek is] short on GPUs and flush with cash. It’s literally effectively more compute for them.” If I was DeepSeek I would definitely create a ton of synthetic data from the best API model out there. Theyre short on GPUs and flush with cash. It’s literally effectively more compute for them. yes on the Gemini distill question. Partly in an effort to prevent distillation, AI companies have been ramping up security measures. In April, OpenAI beganrequiringorganizations to complete an ID verification process in order to access certain advanced models. The process requires a government-issued ID from one of the countries supported by OpenAI’s API; China isn’t on the list. Elsewhere, Google recently began “summarizing” the traces generated by models available through its AI Studio developer platform, a step that makes it more challenging to train performant rival models on Gemini traces. Anthropic in May said it wouldstart to summarizeits own model’s traces, citing a need to protect its “competitive advantages.” We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this piece if we hear back.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Indian grocery delivery startupKiranaProhas been hacked and all its data has been wiped, the company’s founder confirmed to TechCrunch. The destroyed data included the company’s app code and its servers containing banks of sensitive customer information, including their names, mailing addresses, and payment details, KiranaPro co-founder and CEO Deepak Ravindran told TechCrunch. The company’s app is online but cannot process orders, TechCrunch has found. Launched in December 2024, KiranaPro operates as a buyer app on theIndian government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce, allowing customers to purchase groceries from their local shops and nearby supermarkets. KiranaPro has 55,000 customers, with 30,000-35,000 active buyers across 50 cities, who collectively place 2,000 orders daily, according to the company. Unlike a typical grocery delivery app, KiranaPro offers a voice-based interface that allows users to place orders from local shops using voice commands in languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and English. The startup planned to expand to 100 cities in the next 100 days before the incident happened, Ravindran said. On May 26, KiranaPro executives became aware of the incident while logging into their Amazon Web Services account. Hackers gained access to KiranaPro’s root accounts on AWS and GitHub, Ravindran told TechCrunch. Ravindran shared a couple of screenshots of the GitHub security logs and a file containing a sample of activity logs around the time of the incident, suggesting that the hacking happened after someone gained access to their systems via a former employee’s account. KiranaPro’s chief technology officer Saurav Kumar told TechCrunch that the hack happened around May 24-25. The startup said it used Google Authenticator for multi-factor authentication on its AWS account. Kumar told TechCrunch that the multi-factor code had changed when they tried to log into their AWS account last week, and all their Electric Compute Cloud (EC2) services, which let clients access virtual computers to run their applications, were deleted. “We can only log in through the IAM [Identity and Access Management] account, through which we can see that the EC2 instances don’t exist anymore, but we are not able to get any logs or anything because we don’t have the root account,” he said. KiranaPro has reached out to GitHub’s support team to help identify the hacker’s IP addresses and other traces of the incident, said Ravindran. Similarly, Ravindran told TechCrunch that the startup is filing cases against its former employees, who he said had not submitted their credentials for accessing their GitHub accounts to check their logs. It is unclear how the attack happened. Some of the biggest cyberattacks in recent years, such asLastPass,Change Healthcare, andSnowflake, were caused by credential theft, such as throughpassword-stealing malwareinstalled on an employee’s laptop, and missing or unenforced multi-factor authentication. The companies were ultimately responsible for enforcing the security of their own systems, including whether their employees must use multi-factor authentication, and terminating accounts of former employees who no longer work at their company. KiranaPro counts Blume Ventures, Unpopular Ventures, and Turbostart among its institutional venture backers, as well as Olympic medalist PV Sindhu and BCG MD Vikas Taneja among its angel investors. The company has a team of 15 employees located in Bengaluru and Kerala. Topics Reporter Think you know AI? Prove it.

Here’s a roundup ofthe most notable features rumored to be coming to iOS 19. Sources told Bloomberg thatApple plans to rename its operating systemsto reflect the release year rather than using version numbers. This means that iOS 19 will be renamed iOS 26, similar to how car model years are designated. This name change will also apply to other software updates, such as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Anticipated to be the most significant design change since iOS 7, the operating system may feature a complete visual overhaul, one that’s reportedlyinspired byApple’s Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. This could include translucent panels for navigation and circular app icons. The visionOS-inspired design will be made across Apple’s entire ecosystem with the goal of creating a more cohesive experience. Apple is alsorumoredto be releasing agaming appthat will integrate Apple Arcade and the App Store’s game offerings, featuring a central hub for achievements, leaderboards, and App Store content. This comes after the companyacquired its first game studio, RAC7, according to DigitalTrends. Apple may also be developing an AI feature to serve as apersonal health coach. This new chatbot is expected to suggest lifestyle changes and provide health advice based on user data collected from the Health app. Additionally, the Health app may be revamped to include a food-tracking feature, allowing users to log their carbohydrate and caffeine intake. Apple could improve iPhone battery health withAI-powered battery management.This new feature is reported to analyze device usage and make adjustments to conserve battery life. There may also be a new charging icon on the lock screen that gives an estimated time for when it’s fully charged. Another rumor suggests thatreverse wireless chargingis being tested on the iPhone 17 Pro models, allowing users to charge accessories such as AirPods or the Apple Watch directly from their iPhone. One notable absence from all the rumors is the impressiveSiri capabilitieshighlighted in Apple’s 2024 presentation, which featured a more context-aware assistant that can gather information and perform actions across different apps. The companystatedin March that the new features are delayed. While we can expect some AI-related announcements, the primary focus is likely to be on design changes. Reports indicate that improvements to existing Apple Intelligence features will also be introduced, along with some new additions. Topics Think you know AI? Prove it.

    "title": "UK temporarily spared from Trump's 50% metal tariffs",
    "article_text": "The UK has been temporarily spared from US President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminium tariffs from 25% to 50%. The order signed by Trump on Tuesday evening raises import taxes for US-based firms buying from other countries from Wednesday - but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. The order depends onthe UK and US tariff pact signed in May, which would axe steel and aluminium tariffs but has yet to come into force, meaning UK steel exporters will face tariffs until then and could face the 50% tariff if the pact falters. The UK government said it is \"committed to protecting British business and jobs\", but the Conservatives said the order was a \"fresh tariff blow\". The UK government spokesperson added that it will \"continue to work with the US to implement our agreement, which will see the [tariffs] removed\", with the legislation implementing the deal to be presented in Parliament \"in due course\". Trump said in the order that the UK needed \"different treatment\" because of the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed on 8 May 2025. However, Trump later added that the US might increase the tariff on the UK \"on or after July 9 2025\" if it \"determines that the United Kingdom has not complied with relevant aspects of the EPD\". The UK's carve-out in the executive order comes after Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Paris on Tuesday. The US is the destination for about 7% of UK steel exports, meaning any tariffs have a big impact on the industry. Director general of UK Steel Gareth Stace said the UK's exemption from the 50% tariff was \"a welcome pause\", but added that \"uncertainty remains over timings and final tariff rates, and now US customers will be dubious over whether they should even risk making UK orders\". \"The US and UK must urgently turn the May deal into reality to remove the tariffs completely,\" he said. Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"Labour's botched negotiations have left businesses in limbo and this country simply cannot afford their continuing failure.\" The Navy is also considering renaming ships named after Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman. Billionaire says the bill, which faces a key test in the Senate, undercuts efforts to slash federal spending. The policy group lowers its UK economy forecast due to trade barriers and Britain's \"very thin\" financial buffer. The company says existing orders will be fulfilled before the closure of the site in spring 2026. Jacinda Ardern says she didn't like being called the 'anti-Trump'",

    "title": "IDF says roads to Gaza aid centres are 'combat zones' as sites close for day",
    "article_text": "Aid distribution centres in Gaza will be closed for a day on Wednesday, as the Israeli military warned roads leading to the sites will be considered \"combat zones\". The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial US and Israel-backed aid network which began operating last week, said it was closing its sites for \"update, organization and efficiency improvements works\". In a separate update, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said people would be \"prohibited\" from entering the distribution centres or travelling on roads leading to them. Early on Tuesday,at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fireclose to a distribution centre, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency. It was the third deadly incidentin as many days to occur on a route to a GHF site. The IDF said its troops fired shots after identifying suspects who moved towards them \"deviating from the designated access routes\". In the wake of Tuesday's incident, the director of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Atef Al-Hout, said the injured were arriving with gunshot wounds after Israeli forces had opened fire on \"crowds of civilians waiting for aid in western Rafa\". Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency spokesman Mahmoud Basal said civilians were fired upon by tanks, quadcopter drones and helicopters near an aid site. A foreign medic working in the area described the scene as \"total carnage\" and said they had been inundated with casualties. In a statement, the IDF said its troops were \"not preventing the arrival of Gazan civilians to the humanitarian aid distribution sites.\" GHF said it would start distributing aid again on Thursday. A spokesperson for the aid group said it had asked Israeli military to \"guide foot traffic\" near military boundaries to reduce \"confusion or escalation\" risks, according to Reuters news agency. GHF added it was also working to develop clearer guidance for civilians and enhance training to support their safety. \"Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid.\" UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an \"immediate and independent\" investigation into the events. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Guterres, told the BBC the closure of aid centres showed \"a lack of clarity of who the GHF is\" and a \"lack of accountability\". \"We're seeing armed men around these distribution points. No one knows who they are, who they're accountable for,\" he said. It comes as the UN warns that more than two million peopleare at risk of starvationin Gaza, after a total Israeli ban on shipments of food and other aid that lasted 11 weeks. The GHF aims to replace the UN-led aid distribution network in Gaza, following repeated claims from Israel that the UN did not prevent supplies being hijacked by Hamas, which the UN denies. Under the new distribution system, Gazans are required to collect supplies from a small number of centres in areas under Israeli military control and staffed by armed American contractors. Critics say the model has left people needing to walk long distances to the sites and transport boxes weighing 20kg back to their homes or shelters. Dujarric described the GHF as \"a demonstration of how not to do humanitarian aid\" as it \"puts people's lives at risk\" by forcing them to make long trips to get food in a militarised zone. He called the strategy \"unacceptable\" and echoed the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, who said aid distribution had \"become a death trap\". The UN and other humanitarian organisations have accused the GHF of failing to uphold humanitarian principles. Also on Tuesday, Reverend Dr Johnnie Moore - a Christian evangelical pastor and prominent supporter of US President Donald Trump - was announced as the new head of GHF. He was appointed to replace its first chief Jake Wood, aformer US marine who stood down and criticised the GHF model. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 54,470 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,201 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the territory's health ministry. A recent spate of attacks targeting Jewish people and institutions has led to calls for heightened security The BBC’s Anna Foster hosts a debate to discuss whether there have been war crimes in Israel and Gaza. BBC Verify examines three deadly incidents which left dozens dead near a controversial aid site in Gaza. Civilians were fired at by tanks, drones and helicopters, civil defence officials say, while Israel says only that troops fired towards several suspects. Twelve people were injured when a man allegedly attacked an event supporting Israeli hostages with Molotov cocktails",

    "title": "Musk calls Trump's tax bill a 'disgusting abomination'",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has hit out at President Donald Trump's signature tax and spending bill, describing it as a \"disgusting abomination\", in a widening rift between the two allies. The budget - which includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and more defence spending while also allowing the US government to borrow more money - was passed by the House of Representatives last month. \"Shame on those who voted for it,\" Musk said in a post on X about the legislative linchpin of Trump's second-term agenda. The tech billionaire left the administration abruptly last week after 129 days working to cut costs with his team, known as Doge. The comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government,after having previously called the plan \"disappointing\". The South African-born tech billionaire's time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that \"he will, always, be with us, helping all the way\". In its current form, the bill - which Trump refers to as the \"big beautiful bill\" - has been estimated to increase the budget deficit - the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it receives - by about $600bn (£444bn) in the next fiscal year. In a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the \"outrageous, pork-filled\" spending bill will \"massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America [sic] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt\". In American politics \"pork\" refers to spending on projects in lawmakers' constituencies. Musk, who had previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican that votes against Trump's agenda, added a political warning in another post. \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\" he wrote. Asked about Musk's comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"the President already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill\". \"This is one, big, beautiful bill,\" she added. \"And he's sticking to it.\" The legislation also pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration in 2017, as well as an influx of funds for defence spending and to fund the administration's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. To the dismay of fiscal conservatives, it would lift the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow, known as the debt ceiling, to $4tn. The comments from Musk reflect wider tensions among Republicans over the plan, which faced stiff opposition from different wings of the party as it worked its way through the House. The Senate has now taken it up, and divisions are already emerging in that chamber, which is also narrowly controlled by Republicans. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has said over the last few days he will not support the bill if it raises the debt ceiling. \"The GOP [the Republican Party] will own the debt once they vote for this,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, over the weekend. Trump responded to Paul with a series of social media posts, accusing him of having \"very little understanding of the bill\" and saying that the \"people of Kentucky can't stand him\". \"His ideas are actually crazy,\" Trump wrote. Republican lawmakers pushed back on Musk's comments, with Senate majority leader John Thune telling reporters the party plans to \"proceed full speed ahead\" despite \"a difference of opinion\". \"We have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president,\" he said. Mike Johnson - the Republican Speaker who has ushered the legislation through the House - told reporters on Capitol Hill that \"my friend Elon is terribly wrong\". \"It's a very important first start. Elon is missing it,\" Johnson said. Johnson said he had a 20-minute phone call with the tycoon about the bill on Monday, adding that its phasing out of electric vehicle tax credits could \"have an effect\" on Tesla, Musk's firm. \"I lament that,\" Johnson said, expressing surprise that Musk criticised the bill despite their call. \"I just deeply regret he's made this mistake.” Among the issues that upset Musk involved air traffic control at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according toAxios. Musk was hoping it would be run on his Starlink satellite system, but he was denied because of issues relating to the technology and the appearance of a conflict of interest, the political outlet reported. Some Democrats welcomed Musk’s comments despite their previous criticism of him and the work of Doge. \"Even Elon Musk, who's been part of the whole process, and is one of Trump's buddies, said the bill is bad,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"We can imagine how bad this bill is.\" Trump and Republicans in Congress have set a deadline of 4 July to get the measure passed and signed into law. Musk supported Trump in last year's November election with donations of more than $250m. To make peace with spending hawks, Trump is also asking Congress to pass a plan that would reduce current spending by $9.4bn, a figure derived from Doge's work. It would mainly slash funding for foreign aid, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and for broadcasters NPR and PBS.

    "title": "Madeleine search officers dig at abandoned building in Portugal",
    "article_text": "Portuguese and German authorities have begun a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after she disappeared. Madeleine was three when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on 3 May 2007, sparking a Europe-wide police investigation that has become one of the highest-profile missing persons cases. Portuguese police said on Monday they were carrying out warrants from German prosecutors to search 21 plots of land between where Madeleine went missing and where the German investigators' prime suspect had been staying at the time. Tuesday's search appears to have focused on an abandoned building, where officers were seen digging and clearing rocks. The search - which covers the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz - is due to continue until Friday. On Tuesday morning, a Portuguese fire engine andfour vehicles carrying German police arrived at the search site - located around 3.5 miles from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine and her family had been staying. Roads leading up to the site - which is large and mostly scrubland - have been closed since Monday, where the team has been clearing grass and vegetation. The day's efforts appear to centre on disused buildings near the coast. The team has also examined wells, while firefighters have drained one particular well. Around 30 German officers are expected to take part in the search. Charlie Hedges, the former missing children chief at the National Crime Agency (NCA), who has worked on some of the UK's highest-profile cases, said it appeared investigators were \"casting the net a bit wider\" with the latest search. \"It seems a bit widespread to be [that] they're looking for something particular,\" he told the BBC. \"If it was a firm lead, you'd have thought it would be defined and towards one place.\" However, he said they must have had enough justification to acquire the search warrants. \"They'd need to get approval for funding from Germany, and it should be quite a considerable cost with the number of resources and working abroad and the rest of it.\" Madeleine's case was initially handled by the Portuguese authorities with the aid of the Metropolitan Police. German investigators have taken a lead since 2020, when they identified German national Christian Brückner as their prime suspect. The 48-year-old is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. He was due to be released in September, but that could be pushed back to early 2026 if he does not pay a fine he owes. German authorities fear that if Brückner is not charged with anything, he will disappear following his release. German police suspect him of murder. British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation. Brückner has repeatedly denied any involvement and no charges have been brought against him relating to her disappearance. Portuguese authorities have also named Brückner as a formal suspect, or \"arguido\". They said they will hand over any evidence seized in the latest search to German authorities. The Met Police, which said this week that it was aware of the searches being carried out by German police in Portugal, continues its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. The case, known as Operation Grange, has been ongoing since 2011 and has cost around £13.3m to date. Officials have not disclosed if they are conducting this latest search in Portugal based on any new information, making it appear as if they are taking one last look in places where evidence or a body could have been hidden. German police have a European warrant, which has been approved by Portuguese prosecutors, to allow them to conduct searches on private land. The last search took place two years ago and was focused around a reservoir to the north-east of where Madeleine was staying. Brückner, who spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017, was found to have photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir. Mr Hedges said the latest search area could be \"a gap they're trying to plug\". He suggested Brückner's impending release was \"probably driving things\" and police needed to \"nail down\" further evidence. Jim Gamble, founding chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection unit of the NCA, said a review of the case he led in 2010 had \"identified areas that should have been searched and could have been searched that weren't\". He told the BBC that mistakes in the original investigation had \"created a legacy of chaos that undermined the investigation for many years\", requiring new searches to  cover old ground. Mr Gamble added that, 18 years on, investigators would be using new forensic techniques, including equipment that can scan below the surface of the earth. On the night Madeleine disappeared, her parents had been at dinner with friends at a restaurant a short walk away while their three-year-old daughter and her younger twin siblings were asleep in the ground-floor apartment. Her mother, Kate, discovered she was missing at around 22:00. A German documentary in 2022 found evidence that Brückner occasionally worked at the Ocean Club as a handyman, while German prosecutors have also linked his mobile phone data and a car sale to their case against him. Last month, Madeleine's parents marked the 18th year anniversary of her disappearance, saying their \"determination to leave no stone unturned is unwavering\". The ruling right-of-centre Democratic Alliance of PM Luís Montenegro wins elections, amid a far-right surge. Cristiano Ronaldo say he is \"very proud\" of his eldest son after he makes his debut for Portugal Under-15s.

    "title": "Has good weather helped to fuel record small boat crossings?",
    "article_text": "Good weather and the willingness of people smugglers to cram more people onto small boats have been highlighted by the government as factors driving the level of migrant Channel crossings. The Home Office has released figures showing that the number of \"red days\" - when conditions are considered favourable for small boat crossings - peaked in 2024-25. The figures also show a rise in \"severely overcrowded boats\" in the same period. The Conservatives and Reform have accused the government of \"blaming the weather\" for the record crossings so far this year. The government has said it is working to fix \"a broken asylum system\" left by the Tories. The Home Office figures reveal there were 190 red days in the 12 months to April 2025 - an 80% increase on the previous year and the highest number since records began. Red days are defined as days which the Met Office has assessed as \"likely\" or \"highly likely\" to see small boat crossings, based on things like the height of waves, wind speed and rainfall. By publishing the red day figures, the first official release of this kind, the government is suggesting a link between good weather conditions and the level of migrant crossings. So far this year, 14,812 people have arrived in small boats - up about 40% on the same period last year. Almost 1,200 people arrived on Saturday alone. BBC Verify asked Peter Walsh from the Migration Observatory, based at the University of Oxford, exactly what impact the weather has on Channel crossings. He said it was a factor but other issues, such as the effectiveness of smuggling gangs and the number of people wanting to reach the UK are likely to be more important. \"A migrant's decision to come to the UK by small boat is important and life-changing for them: will they casually drop their plans and decide not to migrate because of a few consecutive days of bad weather? Or will they just wait until the next safe-weather day,\" he told BBC Verify. While acknowledging that gangs have exploited periods of good weather to increase crossings, a Home Office spokesperson insisted the government is \"restoring grip to the broken asylum system it inherited\". \"That's why we are giving counter-terror style powers to law enforcement, launching an unprecedented international crackdown on immigration crime and have prevented 9,000 crossings from the French coastline this year alone\", the spokesperson said. Responding to the red day figures, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp, said: \"Blaming the weather for the highest ever crossing numbers so far this year is the border security equivalent of a lazy student claiming 'the dog ate my homework'.\" Reform MP Lee Anderson said: \"This Labour government blaming small boat crossings on the weather is like blaming the housing crisis on homebuilders - it's pathetic.\" The figures also show a rise in what the Home Office has called \"severely overcrowded small boats\". In the year to April 2025, there were 33 boats which carried 80 or more people on board. The year before, there were only 11 boats with 80 or more people and there was just one of these boats recorded in the year to April 2023. While the number of people per boat has increased, the total number of boats has fallen from 1,116 in 2021–22 to 738 last year. Last year arecord number of people diedattempting to cross the channel in small boats, something which the Home Office attributes to \"more people [being] crammed into flimsy and dangerous boats\" by people smugglers.

    "title": "Killings near Gaza aid centre will deepen criticism of Israel's new distribution system",
    "article_text": "Witnesses and international medical teams report terrible scenes of killing as Israeli troops opened fire in the hours of Tuesday before dawn on Palestinians who were converging on the new aid distribution site in southern Gaza. It was \"total carnage\" according to a foreign witness. An official statement from the Israeli military describes a very different picture. It said \"several suspects\" moved towards Israeli forces \"deviating from the designated access routes\". Troops \"carried out warning fire… additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects who advanced towards the troops\". The killing of civilians who came looking for food aid will redouble criticism of the controversial new system of distributing aid in Gaza. The new aid hubs in Gaza are a scheme conceived by Israel with the support of the United States to replace the operation run by United Nations agencies and other experienced international aid groups. A new private body, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) employs armed security teams provided by an American company at its hubs, which are so far in areas of southern Gaza under full Israeli military control. The GHF started after a total Israeli ban on shipments of food and other aid into Gaza left the entire population at the risk of famine, according to the agency that collates data on food emergencies on behalf of countries and the UN. Israel claims that UN staff stood by while Hamas stole most of the aid coming into Gaza. The UN denies the allegations, insisting it can account for all the aid it distributes. It refuses to cooperate with the GHF. It is clear that the GHF system has fundamental flaws, bearing out the worst fears of aid professionals. Jake Wood, the head of the GHF resigned just over a week ago, saying it would not be able to fulfil the principles of \"humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence\". The UN had a wide network of aid distribution points and supplied ingredients to communal kitchens and bakeries that fed hundreds of thousands. The GHF system means that the people must travel through a war zone in the ruins of southern Gaza to collect a box of rations. Distribution seems to be chaotic, and so far has repeatedly broken down into a free for all. Stronger young men can grab boxes of aid for their families. The weakest get nothing. There is not enough to go around. To get closer to the front of the queue Palestinians walk throughout the night. Large gatherings of Palestinians, desperate to get food rations are inherently hard to manage. It seems that this morning Israeli troops opened fire with deadly consequences. In an interview with the BBC before the latest killings, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, said the GHF plan showed \"utter disregard for civilians. Can you imagine people who have been absolutely desperate for food, for medicine for almost three months, and then they have to basically run for it or try to get it in the most desperate circumstances?\" Israel's conduct he said, \"shows utter disrespect for the laws of war, for the protection of civilians\". The argument for the GHF system is that it is better than nothing, that it provides a modicum of food aid and can be expanded. The argument against it is that Israel is using to control and corral Palestinian civilians. Israeli ministers have been open about using food aid as a weapon of war. The defence minister Israel Katz called it a \"lever\" against Hamas. The deadly turmoil surrounding the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation comes at a time when Israel's close allies, including the UK, France and Canada are demanding big changes in its conduct in Gaza, including allowing in the humanitarian aid necessary to care for more than two million people. They have threatened concrete steps, most likely sanctions and perhaps recognition of a Palestinian state, if Israel does not end its latest offensive. Western diplomats are looking on with dismay at the killing of the hungry in Gaza, as Israel's international isolation deepens. A recent spate of attacks targeting Jewish people and institutions has led to calls for heightened security The BBC’s Anna Foster hosts a debate to discuss whether there have been war crimes in Israel and Gaza. BBC Verify examines three deadly incidents which left dozens dead near a controversial aid site in Gaza. Civilians were fired at by tanks, drones and helicopters, civil defence officials say, while Israel says only that troops fired towards several suspects.

    "title": "What we know about killings near US-Israeli backed Gaza aid site",
    "article_text": "Over the past three days, there have been a series of deadly incidents on the route to an aid distribution site in Gaza run by a controversial group backed by the US and Israel. The three incidents took place on roads approaching one of the new sites in the extreme south-west of Gaza, which is under full Israeli military control. The facility is being operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The first incident took place early on Sunday morning when 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. Another three people were killed by gunfire on Monday morning, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Meanwhile, a further 27 people were killed by Israeli fire near the site on Tuesday morning, according to health officials. Israel has denounced what it called \"false reports\" that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites. It said that some soldiers fired warning shots on Sunday 1km away, and that they also opened fire after identifying \"several suspects\" on Monday and Tuesday. Very few videos have emerged from Gaza that show the incidents themselves, but BBC Verify has examined footage has surfaced and attempted to map how they unfolded. All three are reported to have taken place near an aid distribution centre in the south-west of Gaza, in the Tal al-Sultan area. The site, named Safe Distribution Site 1 (SDS 1) by the GHF, opened on the 26 May. It is one of four such facilities, three of which are based in southern Gaza. The facilities are part of a new aid system - widely condemned by humanitarian groups - aiming to bypass the UN, which Israel has accused of failing to prevent Hamas diverting aid to its fighters. The UN says that has not been a big problem and that the GHF's system is unworkable and unethical. However, only SDS 1 has been open and operational since Friday, according to official GHF posts online. It follows a chaotic opening week which saw the site overrun by desperate civilians, and projectiles being thrown towards Gazans at another facility at the GHF's northern site near Nuseirat on Thursday. A spokesperson for the foundation did not respond to messages asking why the other facilities have been closed for several days. The GHF has also encouraged civilians to follow a set route when approaching SDS 1, directing them along a coastal road called al-Rashid Street. The instructions have been issued on the foundation's official Facebook page. Chris Newton, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based think tank Crisis Group, said the route was neither \"safe nor effective\". He added that directing civilians down a single route towards the site was \"a very far cry from what was possible\" under the UN-based system, which saw 400 distribution points scattered across the strip. \"This all looks designed to fail,\" he said of the new aid system. According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, some 31 people were killed by gunfire on Sunday. The GHF posted on its official Facebook page early on Sunday, telling civilians that SDS 1 would be open from 05:00 local time. However, just an hour later it posted again saying that the site was closed. By this time many Gazans had gathered at the Al-Alam roundabout as they waited to be granted access to the site, Mohammed Ghareeb, a journalist based in Rafah, told the BBC. We have seen a limited amount of video that is claimed to relate to the shootings. In one video filmed on the route to the aid site, purportedly on Sunday, people lie on the ground and an explosion is heard which could be tank or artillery fire. An audio recording provided to the BBC by international staff at the UK-Med field hospital about 3km away from the site captured two apparent explosions and protracted gunfire for over five minutes. Video footage posted at 06:08 showed dozens of people lying prone on sand, with automatic gunfire audible. BBC Verify could not definitively geolocate the footage. Another clip reviewed by BBC Verify, which claimed to be from the aftermath of the incident, showed a number of bodies lying on a beach on Gaza's coast. As the video progresses, several of the bodies were covered by white bags. One of those lying on the beach appeared to be a young woman. We cannot definitively geolocate the footage. However, lights seen in the distance suggest that the footage may have been filmed in an area about 1km from SDS 1. Images - provided to the BBC by doctors - of bullets recovered from those killed and wounded in the incidents showed that both 5.56mm and 7.62mm rounds were used. But Benedict Manzin - an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline - said that the source of the rounds was unclear, noting that both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups \"will have access to weapons that fire 5.56mm and 7.62mm rounds\". The IDF denied its troops fired at civilians \"near or within\" the site and said reports to this effect were false. But an Israeli military source later said warning shots were fired approximately 1km (0.6 miles) away from the site \"to prevent suspects from approaching the troops\". The GHF said in a statement: \"There were no injuries, fatalities or incidents during our operations yesterday. Period. We have yet to see any evidence that there was an attack at or near our facility.\" On Monday, three people were killed while waiting for food near SDS 1, according to the ICRC. The Israeli military said \"warning shots were fired toward several suspects who advanced toward\" troops approximately 1km from the site. The Gaza health ministry said at least 27 people were then killed when Israeli forces opened fire near SDS 1 early on Tuesday. Very little footage has emerged purporting to show the moment of the shooting. But one clip posted online showed people running with gunfire audible. BBC Verify geolocated the footage to a road near SDS 1 and established it was newly published on Tuesday although we cannot say for certain it relates to Tuesday's incident. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that the incident again occurred a few hundred metres away from the Al-Alam roundabout. He said most of those killed or injured \"were hit by gunfire from tanks, helicopters and quadcopter drones\". Yasser Abu Lubda, a 50-year-old who has been displaced from Rafah, told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that the shooting began shortly before 04:00 local time. Rasha al-Nahal, another witness, told AP \"there was gunfire from all directions\". And the ICRC said in a statement that its field hospital in Rafah received \"a mass casualty influx of 184 patients\". \"This includes nineteen cases who were declared dead upon arrival and eight more who died due to their wounds shortly after. The majority of cases suffered gunshot wounds.\" In a statement, the IDF said approximately 0.5km from the aid distribution site \"several suspects\" moved towards them. It said troops shot warning fire and when \"suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individual suspects\". It said it was looking into reports of casualties. Responding to Tuesday's incident, the GHF said: \"While the aid distribution was conducted safely and without incident at our site today, we understand that IDF is investigating whether a number of civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone. This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and operations area.\" BBC Verify will continue to investigate footage surrounding each of the three incidents.

    "title": "Jonathan Joss: Three roles the late US actor was known for",
    "article_text": "US actor Jonathan Joss, known for his roles in King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation, has died aged 59. Joss was shot dead, in what his husband called a homophobic hate crime, although police in Texas say there is no evidence of this. Joss's broad career spanned different genres and platforms, appearing in films, sitcoms, animations, stage productions and more. He has been credited with increasing representation of Native Americans on screen. Here are three of the notable performances he will be remembered for. In the animated sitcom King of the Hill, Goss voiced the character of John Redcorn, a Native American \"licensed New Age healer\" from season two onwards. The sitcom centres around the Hill family and is set in the fictional town of Arlen, in suburban Texas. For the first four seasons, Redcorn is having an affair with Hank Hill's neighbour, Nancy Gribble. Nancy's husband Dale is oblivious. While a flawed character, Redcorn is known for his kindness and calm persona, and for championing his Native American heritage. In season four, during perhaps his most notable storyline, Redcorn reveals an ongoing battle between his tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying he hoped to regain Native American land from the government. Considering Redcorn a \"true friend\", Dale decides to help him with the lawsuit filed against the government, by introducing him to the Freedom of Information Act. Redcorn then permanently ends his14-year affair with Nancy, out of respect for Dale. The affair is not revealed to Dale and he happily heads home with Nancy. Author Dustin Tahmahkera once described Redcorn as \"arguably the most developed and complex indigenous character in US sitcom history, thanks in critical part... to the on-and-offscreen work of Joss\". In his 2014 book Tribal Television, which considered the representation of Native Americans in sitcoms, Tahmahkera added that the portrayal \"attempted to break through a largely unkind and unflattering history of representations of the indigenous\". But the fact that Redcorn was the \"most human and multidimensional\" Native American on screen was \"a disheartening and stark reminder of the history of indigenous representations in network television\", Tahmahkera pointed out. King of the Hill originally aired from 1997 to 2010. The sitcom is set to return in August with the characters aged and living a new part of their lives. Joss's onscreen role as Native American tribe leader Chief Ken Hotate was a fan favourite in this live-action sitcom. The Chief's sharp dress sense matched his comedic wit, and he was often seen teasing the core characters as they struggled to tell if his straight-faced comments were deadly serious or a complete joke. Chief Hotate often met Leslie Knope, deputy director of the Parks and Recreation department for the fictional city of Pawnee, to discuss use of the land. He would often use stereotypes associated with Native Americans to his advantage, for example when opposing a festival organised on an ancient burial site by saying he hoped his ancestors \"don't put a curse\" on the event. White people are \"terrified of curses\", he explained to the camera in a tongue-in-cheek aside. As with King of the Hill, Joss's character was dedicated to defending tribal ancestry, and would often highlight injustices faced by his community. Parks and Recs creators used Joss's character with a \"really witty kind of self awareness\", said Samantha Sheppard, associate professor of cinema and media studies at Cornell University. \"Parks and Rec loved to kind of reckon with the fact that despite the very good intentioned and warm-hearted, generous public servant that was Leslie Knope, and the folks who worked for the city, that the city still existed on indigenous land, and therefore had to account for those violences and that history,\" Prof Sheppard told the BBC. His role made light of the sensitive issues in a way that made the difficult topic of America's ugly history with indigenous groups more \"accessible\", Prof Sheppard said. \"There was this kind of cheeky awareness of stereotypical representations of Native Americans on screen,\" she said, referring to the dichotomy of Chief Hotate also being a casino owner. \"I think it did pave the way for, like, other kinds of indigenous storytelling to happen.\" Taking on a darker role, Joss portrayed the ruthless Denali in 2016's The Magnificent Seven. A retelling of a 1960s Westernof the same name, a group of gunslingers come together to protect the town of Rose Creek, which is under threat from a tycoon wanting to mine the ground for gold. Denali, exiled from the Comanche tribe, becomes a personal assassin to the tycoon, and is seen firing arrows and in hand-to-hand combat. \"When people ask me what I thought of the movie, I tell them that all I know is my dad would have loved it,\" Josstold MySanAntonio: a news outlet local to his home town at the time of the film's release.

Mr Bennett was suspended on full pay during the whole process. On Tuesday the second panel found the allegation proven against Mr Bennett at the level of gross misconduct. Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the former senior officer \"knew full well what was required of him, yet he made a choice not to cooperate\". \"I am enormously concerned that almost five years since this incident happened we have only now been able to dismiss Cdr Bennett,\" added Assistant Commissioner Twist. \"This should have been a simple matter. Cdr Bennett has never disputed he refused a lawful order to take a drugs test.\" He said greater use by the Met of accelerated misconduct hearings to fast-track cases where the evidence is \"irrefutable\" would allow the force to dismiss officers \"far more quickly\". \"I am confident a situation like Cdr Bennett's prolonged case would not happen again,\" he added. The original disciplinary panel rejected a claim by Mr Bennett's former flatmate Sheila Gomes that he had used cannabis daily before breakfast. But it found that he had breached professional standards when he refused to do a drugs test. Two further allegations at the first panel - that between 2019 and 2020, while off duty, he had smoked cannabis, and that he gave an untrue explanation for why he refused to take the drugs test - were not proven. He told the first panel he had been taking CBD (cannabidiol) to treat facial palsy and was worried the sample would come up positive for an innocent reason. Mr Bennett - who wrote a Met drugs strategy in 2017 - was found in 2023 to have breached force standards for honesty and integrity, orders and instructions and discreditable conduct and was sacked. His lawyers successfully argued that while he had always admitted refusing to provide a sample, the panel found him guilty of a lack of integrity that he had not been charged with. Following the PAT's decision to revoke the dismissal, the Met considered a legal challenge by way of a judicial review but decided that Mr Bennett should face a fresh misconduct hearing. Following the misconduct panel's decision and his subsequent dismissal, Mr Bennett will be added to the College of Policing's barred list.

    "title": "Brits could face death over Bali 'Angel Delight' drugs plot",
    "article_text": "A trial has begun of three British nationals alleged to have been involved with smuggling cocaine disguised as packets of Angel Delight into Indonesia. Jon Collyer, 38, and Lisa Stocker, 39, were arrested at Bali's international airport in February after being caught with 994g of cocaine, according to Balinese authorities. The pair appeared in court alongside Phineas Float, 31, who was allegedly due to receive the packages and was arrested a few days later. All three defendants, who are from Hastings and St Leonards in East Sussex, could face the death penalty – the heaviest punishment for taking part in a drug transaction under Indonesian law. It is alleged that Mr Collyer and Ms Stocker were caught with 17 packages of cocaine, with a value of roughly £300,000. The BBC's US partner CBS has quoted the AFP news agency as saying Balinese authorities believe the cocaine was hidden in packets of Angel Delight, a powdered dessert mixture. A journalist from the news agency at the court in Bali said a verdict was not expected until a later date. The British embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indonesia hands out severe punishments for drug smuggling and has previously executed foreigners, but has upheld a temporary halt on the death sentence since 2017. Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto's administration has moved in recent months to repatriate several high-profile inmates, all sentenced for drug offences, back to their home countries. Frenchman Serge Atlaoui returned to France in February after Jakarta and Paris agreed a deal to repatriate him on \"humanitarian grounds\" because he was ill. In December, Indonesia also took Mary Jane Veloso off death row and returned her to the Philippines. It also sent the five remaining members of the \"Bali Nine\" drug ring, who were serving heavy prison sentences, back to Australia. According to Indonesia's Ministry of Immigration and Corrections, 96 foreigners were on death row, all on drug charges, before Veloso's release. Speaking exclusively to BBC South East in February, Sheiny Pangkahila, the lawyer representing Mr Collyer, Ms Stocker and Mr Float, said, if convicted, theycould each face between 15-20 years in an Indonesian prison. In a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was \"providing consular support to three British nationals detained in Indonesia and are in contact with the local authorities\". \"The British government's policy on the death penalty is clear: we oppose it in all circumstances as a matter of principal.\" The trial continues.

    "title": "MI5 lied ‘deliberately and repeatedly’ in neo-Nazi spy case, BBC tells High Court",
    "article_text": "MI5 lied \"deliberately and repeatedly\" as it tried to defend its handling of a neo-Nazi agent who abused women, the BBC has told a panel of High Court judges. The corporation argued the threshold for contempt of court proceedings against MI5 and three individual officers had been met. Sir James Eadie KC, acting for MI5, issued an \"unreserved apology\" on behalf of the Security Service but said the \"errors that had been made had not been deliberate\". The three judges - England and Wales' most senior judge, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr, President of the King's Bench Division Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain  - reserved judgement on the case until a later date. The case, which began in 2022 with an attempt to block the BBC from publishing a story about the neo-Nazi agent, has become a major test of how the courts view MI5 and the credibility of its evidence. MI5 gave evidence to three courts, saying that it had never breached its core secrecy policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) that a man known only as X was a state agent. But in February, the BBC was able to prove with notes and recordings of phone calls with MI5 thatthis was false. An MI5 officer had confirmed the agent's status as he tried to persuade me to drop an investigation into X, a violent neo-Nazi misogynist who used his Security Service role to coerce and terrify his former girlfriend, known publicly as \"Beth\". At Tuesday's hearing MI5 acknowledged that the NCND policy could no longer be maintained in this case. This policy has meant significant amounts of evidence has been confined to closed hearings which neither the BBC nor Beth - who has brought a separate case complaining about MI5 - are permitted to attend. Outside court, Beth's solicitor Kate Ellis said this meant she would now get a fair trial of her own legal claim against MI5. \"It's a huge outcome for Beth. She's had to fight this all the way to the High Court,\" Ms Ellis said. \"This case has really undermined MI5's credibility in the courts.\" Charlotte Kilroy KC, representing Beth, told the court her client agreed with the BBC that the threshold for contempt of court proceedings had been met. There had been \"copious levels of dishonesty\" which had not been acknowledged in MI5's investigations into how it came to give false evidence. Contempt of court is a legal term for behaviour that impedes the administration of justice or creates a risk of that happening, such as publishing information that prejudices a trial or giving false statements to court. It can be punished with a fine or up to two years in prison. The BBC's barrister, Jude Bunting KC, submitted to the court that it should consider contempt of court proceedings against MI5 itself, and three individual Security Service officers - including one who confirmed X's status as an agent on the phone to me and a senior officer known as Witness A who gave the false evidence to court. MI5's accounts of how it came to give false evidence \"lack candour\" and there is a \"real concern\" that the court has not been given a full explanation of what went wrong, Mr Bunting said. He said an external review by the government's former chief lawyer Sir Jonathan Jones KC did not speak to two crucial witnesses. Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Attorney General for the Security Service, offered an \"unreserved apology on behalf of MI5\". \"Everyone from the director general downwards acknowledges the seriousness caused,\" he said. MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum immediately informed Home Secretary Yvette Cooper as soon as the matter was drawn to his attention, Sir James said. There has been \"a full and comprehensive investigation\" which came to the conclusion that \"the errors that had been made had not been deliberate\" and that \"there had been no misleading or lying\", MI5's barrister said. He said that contempt of court proceedings \"would not be appropriate\". Two senior government watchdogs say victim support services are being \"pushed to the brink\". Ashleigh Murray says a scheme that installed new security measures at her home helped rebuild her life. The scheme aims to help park staff safely address harassment of women and girls when they see it. Gloucestershire Police hopes to improve the way it reports violence against women - placing responsibility on perpetrators. The anti-violence images are expected to be seen by more than a million rail passengers a year.",

Sir Mo Farah, Keely Hodgkinson, Dame Kelly Holmes, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Daley Thompson are among the athletes, past and present, to sign the letter. The bid proposal, if successful, would see the World Championships held at London Stadium, and require a \"one-off injection of public funding in 2028\" with the promise of \"Â£400m in national economic impact\". \"Hosting in 2029 would bring the world's best athletes back to British soil but more importantly, it would inspire a new generation to get involved in the most diverse and inclusive sport there is,\" the letter read. \"Some of us were lucky enough to experience a home crowd at London 2012 and 2017. Some of us volunteered, others were in the stands. All of us were inspired. \"That spark set many of us on our journeys, just as it did for so many thousands of other young people who've gone on to join clubs, coach, officiate, or simply fall in love with athletics.\" The 2029 bid process is due to begin this summer, with organisers urging ministers to commit to securing the World Championships for the UK in the coming weeks.

    "title": "Dutch government collapses after far-right leader quits coalition",
    "article_text": "The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition following a row over migration. Prime Minister Dick Schoof confirmed he was stepping down on Tuesday and offered the resignation of the cabinet to King Willem-Alexander. In televised remarks following an emergency cabinet meeting, Schoof said Wilders' decision to withdraw the support of his PVV party was \"irresponsible and unnecessary\". \"As far as I'm concerned, this shouldn't have happened,\" he added. The governing coalition was in place for less than one year. The row which led to its collapse came after Wilders pushed for 10 additional asylum measures, including a freeze on applications, halting the construction of reception centres and limiting family reunification. Schoof had made a last-minute appeal to coalition party leaders on Tuesday morning, but the meeting lasted just one minute before Wilders walked out, ending the coalition. \"No signature for our asylum plans. PVV leaves the coalition,\" said Wilders on X. There was shock and anger among political leaders, many of whom pointed out that several of Wilders' demands were similar to policies already in the coalition agreement, and that they would not stand in the PVV's way to implement them. Many of the additional proposals put forward by Wilders had been dismissed during coalition talks because of  legal concerns. Wilders' decision has put an end to an uneasy governing coalition which was born in July 2024 after months of political wrangling following elections the previous year. His anti-immigration, far-right PVV was the largest party. The other members were the conservative-liberal VVD, the Farmers' Citizen Movement (BBB) and the centrist New Social Contract. From the start the coalition seemed a marriage of convenience, characterised by infighting and appeared to struggle to push through any of policies it had proudly promoted. Following its collapse, Wilders' former coalition partners accused him of engineering the crisis. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said the move was \"super irresponsible\", adding: \"This wasn't about asylum at all.\" \"I think Wilders is betraying the Netherlands,\" said deputy Prime Minister Mona Keijzer from the BBB. But Wilders appears to feel emboldened. On Tuesday he told reporters that he intended to become prime minister of the Netherlands \"and ensure that the PVV becomes bigger than ever in the next elections\". Sandra Phlippen, the chief economist for ABN AMRO bank, said the immediate economic impact of the cabinet's collapse appeared minimal because during its 11 months in office the government had \"barely made any concrete plans\". Polls show the far right and Green-Left parties are neck-and-neck, with migration and cost-of-living issues fuelling political volatility across Europe. Wilders wanted the government to collapse as the support for his Freedom Party continues to drop in the polls, according to Armida van Rij, the Head of the Europe Programme at Chatham House. With the Nato summit due to be held in the Hague at the end of the month, Schoof's ministers will seek to remain in power in a caretaker capacity until a date is set for the Netherlands to return to the polls - likely in the autumn, according to Dutch media. In the Dutch political system, becoming prime minister requires forming a majority coalition in the 150-seat parliament. Even if Wilders again surpasses the political pundits expectations, his decision to collapse the government is being seen as reckless - and perceptions he is putting personal ambition above national stability could further complicate his ability to form alliances after the next election. The parties that were reluctant or refused to go into government with Wilders after the last election are likely to find that kind of partnership even less attractive now. In addition, by toppling the coalition over the issue of asylum, it is likely Wilders will put it at the centre of his upcoming election campaign. However, given that his party had been responsible for asylum and immigration for almost a year, there are no guarantees that such a gamble will pay off.",

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Kirby scores 'sublime' goal for England England attacking midfielder Fran Kirby has announced her retirement from international football with immediate effect before the European Championships. In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, Kirby says she is leaving the international scene with her \"head held high\". The Brighton player, who scored 19 goals in 77 caps for the Lionesses, has been a key figure for England for more than a decade. Kirby was named in Sarina Wiegman's squad for the Uefa Nations League matches against Portugal and Spain but was informed she would not be selected for the Euros starting on 2 July. In her first interview after announcing her retirement, Kirby said: \"It is something I have been thinking about for over a year. I knew this was going to be my last major tournament. \"The plan was to retire after the Euros but after speaking to Sarina I'm not going to make the squad. \"It was like a dagger to my heart but also a weight off my shoulders all at the same time. It was emotional for both of us but we both respected what each person was saying.\" Speaking after England's 2-1 defeat by Spain, Wiegman said she \"loved\" working with Kirby, calling her \"an amazing player and an incredible person too\". \"She did everything to make the squad,\" added Wiegman. \"She has always been ready to play and to perform, helping others and doing whatever I asked her to do. \"I said to her she most likely would not make the squad, even though things could change quickly.\" Earps announces shock England retirement after losing place How Earps went from Â£25 a game to 'Mary, Queen of Stops' Womenâs Football Weekly: Nations League reaction and Kirby announces England retirement Fran Kirby's final England appearance was in the 6-0 Nations League win over Portugal The news comes just days after goalkeeper Mary Earps also retired from international football before England attempt to defend their Euros title. Kirby, 31, is understood to have informed her England team-mates of the decision after Tuesday's defeat by Spain in Barcelona. Her last England appearance was as a second-half substitute inthe 6-0 win over Portugal.She was not named in the matchday squad against Spain. The former Chelsea player, who is a two-time PFA Women's Footballer of the Year winner, is one of the most recognisable female players in the country. Kirby won seven Women's Super League (WSL) titles and five Women's FA Cup trophies at Chelsea, but she is best remembered for playing a key role in England's historic Euro 2022 triumph. She started all six of England's games in the tournament, scoring twice, as Wiegman's side lifted the trophy with victory over Germany at Wembley. \"When I woke up in the morning after telling Sarina, I didn't feel any regret,\" added Kirby. \"That's when I knew I'd made the right decision. \"I've been on this team for a long time, it's not going to be a shock that it was coming to an end. \"You get to a certain age and there are some really good youngsters that are coming through.\" Fran Kirby was one of England's star players in their Euro 2022 triumph Kirby, who started her career at Reading, scored seven goals in 17 WSL appearances this season as Brighton finished fifth. \"I've put everything into this and feel like I have had a good domestic year,\" she said. \"I've fought hard to be in the Euros squad but unfortunately that's not enough.\" Kirby has battled with injury issues and illness throughout her career, struggling with fatigue in the build-up to Euro 2022 andmissing the 2023 World Cupwith a knee injury that required surgery. \"Everyone knows the injuries that I've had and I've been protecting my body,\" she said. \"This is part of that. But I feel like I've got so much to give in football. I'm already looking forward to the domestic season.\" After being in the England team since I was 21, it's time to close that chapter of my life. I didn't ever want this day to come, but I cannot tell you how proud I am it happened. It's been the biggest honour to represent my country, one that I had only dreamt about as a young girl. I've played with some incredible players, worked with some incredible managers, played in some amazing tournaments and have irreplaceable memories. My journey has been full of ups and downs, setbacks and achievements. Enough has been said and written about those, but regardless of whatever was thrown at me, I want you all to know that every time I put on that England badge I gave it 100%. Every single call-up, I accepted my role and did whatever was needed for the team. I wanted England to win. I've always been there to help England win. My mum had a dream of me representing my country and I'm so proud I was able to do that and play in front of you all. I will never, ever forget the noise when my name is read out at a stadium. I was first selected when I was playing in WSL 2, I played a part in the game-changing World Cup, winning bronze in 2015, creating memories of a lifetime. Starting in every game and winning the Euros in 2022 was a dream come true, to be part of change in women's football was one of the best experiences I could ever have imagined. Thank you to all of you for embracing me as a young girl from Reading who had a dream. I hope you all know that wearing that badge was the greatest honour. To every young girl that suffers setbacks, just remember you can. You can. Forever a Lioness, Fran. Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "How Bazball's baby showed merit in England's thinking",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Watch the best shots of Smith's innings England's Tuesday began stuck in traffic. It was Jamie Smith who ensured there were no dangers of them grinding to a halt thereafter. The team that arrived at The Oval on e-bikes after traffic problems in London were powered to their victory by a freewheeling Smith, who followed a duck in Cardiff with an electric 64 from 28 balls to clinch a series clean sweep. \"I wanted to push out my chest a bit and say that I'm good enough to open the batting,\" Smith, 24, said after the seven-wicket win. On the face of it, England's decision to employ Smith as an opener in this series is one straight from the playbook of out-of-the-box decisions made in the Brendon McCullum era of English cricket. If Shoaib Bashir being called up for the Test side on the back of six first-class appearances was rogue, asking Smith to open the batting for a floundering 50-over side at the start of a new era - a position he has never batted in professional cricket - was not far behind. England thrash Windies to seal 3-0 series win But in reality, despite regular 50-over openers Will Jacks or Tom Banton looking the frontrunners in the squad beforehand, Smith was always the obvious candidate - he is, after all, Bazball's favourite son. Ben Foakes did little wrong in India in 2024 but by England's next Test, Smith had replaced him. After 70 on debut and 95 in his third Test, the talk around Smith was glowing. When he made his maiden Test century a match later against Sri Lanka there were already suggestions he should take a job proving as troublesome to fill as the manager's role at Old Trafford - England's Test number three. Jacob Bethell's emergence has put that one on the backburner but when McCullum took over as England's white-ball coach last September it was no coincidence Smith was recalled to the set-up for the next series. Captain Harry Brook revealed last week McCullum was talking about the possibility of Smith opening at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan - before incumbent Phil Salt had been shown the door. \"Me and Baz think Smudge could be an unbelievable white-ball opener,\" Brook said before the series. It is no criticism but Brook has begun to sound like a jammed cassette when outlining his ideal batter since taking the job. From Leeds to London, \"we want batters that can put their best balls under pressure\" he has said again and again - and again. Smith could have hardly have done that better than he did in the third ODI. The Surrey academy product received nine balls on a 'good length' under the lights at his cricketing home and scored 20 runs at a strike-rate north of 200. Across the match, his batting contemporaries managed 56 runs off 71 balls against such deliveries. England's fascination with Smith comes with all of the caveats of his international career being only 24 matches old but with the knowledge that at his best he can seemingly do it all. On this very ground against Sri Lanka last year he scored 15 from his first 31 deliveries in a Test before crashing 52 off his next 18. This video can not be played England seal series win against West Indies after emphatic victory He has a technically solid defence and drives through the covers with ease. But he can also pick the ball off a length and deposit it over mid-wicket as he did on Tuesday. \"He's not a slogger, is he? He's playing proper shots,\" was how Brook put it succinctly. England also know the importance of an opening partnership if their rebirth after the troubles of Jos Buttler's final 18 months as captain is to be successful. Eoin Morgan's World Cup-winning team had Buttler's fireworks, a match-winner in Ben Stokes and Joe Root's calmness but none of that would have been possible without Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow setting platforms that would have been too big for the 1970s. In Tests, England's best performances under McCullum's leadership - inRawalpindi, atThe Oval, or atEdgbaston- have all been built on significant opening partnerships. Like Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley against the red ball, Duckett and Smith attack the white like they are playing different sports. To get technical, Duckett's average interception point against seamers is around 1.77m, 33cm behind Smith's. While right-hander Smith targets boundaries in front of him, left-hander Duckett has scored only 18% his career runs against pacers in the 'V'. And in McCullum, Smith has a coach who opened 107 times in ODIs and did so in a New Zealand side that reached a World Cup final - an ideal sounding board should one be needed. As one may expect with England's relaxed approach, however, Smith has largely been left to create his own plans during his first week in the job. \"He knows how to bat,\" Brook said. \"Like I said so many times, he's done it in Test cricket for periods. \"He's gonna have a good go at it at the top in one-day cricket and I think everybody's excited to see how he goes.\" Brook knows there will be bumps to come but Smith will be given every chance to lead England on their ride.

    "title": "'Very good week' for England or 'back to the drawing board'?",
    "article_text": "England keeper Hannah Hampton has faced pressure following the shock retirement of Mary Earps Big-name retirements, an impressive display against Portugal but dominated by Spain days later. Has it been a positive week for England or a reality check? Sarina Wiegman's side are preparing to defend their European title in Switzerland next month but had two testing matches in the Women's Nations League to navigate first. A 6-0 victory over Portugal afforded the opportunity for returning stars to build their fitness after injuries, but Tuesday's game in Spain against the world champions was the ultimate litmus test to assess the level of the Lionesses going into the tournament. Lauren Hemp played 90 minutes for the first time since returning from injury Manager Wiegman had her hands full going into the camp after goalkeeper Mary Earps announced her shock international retirement and key defender Millie Bright withdrew from the squad to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing. Paris St-Germain stopper Earps had fallen down the pecking order, with Hannah Hampton increasingly looking more likely to secure the number one spot. But Wiegman admitted Earps would have been a valuable member of the Euros squad - and it had been \"hard\" to deal with her decision. That news was a major distraction as England prepared to face Portugal, piling pressure on Hampton and raising questions about the morale in the squad. The response was emphatic and admirable as they produced an immense display, thrashing Portugal in front of an entertained crowd at Wembley. Aggie Beever-Jones demonstrated England's attacking depth with a brilliant hat-trick, while Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway all got minutes after returning from knee surgeries. Those positive signs cannot be forgotten, although their week did not end on a high as an elite Spain side fought back in style for a 2-1 success that took them into the Nations League semi-finals. Former England defender Anita Asante told ITV: \"The most important thing is the right players are getting the right minutes to feel prepared going into the Euros.\" Karen Carney, a former Lionesses midfielder, added: \"It's great we got fitness for Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood. \"If we get them back fighting - it's a good position for them. I'm confident for England going into the group stages.\" Carney admitted England had to \"suffer\" against Spain because they rotated in the second half as Wiegman looked to expose some of her fringe players to the experience against world-class opponents. She names her Euros squad on Thursday and handed a senior debut to Missy Bo Kearns, just hours before midfielder Fran Kirby announced her international retirement, capping off a rollercoaster week for the Dutchwoman. \"Sometimes you have to go through these moments because the bigger picture for the summer is giving players the minutes that they need,\" added Carney. \"The changes in the second half really hampered England and we felt disconnected. It is a positive because Wiegman has got a lot to learn.\" The England boss echoed that sentiment, saying she was not concerned and could use the Spain loss as another \"learning moment\". \"We had a very good week - players coming back from injuries, players fighting for positions, or minutes, or selection, and that is very positive.\" Georgia Stanway had knee surgery in January while at Bayern Munich England out of Nations League with Spain defeat Kirby announces England retirement before Euros England miss out on semis - how Nations League unfolded But while there were certainly positives - most notably the Portugal performance after such a disruptive build-up - the second-half display in their defeat by Spain showed they clearly have work to do. With France, the Netherlands and Wales awaiting them in the group stages at the Euros, they do not have time to get up to speed. Spain are tipped by many to be the tournament favourites and will undoubtedly be one of England's biggest obstacles if they want to defend their title. It would have been unsettling, then, to see how easily Montse Tome's side dominated possession in the second half and put the visitors under relentless pressure and should have scored more goals than the two from substitute Claudia Pina. \"It's back to the drawing board against our old rival Spain,\" said former England international Lindsay Johnson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"In the first half, England looked confident in that low block, and they hit Spain on the transition. \"In the second half, England really dropped off, Spain upped their game and England couldn't get anywhere near Spain. They were chasing shadows.\" Captain Leah Williamson admitted her side's performances away from home recently have been \"difficult\". It has been an inconsistent Women's Nations League campaign for the Lionesses. They were held to a 1-1 draw in Portugal, then beat Spain at Wembley days later in February. In April, they thrashed Belgium 5-0 at home, then lost 3-2 in Leuven. \"What we have been saying the whole time is that 'it's the new England'. So we wanted to try different things as well,\" Williamson told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"There was more inconsistency than we like, but you have seen very good sides of us. They are the levels we need to keep pushing for and hopefully we will be ready [for the Euros]. \"We would have liked to pick up a win [against Spain]. That would have done wonders for our confidence, how we feel and how we look ahead. \"But we can't forget all the work we have done. As we always say, I would rather have a lesson now than in a month's time.\" England will have another opportunity to piece things together when they face Jamaica in a friendly on 29 June - their final match before the Euros.

    "title": "'A clear idea' - what is Man Utd's transfer strategy?",
    "article_text": "Bryan Mbeumo finished joint-fourth top scorer in the Premier League last season with 20 goals It's been a busy few days at Manchester United. From agreeing to signMatheus Cunha,speaking withBrentford's Bryan Mbeumo,finding out Bruno Fernandeswon't be joining Saudi Arabian side Al Hilaland thatJadon Sancho will return from Chelsea,along with a Â£5m payment, it has been a whirlwind return from their troubled post-season tour of Asia. So, where are they now and what is their transfer strategy moving forward? The spark to reinvigorate Man Utd? How Cunha fits Amorim's plans Sancho's fall from grace - Â£73m fee to Chelsea paying not to sign him Embarrassing defeat and bizarre parade - inside Man Utd's troubled trip Fernandes took a bit of time mulling over the Al Hilal offer after United head coach Ruben Amorim said in Hong Kong on Friday he thought his captain would stay at the club. The 30-year-old wanted to talk it through with his family as, after all, the sums being offered were truly staggering and could not just be dismissed out of hand. At this point last week, many at United thought Fernandes would go.Now we know he won't. Lost amid his assertions about Fernandes, Amorim said something else that resonated. Knowing nailing him down on individuals and specifics would be impossible, I asked Amorim if he knew what he wanted his squad to look like when pre-season training began at the start of July. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I have a clear idea what we want. \"As you know, we are bit limited and can't do it all in one summer. But there is a clear picture for what we want.\" The initial approach - and as a guide it still holds - was to go for younger, hungry players, who can improve. That is the basis on which 20-year-old Denmark international Patrick Dorguarrived in a Â£25m dealfrom Serie A outfit Lecce in February to address the problematic left wing-back berth. It was the same with 18-year-old Arsenal central defender Ayden Heaven. Both players made promising contributions, albeit in a struggling team. However, some issues are so urgently in need of addressing, no time for development is available. And, what Amorim wanted, as an absolute priority, was to reinforce his attack. Time and again towards the end of the Premier League season, the United boss had lamented his side's ability to make the most of the chances they were creating. Man Utd captain Fernandes rejects Al-Hilal move Chelsea pass on Sancho so pay Man Utd Â£5m penalty Man Utd set to open talks over Mbeumo deal Between them, Wolves' Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 league goals last season. The campaign before, it was 21. They are proven in England in a way Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were not before moving to United for a combined fee of almost Â£110m in the summers of 2023 and 2024 respectively. Two signings alone is a bit early to confirm a significant shift away from buying in from overseas â and the arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea in 2023 is proof United had not completely ignored the domestic market before. But it does take out some of the risk when you buy players who know the challenges that lie ahead. \"I think they are players who can come in and hit the ground running,\" former United skipper Gary Neville told Sky Sports. \"United has become a very difficult place for new signings to operate in the last 10 years. Cunha and Mbeumo have got Premier League experience and lots of games under their belt. \"When I watch Manchester United's wide players, they have to be able to get from box to box quickly, and they have to be able to travel with the ball and without the ball. Mbeumo and Cunha can do that, they both run forward with real intent and purpose. \"The players who are going to leave are more jinkers and play in smaller spaces.\" The great unknown is whether Amorim would play Cunha and Mbeumo - if he signs and, as yet, Unitedhave not made contact with Brentford- behind a number nine in the two '10' slots, or if one of them will operate as a main striker, or they will swap. Rasmus Hojlund ended the 2024-25 season with two goals in his final 13 games after the March international break Amorim was adamant in Hong Kong that United could work around Fernandes staying at Old Trafford from a financial point of view. However, the situation is not straightforward. With no European football of any sort next season, finances will be tight. Amorim has already said he can operate with a smaller squad given there are fewer matches, so sales are inevitable. Broadly speaking, there are three categories. Players Amorim just does not want â so the likes of Sancho, Antony, Marcus Rashford andAlejandro Garnacho. Players who have struggled and it would make sense to sell â Hojlund and Zirkzee fit into this group, as does Casemiro. Then, the bulk are players who have something to offer and United would be open to keeping but would let go if the right bid came in. Yet the major issue around all of this is how long would it take to do a deal and how much would it cost? Take Sancho for example. It has been established Chelseawould have signed himon reduced terms, which he was not prepared to accept. If a Premier League club that has just qualified for the Champions League are baulking at Sancho's wages, it is fair to assume most other clubs will reach the same conclusion. If Sancho refuses to drop his demands and Amorim wants him out, United will have to negotiate some kind of compromise. This puts them back in the uncomfortable position of paying a player to play for a rival. It is the kind of situation minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe finds so irritating and wants to end. Yet, when you take a realistic approach to Sancho, Antony and Rashford in particular, it is hard to see how that situation is avoided. The same could also be said of many United players who remained at the club last season. The matches may have finished but for United technical director Jason Wilcox and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves, the hard work is just beginning. It is how well they do, getting players in and out, that will determine how much progress Amorim can be expected to make.

    "title": "World Boxing sorry for naming Khelif in rule change",
    "article_text": "Imane Khelif won welterweight gold at the Olympic Games in Paris last year World Boxing has apologised after Olympic champion Imane Khelif was named in the governing body's announcement of mandatory sex testing. The governing bodyreleased its new policy last week, and singled out the Algerian, saying Khelif will not be allowed to compete in the female category of its competitions until the fighter undergoes the test. But World Boxing has told BBC Sport its president Boris van der Vorst has since written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to apologise after acknowledging that \"the athlete's privacy should have been protected\". Khelif, 26,won women's welterweight gold at the Paris Olympicslast year amid a row over gender eligibility. Khelif, along withTaiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting, was disqualified from the 2023 World Championships by previous world governing body the International Boxing Association (IBA) for allegedly failing gender eligibility tests. Khelif was cleared to compete in Paris by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's amateur world governing body in June 2023 over concerns over how it was run. The IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division in Paris if their passports said they were female. What does science tell us about boxingâs gender row? Khelif required to take sex test for World Boxing fights Boxing controversy - what we know and what we don't Khelif had been set to make a competitive comeback in Eindhoven from 5-10 June. But on Friday, World Boxing saidmandatory sex testing would be introducednext month \"to ensure the safety of all participants and deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women.\" It added: \"In light of plans to introduce this policy and the particular circumstances surrounding some boxers that competed at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing. \"This decision reflects concerns over the safety and wellbeing of all boxers, including Imane Khelif, and aims to protect the mental and physical health of all participants in light of some of the reactions that have been expressed in relation to the boxer's potential participation at the Eindhoven Box Cup.\" World Boxing also published a letter it had sent to both Khelif and the Algerian Boxing Federation, claiming that the new eligibility rules were developed \"with the express purpose of safeguarding athletes in combat sports\" given the \"physical risks associated with Olympic-style boxing\". It also said in the letter that in \"the event the athlete's sex certification is challenged by the athlete's federation or by World Boxing\" the athlete shall be \"ineligible to compete until the dispute is resolved\". World Boxing was granted provisional recognition as the sport's international governing federation by the IOC in February 2025, and the Algerian Boxing Federation joined it in September. Khelif has always competed in the women's division and there is no suggestion the fighter identifies as anything other than a woman. Some reports took the IBA stating that Khelif has XY chromosomes to speculate that the fighter might have differences of sexual development (DSD),like runner Caster Semenya. However, the BBC has not been able to confirm whether this is or is not the case. The IOC made it clear last year this is\"not a transgender case\". In a statement on Tuesday, the IOC said it \"has always made it clear that eligibility criteria are the responsibility of the respective International Federation. The factors that matter to sports performance are unique to each sport, discipline, and/or event. \"We await the full details of how sex testing will be implemented in a safe, fair and legally enforceable way.\" World Boxing has said that its new policy is in the final stages of development, and will mean that \"all athletes over the age of 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.\"",

    "title": "Bill Gates vows to give most of $200bn fortune to African health and education",
    "article_text": "US tech mogulBill Gateshas pledged the majority of his $200bn fortune towards health and education services in Africa. Speakingat an event in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Monday, the 69-year-old said that his pledge would focus on “unleashing the human potential through health, through education” across the continent, adding: “Every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity.” Gates, referring to his philanthropic organization, explained: “I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. And so you can see, you know, I’m extremely lucky. My wealth has gotten to a very high level here. And now, by accelerating my giving, I will have the Gates Foundation take all of those resources.” He went on to add: “The goals here are pretty basic. They really speak to our values. Mothers should survive delivery. Babies should survive past their fifth birthday – kids should be well nourished. Many of these infectious diseases should go away, and the rest within 20 years should be at a very low level.” Citing his endorsement for artificial intelligence, Gates also said: “I am a technologist at heart. I love backing scientists with great new ideas. And the latest technology that we’re all hearing about is artificial intelligence. And I can say to you that this will be deeply important. It’s an incredible opportunity. It brings challenges with it, but as we drive it forward, it will make a huge difference in health, education and agriculture.” Without naming Donald Trump’s presidential administration, Gates alluded to the slew of federal cuts that have been made across foreign aid programs, saying: “Now, we’re sitting here at a time, actually, of a significant crisis in part of the system where there’s been partnership between countries … Some of those cuts are being made so abruptly that there are complete interruptions in trials, or medicines are still sitting in warehouses and are not available. And these cuts are something that I think are a huge mistake.” Gates’s speech came just weeks after he publicly condemned the budget cuts to USAID by the Trump administration’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), which was run for about four months beginning in January by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. Speaking to the Financial Times, Gates said the cuts have led to the expiration of vital food and medicines across aid warehouses, which could precipitate deadly diseases’ spread. “The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates, who has previouslycriticizedMusk,toldthe outlet. In a separate press release, the Gates Foundationannouncedthat it and its partners would address three main goals associated with the Microsoft founder’s pledge: end preventable deaths of moms and babies; ensure the next generation grows up without having to suffer from deadly infectious diseases; and lift millions of people out of poverty. The foundation said that it will “sunset its operations” after 20 years.",

    "title": "‘Multiple casualties’ reported after attack on UN aid convoy in Darfur",
    "article_text": "A UN aid convoy carrying critical food supplies to a famine-threatened city in westernSudanhas been targeted in an attack that killed five people and injured several others. Trucks belonging to the UN’s food and children’s agencies were struck as they headed towards El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, which has beenbesieged by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces(RSF) for more than a year. Fighting broke outin Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly. On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlordGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called theJanjaweed, which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur. The conflict has plunged Sudan into“one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials. It has created theworld’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan. As details of the incident emerged, theUN’s refugee agencyconfirmed the number of people who had fled the country since Sudan’s civil war began had surpassed 4 million, and warned that the scale of displacement was “putting regional and global stability at stake”. The attack on the aid convoy occurred about 45 miles (75km) from El Fasher, in Al Koma, a stronghold of the RSF. A spokesperson for the UN children’s agency,Unicef, said: “We have received information about a convoy withWFP[World Food Programme] and Unicef trucks being attacked last night while positioned in Al Koma, waiting for approval to proceed to El Fasher.” A joint statement from both UN agencies called for an urgent investigation into the deadly attack. So far, the attackers have not yet been officially identified. Both sides in the country’s conflict – the Sudanese army and the RSF – blamed each other. The Al-Koma Emergency Room, a group of local volunteers,posted a videoof a burned out truck, loaded with supplies, and blamed the attack on “Sudanese army drones”. Al Koma was the location of another atrocity at the weekend, when an airstrike on a civilian market by the Sudanese army reportedly killed at least 89 people. The area is firmly under the control of the RSF, with aid trucks forced to navigate a series of the paramilitary group’s checkpoints to reach El Fasher. Last week the WFP expressed “shock” after its premises in El Fasher were repeatedly shelled by the RSF. El Fasher is home to about 2 million people, including about 800,000 internally displaced persons who fled to the city from across Darfur and it remains the only one of five state capitals in the Darfur region not to fall under RSF control. In recent months, it has endured daily shelling amid an ever-tightening siege. Within the city itself, food supplies are running so low that the UN has warned of famine. Activists trapped within El Fasher have said thousands of people face starvation as essential foods and medicines disappear from markets because of the RSF’s siege. Speaking to the activist networkAvaazseveral days ago, a volunteer called Adam said community kitchens in the city no longer had access to maize or wheat. “We used to have goods coming in regularly through vehicles, but now the only goods that enter the city come on donkeys,” he said. “For the entire city of El Fasher, we have no more than 10 donkeys that enter the city carrying goods per day. Even these people carrying limited supplies on their donkeys get questioned and interrogated at RSF [checkpoints].” The civil war, now in its third year, has caused theworld’s biggest humanitarian crisis. In addition to the 4 million people who have now fled Sudan, a record 11.6 million people have also been displaced within the country, about half of whom are in the Darfur region. Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have been accused of myriad war crimes and using starvation as a weapon of war.",

    "title": "Outrage over arrest of Kenyan software developer as regional repression grows",
    "article_text": "A Kenyan software developer and digital activist who was arrested last week after creating a tool for people to express their opposition to a proposed law has been arraigned in court and released on bail, amid public anger at her detention and growing signs of repression in the east African country and its neighbours. Rose Njeri was on Tuesday accused of violating the country’s computer misuse and cybercrime law. Prosecutors said on the charge sheet that her tool enabled users to automatically send emails to the national assembly’s finance committee, “thereby interfering with the normal functioning of the systems”. Njeripublished a post on Xon 19 May announcing her new tool. “I wrote a simple program that lets you reject the Finance Bill 2025 with just one click. Click below to send your objection,” she said. She was arrested at her home in Nairobi on Friday, and police confiscated her electronic devices. Her arrest sparked outrage in the country, with politicians, civil society members and Kenyans at large condemning it and calling for her release. Activists and family members protested outside the police station where she was being held on Sunday. “Imagine having to tell her children that she’s in jail for developing a website that eases public participation for Kenyans who want to submit their proposals on the 2025 budget,” activist Boniface Mwangisaid. The executive director of Amnesty International Kenya, Irũngũ Houghton, said ina statementon Tuesday: “It is clear to us that Rose Njeri’s rights have been severally violated, and any contemplated fair trial is in jeopardy.” Njeri’s tool related to a finance bill that proposes a wide range of tax changes to increase government revenue. Expertssayit may increase tax burdens and reduce Kenyans’ disposable income. A similar proposed law last year causedunprecedented proteststhat led to the killing of dozens of protesters and thedisappearanceand abduction of many more. Demonstrations reduced over time, but killings and disappearances continued with the targettending to shift towards online critics. Njeri’s arrest is in line with what observers say is a wave of repression by east African governments cracking down on dissent. The former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and activistsHanifa Adanand Hussein Khalid were deported from Tanzania two weeks ago. They had travelled to the country to attend a hearing in a treason case against the opposition politicianTundu Lissu. Two other people who had also gone there for the case – Mwangi and the Ugandan lawyer Agather Atuhaire – said on Monday that Tanzanian security officers had sexually assaulted them. The Police Reforms Working Group – Kenya, a coalition of rights organisations, called on the east African and international community to put pressure on the Tanzanian government to hold the officers “responsible for the torture … and sexual assault committed against Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire” accountable. The group spoke alongside the Law Society of Kenya at a press conference in Nairobi.“Torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are serious crimes under multiple treaties and international law,” they said. InUganda, where the opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been in jail for six months over alleged treason charges, lawmakers passed a bill last month to allow civilians to be tried in military court.",

    "title": "Caribbean beaches blighted by record masses of stinking seaweed",
    "article_text": "A record amount of sargassum has piled up across theCaribbeanand nearby areas in May, and more is expected this month, according to a new study. The brown prickly algae is suffocating shorelines from Puerto Rico to Guyana and beyond, disrupting tourism, killing wildlife and even releasing toxic gases that forced one school in the French Caribbean island of Martinique to temporarily close. The amount – 38m tonnes – is the biggest quantity of algae observed across the Caribbean Sea, the western and eastern Atlantic, and the Gulf of Mexico since scientists began studying the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in 2011, said Brian Barnes, an assistant research professor at the University of South Florida who worked on the new report from the University of South Florida’s Optical Oceanography Lab. The previous record was set in June 2022 , with some 22m tonnes. “The peaks just seem to keep getting bigger and bigger year after year,” he said. But scientists don’t know why yet. “It’s the million-dollar question,” he said. “I don’t have a supremely satisfying answer.” Three different types of sargassum exist in the Caribbean and nearby areas, reproducing asexually as they remain afloat thanks to tiny air sacs. They thrive in different ways depending on sunlight, nutrients and water temperature, factors that scientists are currently studying, Barnes said. Experts have also said that agricultural runoff, warming waters and changes in wind, current and rain could have an effect. While large clumps of algae in the open ocean are what Barnes called a “healthy, happy ecosystem” for creatures ranging from tiny shrimp to endangered sea turtles, sargassum near or on the shore can wreak havoc. It can block sunlight that coral reefs need to survive, and if the algae sinks, it can smother reefs and sea grasses. Once it reaches the shore, the creatures living in the algae die or are picked off by birds, Barnes said. Huge piles of stinky seaweed also are a headache for the Caribbean, where tourism often generates big money for small islands. In the popular tourist spot of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, officials have invested in barriers to prevent sargassum from reaching the shore. In the Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten, crews with backhoes were dispatched in late May as part of an emergency cleanup after residents complained of strong smells of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which can affect a person’s respiratory system. “The smell is quite terrible,” Barnes said. Meanwhile, in the French Caribbean, officials expect to soon use storage barges and an upgraded special vessel that can collect several tonnes of seaweed a day. The sargassum “disfigures our coasts, prevents swimming and makes life impossible for local residents”, the French prime minister, François Bayrou, recently told reporters. But Frank Comito, special adviser to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said such vessels were “massively expensive” and not a popular option, noting that another method – using heavy equipment – is labor-intensive. “You have to be careful because there could be sea turtle eggs affected,” he said. “It’s not like you can go in there and massively rake and scrape the whole thing.” Some Caribbean islands struggle financially, so most of the cleanup is done by hotels, with some offering guests refunds or a free shuttle to unaffected beaches. Every year, the amount of sargassum expands in late spring, peaks around summer and starts to decline in the late fall or early winter, Barnes said. The new record is likely to be broken – experts said they expect even more sargassum for June.",

    "title": "Lee Jae-myung: from child labourer to leader of deeply scarred South Korea",
    "article_text": "Lee Jae-myung will need to draw on his considerable survival instincts as he attempts to steer South Korea out of thepolitical morass of the past six months. The liberal candidate,who on Tuesday became the country’s president at the third attemptafter defeating his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, has promised to govern for all South Koreans – and for good reason. After a swift transfer of power that see him take office on Wednesday, Lee will inherit a deeply scarred country. He faces the task of restoring stability after his predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol’s disastrousattempt to impose martial lawin December, in what he said was an attempt to eliminate “anti-state forces”. And Lee will be expected to move quickly to address domestic issues that have been largely sidelined whileSouth Koreaconfronted its biggest political crisis in decades: income inequality, the soaring cost of living and – a hardy perennial for South Korean leaders – how to resurrect dialogue with an increasingly erratic North Korea. Lee, 61, a former factory worker who became a human rights lawyer before entering politics, is no stranger to adversity – or controversy. He campaigned behind protective screens, wearing a bulletproof vest and surrounded by armed guards – an unprecedented precaution in democratic South Korea prompted by reported threats to his life and, in January last year,a knife attackin which he sustained neck injuries that required emergency surgery. The threats to Lee are not only physical. He begins his single five-year term creaking beneath the weight of continuing legal cases that could plunge his presidency into crisis before it has barely begun. Lee faces several charges – which he has denied – the most serious that he made false statement during a televised debate during his last presidential campaign, in 2022. He brings experience of the rough and tumble of South Korean politics, having served as the former leader of the main opposition Democratic party, as well as stints as a governor and mayor. South Korean media have described Lee as stubborn and determined, qualities they trace to his early years as one of seven children growing up in a poor family in Andong, North Gyeongsang province. His education was hardly an ideal preparation for a career in law and politics. He frequently skipped classes at primary school – a 5km walk from home – and quit school as a teenager to work in factories to help his mother and sister, both toilet cleaners, pay the bills after they moved to Seongnam, near Seoul. At 13 he was left with a permanent disability after his wrist was crushed by an industrial press. The injury meant he was later exempted from mandatory military service. Lee eventually passed his school exams before studying law on a scholarship, passing the bar exam in 1986 before becoming a human rights lawyer and activist. His transition to politics mirrored the struggling start to his education: he failed to get elected as mayor of Seongnam at his first attempt in 2006, succeeding four years later. Having lost his party’s nomination for president to Moon Jae-in in 2017,Lee was defeated in the 2022 electionby Yoon by the slimmest margin – less than one percentage point – in South Korea’s history, after an acrimonious campaign that offered a foretaste of the division that would characterise Yoon’s time in office. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Lee had benefited from public anger directed towards Yoon and his People Power party [PPP]. “Lee’s victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon’s spectacular collapse,” Easley said. As polling day approached, Lee appeared to agree that Yoon was his greatest electoral asset. In a speech on Monday, he promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and heal a divided country, cautioning that a vote for his PPP opponent, Kim, could reopen the door to Yoon’s “rebellion forces”. He said: “If they somehow win, that will mean … the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation.” Lee was given temporary relief from his legal headaches after courts approved his request to postpone further hearings until after Tuesday’s election. But any guilty verdict now that he is president would spark a debate over constitutional provisions that shield South Korean leaders from criminal prosecution, except against allegations of insurrection or treason. Observers wonder if presidential immunity would halt the prosecutions, or simply prevent any new charges from being brought. Lee called Tuesday’s election “judgment day” for South Korea. He was referring to the opportunity it gave voters to move on from the Yoon era – but his own moment of reckoning may not be far behind.",

    "title": "Lee Jae-myung wins election as South Korean president",
    "article_text": "Liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung has won the vote to become South Korea’s new president after asnap electiontriggered by a brief period of martial law imposed by the now-impeached former leader,Yoon Suk Yeol. With 100% of the ballots counted, Lee won 49.42% of nearly 35 million votes cast, while his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo had taken 41.15%, according to national election commission data, which said turnout was the highest for a presidential election since 1997. Speaking outside his home, Lee thanked voters for placing their trust in him. “I will do my utmost to fulfil the great responsibility and mission entrusted to me, so as not to disappoint the expectations of our people,” he told reporters. He said he would not forget the duty of a president to unite the people. Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who had made two failed attempts to become president, rode a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December. The order, which was overturned in a matter of hours, sparked South Korea’sbiggest political crisis in decades. The country is also battling an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump. Kim, however, struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party feuded over how to view Yoon’s legacy. Turnout was high, at 77.8% an hour before the polls closed, surpassing the figure recorded in the previous presidential election in 2022, according to the national election commission. More than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters had cast their ballots in early voting last Thursday and Friday. Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional courtupheld Yoon’s impeachmentin early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health. In a Facebook message on Tuesday, Lee had cast the election as voters’ opportunity to “save South Korea, which is in crisis due to the greed of the establishment”. But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow Lee into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period. Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months todenounceor support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets. “The economy has gotten so much worse since December … Not just for me but I hear that from everybody,” said Kim Kwang-ma, an 81-year-old voter. “And we as a people have become so polarised … I wish we could come together so that Korea can develop again.” Lee, a frontrunner since the start of the campaign, will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. In his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a victorious Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election. Lee “is now trying to seize all power inSouth Koreaand establish a Hitler-like dictatorship”, Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan. Lee, who headed the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics. He faces criminal trials including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal. Courts agreed to postpone further hearings of continuing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remained unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution. Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment. He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor. But he wants to move away from Yoon’s confrontational approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour. He has conceded, though, that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.",

    "title": "Austrian newspaper cuts ties with writer over Clint Eastwood ‘exclusive’",
    "article_text": "One of Austria’s leading newspapers has severed ties with a Hollywood reporter after admitting she repackaged old comments by Clint Eastwood and presented them as a supposedlyexclusive interview. In an apparent journalistic coup, the Vienna-based daily Kurier published a Q&A with Eastwood last Friday and it was picked up around the world over the weekend due to the Oscar-winning actor’s outspoken criticism of Hollywood’s “era of remakes and franchises”. On Monday, however, Eastwood released a statement saying he had never spoken to Kurier’s interviewer and that the exchange was “entirely phoney”. In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, Kurier’s editor, Martin Gebhart, denied that the quotes had been made up, saying the author of the article had “convincingly explained that she had spoken to Eastwood 18 times at round tables,” referring to group interviews commonly held at festivals. However, Gebhart conceded that presenting material from several such encounters with the press as an exclusive interview did not comply with his newspaper’s “quality standards”, and he said it would not work with the reporter in the future. “Even though no quotes were fabricated, the interviews are documented, and the accusation of fabrication can be refuted, we will no longer work with the author in the future because transparency and our strict editorial standards are paramount to us,” he said. The author of the piece, Elisabeth Sereda, a US-based Austrian journalist, has regularly written on Hollywood celebrities for Kurier and other Austrian media. A member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, she is listed as a voting member on thewebsiteof the Golden Globes. In recent months, Kurier has published Sereda-bylined interviews with several high-profile actors including Pamela Anderson, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jude Law. Sources close to Law said no interview between the British actor and the Austrian journalist had taken place and that the only time Kurier could have obtained direct quotes would have been at a press conference at the Toronto international film festival last year where Law spoke to promote his survival thriller Eden. Sereda has been approached by the Guardian for comment. Intended to mark Eastwood’s 95th birthday, the quotes featured in the Kurier piece attracted worldwide attention. “I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote films like Casablanca in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea,” the actor was quoted as saying. “My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home.” In his statement to the trade publication Deadline, Eastwood said: “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phoney.”",

    "title": "Major evacuation in Cologne after second world war bombs discovered",
    "article_text": "The biggest evacuation in Cologne since the second world war is under way after the discovery of three unexploded bombs dropped by allied forces 80 years ago. About 20,000 people are having to leave their homes and businesses, while hotels, a care home for elderly people and a hospital are being evacuated. Three bridges over the Rhine have been closed and rail traffic has been halted or diverted. Numerous schools, kindergartens, museums and the tram network, as well as the home of the city’s philharmonic orchestra, have had to close after the entire old town was brought to a halt. The broadcaster RTL had to shift its news programmes to studios in Berlin as its Cologne building sits inside the evacuation area of about 1,000 metres in radius. Several programmes that were due to be transmitted live had to be recorded instead, the broadcaster said. The bombs are due to be defused on Wednesday morning. They are US-produced bombs, two of 1,000kg and one of 500kg. They were discovered on Monday on the right bank of the Rhine during building works near the Deutz shipworks. All three are equipped with impact fuzes intended to cause detonation on contact with a hard surface. Volunteers, police and other city authorities will carry out a round of checks ringing on doorbells, calling through letter boxes and gathering information from residents about their neighbours on Wednesday morning before attempts to defuse the bombs can start. Police have said they have the authority to use force to remove anyone who refuses to leave voluntarily. Locals can call a hotline or refer to awebsitefor advice. Tents and other facilities such as sport halls and churches outside the evacuated area will be open to provide people with food, refreshments and support, city authorities said. Eighty years after the end of the second world war, such finds are stillnot unusual in Cologne, which was among Germany’s most heavily bombed cities during the conflict. It was hit in 262 air raids carried out by the RAF, sometimes using US-produced bombs, especially towards the end of the conflict. About 20,000 people were killed in the bombing raids. On the night of 30 May 1942, the city was the target of the RAF’s first “thousand-bomber raid” on a German city. More than 1,000 aircraft were dispatched, flying in a narrow “bomber stream” formation, the density of which had the effect of overwhelming German radar and defences. On this single night, 868 bombers attacked the city with 1,455 tons of bombs in what was known as Operation Millennium. It is not yet known exactly when the bombs currently awaiting defusing were dropped.",

Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed head of the Zaporizhzhia region in southernUkraine, said the process of reconnecting consumers to the power grid was under way after a Ukrainian attack left people without power.Balitsky said on Telegram that around 20% of the more than 600,000 people left without electricity now had power again. The Kremlin says it is “unlikely” a meeting between Russian presidentVladimir Putin, his Ukrainian counterpart,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and US presidentDonald Trumpwould take place soon. “In the near future, it is unlikely,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the chances of a meeting, adding that such a summit could only happen after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reach an “agreement”. Defence sources believe that Britain will be forced to sign up to a target of lifting defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2035 at this month’sNatosummit after a campaign by the alliance’s secretary general to keepDonald Trumponboard. One senior insider said Britain would “without a doubt” sign up to a proposal from the Nato chief,Mark Rutte, to lift allies’ defence spending, which would represent a real-terms increase of about £30bn from the Labour government’s plan. US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth will go to Brussels on Thursday to participate in the Nato defence ministers meeting and travel to Normandy, France, on Friday for D-day commemorations, the department said in a statement.Hegseth will deliver a message advancing President Donald Trump’s call for Nato allies to commit spending 5% of their GDP on defence, the department said on Tuesday.

China denied on Tuesday that its scientific and technological achievements were due to “stolen” intellectual property, after comments by the Dutch defence minister accusing Beijing of intensifying its espionage, especially on semiconductors. China firmly opposes attempts to “smear” it using accusations of “spying” and “cyber-attacks” as a pretext, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a written response to Reuters. It urged relevant sides to look at China objectively and fairly. The Dutch military intelligence agency said last year that Chinese spies had targeted the Dutch semiconductor, aerospace and maritime industries. Such attacks have intensified, Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans said at a forum on Saturday.

It said seven people were killed and 113 injured, including children, when two trains crashed in Russia’s Kursk and Bryansk regions as a result of the attacks. Dick Schoofis a career civil servant who was handpicked byGeert Wildersa year ago to lead the government. He had tried to prevent the break up of the coalition this morning, but the meeting was short lived, with Wilders effectively collapsing the government when he walked out of it. The far-right leader had said earlier on Tuesday that all his party’s ministers would quit the government after the other three parties in the coalition had rejected his radical proposals on immigration. As my colleague Jon Henleynotes in this story, Wilders had warned last week that if his plans were not adopted, the PVV – the largest party in parliament, with 37 seats – would be “out of the cabinet”. He wanted the coalition to adopt a 10-point plan aimed at radically reducing immigration and asylum, including enlisting the army to secure and patrol the borders, turning all asylum seekers back at the border and closing refugee accommodation facilities. Wilders also proposed sending all Syrian refugees home, suspending EU asylum quotas and banning family members joining refugees already in the country. Legal experts have said several of the proposals breached European human rights laws or the UN refugee convention, to which theNetherlandsis a signatory. Dick Schoofis expected to offer the resignation of the cabinet toKing Willem-Alexanderbefore the end of the day. Schoof said Wilders’ dramatic decision to leave the coalition was “irresponsible and unnecessary”. “As far as I’m concerned, this shouldn’t have happened,” he said. Schoof said his coalition government will become a caretaker administration up until the new election, a date for which has not been set yet. It means that theNetherlandswill have a caretaker government when it hosts a summit of Nato leaders in three weeks, during which alliance members will likely be asked to commit more money to defence spending amid mounting concerns about Russian aggression spreading beyond Ukraine.

After unveiling the defence overhaul on Monday, Healey saidEuropewas facing war, growing Russian aggression, new nuclear risks and daily cyber-attacks. Russia’s embassy issued a statement on Tuesday criticising what it described as “a fresh salvo of anti-Russian rhetoric”. “Russia poses no threat to the United Kingdom and its people,” the statement said. “We harbour no aggressive intentions and have no plans to attack Britain.

    "article_text": "Rome taxi drivers are in uproar at the suggestion they drive as badly as madMax Verstappen, with some challenging Formula One drivers to navigate the traffic and potholes of the Italian capital as skilfully as they do. Verstappen, a four-time F1 champion, was issued with a penalty on Sunday after crashing into George Russell’s Mercedesin the Spanish Grand Prix. Respondingto questionsabout the incident from an Italian journalist, Toto Wolff, the Mercedes F1 principal, said: “This is road rage, like the taxi drivers in Rome or Naples.” The journalist tried to defend his country’s drivers, saying: “We have improved a lot inItaly.” Wolff said: “There’s a lot of aggression in the centre of Rome and Naples, without rules.” While the remarks appear to have been shrugged off by taxi drivers in Naples, their counterparts in Rome, who in recent years have had to contend with wayward electric scooter riders, omnipresent construction sites and tourists being shown around in golf buggies, were outraged. “Maybe it would be better if Wolff focused on [the performance] of his own team,” Loreno Bittarelli, president of Rome’s largest taxi cooperative, toldCorriere della Seranewspaper. Nicola Di Giacobbe, from the taxi union, Filt-Cgil, joked: “We drive like a Mercedes since it only goes 30 miles an hour, just like us.” However, Di Giacobbe conceded that Rome has serious problems when it comes to traffic congestion and rule-flouting, making mobility in the city “a no man’s land”. Roberto, a taxi driver with 40 years’ experience, told Corriere: “We are the best at driving in the chaotic traffic of this city. We are more patient and expert than the average driver. This city has gotten worse in recent years – now it takes 30 minutes to go two kilometres.” Fellow tax driver, Alessandro, referred to Wolff’s comments as “a banal cliche”. “We are the ones who are first in not having accidents, otherwise we would lose our working day,” he said. “I would like to seeFormula Onedrivers manoeuvring around construction sites, scooters and golf carts the way we do. Rome is now a jungle, not a Formula One track.”",

    "title": "Israel warns Palestinians against travel on roads to Gaza aid hubs, labelling them ‘combat zones’",
    "article_text": "Israel’s military has warned residents of Gaza against travel in areas leading to aid distribution centres, after at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for food at the points set up by the US-backed foundation. An Israeli military spokesperson on Tuesday said roads leading to the distribution centres set up by theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF) were considered “combat zones”. In a post on social media, the GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organisation and efficiency improvement work”. The group did not give more information on the improvements it intended to make. Operations would resume on Thursday, the group claimed. The organisation said it was in discussion with the Israeli military to boost security measures beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites. Gaza’s health ministry said27 people were killed early on Tuesdayas they gathered to received food at one of the GHF’s food distribution hubs. It was the third such incident in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at Palestinians who were moving towards them. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”. “The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. “The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were. A spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza and is backed by Israel, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”. The incident ocurred as the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub. The United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime. “Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid inGazaare unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.” Witnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub. Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site. ‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’ ‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi. Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, claiming Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters. The group denies this and aid officials in Gazahave said there was no evidenceof any widespread diversion of aid at any stage of the conflict. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation. The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population. On Tuesday, an evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues wasappointed the new head of the GHF. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, was appointed the new head of the GHF after Jake Wood, a former marine, resigned,saying that he could not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests.

    "article_text": "An evangelical leader and adviser to Donald Trump on interfaith issues has been appointed the new head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) as the controversial US- and Israeli-backed initiative attempts to recover from top-level resignations during a tumultuous rollout last week. Johnnie Moore, a member of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and founder of the boutique advisory firm Kairos Company, was appointed the new head of the GHF after Jake Wood, a former marine, resigned,saying that he could not guarantee the GHF’s independencefrom Israeli interests. Moore has been a vocal defender of the GHF who has bristled at public criticism of the rollout, telling the UN chief, António Guterres, on X that reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid inGazawas “a lie … spread by terrorists”. Major partners continue to abandon the GHF, which was launched with vocal support from US government officials. Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a US consulting firm, said it had cancelled its contract with the GHF on Tuesday amid growing media scrutiny into the group’s work and sources of funding. In a post on its social media, the GHF announced that its distribution points would be closed on Wednesday for “update, organization and efficiency improvement work”. The group did not give more information on the improvements it intended to make. Operations would resume on Thursday, the group claimed. In a statement, Moore lauded the GHF’s reported delivery of more than 7m meals in the last week, numbers that haven’t been independently verified, and also took aim at media reports about murky finances and chaotic rollouts of the aid distribution centres in Gaza. Local health officials said thatat least one person was killed and more than 50 people injuredon 27 May when Israeli troops opened fire on the second day of operations at a GHF distribution centre. “GHF believes that serving the people of Gaza with dignity and compassion must be the top priority,” Moore said in a statement. “We welcome others to join us and urge extreme caution against sharing unverified information from sources that have repeatedly issue demonstrably false reports. “False reporting of violence at our sites has a chilling effect on the local population and we can think of no greater disservice to a community in dire need,” he said. A biography on the Kairos website calls Moore a “noted evangelical friend of the State of Israel” and says that he has played an important role in US outreach to Middle Eastern governments, including in the conclusion of the Abraham accords to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states. John Acree, the acting director of the GHF, said that Moore has a “proven record of principled leadership and hands-on humanitarian work”. But Moore’s paucity of experience working with major charitable organisations will make it difficult for him to refute criticisms about the GHF’s lack of independence and experience dealing with a major humanitarian crisis. BCG, which was reported to be handling key logistics planning, abandoned the project late last week and a representative told CNN that “unapproved follow-on work relating to Gaza lacked buy-in from multilateral stakeholders and was stopped on May 30”. “BCG has not and will not be paid for any of this work,” the organisation said. BCG also told reporters that they had placed the employee responsible for overseeing the project on administrative leave pending an internal review. The Washington Post, which first reported on BCG cutting ties with the GHF, said that the consulting group was instrumental in planning GHF’s operations. Three people closely connected to both theGHF and BCG told the Washington Post that it would be difficult for the foundation to continue to function without the consultants who helped create it. “In addition to helping develop the initiative in close coordination with Israel, BCG set the prices for paying and equipping the array of contractors who built four distribution hubs in southern Gaza to deliver the aid,” the newspaper reported.",

    "title": "Masked Israeli troops block media visit to West Bank site of Oscar-winning film",
    "article_text": "Masked Israeli soldiers have blocked an international group of reporters from visiting Palestinian villages on the West Bank that have been under sustained attack by Jewish settlers, and which were the subject of anOscar-winning documentary film. TheAcademy Award won by No Other Landhas not stopped the attacks on Masafer Yatta, a cluster of villages on the southern edge of the occupied territory, which has been the target of settler violence and house demolitions and forced displacement by the army for many years. After soldiers almost complete destroyed one of the hamlets in the area, Khalet Al-Daba’a, in early May, two of the film’s co-directors, Yuval Abraham and Basel Adra, invited journalists to visit the area, which is Adra’s home, to witness the extent of the destruction first hand. “It’s not easy for me to write this, but my community Masafer Yatta will be destroyed unless more activists and journalists don’t urgently come and join us on the ground,” Adra wrote on X. “Settlers are now in [Khalet Al-Daba’a] village 24/7 after the army destroyed it.” The convoy of 20 reporters in press vehicles was stopped on the way to Masafer Yatta on Monday by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers wearing black balaclava-type masks hiding most of their faces. In a video taken at the scene andposted by Abraham, an IDF major gives the journalists “a reasonable time of 10 minutes” to leave. The two film-makers can be seen remonstrating with the officer, pointing out that Adra had invited the journalists to his own home. “They are coming to see the destruction in Masafer Yatta, the way that you are destroying the community, the settler violence,” Abraham says. The major responds by saying that the journalists were being prevented from visiting “to keep order in this area”, claiming they were causing a “public disturbance”. Adra replies: “You didn’t prevent the settlers when they came to burn the homes inside, the cars, and attack people. I have so many videos of settlers coming to attack us and shoot people here. You do nothing. Why? Why now, only when journalists are coming to see this and to film this and to interview people, [are] you coming to prevent them?” He later wrote on X: “This is what it means to live under occupation: a masked soldier decides who and when can pass, when to destroy or to invade our homes.” The IDF was asked for comment on Monday’s incident but did not provide one. TheInternational Solidarity Movement, a group set up to resist land seizures on occupied Palestinian territory, has said that two of its activists were detained in Khalet Al-Daba’a on Saturday, and that one of them, a 48-year-old Swedish resident of London, Susanne Björk, was deported. No Other Land, made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, won the Oscar on 2 March as the year’s best documentary feature. Three weeks later, another of its co-directors, Hamdan Ballal, wasattacked at his homein Masafer Yatta by a group of settlers and then detained by the IDF. Backed by the hardline coalition of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, settlers have accelerated their seizure of Palestinian land and villages since the start of the Gaza war in October 2023. The government announced last week that it wouldestablish 22 new settlementsin the occupied territory, legalising a series of outposts initially established without official authorisation. The defence minister, Israel Katz, said the creation of the new settlements was “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel”.",

    "title": "At least 27 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire at food point, Gaza officials say",
    "article_text": "At least 27 people were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for food at a distribution point set up by an Israeli-backed foundation in Gaza, according to health officials in the strip. It is the third such incident in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at individuals who were moving towards them. The Gaza civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal told Agence France-Presse: “Israeli forces opened fire with tanks and drones on thousands of civilians who had gathered since dawn near the al-Alam roundabout in the al-Mawasi area, north-west of Rafah.” It is the same site where on Sunday more than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli firewhile they were heading to the distribution hub. Gaza’s health ministry said 27 people were killed early on Tuesday. Hamas-affiliated media also carried the reports. The United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime. “Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid inGazaare unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.” “There were three children and two women among the dead,” Mohammed Saqr, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, which received the 27 bodies, told the Guardian. “Most of the patients had gunshot wounds, others had shrapnel all over the bodies, which means they were targeted with tanks or artillery munitions.” Doctors at Nasser hospital said the Israeli forces had mostly targeted the heads, the chest and the upper parts of the bodies of the victims, and that the health facility was running out of blood units and medical supplies. Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed its field hospital in Rafah had received 184 wounded people, 19 of whom were declared dead on arrival. Eight more later died from their wounds. A video circulating on social media documented the arrival of injured people at the Red Cross hospital from a food distribution point in Gaza’s Rafah governorate. It showed dead bodies and the injured being dragged by people inside the health facility. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”. “The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces. “The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were. A spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed organisation that has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”. Witnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub. Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site. ‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’ ‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi. Ahmad al-Shaer, 22, who went to the aid distribution point with his friend Hasni Abu Shanab, 35, said the gunfire started at about 5am. “When the shooting began, Hasni lay flat on the ground to avoid the bullets, but even then a bullet hit him, it pierced one of his legs, exited, and then penetrated the other leg, where it lodged. The gunfire was coming from all directions and bullets were falling everywhere around him,” he said. Shaer said Abu Shanab was moved to Nasser hospital and that the facility was “full of people in critical condition. There aren’t enough beds, rooms or medical equipment for all the cases.” He added: “Hasni went to the aid site because he had no other choice. He was desperate to feed his three children. He had nothing to offer them and couldn’t meet their basic needs.” Tamer Nassar, 33, from Beit Hanoun, who has been displaced to al-Mawasi in Khan Younis said: “I went at dawn to the American food aid distribution point in Rafah. The gunfire suddenly and deliberately erupted at everyone present in the distribution area. Bullets were raining down on us from everywhere: from the sea, from the air, from the hills, from all directions. I was a victim, along with many others around me; some were injured, others were killed. “I raised my shoulder while trying to lie on my stomach, and that’s when the first bullet struck my shoulder,” he said. “Anyone who tried to help the wounded was also shot at. We decided to go there today despite the extreme danger. If we had food at home to silence our children’s hunger, we wouldn’t have gone and risked our lives. They took images of my injuries and found that the first bullet had entered and exited, but the second one remained lodged in the bone and shattered it.” The shootings follow other similar incidents recently in which Palestinians have been killed and injured by Israeli fire as they sought food at newly established distribution points. Last Wednesday,Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestiniansand wounding 46 others near one of the GHF distribution sites. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to the site. More than30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sundayas they went to receive food at a GHF distribution point, according to witnesses. A hospital run by the Red Cross confirmed it treated many wounded. The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians” in Sunday’s incident. However, an IDF official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops”, near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were. Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had killed more than 102 civilians since the opening of the of aid centres run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation. The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.

    "title": "Sellafield nuclear clean-up too slow and too costly, say MPs",
    "article_text": "MPs have warned about the speed and cost of cleaning up the Sellafield nuclear waste dump and raised concerns over a “suboptimal” workplace culture at the site. Members of parliament’s public accounts committee (PAC) urged the government and bosses at the sprawling collection of crumbling buildings in Cumbria to get a grasp on the “intolerable risks” presented by its ageing infrastructure. In a detailed report into the site, the PAC said Sellafield was not moving quickly enough to tackle its biggest hazards; raised the alarm over its culture; and said the government was not ensuring value for money was being achieved from taxpayer funds. In 2023, the Guardian’sNuclear Leaksinvestigation revealed a string of safety concerns at the site – including escalating fears over aleak of radioactive liquidfrom a decaying building known as the Magnox swarf storage silo (MSSS) – as well as cybersecurity failings and allegations of a poor workplace culture. The PAC – whichheard evidencein March from Sellafield and its oversight body, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) – found that the state-owned company had missed most of its annual targets to retrieve waste from several buildings, including the MSSS. “As a result of Sellafield’s underperformance [the MSSS] will likely remain extremely hazardous for longer,” the MPs said. The ultimate cost of cleaning up Sellafield, which contains waste from weapons programmes and atomic power generation, has beenestimated at £136bnand could take more than 100 years. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the PAC, said: “Unfortunately, our latest report is interleaved with a number of examples of failure, cost overruns, and continuing safety concerns. Given the tens of billions at stake, and the dangers on site to both the environment and human life, this is simply not good enough.” He added: “As with the fight against climate change, the sheer scale of the hundred-year timeframe of the decommissioning project makes it hard to grasp the immediacy of safety hazards and cost overruns that delays can have. “Every day at Sellafield is a race against time to complete works before buildings reach the end of their life. Our report contains too many signs that this is a race that Sellafield risks losing.” MPs noted that one project, a now-paused replacement of an on-site lab, had resulted in “£127m wasted”. The cost of cleaning up Sellafield has causedtensions with the Treasuryas the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempts to tighten public spending and spur growth. Sellafield, which is home to the world’s largest store of plutonium, said in February that nearly £3bn in new funding was“not enough”. Last year, Sellafield apologised and wasfined £332,500after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings. The PAC noted that the timeline for a government project to create a long-term deep underground store for nuclear waste, including that held at Sellafield, had slipped from 2040 to the late 2050s. The government is considering sites in Cumbria and Lincolnshire, although Lincolnshire county council is expected to withdraw the latter from the process aftervocal local opposition. The MPs said they had found “indications of a suboptimal culture” at Sellafield, and noted that theNDA paid £377,200in 2023-24 to settle employment-related claims. Alison McDermott, a former HR consultant whoraised concerns over bullying and a “toxic culture”at the site, said she felt “vindicated” by the report. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The PAC urged the government to set out how it would hold the NDA and Sellafield to account over its performance. It said Sellafield should report annually on progress against targets and explain how it is addressing the deteriorating condition of its assets. The NDA should publish data on the prevalence of bullying and harassment at nuclear sites, it said. Clifton-Brown said there were “early indications of some improvements in Sellafield’s delivery” but said the government needed to do “far more” to ensure bosses safeguard the public and taxpayer funds. The NDA’s chief executive, David Peattie, responding on behalf of Sellafield, said: “We welcome the scrutiny of the committee and their report. We will now look in more detail at the recommendations and consider how best to address them. “We take the findings seriously, and the safety of the site and the wellbeing of our people will always be our highest priorities.” A spokesperson for the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero said: “We expect the highest standards of safety and security as former nuclear sites are dismantled, and the regulator is clear that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield. “We continue to support the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in its oversight of Sellafield, while driving value for money. This is underpinned by monthly performance reviews and increased responsibility for overseeing major project performance, enabling more direct scrutiny and intervention. “We have zero-tolerance of bullying, harassment and offensive behaviour in the workplace – we expect Sellafield and the NDA to operate on this basis, investigate allegations and take robust action when needed.”",

    "article_text": "Marty McFly grabbed a guitar in Back to the Future and rocked out with the band at a 1950s high school dance, helping him narrowly avoid blinking out of existence before time-traveling back to the 1980s. The guitar, in real life, wasn’t as lucky. Film-makers went looking for the instrument while making the movie’s 1989 sequel, but even now it’s nowhere to be found. Four decades after the blockbuster film debuted, the guitar’s creator has launched a search for the cherry red Gibson ES-345. Gibson, which is based in Nashville, is asking the public for help tracking it down as the movie turns 40 and as the company produces a new documentary about the search and the film, Lost to the Future. In a video by Gibson, with the movie’s theme song playing in the background, Back to the Future stars such as Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Harry Waters Jr make a cinematic plea. There’s also a surprise appearance by Huey Lewis, whose band Huey Lewis and the News performed the soundtrack’s headliner song, The Power of Love. Lloyd, in the cadence of Doc Brown, says in the video that the guitar has been “lost to the future”. “It’s somewhere lost in the space-time continuum,” says Fox, who played McFly. “Or it’s in some Teamster’s garage.” In the film, McFly steps in for an injured band member at the 1955 school dance with the theme Enchantment under the Sea, playing the guitar as students slow dance to Earth Angel. He then leads Marvin Berry and the Starlighters in a rendition of Johnny B Goode, calling it an oldie where he comes from even though the 1958 song doesn’t exist yet for his audience. Fox said he wanted McFly to riff through his favorite guitarists’ signature styles – Jimi Hendrix behind the head, Pete Townshend’s windmill and the Eddie Van Halen hammer. After digging and dancing to Johnny B Goode, the students at the dance fall into an awkward silence as McFly’s riffs turn increasingly wild. “I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet,” McFly says. “But your kids are gonna love it.”",

    "title": "US judge rules prisons must provide gender-affirming care for trans people",
    "article_text": "A US judge on Tuesday ruled the US Bureau of Prisons must keep providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office to halt funding for such care. US district judge Royce Lamberth in Washington DC allowed a group of more than 2,000 transgender inmates in federal prisons to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action. He ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide them with hormone therapy and accommodations such as clothing and hair-removal devices while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling does not require the bureau to provide surgical care related to gender transitions. Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said theTrump administrationexpects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute. “The district court’s decision allowing transgender women, aka MEN, in women’s prisons fundamentally makes women less safe and ignores the biological truth that there are only two genders,” Fields said in an email. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the prisoners, said the ruling was “a critical reminder to the Trump administration that trans people, like all people, have constitutional rights that don’t simply disappear because the president has decided to wage an ideological battle”. About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the Department of Justice. About two-thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men’s prisons. The named plaintiffs, two transgender men and one transgender woman, sued the Trump administration in March to challenge Trump’s 20 January executive order aimed at combating what the administration called “gender ideology extremism”. The executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; and house transgender women in men’s prisons. It also ordered the bureau to stop spending any money on “any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex”. Lamberth, appointed by the Republican president Ronald Reagan, said in Tuesday’s ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their lawsuit because the bureau did not perform any analysis before cutting off treatment that its own medical staff had previously deemed to be medically appropriate for the inmates. Even if it had extensively studied the issue before deciding to stop gender-affirming care, the decision might still violate the US constitution’s eighth amendment’s protections against “cruel and unusual” punishment, Lamberth wrote. The Department of Justice had argued that the judge should defer to the policy decision of a democratically elected president, but Lamberth said a functioning democracy requires respect for “all duly enacted laws”, including those that blocked the executive branch from acting in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner. Democratic self-governance “does not mean blind submission to the whims of the most recent election-victor”, Lamberth wrote. The executive order said it was meant to promote the “dignity, safety, and wellbeing of women, and to stop the spread of ‘gender ideology’” which denies “the immutable biological reality of sex”. But the inmates receiving hormone treatments had little interest in promoting any ideology, and were instead taking “measures to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria”, Lamberth wrote.",

    "title": "Closing arguments begin in sexual misconduct trial of Harvey Weinstein",
    "article_text": "The third sexual misconduct trial of former movie mogulHarvey Weinsteinwas rapidly heading toward a conclusion on Tuesday, as prosecutors and the defense began delivering closing arguments in Manhattan criminal court. “If there is a doubt about their case, you gotta throw it out,” defense attorney Arthur Aidala said of three women who testified against Weinstein. “These are the people they want you to believe – they’re all women with broken dreams.” Aidala argued that prosecutors failed to prove Weinstein’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, despite hours of carefully preparing their witnesses to build a case to get “the poster boy, the original sinner” of the#MeToo movement.Weinstein’s accusers, he continued, were untrustworthy. “He’s the one who’s getting used,” Aidala said, and described the encounters as part of a “courting game” between men and women.“They are lying about what happened. Not about everything, but about a small slice – just enough to turn their regret, their buyer’s remorse, into criminality,” Aidala said. “Mr Weinstein sits here an innocent man. The presumption of innocence ... The only ones who can take that away are the 12 of you … ” He concluded: “If this guy wasn’tHarvey Weinstein, would we even be here?” District attorney Nicole Blumberg followed with a summation that Weinstein had used his power in the entertainment industry to “physically and emotionally overpower” his accusers. “He didn’t have an interest in their careers,” Blumberg said. “He had an interest in their bodies. He didn’t care what they wanted. He cared what he wanted.” Addressing Aidala’s claim that Weinstein was “the one getting abused here”, Blumberg said: “The defense is no victim in this case – and to suggest otherwise is offensive.” The prosecution is scheduled to continue its closing on Wednesday before the case is handed to the jury for deliberations. Six weeks after prosecutors began laying out their case against him (largely a re-airing of a 2020 criminal prosecution, with one additional accuser, that was later overturned on appeal), the matter will be deliberated again by jurors, without Weinstein testifying. He is charged with assaulting three women in Manhattan between 2006 and 2013 – Mimi Haley, Jessica Mann and Kaja Sokola – and has been appearing in court each day in a wheelchair from Manhattan’s Bellevue hospital, where he is being treated for a number of ailments, including chronic myeloid leukemia. Manhattan’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, who is facing re-election this year, opted to retry Weinstein soon after his first conviction on third-degree rape and a criminal sexual charge was vacated because prosecutors were found to have prejudiced the jury by calling witnesses whose testimony was unrelated to the charges. The decision to bring a second prosecution inNew Yorkrequired the 73-year-old Weinstein to travel from California, where he was serving a 16-year sentence for sexual assault. The second New York trial avoided the most serious sexual assault charges that he was cleared of in 2020 to avoid double jeopardy. At trial, prosecutors have sought to establish that Weinstein used his power in the film industry to sexually assault and “exert enormous control” over the three women, each of whom were seeking to gain a footing in the business. In opening statements, assistant DA Shannon Lucey said Weinstein had offered his accusers film scripts and promises of fame, and he “used those dream opportunities as weapons”. Prosecutors avoided introducing so-called prior bad acts testimony – but brought an additional sex crimes charge related to Sokola, who accused Weinstein of performing oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel on one occasion in early 2006. Weinstein’s defense team pushed back on that claim, offering jurors the testimony of Helga Samuelsen, a friend of Sokola’s, who said Weinstein had visited Sokola months earlier in their shared apartment and spent about a half hour in a bedroom with her. Sokola earlier testified that the alleged encounter had not happened. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Weinstein’s defense also offered evidence that each of the three women had friendly relationships with the defendant before and after the alleged sexual assaults – and each had received compensation from a payout fund established after allegations were made against the movie mogul, triggering a public reckoning over gender power dynamics that came to be known as the #MeToomovement. Among the witnesses, Jessica Mann testified that she had what she considered a romantic relationship with Weinstein, who was then married. All three said they believed Weinstein could help them with their professional goals and maintained relationships with him, and, in some instances, he had helped them find work. Aidala told jurors that the three women had “fooled around with him consensually”, adding “they were flirtatious, they were friendly, they wanted him, they needed him, he could change the trajectories of their lives”. But a clinical psychologist, testifying for the prosecution, said that for a variety of reasons, it is not unusual for sexual assault victims to remain on good terms with their assailants after an assault. In total, prosecutors introduced evidence from 24 witnesses during Weinstein’s retrial. They included former assistants, friends of his accusers and workers at the hotels where the alleged assaults took place. Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty, elected not to testify in his defense – repeating the same decision he made in the earlier trials. Aidala said his client very much wanted to take the stand – and had been prepped to do so – before Weinstein decided against it as a matter of courtroom strategy.

In a video on Tuesday, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the family of Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “This terrorist will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Noem said in the video. “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it.” Police have accused the 45-year-old Soliman of throwing Molotov cocktailsinto a crowdthat had gathered for an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group calling for the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza. According to an affidavit, Soliman yelled “Free Palestine” while hurling the incendiary devices. The firebombs injured 12 people, three of whom remain hospitalised. Police have said Soliman planned the attack for more than a year. He is facing federal hate crime charges. “When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again,” J Bishop Grewell, Colorado’s acting US attorney, said during a news conference Monday. Soliman said that he acted alone and that nobody else knew of his plans. But officials with the administration of US President Donald Trump said they will investigate whether his wife and five children were aware of the suspect’s intentions. Administration officials have also highlighted the fact that Soliman, an Egyptian national, was in the US on an expired tourist visa, tying his arrest — and that of his family — to a larger push against undocumented immigration. “The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorism,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “Under the Trump administration, aliens will only be admitted into the United States through the legal process and only if they do not bear hostile attitudes towards our citizens, our culture, our government, our institutions or, most importantly, our founding principles.” Soliman’s family includes a wife and five children. The official White House account on the social media platform X indicated that they “could be deported by tonight”. “Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed’s Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon,” Tuesday’s postread. The attack comes amid rising tensions in the US over Israel’s continued war in Gaza, which United Nations experts and human rights groups havecompared to a genocide. It also comes less than two weeks after thefatal shootingof two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington, DC. Jewish as well as Muslim and Arab communities have reported sharp upticks in harassment and violence since the war began. Trump andhis allieshave used concerns about anti-Semitism as a pretext to push hardline policies on immigration and a crackdown on pro-Palestine activists. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” Trump said in a social media post on Monday. But the president and his supporters have themselves faced allegations of leaning intoanti-Semitic rhetoric. And his administration’s push to expel foreign nationals has caused alarm among civil liberties groups. The administration is currently attempting to deport several international students involved in pro-Palestine activity, including a Turkish graduate student named Rumeysa Ozturk. Her legal team argues that Ozturk appears to have been arrested for co-signing an op-ed calling for an end to the war in Gaza. Ozturkwas releasedfrom immigrant detention in May following a legal challenge, but she continues to face deportation proceedings.",

    "title": "Who is Lee Jae-myung, South Korea’s new president?",
    "article_text": "Lee Jae-myung’s hardscrabble path to the South Korean presidency mirrors his country’s stratospheric rise from grinding poverty to one of the world’s leading economies. When Lee, a scandal-prone school dropout-turned-lawyer who was elected in a landslide on Tuesday, was born in 1963, South Korea’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was comparable with sub-Saharan African nations. South Korea was so poor, in fact, that Lee’s exact birthday is a mystery – his parents, like many families alert to the sky-high infant mortality of the era, took about a year to register his birth. Yet even by the standards of the day, Lee’s early years were marked by deprivation and adversity, including stints as an underage factory labourer. Known for his populist and outspoken style, Lee, the standard bearer for the left-leaning Democratic Party, has often credited his humble beginnings with moulding his progressive beliefs. “Poverty is not a sin, but I was always particularly sensitive to the injustices I experienced because of poverty,” Lee said in a speech in 2022. “The reason I am in politics now is to help those still suffering in the pit of poverty and despair that I managed to escape, by building a fair society and a world with hope.” The fifth of seven children, Lee dropped out of school in his early teens to move to Seongnam, a satellite city of Seoul, and take up employment to support his family. At age 15, Lee was injured in an accident at a factory making baseball gloves, leaving him permanently unable to straighten his left arm. Despite missing years of formal education, Lee graduated from middle and high school by studying for the exams outside of work hours. In 1982, he gained admission to Chung-Ang University in Seoul to study law and went on to pass the bar exam four years later. During his law career, Lee was known for championing the rights of the underdog, including victims of industrial accidents and residents facing eviction due to urban redevelopment projects. In 2006, Lee made his first foray into politics with an unsuccessful bid for the mayorship of Seongnam, which he followed two years later with a failed run for a parliamentary seat in the city. In 2010, he finally broke into politics by winning Seongnam’s mayoral election on his second attempt and went on to earn re-election four years later. From 2018 to 2021, Lee served as governor of Gyeonggi, the country’s most populous province, which surrounds Seoul. Both as mayor and governor, Lee attracted attention beyond his immediate electorate by rolling out a series of populist-flavoured economic policies, including a limited form of universal basic income. After stepping down as governor, Lee entered the national stage as the Democratic Party candidate in the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Yoon Suk-yeol by 0.73 percent of the vote – the narrowest margin in South Korean history. Despite facing a slew of political and personal scandals, culminating in at least five legal cases, Lee led the Democratic Party to one of its best results in last year’s parliamentary elections, delivering it 173 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly. After Yoon’s impeachment and removal from the presidential office following his short-lived declaration of martial law in December, Lee earned his party’s nomination without serious challenge, garnering nearly 90 percent of the primary vote. “His communication style is direct and straightforward, and he is astute at recognising social and political trends, which is a rare quality among politicians of his generation in Korea,” Lee Myung-hee, an expert on South Korean politics at Michigan State University, told Al Jazeera. “However, this direct communication style can sometimes hinder his political advancement, as it may easily offend his opponents.” During his election campaign, Lee played down his progressive credentials in favour of a more pragmatic persona and a milder iteration of the populist economic agenda that powered his rise to national prominence. In the weeks leading to the vote, Lee’s victory was rarely in doubt, with his closest competitor, Kim Moon-soo, of the conservative People Power Party, often trailing the candidate by more than 20 points in opinion polls. As president, Lee has pledged to prioritise the economy, proposing, among other things, a major boost in investment in artificial intelligence, the introduction of a four-and-a-half-day work week, and tax deductions for parents in proportion to the number of children they have. On foreign affairs, he has promised to mend relations with North Korea while pushing for its ultimate denuclearisation – in keeping with the traditional stance of his Democratic Party – and maintain the US-Korea security alliance without alienating China and Russia. “I would call him a progressive pragmatist. I don’t think he will stick to any consistent progressive lines or even conservative lines,” Yong-chool Ha, director of the Center for Korea Studies at the University of Washington, told Al Jazeera. “Critics call him a kind of manipulator; his supporters call him flexible,” Ha said. “I would say he is a survivor.” While Lee will enter office with the backing of a commanding majority in the National Assembly, he will take stewardship of a country that is deeply polarised and racked by divisions following Yoon’s impeachment. “The Korean political landscape remains highly polarised and confrontational, and his ability to navigate this environment will be crucial to his success,” said Lee, the Michigan State University professor. Lee will also have to navigate a volatile international environment shaped by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, great power rivalries, and United States President Donald Trump’s shake-up of international trade. For Lee personally, his election, after two unsuccessful bids for the presidency, marks an extraordinary comeback befitting the against-the-odds origin story that propelled his rise. Lee had been facing five criminal proceedings, including charges of election law violations and breach of trust in connection with a land corruption scandal. Following his election, Lee is all but certain to avoid trial during his five-year term in office. Under the South Korean constitution, sitting presidents enjoy immunity from prosecution, except in cases of insurrection or treason – although there is debate among legal scholars about whether the protection extends to proceedings that are already under way. To remove ambiguity, the Democratic Party last month passed an amendment to the criminal code stating that criminal proceedings against a person who is elected president must be suspended until the end of their term.",

    "title": "Syria says Israeli attack on Deraa causes ‘significant’ losses",
    "article_text": "Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned an Israeli strike on the Syrian province of Deraa, saying that it caused “significant human and material losses”, the state news agency SANA reports. The strike came after the Israeli military said that two projectiles had crossed from Syria towards Israel on Tuesday, and fell in open areas in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights, though the Syrian Foreign Ministry said these were “reports that have not been verified yet”. The ministry reiterated that Syria has not and would not pose a threat to any party in the region. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the projectiles. “We believe that there are many parties that may seek to destabilise the region to achieve their own interests,” the ministry added. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said he held Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa responsible for the projectiles. “We consider the president of Syria directly responsible for any threat and fire towards the State of Israel, and a full response will come soon,” Katz said. Syria and Israel have recently engaged inindirect talksto ease tensions, a significant development in relations between states that have been on opposite sides of the conflict in the Middle East for decades. Several Arab and Palestinian media outlets circulated a claim of responsibility from a little-known group named the Muhammad Deif Brigades, an apparent reference to Hamas’s military leader who waskilled in an Israeli strikein 2024. The statement from the group could not be independently verified. The Israeli army said it attacked southern Syria with artillery fire after the projectiles launched at Israel. Residents said that Israeli mortars were striking the Wadi Yarmouk area, west of Deraa province, near the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The area has witnessed increased tensions in recent weeks, including reported Israeli military incursions into nearby villages, where residents have reportedly been barred from sowing their crops. Israel has waged a campaign ofaerial bombardmentthat has destroyed much of Syria’s military infrastructure. It has occupied the Syrian Golan Heights since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and taken more territory in the aftermath of Syrian PresidentBashar al-Assad’s removalin December, citing lingering concerns over the past of the country’s new government. Around the same time that Israel reported the projectiles from Syria, the Israeli military said it intercepted a missile from Yemen. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis said they targeted Israel’s Jaffa with a ballistic missile. The group has been launching attacks against Israel in what they say is in support of Palestinians during the Israeli war in Gaza.",

    "article_text": "Who:Germany vs PortugalWhat:UEFA Nations League semifinalWhen:WednesdayWhere:Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany How to follow our coverage:We’ll have all the build-up from 6pm (16:00 GMT) onAl Jazeera Sport. Hosts Germany and Portugal, the winners of the 2019 inaugural edition, face off in the first of theUEFA Nations Leaguesemifinals. Holders Spain and France play in the other tie on Thursday with their match being played in Stuttgart. Al Jazeera Sport looks at the first of the games and where the tournament itself ranks: The competition was formed to give more meaning to international matches played outside the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championships. Instead of a flow of international friendlies, which had become devalued by players and fans alike, nations now compete in a structured format that ends in a country being crowned Nations League champions. The teams that finish in the top two of their World Cup qualifying groups in Europe will automatically progress to the FIFA World Cup. The four highest placed teams from the Nations League that did not finish in the top two of their World Cup qualifying groups are then given an extra shot at reaching the global game’s showpiece event. It is an added incentive to all teams as a back-up plan should their official World Cup qualifying campaign fall flat. There are four groups in League A of the Nations League, four in League B and four in League C. The top two teams from each of the League A groups qualify for the knockout stages of the competition, which begins at the quarterfinals stage. Leagues B and C try to gain promotion to League A to incentivise all teams in their international match-ups and to offer the chance of reaching the final and lifting the trophy to all. Cristiano Ronaldo aiming for a second#NationsLeaguetitle 🇵🇹🏆pic.twitter.com/VMzf5JFEMA — UEFA EURO (@UEFAEURO)June 3, 2025 Germany, who finished top of Group 3 in League A, beat Italy 5-4 in their last-eight encounter over two legs. Portugal, who finished top of Group 1,beat Denmark 5-3 on aggregatein their quarterfinal. Both sides were unbeaten in the six-match group stage, which concluded in November. Cristiano Ronaldo is to start the semifinal for Portugal despite the mystery surrounding his immediate club future – which looks likely toresult in an appearance at FIFA’s Club World Cup this month. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star posted on social media on the final day of the Saudi Pro League that his time with Saudi Arabian top-flight team Al Nassr had come to an end. FIFA PresidentGianni Infantino had already revealedthat talks were under way for a loan for Ronaldo to play for one of the teams competing at the competition being staged in the United States. A star performance by the 40-year-old in the semifinal and potential final of the Nations League would significantly up the stakes for his next move – and his potential late arrival as a headline act at the Club World Cup. Portugal beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2019 final. The match itself was played on home soil for the Portuguese at Porto’s Estadio do Dragao, where Goncalo Guedes scored the only goal of the game in the 60th minute. Julian Nagelsmann, Germany coach:“The goal is to win the Nations League title. We want to perform, deliver results and win titles, and for us as a group, it’s very important. Spain proved how important this tournament can be when they won it before triumphing at Euro 2024. When I look at the faces of our players, I see motivation and excitement. I’m looking forward to the atmosphere in the stadium.” Roberto Martinez, Portugal coach:“There aren’t many opportunities in international football to win trophies, and there is nothing better than doing so. The important thing is that we are here, and the final four is where we have to be. This team have shown significant resilience over these two and a half years, and facing teams like Germany, followed by maybe Spain or France, are perfect challenges to continue preparing the team for the World Cup.” This will be the 12th time that the two nations have met. Germany has won on seven occasions, and Portugal has recorded just one win. The Germans have won the last five encounters, which had all been at either FIFA World Cups or UEFA European Championships. Portugal’s last win came in the group stage of Euro 2000 with Sergio Conceicao scoring all the goals in a 3-0 victory against the then-holders, who were eliminated. The Germans have since exacted a heavy revenge on the Portuguese, including a 4-2 group stage win in their last encounter in 2021 at the delayed Euro 2020 championships. The Allianz Arena, which is also hosting the first semifinal, will also stage the final on Sunday. Out:Amiri, Bisseck, Havertz, Henrichs, Kleindienst, Musiala, Rudiger, Schlotterbeck, Stiller Germany have a string of injuries but do welcome back long-term absentee Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal. Who replaces Bayern Munich’s Jamal Musiala in midfield will be one of the key questions, but the absences of Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger and Arsenal forward Kai Harvertz will also be heavily felt. Out:Cancelo Portugal are boosted by an almost fully fit squad with only Al Hilal defender Joao Cancelo leaving a void to be filled. Possible Germany XI:ter Stegen; Kimmich, Tah, Koch, Raum; Goretzka, Gross; Adeyemi, Wirtz, Sane; Fullkrug Possible Portugal XI:Costa; Dalot, Dias, Goncalo Inacio, Nuno Mendes; Vitinha, Fernandes, Neves; Silva, Ronaldo, Leao",

    "title": "Elon Musk slams Trump’s signature budget bill as a ‘disgusting abomination’",
    "article_text": "Billionaire Elon Musk has renewed his criticisms of United States President Donald Trump’s signature budget bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination” in a series of social media posts. On Tuesday,just days after leaving his post in the Trump administration, Musk offered yet another broadside against the legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Muskwrote. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” His subsequent posts laid out the reasoning for his opposition, suggesting that the spending and tax cuts proposed in the bill would balloon the US national debt. “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,” Musksaidin one post. In another, hewrote, “Congress is making America bankrupt.” The bill would extend tax cuts established in 2017, during Trump’s first term, and funnel more funds to his administration’s priorities, including $46.5bn for the construction of barriers at the US border with Mexico. But to accomplish those goals, critics have pointed out that the legislation would lift the cap on the national debt by $4 trillion. It would also limit access to social safety-net programmes like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known colloquially as food stamps. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan bureau that provides research to Congress,estimatesthat the bill will result in a $698bn reduction in Medicaid subsidies and $267bn less in funding for SNAP. Those trade-offs have spurred concern on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats and some Republicans expressing fears that their constituents may lose their access to vital government services. Fiscal conservatives, meanwhile, have baulked at the increase to the national debt. In an early-morning vote on May 22, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the One Big Beautiful Bill by a tight vote of 215 to 214. Republicans hold a 220-seat majority in the 435-member chamber, but several members were either absent or voted “present”. Only two Republicans — Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio — broke with party ranks to vote against the bill. The House’s 212 Democrats all voted against it as well, in a unified show of opposition. That sent the bill to the Senate, where Republicans likewise hold a razor-thin majority. Senators are expected to weigh the bill in the coming days. But following Musk’s criticisms of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Massie chimed in to applaud the billionaire for his frank criticism. “He’s right,” Massiewrotein a brief post, to which Muskrespondedthat his opposition was rooted in “simple math”. Musk alsocalledon voters to “fire all politicians who betrayed the American people” during the 2026 midterm elections — referencing what he considered wasteful spending. Until last week, Musk had served as a special government employee in the second Trump administration, helping to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) since the president’s inauguration in January. In that advisory role, Musk was tasked with identifying and eliminating “waste” in the federal bureaucracy. His and DOGE’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, yank contracts and shutter government agencies, however, made them both a target for widespread criticism and lawsuits. Opponents accused Musk of engaging in conflicts of interest, including by attacking watchdog groups like theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. Federal law generally prohibits special government employees from serving for more than 130 days in a year, and Musk ended his tumultuous tenure in the Trump administration with an Oval Office sendoff last week. Trump presented the billionaire with a decorative key to the White House andcalled his work transformational, crediting Musk with ushering in “a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington”. But in the lead-up to that goodbye, Muskappeared in previewsfor the TV show CBS Sunday Morning denouncing the One Big Beautiful Bill. He described its provisions as contrary to the spirit of DOGE’s spending cuts. “I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told CBS. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” he added. “I don’t know if it could be both. My personal opinion.” Those comments fuelled rumours of a widening rift between Trump and Musk, who had been one of the president’s most prominent donors and proxies during his 2024 re-election campaign. Still, the Trump administration has brushed aside reports of tensions between the two men. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, for instance, shrugged off a question about Musk’s latest fusillade from her podium at the White House briefing room. “ Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn’t change the president’s opinion,” she said. “This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.” Leavitt did, however, blast Republican senators who opposed the legislation for “not having their facts together”. One of those senators is Rand Paul of Kentucky, who voiced his support for Musk’s dissent against the bill on Tuesday. “I agree with Elon. We have both seen the massive waste in government spending and we know another $5 trillion in debt is a huge mistake,” Paulwrote. “We can and must do better.” Trump, however, lashed out against Paul on social media and defended his budget bill, calling it a “WINNER”. “Rand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!). The people of Kentucky can’t stand him,” Trumpsaid. “This is a BIG GROWTH BILL!”",

    "title": "Man Utd’s Fernandes confirms he has rejected Saudi Pro League move",
    "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes has confirmed he rejected a huge offer from Saudi Arabia and chose instead to stay at Manchester United, saying he wanted to “continue to play at the highest level”. Speaking to media in a Portugal camp ahead of Wednesday’s Nations League semifinal against Germany in Munich, the football midfielder confirmed he received an “exciting offer” from Al-Hilal but wanted to be part of manager Ruben Amorim’s rebuild at Old Trafford. Reports said Al-Hilal were willing to pay United up to 100 million British pounds ($135m) for the 30-year-old Portugal international. “The president of Al-Hilal called me and asked me if I wanted to move there,” Fernandes confirmed, saying the club “waited for me to think about my future”. “I talked to the gaffer and he asked me not to go,” Fernandes revealed, adding: “Man United said they didn’t want to sell me. “They said if I wanted to go, I could, but they didn’t need the money.” The player said a transfer would have been “easy” with several Portuguese players already in Saudi Arabia, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Cancelo and Ruben Neves, but added: “I want to play at the highest possible level. “I want to play major competitions. I know I still can, and I want to be happy doing the thing I love the most. “For better or worse, this is how I see football and I’m passionate about football and this is the decision I’ve made.” United endured their worst finish of the Premier League era, finishing 15th. They also lost the Europa League final to Tottenham. United captain Fernandes was one of the few players to emerge with credit from a disastrous season, scoring 19 goals and making 19 assists across all competitions. Former United captain Gary Neville, now a Sky Sports pundit, said the development was “significant”. “I think that there was an element of this situation that meant United getting that level of money, for someone of Bruno’s age, obviously, you couldn’t say that it would have been a bad deal,” he said. “But, on the other hand, Manchester United’s star player – only player, at times – for the last four, five, six years, has been Bruno Fernandes. He’s so important.” Neville added: “To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, ‘No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things,’ I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. “The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.” United are expected to be busy in the transfer market as Amorim reshapes his under-performing squad. The club have already signed Brazil forward Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are being heavily linked with Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. Departures could include Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. Fernandes has made 290 appearances and scored 98 goals for United since his 47 million pounds ($63m) move from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.",

    "title": "US to reduce military presence in Syria, keeping only one base operational",
    "article_text": "The United States will shut down most of its military bases in Syria, consolidating operations to a single location, as part of a policy overhaul announced by its new special envoy. Thomas Barrack, appointed by President Donald Trump last month as the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy for Syria, said the shift marks a rejection of Washington’s past century of failed approaches in Syria. In an interview with the Turkish broadcaster NTV on Monday, Barrack said thetroop drawdownand base closures reflect a strategic recalibration. “What I can assure you is that our current Syria policy will not be close to the Syria policy of the last 100 years because none of these have worked,” he said. US forces are expected to withdraw from seven of eight bases, including those in Deir Az Zor province in eastern Syria, with remaining operations centred in Hasakah in the northeast. Two security sources told the Reuters news agency that US military hardware and personnel have already started relocating. “All troops are being pulled from Deir Az Zor,” one source told Reuters in April. A US Department of State official later said troop levels would be adjusted “if and when appropriate”, depending on operational demands. Roughly2,000 American soldiers remain in Syria, largely embedded with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a key partner in the US-led campaign against ISIL (ISIS). The SDF, dominated by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia, has been a longstanding point of contention with NATO ally Turkiye, which views it as linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The PKK, which recently announced itsdisbandment, fought a decades-long armed rebellion against the Turkish state. Barrack called the SDF “a very important factor” for the US Congress, stressing that integrating the group into Syria’s national army is now a priority. “Everyone needs to be reasonable in their expectations,” he said. Since the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, international engagement with Damascus has resumed under new President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Barrack recently raised the US flag over the ambassador’s residence in Damascus for the first time since 2012. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised the SDF last week, accusing it of “stalling tactics” despite its agreement to join the Syrian armed forces.",

    "title": "Colombia rejects Guatemalan court’s arrest warrants for top officials",
    "article_text": "Bogota, Colombia– Colombian PresidentGustavo Petrohas criticised a Guatemalan court order for the arrests of two senior Colombian officials, accusing the prosecutor’s office of being corrupt. Guatemalan Public ProsecutorRafael Curruchicheon Monday accused Colombian Attorney General Luz Adriana Camargo and former Colombian Defence Minister Ivan Velasquez of corruption, influence peddling, obstruction of justice, and collusion during a United Nations-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) investigation into bribes paid to Guatemalan officials by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Petro said on Tuesday that the targeting of Camargo and Velasquez was politically motivated and shows that the attorney general’s office is “subordinate to the mafia”. “Narcotrafficking multinationals are trying to take over legal authorities and governments to carry out and whitewash their illicit business,” wrote Petro in a post on X. In a statement released on Monday, Guatemala’s government also said it “emphatically rejects the arrest warrants”. “These actions are carried out with a clear political objective, without grounding in the national and international legal system,” it said. While announcing the warrants on Monday, Curruchiche alleged without providing evidence that Camargo and Velasquez abused their power while working at the CICIG on theOdebrecht case, a vast corruption scandal in which the construction firm admitted to bribing officials for public contracts in 10 Latin American countries. On Tuesday, Curruchiche presented emails, purportedly between Odebrecht employees and Camargo, to reporters that he said prove Camargo and Velasquez are guilty, though Al Jazeera could not independently verify the validity of the emails. Curruchiche’s office first announced it was investigating Velasquez, who is currently Colombia’s ambassador to the Holy See, in January 2023 when he was still minister of defence. From 2013 to 2019, Velasquez oversaw the CICIG, which uncovered several corruption networks in Guatemala. Guatemala’s prosecutor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Both Camargo and Velasquez have denied the accusations. “The corrupt Guatemalan Attorney General and her prosecutor Curruchiche – designated as corrupt and sanctioned by the US and the European Union – extend their persecution to me and Luz Adriana Camargo,” wrote Velasquez in an X post on Tuesday. Colombia’s attorney general also rejected the charges in a press conference in Bogota on Wednesday. “I am comforted by the tranquility of my innocence in the crimes that have been attributed to me by political bias,” said Camargo. Juanita Goebertus Estrada, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that the accusations against the Colombian officials were unfounded. “There is no evidence against Velasquez or Camargo of any credible participation in criminal activity,” she said, adding that the warrants were just the latest in a series of controversial moves by the office of Guatemala’s Attorney GeneralMaria Consuelo Porras, who has faced international criticism for resisting anti-corruption efforts. “Consuelo Porras has a terrible record in human rights and democracy. She has constantly used criminal action as a weapon against those who have tried to fight against corruption in the country,” said Goebertus. Curruchiche wascriticisedfor interfering with elections after his office suspended then-candidate Bernardo Arevalo’s party ahead of the presidential run-off in 2023. Arevalo went on to win the elections, assuming office in January 2024 Guatemala’s government said the arrest warrants are part of a wider pattern of judicial overreach. “These are part of a series of actions by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Attorney General of the Republic and judges associated with corruption that have distorted the meaning of justice in Guatemala,” said the Guatemalan government in its statement on Monday. Despite the arrest orders, it appears unlikely that actions against the two officials will be taken outside of Guatemala. “Petro won’t comply with the arrest warrants … and it is very likely that he will seek an injunction to any international notice by Interpol that seeks to do the same,” Sergio Guzman, director at Colombia Risk Analysis, a security think tank, told Al Jazeera. However, Colombian opposition figures have embraced the arrest warrants as evidence of corruption in the Petro administration. Vicky Davila, the conservative frontrunner in next year’s presidential elections, promised to comply with the order. “On August 7 of next year, we will send them to Guatemala on a commercial flight, handcuffed, as befits extradited persons, to answer to the justice of that country for their alleged crimes,” wrote Davila in a post on X on Monday.",

    "title": "Kohli wins first IPL title as RCB beat Punjab Kings in final",
    "article_text": "Royal Challengers Bengaluru and their star name Virat Kohli both earned their first Indian Premier League title by beating Punjab Kings by six runs. Bengaluru finished runners-up in 2009, 2011 and 2016 but finally won on Tuesday at Narendra Modi Stadium – thanks largely to Krunal Pandya’s sensational spell of 2-17 in four overs. Kohli shed a tear as Bengaluru clinched victory to conclude the 18th season of the world’s most popular T20 tournament. “This win is as much for the fans as it is for the team. It has been 18 long years,” said Kohli, who has been associated with Bengaluru since the inaugural edition in 2008. “I have given my youth, my prime. I gave it everything I have. I never thought this day would come. I was overcome with emotion as soon as the last ball was bowled.” Kohli top-scored for Bengaluru with 43 runs off 35 balls to help put up 190-9 in 20 overs. Punjab pacers Arshdeep Singh (3-40) and Kyle Jamieson (3-48) shared six wickets between them. Punjab’s reply stuttered after a good start, and despite a consolation half-century from Shashank Singh, it fell short and finished with 184-7 (20 overs). Put into bat, Bengaluru lost Phil Salt for 16 runs. It slowed down Kohli, who hit only three fours in an uncharacteristic knock. The Indian batting star finished with 700 runs in 16 matches this season – third in the highest run-scorers list. Kohli put on vital partnerships with Mayank Agarwal (24) and skipper Rajat Patidar (26). Their cameos kept the scorecard ticking along. Azmatullah Omarzai got the vital wicket and sent Kohli back while Jamieson picked up his second by trapping Patidar LBW. Jitesh Sharma then provided the acceleration, hitting two sixes and two fours to score 24 off 10 balls, while Liam Livingstone also hit two sixes in 25 off 15 balls. From 131-4 in 14.5 overs, it was just enough to push Bengaluru past 190. In reply, Punjab started well as Priyansh Arya (24) and Prabhsimran Singh (26) put on 43 off 30 balls. Salt took a smart catch hopping across the boundary to send back Arya, and then Pandya struck after the powerplay. First he sent back Prabhsimran, who was crawling despite a dropped catch earlier on. The turning point came in the 10th over as Shreyas Iyer was caught behind for one off Romario Shepherd. Josh Inglis scored 39 off 23 balls, including four sixes, but he holed out off Pandya in the 13th over in another body blow for the Kings’ chase. Thereafter, it was an uphill task for Punjab as the Bengaluru bowlers squeezed the run rate. Shashank Singh stayed put, scoring 61 not out off 30 balls, including six sixes, but it only reduced the margin of victory.",

    "title": "‘Malicious’: New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka sues US attorney after arrest",
    "article_text": "A New Jersey mayor has filed a lawsuit against a federal prosecutor and close ally of United States President Donald Trumpafter he was arrestedat a protest outside an immigration detention centre. In a civilcomplaintfiled on Tuesday, Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, accused acting US Attorney Alina Habba of “subjecting him to false arrest and malicious prosecution”. The complaint also names Ricky Patel, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations unit, as a co-defendant. “As a result of this false arrest”, the lawsuit argues that Mayor Baraka “suffered severe reputational harm, emotional distress and other damages”. The suit is the latest fallout froma May 9 protestoutside Delaney Hall, a privately run immigration detention facility in Newark. Baraka, a longtime critic of the facility, had joined three Democratic members of the US House of Representatives for a tour of the 1,000-bed detention centre, as protesters gathered outside the gate. The lawsuit alleges that a member of theGEO Group, which owns the facility, allowed Baraka to come inside Delaney Hall’s wire gate. But once inside, it says Patel ordered him to exit again, on threat of arrest. Baraka complied, but a few minutes later, as he stood with protesters outside the gate, agents with the Department of Homeland Security surrounded the mayor, handcuffed him and led him away. The complaint alleges that Patel ordered the agents to “take [the mayor] down” and that they “pushed, shoved and assaulted” the mayor’s security team before arresting him. Barakadenies trespassingonto the Delaney Hall grounds. “They abused their power to violently arrest me at Delaney Hall despite being invited inside,” Barakawroteon social media on Tuesday. “No one is above the law.” Habba initially filed a trespassing charge against Baraka for his actions during the protest. But by May 19, shemoved to dismissthe charge, prompting a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case. “Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamour, nor to advance political agendas,” Judge Andre Espinosa told a representative for Habba’s office. “The hasty arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, followed swiftly by the dismissal of those trespassing charges a mere 13 days later, suggests a worrisome misstep by your office,” Espinosa added. “An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool. It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough, dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence.” At the same time as she announced she was seeking the dismissal of the trespassing charge, Habba revealed she would bepursuing criminal chargesagainst US Congress member LaMonica McIver, who was also at the Delaney Hall protest. Habba accused McIver of assaulting law enforcement during Baraka’s arrest. That case is ongoing. But Representative McIver has called the charges against her “purely political”, and sheissued astatementon Tuesday in support of Baraka’s lawsuit. “The way Mayor Baraka was treated at Delaney Hall was outrageous,” the statement reads. “It is beyond clear that there was never any legal or factual basis to arrest or charge him. The administration’s playing politics with our justice system is disgraceful.” In the lead-up to Baraka’s lawsuit, Habba herself weighed in, suggesting the mayor’s complaint was a waste of time. “He is planning to sue the Feds,” Habbawroteon social media Monday. “My advice to the mayor – feel free to join me in prioritizing violent crime and public safety. Far better use of time for the great citizens of New Jersey.” Habba had served as part of Trump’s personal legal team before joining his administration following his second inauguration in January. Trump has pledged to pursue a policy of “mass deportation” during his second term as president, but that goal has run up against logistical issues, including a lack of detention space. His administration awarded Delaney Hall a 15-year contract to help address the growing demand for beds, and the facility opened this past May. Baraka, however, has argued that Delaney Hall failed to receive the proper local permitting and has been a visible presence at protests outside the immigration centre. The GEO Group denies any permitting violations. Critics, particularly on the left, have long accused the Trump administration of retaliating against those who oppose the president’s signature policies, including his crackdown on immigration. Tuesday’s lawsuit, for example, accuses Habba of defaming Baraka in her efforts to detain and charge him with trespassing. “In authorizing and/or directing the arrest of Mayor Baraka without proper legal grounds, Defendant Habba was acting for political reasons and fulfilling her stated goal of ‘turning New Jersey red’,” the lawsuit argues. The complaint further alleges that other members of the Trump administration participated “in promoting a false and defamatory narrative”, including that Baraka “broke into” the detention facility. Baraka is running this November as a Democratic candidate in the race to be New Jersey governor. His lawsuit alleges the arrest and subsequent trespassing charge was designed to “damage him politically”. Last month, Trumpendorsedone of Baraka’s Republican rivals, businessman and former state Representative Jack Ciattarelli, for the governorship.",

    "title": "Five UN food aid workers killed in Sudan ambush as hunger crisis deepens",
    "article_text": "An ambush on a United Nations food aid convoy inSudanhas killed at least five people, blocking urgently needed supplies from reaching civilians facing starvation in the war-torn Darfur city of el-Fasher. Aid agencies confirmed on Tuesday that the 15-truck convoy was transporting critical humanitarian supplies from Port Sudan to North Darfur when it was attacked overnight. “Five members of the convoy were killed and several more people were injured. Multiple trucks were burned, and critical humanitarian supplies were damaged,” the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and theWorld Food Programme (WFP)said in a joint statement. The agencies did not identify the perpetrators and called for an urgent investigation, describing the incident as a violation of international humanitarian law. The route had been shared in advance with both warring parties. The convoy was nearing al-Koma, a town under the control of the paramilitaryRapid Support Forces (RSF), when it came under fire. The area had witnessed a drone attack earlier in the week that killed civilians, according to local activists. Fighting between the RSF and the Sudanese army has raged for over two years,displacing millionsand plunging more than half of Sudan’s population into acute hunger. El-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, remains one of the most vulnerable regions. “Hundreds of thousands of people in el-Fasher are at high risk of malnutrition and starvation,” the UN statement warned. Both sides blamed each other for the attack. The RSF accused the army of launching an air attack on the convoy, while the army claimed RSF fighters torched the trucks. Neither account could be independently verified. The attack is the latest in a string of assaults on humanitarian operations. In recent weeks, RSF shelling targeted WFP facilities in el-Fasher, and an attack on El Obeid Hospital in North Kordofan killed several medical staff. Aid delivery has become increasingly perilous as access routes are blocked or come under fire.",

    "title": "US factory orders slump in April as spending on tariff anticipation fades",
    "article_text": "Orders from United States factories have tumbled in April after a surge in March when businesses had front-loaded purchases in anticipation of tariffs. New orders for US manufactured goods dropped by 3.7 percent on a monthly basis, worse than economists had expected, according to Census Bureau data released on Tuesday. Economists polled by the Reuters news agency expected a 3.1 percent drop. Dow Jones forecast a 3.3 percent drop. On an annual basis, however, factory orders rose by 2 percent. April’s report is in sharp contrast to the 3.4 percent increase in March, which topped five straight months of increases. Manufacturing, which accounts for 10.2 percent of the US economy, has been put under pressure byPresident Donald Trump’s aggressive tariffs. Trump sees the tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised extension of tax cuts and to revive a long-declining industrial base, a feat that economists argued was impossible in the short term because of labour shortages and other structural issues. Orders in the transportation sector fell 17.1 percent, led by a sharp drop in the commercial aircraft sector. Aircraft orders fell by 51.5 percent in April.Orders for motor vehicles, parts and trailers dropped 0.7 percent. Electrical equipment, appliances and component manufacturing fell by 0.3 percent. But manufacturing for computers and other electronic products actually grew by 1 percent. Machinery orders also rose 0.6 percent. Excluding transportation, which led the surge in March orders, orders fell 0.5 percent, matching March’s decline of non-transportation goods. The government also reported that orders for nondefence capital goods excluding aircraft, a measure of business spending plans on equipment, decreased 1.5 percent in April rather than 1.3 percent as estimated last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods fell by an unrevised 0.1 percent, or $1.8bn. An Institute for Supply Management survey showed manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in May and suppliers took the longest time in nearly three years to deliver inputs to factories.",

    "article_text": "Two suspectedAllied Democratic Forces (ADF)rebels, including a female suicide bomber, were killed in an explosion near a prominent Catholic shrine in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, as crowds gathered to mark Martyrs’ Day. The blast on Tuesday took place in the upscale suburb of Munyonyo, outside the Munyonyo Martyrs’ Shrine, where Ugandans were assembling to commemorate 19th-century Christians executed for their faith. No civilian injuries were reported. “A counterterrorism unit this morning intercepted and neutralised two armed terrorists in Munyonyo,” said army spokesmanChris Magezion X. He confirmed one of the assailants was a female suicide bomber “laden with powerful explosives”. Footage broadcast by NBS Television, an independent outlet, showed a destroyed motorbike and debris scattered across the road. Police Chief Abas Byakagaba told NBS the explosion occurred while “two people were on a motorcycle,” adding: “The good thing, though, is that there were no people nearby who were injured.” There has been no immediate claim of responsibility. While Ugandan authorities are still piecing together the events, Magezi suggested the suspects were linked to the ADF, a rebel group that originated in Uganda in the 1990s but later relocated to eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ADF has pledged allegiance to ISIL (ISIS) and wasbehind a spate of deadly bombings in Ugandain 2021. The group has been accused by the United Nations of widespread atrocities, including the killing of thousands of civilians in the region. Martyrs’ Day is one of Uganda’s most significant religious holidays, drawing thousands of pilgrims annually. Security forces have increased patrols across the capital in the aftermath of the incident.",

Now, the former White House employee is calling it a “disgusting abomination” and claiming that Congress is making America bankrupt inposts on X on Tuesday. Elon’s problem isn’t the provisions we noted that would strip state legislatures of AI oversight andscale back consumer protection and climate initiatives, while funding increased border surveillance. Instead, he claims, “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Officehas reportedthat the bill’s tax provisions would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Despite Musk continuing andthreateningthat “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,” the White House and other Republican political leaders have not shown much regard for his statements. In a briefing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitttold reporters, “...look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn’t change the president’s opinion; this is one big beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.” Democrats had a different response, asABC Newsreports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held up a printout of Musk’s tweets during his press conference following a policy luncheon. Schumer told reporters, “Trump’s buddy says the bill is bad -- you can imagine how bad this bill is,” while his counterpart in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, said, “...breaking news: Elon Musk and I agree with each other.” Politicoreports that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson told reporters he spoke to Musk on Monday for about 20 minutes regarding the bill, and said, “With all due respect, my friend Elon is terribly wrong about the one big, beautiful bill.” In the Senate, Republican Majority Leader John Thune told reporters, “On this particular issue, we have a difference of opinion,” and that he believes Musk is using outdated data.

    "article_text": "Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the jet black Ultra 2, is receiving a sizable discount right now. Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the jet black Ultra 2, is receiving a sizable discount right now. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing theApple Watch Series 10alongside ablack renditionof theApple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does thesecond-gen Apple Watch SE, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update,watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals. The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. While the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, theSeries 9. That said, it’s currently on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyright now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($10 off), which remains its lowest price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at $329 ($100 off) — which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $389 ($110 off). The Apple Watch SEreceived a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, 9, and 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity increases the starting price to $299 for the 40mm size (the 44mm size adds $20 to each configuration). Right now, the best deal on the latest SE can be found atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $169 ($80 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor $219 (also $80 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm model is on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at $219 ($80 off), which nearly matches the lowest price we’ve seen on the entry-level LTE configuration. The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors. In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazonwith a Trail Looporan Ocean Bandstarting at $734.89 (about $64 off) or withan Alpine Loopstarting at $741.89 (about $57 off). You can also pick it up atBest BuyandTargetin various configurations, though only for its full retail price of $799. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.

The company just missed a $183 million interest payment, theWall Street Journalreported on Monday. Itmissed another $326 million interest payment,Bloombergreported on Friday. It’s potentially setting itself up for bankruptcy protection,SpaceNewsreports. It’s potentially setting itself up for bankruptcy protection While those payments are on hold, EchoStar, which Dish Network rejoined last year, is still investing in its TV business. It commissioned a new communications satellite for television, Maxar Space Systemsannouncedyesterday. The satellite, EchoStar XXVI, is supposed to be completed by 2028 to support Dish TV coverage across 50 US states and Puerto Rico. The FCC isinvestigatingwhether EchoStar is hitting requirements to deploy 5G that it’s supposed to meet in order to keep its spectrum licenses. Dish Network merged back with EchoStar — which also owns Boost Mobile — to try tocompete in 5G, with the goal of trying to become a competitor with AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. The FCC probe has led EchoStar to “freeze its decision-making” for Boost Mobile, theWall Street Journalreports. SpaceX is also a rival vying with EchoStar for spectrum licenses in the 2 GHz band. Elon Musk’s company conducted its own analysis of Dish’s cellular signals and called EchoStar’s use of the gigahertz band “de minimis at best” in an Aprilfilingto the FCC. EchoStar accused SpaceX of a “land grab” for spectrum theWall Street Journalreportedlast month. Neither Dish Network nor EchoStar responded immediately to a request for comment fromThe Verge.

Anker’s audio-focused Soundcore brand is introducing a new wireless Bluetooth speaker with rugged features designed to help it survive and thrive during a trip to the beach. The Boom 3i has an IP68 water and dustproof rating plus an additional protective coating that will keep it corrosion-free for up to two years if exposed to or even completely dunked in salt water, claims Anker. The Soundcore Boom 3i is currentlyavailable for purchase through the brand’s Canadian online storefor $189.99, which is about $139 when converted to US currency. The speaker isn’t yet listed on the US version of the Soundcore website. The Boom 3i is not only completely waterproof, it also floats, but not just for the sake of making it easier to recover should it fall off a boat or dock. The Boom 3i is engineered so that its speakers are always pointing upwards and are fully functional while floating, so you can use it directly in the pool or while having a swim at the lake. If you’re using it in a river with a fast moving current you may want to consider attaching something heavy to the speaker’s detachable carrying strap to create a makeshift anchor. Being waterproof makes the speaker easy to clean when you get back from the beach, but for dislodging dust or sand stuck in the speaker grill, the Boom 3i has a Buzz Clean mode that makes it vibrate intensely to shake off dirt. It also includes a mode that leverages its 96db of sound output to play an emergency alarm should you find yourself in need of help, and it can double as a megaphone using Soundcore’s mobile app and your phone as a mic. Battery life is rated at up to 16 hours with the volume at 50 percent and features like boosted bass and synchronized LED accent lighting turned off. If battery life is your priority in a wireless speaker, there arebetter options available. But if you want a speaker you won’t have to worry about babying while you’re out on an adventure, the Boom 3i seems tougher than most.

    "article_text": "﻿The Unreal Engine 5 demo isn’t technically a part of the final game, but it should give a good idea of what to expect. ﻿The Unreal Engine 5 demo isn’t technically a part of the final game, but it should give a good idea of what to expect. byAndrew Webster Arguably the highlight ofEpic’s State of Unreal keynotewas the opening:a sprawling technical demo that showed just how goodThe Witcher 4looks in Unreal Engine 5. It showcased a bustling market in a port city, a beautiful forest landscape, and a horse that looked and acted like, well, a horse. Even more impressive was the fact that the demo was running at 60 frames per second on a base model PlayStation 5. According to Julius Girbig, a senior technical animator at Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, the choice of hardware for the demo was very intentional. “Everyone has the idea of how fast a PS5 is and what kinds of games it can run,” he tellsThe Verge. “That’s why we specifically wanted to go that route of: let’s start with the consoles, let’s show how much we can optimize this engine together with Epic and make it work on current gen, instead of running it on some high-end hardware.” Now, to be clear, the UE5 demo is not actually a slice of the final game. Girbig describes it as “a demonstration of the tools that we are currently building that will eventually powerThe Witcher 4,” and something that “does show the style and direction that we’re going for, and the fidelity that we’re aiming at with the final game.” But whatever it ends up being, and whenever it launches,The Witcher 4will be a pivotal release for CDPR. After previously creating open-world games likeThe Witcher 3: Wild HuntandCyberpunk 2077with its own proprietary engine — sometimes withtechnically disastrous results—the studio announced in 2022 that it was switching to Unreal. According to Girbig, who didn’t work at CDPR until after the shift to Unreal, the decision was made because UE5 “across the board, gives us what we’re looking for.” That includes an increased sense of scale necessary for open-world games, with the ability to render hundreds of non-playable characters with more elaborate AI guiding their actions, and also a better production pipeline for managing multiple projects. (An upcoming remake of the firstWitchergame is also being made in UE5.) But from an artistic perspective, Girbig says, the move to Epic’s engine has a different kind of impact: getting out of the way to allow for more ambitious ideas. “It allows an artist to express themselves much more easily when the engine isn’t a limitation anymore,” he says. “That’s what we’re aiming for here. As an artist, for me, this unlocked myself to think bigger, and on bigger scales.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "﻿The HyperFlux V2 uses a small adapter to wireless charge the battery on four different models. ﻿The HyperFlux V2 uses a small adapter to wireless charge the battery on four different models. byAndrew Liszewski Razer has announced a new mousepad that can wirelessly charge your wireless mouse while you’re using it.It’s not Razer’s first attempt at the idea, but the newHyperFlux V2doesn’t require you to use a single specific mouse — it works with several models in Razer’s current lineup, charging their batteries continuously using an included adapter puck. It looks and sounds very similar to Logitech’s patentedPowerplay Wireless Charging System. The HyperFlux V2 Wireless Charging System comes in two versions for $119.99. One with a hard surface that’s available now, and one with a softer cloth surface, which is expected to launch later this year. The original Razer HyperFlux was sold as part of a $249.99 bundle that included the Mamba HyperFlux mouse. The V2 model doesn’t come with a mouse, but is compatible with the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, Basilisk V3 Pro, Cobra Pro, and Naga V2 Pro mice, which range in price from $129.99 to $179.99. The Mamba HyperFlux mouse that worked with the original version of the HyperFlux pad featured a supercapacitor inside that retained power for about 5 to 10 seconds when it was lifted off the pad. That was enough time to allow you to reposition the mouse without it dying, but to use it anywhere else required a USB cable. The new HyperFlux V2 instead uses a puck inserted into the bottom of the supported mouse models that charges their batteries wirelessly while they’re on the pad, like its Logitech competitor. An LED indicator at the top of the pad indicates the battery’s charge level by changing colors. Like the original version, the new HyperFlux V2 mouse pad also serves as a receiver, allowing Razer’s mice and keyboards to wirelessly connect to a PC (through the pad, which connects to a computer over USB) using its proprietary HyperSpeed technology that’s faster and more reliable than Bluetooth. The mouse pad is also compatible with Razer’s wireless keyboards, including the BlackWidow V3 Pro and DeathStalker V2 Pro, but it can’t charge them wirelessly. The Vergehas reached out to Logitech for comment and to Razer to clarify if its new wirelessly charging mouse pad is using a different approach than the patented Powerplay system.

Inan update on Tuesday, T-Mobile revealed three new plans that offer customers symmetrical speeds of up to 2 Gigs. In addition to a five-year price lock, the new plans come with a $5 autopay discount, but only if you pay with a debit card or bank account. Here’s a list of the plans, which will be available starting June 5th: T-Mobile’s big fiber expansion comes just months after it closed its joint venture deal with the fiber internet provider Lumos — a move the Federal Communications Commission only approved after the carriermade changes to its stanceon diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). T-Mobile’s fiber internet service was previously only available ina limited numberof locations. But now it’s building out its network through its deal with Lumos and its pending acquisition of thefiber provider Metronet. T-Mobile says it expects to reach 12 to 15 million households or more by the end of 2030, allowing it to compete with rivalslike AT&Tand Verizon that have invested billions into fiber.

    "title": "Navy to rename USNS Harvey Milk, mulls new names for ships named for other leaders",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The U.S. Navy plans to rename theUSNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oilernamed afterthe slain gay rights leader and Navy veteran, and is considering renaming multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders and prominent American voices, CBS News has learned. U.S. Navy documents obtained by CBS News and used to brief the secretary of the Navy and his chief of staff show proposed timelines for rolling out the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk to the public. While the documents do not say what the ship's new name would be, the proposal comes duringPride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969.WorldPride celebrationsare being held in Washington, D.C., this year. The documents obtained by CBS News also show other vessels named after prominent leaders are also on the Navy's renaming \"recommended list.\" Among them are the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, USNS Harriet Tubman, USNS Dolores Huerta, USNS Lucy Stone, USNS Cesar Chavez and USNS Medgar Evers. CBS News found that a December 2024web articlefrom Naval Sea Systems Command about the laying of the keel for the future USNS Thurgood Marshall has been deleted. \"The reported decision by the Trump Administration to change the names of the USNS Harvey Milk and other ships in the John Lewis-class is a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream,\" Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi told CBS News in a statement. She added, \"Our military is the most powerful in the world – but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the 'warrior' ethos. Instead, it is a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News the move was \"an utter abomination in terms of the extreme MAGA Republican effort to continue to erase American history, and we're not going to allow it to happen.\" And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X that Hegseth \"should be ashamed of himself and reverse this immediately.\" Following his confirmation in January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued adirectiveinstructing the Pentagon and U.S. military services to cease hosting events tied to heritage or awareness months, citing concerns that such programs could undermine unity within the ranks. The \"Identity Months Dead at DoD\" guidance banned official manpower and resources from being used on such events — among them, Pride Month, Black History Month and Women's History Month. The documents obtained by CBS News were not marked with the traditional classification markers typically seen on Defense Department memos. The documents were not marked as \"For Official Use Only\" or \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" they were also not marked to indicate they were drafts. There was a \"CAUTION\" note, however, referring to the information as publicly sensitive. The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of \"reestablishing the warrior culture.\" The documents call for Navy Secretary John Phelan to select a new name for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, with the notice of the name change going out to other senior U.S. Navy officials later in the week after undergoing legal review. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Hegseth \"is committed to ensuring that the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the Commander-in-Chief's priorities, our nation's history, and the warrior ethos.\" Parnell added that any potential renaming decisions would be announced once the internal reviews are complete. Military.com firstreportedthe name change for the USNS Harvey Milk on Tuesday, but the news of other naval vessels being considered for a name change has not yet been reported. The USNS Harvey Milk is a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler, designed to support carrier strike groups at sea. The class of ships is named after civil rights icon andCongressman John Lewis, who died in 2020. Harvey Milk, the political trailblazer, emerged in the 1970s as one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States. After years of activism, he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, where he quickly became a national symbol of LGBTQ+ political empowerment. His life was cut short in 1978 when he was assassinated in City Hall, alongside MayorGeorge Moscone. The USNS Harvey Milk waschristenedin 2021 and represented a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces. Before he emerged as one of the most visible advocates for gay rights in American history, Milkservedin the U.S. Navy. From 1952 to 1954, he held posts as an operations and dive officer aboard two submarine rescue ships — the USS Chanticleer and the USS Kittiwake — both active during the Korean War, according to the U.S. National Archives. But his sexual orientation carried profound consequences as Milk came under scrutiny. In December 1954, Milk, who was then a lieutenant junior grade, was facing a court martial for participating in a \"homosexual act\" a year earlier. Instead of facing trial, Milk was drummed out of the U.S. military, like so many other gay service members of his era. In January 1954, he resigned his commission and accepted an \"Other Than Honorable\" discharge. In 2021, the Navy approached Milk's nephew, Stuart Milk, to see if hewantedhis uncle's discharge upgraded, according to NPR. Stuart decided against it as a reminder thatnot everyone was treated with honor. The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy. In February, hedirectedFort Liberty in North Carolina return to Fort Bragg, saying it would now be named after a non-Confederate Bragg, and then directed Fort Moore change to Fort Benning, afteranother Benning. The naming commission also suggested the Navy rename the guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville, which honors a Confederate battle victory, to the USS Robert Smalls, to recognize a slave who stole a Confederate ship and surrendered it to the Union. The Navy also renamed the USNS Maury to the USNS Marie Tharp, removing the name of a Confederate sailor and replacing it with the name of a pioneering female oceanographer. Although the Navy has renamed ships for various reasons, name changes are still an exceptionally rare occurrence, especially after the ships have entered service.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 7:28 PM EDT/ CBS News Family members of the man charged withSunday's attackin Boulder, Colorado, have been taken into custody, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday. Noem made the announcement on X, calling the suspect, Mohamed Soliman, an \"illegal alien\" and \"terrorist.\" He isfacing multiple countsof attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge for the attack that injured 12 people at a march supporting Israeli hostages. \"We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,\" Noem said. \"I am continuing to pray for the victims of this attack and their families. Justice will be served.\" A DHS official said six people — Soliman's wife and children — were taken into ICE custody and will now be processed under expedited removal, which allows the government to deport migrants in the U.S. illegally without holding a court hearing. Soliman is an Egyptian national who arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in 2023, the Department of Homeland Security said. Officials said he filed for asylum in 2022. The family had been living in Colorado Springs. FBI agentssearched the homeMonday morning. At a news conference Monday, Mike Michalek, FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, said the family had been cooperative in the investigation so far. Officials said after Soliman was arrested, his wife took her husband's iPhone to the Colorado Springs Police Department. The 45-year-old Soliman is accused of using Molotov cocktails in Sunday's attack, burning multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Witnesses told investigators that Soliman yelled \"Free Palestine\" and \"End Zionist\" during the attack. Theinjured victimsinclude an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor. The group that came under attack,Run for Their Lives, has been gathering for a walk on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall every week for over a year to raise awareness about the dozens of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman is expected to appear in federal court Friday afternoon. On Monday, CBS News Colorado investigative reporterBrian Maassreached the woman who identified herself as Soliman's wife. \"We don't want to talk, thank you,\" she said during a brief phone call. \"Respect my situation,\" she said, and asked not to be contacted again. One of Soliman's children graduated from high school in Colorado Springs in late May and had been profiled in a newspaper article as one of the \"Best and Brightest\" area students. She was recognized in high school with numerous honors including for academic excellence and a leadership award. She had been accepted to college and said her dream was to go to medical school. She told a reporter she was inspired to enter the medical field after her father went through a difficult operation that restored his ability to walk. Brian  Maasscontributed to this report.

The popular sandwich will reappear on menus starting July 10, 2025, according to an announcement by the company on Tuesday in which Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA,statedsimply, \"It's back.\" Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago. However, the item was removed from McDonald's menus in 2016 because it was too complicated for its kitchens to prepare. Customers have been calling for the Snack Wrap's return ever since. In announcing the Snack Wrap's return, the company included a link to a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, which it describes as a \"content hub for the most anticipated menu item of the decade.\" Featuring Snack Wrap wallpaper as its background, the promotional webpage includes various large folders users can click into. A folder entitled \"Fandom,\" for example, houses screenshots of social media posts from Snack Wrap fans expressing their love for the food and asking when it would be returned to McDonald's menus. In one email, entitled \"Snack Wraps for this Pregnant Lady,\" a McDonald's customer named Carli writes \"my biggest craving is something I can't have. I am due July 14th, 2025. Will snack wraps be back before then? Please just give me a hint.\" \"I've waited years and I'm getting mildly impatient\" wrote another fan called \"loyal snack wrap lover.\" Another, more proactive display of loyalty included a Change.org petition to bring back the Snack Wrap. The petition garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. Bringing back the wrap was a \"years-long process,\" Erlinger told The Associated Press. In its revived form, the Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy. This is a departure from the original version, which included a choice of grilled or fried chicken and sauce options like honey mustard and sweet chili. The simplified recipe is to ensure faster service, according to the company. The company has not revealed how much the Snack Wrap will cost, only that prices will vary depending on location. McDonald's also posted on the Snack Wrap's on its X account, thanking ardent fans for resurrecting the long-lost menu item. Breaking the fourth wall, the social media manager behind the McDonald's accountaddressedfollowers directly, reminding them that \"social media managers don't control the menu,\" but rather its the fans who are to thank for the Snack Wrap's revival. Stated the post, \"you created a movement. a movement so powerful that you finally won.\" The Associated  Presscontributed to this report. Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 6:16 PM EDT/ CBS New York Jurors in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs'sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trialheard from a man Tuesday who worked at the Los Angeles hotel whereCombs was seen on videoattacking histhen-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Eddy Garcia testified Combs paid him $100,000 for that video because he feared if it got out,he'd be ruined. Garcia testified under an immunity order. He worked in private security at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in March, 2016. Garcia told the jury Combs' personal assistant Kristina Khorram reached out to try and seesecurity video of the incident. Garcia testified he couldn't show her, but said \"off the record, it's bad.\" Garcia testified he spoke with Combs over the phone and Combs sounded \"very nervous\" and \"was talking very fast.\" Garcia said he apologized, but also told Combs he couldn't show him. Eventually, during another phone call with Combs, Garcia testified that Combs explained something like this would ruin him, and that he would take care of Garcia in exchange for his help. Garcia told the jury he reached out to his boss, who said he would sell it for $50,000. When he told Combs, Garcia said Combs referred to him as \"Eddy my Angel.\" Garcia said he dropped off a USB drive, signed a non-disclosure agreement, and a document saying there were no other copies. He described Combs as \"excited. Just looked happy.\" When Garcia expressed concerns aboutthe potential for a police reportto be filed, Combs told him not to worry about it, and FaceTimed Ventura who told Garcia she had a movie coming out and that she wanted this to go away. Combs ended up doubling the money to $100,000, Garcia told the jury. Garcia said $50,000 went to his boss, another security officer got $20,000, and he kept $30,000. Garcia testified that Combs reached out a few weeks later saying \"Happy Easter, Eddy my Angel, God is Good. God put you in my life for a reason.\" Garcia said Combs then asked if anyone has inquired about the video, or the incident. Garcia said the answer was no, and Combs told him to reach out if he ever needed anything. Garcia said he reached out a year or two later to Combs via Instagram to inquire about any employment opportunities in security, but he never heard back. The former chief financial officer of Bad Boy Entertainment also took the stand Tuesday, describing how Combs' personal bank accounts and finances at Combs' companies worked. Asked by the defense if he had ever seen Combs commit crimes, he answered no. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all five counts he's facing.

    "title": "Elon Musk slams Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" as \"disgusting abomination\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 3, 2025 / 4:43 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Tuesday, calling it \"a disgusting abomination\" as Congress rushes to send the legislation to the president by July 4. \"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,\" Musk wrote in aposton X, adding that the sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's domestic priorities is \"outrageous\" and \"pork-filled.\" \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,\" he said. Hours later, hewarned, \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the criticism during the daily press briefing, telling reporters that Mr. Trump \"already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion.\" Musktold\"CBS Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview that he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the measure, which passed the House before Memorial Day after Mr. Trump stepped up pressure on the Republican holdouts to fall in line. Musk said the package increases the deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. \"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,\" Musk told CBS News, \"but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.\" Some Republican senators were quick to chime in Tuesday and back Musk's sentiment. The package is now in the hands of the Senate and is expected to undergo changes before heading back to the House. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes the House-passed legislation over the debt ceiling increase, urged the president to \"take some advice from Elon.\" Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who also wants a number of changes to the bill, told reporters he shared Musk's concerns. \"The Senate must make this bill better,\"addedSen. Mike Lee of Utah. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said he has a \"difference of opinion\" with Musk and the billionaire is \"entitled to his opinion.\" \"My hope is that as he has an opportunity to further assess what this bill actually does that he'll come to a different conclusion,\" Thune said. GOP Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia noted that it was Mr. Trump who was elected, not Musk. \"I stand with the president, and that's all there is to it,\" Justice said. Senate Republicans were gathered for their weekly lunch when Musk posted his criticism. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said the general reaction in the room to the message was \"eyeball roll.\" On the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, appeared to take offense to Musk's remark. \"I just deeply regret that he's made this mistake,\" Johnson said, suggesting that Musk's criticism is related to cuts to tax credits aimed at incentivizing electric vehicle purchases. \"I know that the EV mandate is very important to him. That is going away because the government should not be subsidizing these things ... and I know that has an effect on his business.\" \"For him to come out and pan the whole bill is, to me, just very disappointing, very surprising, in light of the conversation I had with him yesterday,\" Johnson said. Last Wednesday, Musk announcedhis departureas a \"special government employee,\" a designation that allowed him to work for the administration under different ethics rules than federal employees and limited his work to 130 days. Musk vowed to slash $1 trillion from the federal budget but left the Trump administration falling far short of that goal. Nonetheless, DOGE'scuts to the government workforce,dismantling of agenciesandcancelation in billions of grants and contractssent shock waves through Washington that reverberatedacross the countryand abroad. A senior administration official told CBS News last week that the billionaire entrepreneur \"left on good terms and is still friends with the president.\" \"This isn't a separation, but just a return to the private sector for Musk,\" the official said, adding that Musk will continue to advise the president.

    "title": "Pepto Bismol didn't help prevent travelers' diarrhea, small CDC study found",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News June 3, 2025 / 11:35 AM EDT/ CBS News The active ingredient inPepto Bismol, bismuth subsalicylate, is often used to treat and preventdiarrhea while traveling— but a new study found it may not help with prevention. In the studyfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"no significant difference\" was found for symptoms of loose stool or diarrhea between groups who tookthe medicationfor prevention and those who took a placebo. Since 1939, bismuth subsalicylate has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach. But, as the authors note, it's also used off-label for the prevention of diarrhea, especially among international travelers. The study issued questionnaires before, during and after travel to the 270 participants, who had a median age of 32 and planned to travel to Southeast Asia, south central Asia, North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa for 7 to 21 days. Participants were recruited from clinical sites in New York in Massachusetts. The group given the medication took 4 tablets twice daily during their trip. The study did have limitations, including not reaching the target sample size. But it did provide the first new data since the 1980s on the potential use of bismuth subsalicylate in diarrhea prevention, according to the study's authors. \"Despite this study not reaching the targeted sample size, there are nonetheless important considerations for healthcare providers conducting pretravel consultations for international travelers,\" the authors wrote. The authors also noted further studies are needed to determine if there is a benefit in certain traveler groups or under certain circumstances. \"A larger study might show benefit, although the benefit may be small given the results of this study,\" they wrote. Procter & Gamble, the parent company of Pepto Bismol, provided the medication for the study but did not participate in any procedures, the authors noted.

    "title": "White House asks Congress to codify DOGE cuts to USAID and public broadcasting",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — The White House sent congressional leaders a request Tuesday to claw back $9.4 billion in approved spending, most of it for foreign aid. The so-called rescissions package would slash funding to the U.S. Agency for International Development, NPR and PBS, and it would aim to codify cuts proposed by Department of Government Efficiency, the advisory entity that was helmed by President Donald Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk until he left his post last week. The package would require simple majority support in the House and the Senate, meaning Republicans could bypass Democrats to pass it. The package includes $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid, including a number of programs designed to support LGBTQ communities. There are also cuts to education and transportation programs, reproductive health and funding for the World Health Organization, as well as about $142 million in cuts for UNICEF and nearly $9 million in cuts to the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. And the package includes $1.1 billion in cuts to funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The $9.4 billion represents a drop in the bucket when set against the $6.8 trillion that the U.S. government spends annually. And congressional Republicans are seeking to pass asprawling domestic policy bill, which would add more than $2 trillion to the debt. Still, spending hawks see it as an important step toward undoing authorized spending, which is rare. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have both said they would quickly take up the request. Congress has 45 days to pass the package once it is submitted. “This rescissions package reflects many of DOGE’s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,” Johnson said in a statement. “Congress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.” Rescission packages usually fail because Congress, which controls the power of the purse, typically rejects attempts by a president to decline to allocate certain spending it has directed. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said there are still some questions about the process, telling reporters Monday, “We’re still talking with the parliamentarian about what can and can’t be done,” referring to the in-house referee for Senate rules. “It’s extremely complex and the rules, because there hasn’t been a successful rescission package in many, many years,” she said. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative hard-liners, is pushing for a speedy vote on the package. “The House Freedom Caucus strongly supports these critical rescissions, and we will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,” the group, led by Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., said in a statement. “While the Swamp will inevitably attempt to slow and kill these cuts, there is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.”",

    "title": "Chinese couple charged with smuggling a biological pathogen into the U.S.",
    "article_text": "A Chinese researcher inMichiganand her boyfriend have been charged with smuggling a biological pathogen that “can cause devastating diseases in crops” into the United States, according to federal charging documents unsealed Tuesday. Yunqing Jian, 33, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, 34, were charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, smuggling goods into the country and making false statements to investigators, the complaint says. Liu was entering the country at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in July when border officers found the pathogen, a fungus known as Fusarium graminearum, in his backpack, according to the complaint. The small clumps of reddish plant material were discovered in four plastic baggies tucked into a wad of tissues. Liu and his girlfriend researched the pathogen as university students in China, the complaint says. Since 2023, Jian had been working at the University of Michigan’s Molecular Plant-Microbe Interaction Laboratory. Liu initially told the officers that he did not know what the materials were and that someone must have planted them in his bag, but he then told a different story, the complaint says. “Liu stated that he intentionally hid the samples in his backpack because he knew there were restrictions on the importation of the materials,” the complaint says. “Liu confirmed that he had intentionally put the samples in a wad of tissues so CBP Officers would be less likely to find and confiscate them, and he could continue his research in the United States.” According to the complaint, Liu also said he planned to use the University of Michigan laboratory to conduct research on the pathogen. When investigators spoke to Jian, she denied knowing anything about Liu’s smuggling or plans to research the pathogen, the complaint says. But an examination of Liu’s and Jian’s electronic devices uncovered WeChat messages from 2022 in which they discussed smuggling seeds into the United States. “I put them in my Martin boots,” Liu wrote, according to the complaint. “In a small bag. The ziplock bag. Very small.” “That’s good,” Jian replied, the complaint says. “Just put it in your shoes.” At a federal court hearing Tuesday afternoon, a judge ordered Jian to remain behind bars after prosecutors described her as a flight risk. Liu, who was not allowed into the country after the pathogen was allegedly discovered in his backpack, remains at large. The FBI Counterintelligence Division conducted the investigation. “Fusarium graminearum is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year,” the complaint says. “The toxins produced by Fusarium graminearum cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock and humans.” U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon said in a statement: “The alleged actions of these Chinese nationals — including a loyal member of the Chinese Communist Party — are of the gravest national security concerns.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The University of Michigan said it condemns “any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security or undermine the university’s critical public mission.” “It is important to note that the university has received no funding from the Chinese government in relation to research conducted by the accused individuals,” the university added in a statement. “We have and will continue to cooperate with federal law enforcement in its ongoing investigation and prosecution.”",

    "title": "Canned soup summer: Bargain hunters are ditching snacks for pantry staples",
    "article_text": "The humble bowl of soup is having a moment. That’s according to The Campbell’s Co., whose iconic cans are synonymous with it. The food makersaid Mondaythat customers are increasingly snatching up its condensed soups and mac-and-cheese offerings while shying away from snacks, a spending shift that partly echoes the depths of the pandemic. “Consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since early 2020,” Campbell’s CEO Mick Beekhuizen said ina statement. The company — whose snack brands include Goldfish, Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels and Cape Cod chips —saw snack sales slip 5%in the last three months. Meanwhile, sales of its meals and beverages rose 6%, mainly driven by Rao’s pasta sauces and soup sales in the United States. While consumers’ outlookshave improved somewhatin recent weeks, many remaindeeply pessimisticabout the direction of the economy under President Donald Trump’sever-shifting trade warand are looking for bargains. Households continue to “focus their spending on products that help them stretch their food budgets, and they’re increasingly intentional about their discretionary snack purchases,” Beekhuizen told Campbell’s investors on its earnings call. “Snacks are losing ground as consumers, squeezed by inflation, shift spending toward essentials and more purposeful food choices,” analysts at the market research firm NIQ wrote in a recent note. “The era of indulgent, impulsive snacking is giving way to a demand for value, quality, and health.” In a recent NIQ survey, 42% of consumers reported buying snacks  less, and 37% said they’re searching harder for deals. Many indicated they’ve been thinking twice about pricier name-brand snacks, opting instead for more generic alternatives at convenience stores or those sold under supermarkets’ own private labels. Snacks are losing ground as consumers, squeezed by inflation, shift spending toward essentials. NIQ market researchers The tightening snack market has seen some friction, with Oreo maker Mondelēz recently suing Aldi, alleging the supermarket operatorhad “blatantly” mimickedsome of its packaging designs for cheaper riffs on iconic snack brands. While Mondelēz says snack demand remains sturdy, PepsiCo — which makes Lay’s and Doritos chips — has said it’s finding success catering to customers at lower price points. “Relative to where we were three months ago, we probably aren’t feeling as good about the consumer now as we were a few months ago,” PepsiCo CFO Jamie Caulfield said in April. The snack foods giant alsoloweredits financial forecast for the year. Food shoppers’ hunt for value is also boosting Dollar General, which Tuesday increased its sales outlook for the year andsaid it picked up market sharein food products. The dollar store operator notched those gains even as other retail giants,such as Target, that sell groceries have struggled to lure budget-conscious shoppers. The growing focus on home cooking comes as costs of dining out are rising nearly twice as fast as grocery prices. Meals outwere up 3.9%in April from a year earlier, federal data show, while at-home food prices rose just 2% over the same period, slower than inflation overall. That divergence helps explain why many restaurant chains are seeing weaker sales. McDonald’s last monthreported its biggest same-store sales decline since the pandemic, with that measure falling 3.6% during the first quarter. Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden, also flagged weaker-than-expected sales around the start of the year, and Chipotle reported its same-store salescontracted for the first time since 2020. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said all but its most affluent diners are increasingly staying away from the burger chain, despite the past year’s efforts to counter its earlier menu price hikeswith value meals. Traffic from low-income consumers was down “nearly double digits” compared to a year ago, with middle-income diners’ visits slowing “nearly as much,” he said. Kempczinski said the split illustrated a “divided” economy in which moderately and less well-off consumers “are being weighed down by the cumulative impact of inflation and heightened anxiety about the economic outlook.” In the meantime, restaurant operators are doing what they can to try to juice sales. Some are leaning into customers’growing appetite for chicken, refreshingtheir locations with sleek new looks, or both. These efforts could prove an uphill battle against the grocery aisle, where the costs of some key purchases, like eggs, are finally easing. But there are still signs of strain at supermarket checkouts as shoppersadjust to higher overall costsfor many of the fridge and pantry basics they can’t easily do without. More shoppers are both financing their grocery purchases with installment loans and falling behind on those bills, a recentLendingTree survey found. One such “buy now, pay later” service, Klarna, said recently that its borrowers arehaving a tougher timeclearing their debts on the platform. Months earlier, the company became Walmart’s exclusive BNPL provider andteamed up with DoorDashto offer installment loans for takeout meals.",

    "article_text": "WATERBURY, Conn. — A Connecticut man was sentenced to 33 years in prison on Tuesday forthe stray-bullet killingof a Puerto Rican Olympic athlete's mother. Jasper Greene, 23, of New Haven, was one of three men charged in the death of Mabel Martinez Antongiorgi on April 9, 2022. The 56-year-old woman was sewing in her home in Waterbury, about 30 miles southwest of Hartford, when a bullet flew through a wall and hit her in the head. Martinez Antongiorgi's daughter, Yarimar Mercado Martinez, competed for the family's native Puerto Rico in rifle shooting at the Olympics in 2016, 2021 and 2024. She was in Brazil for another competition when her mother was killed. Greene pleaded guilty to murder in February. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment after Tuesday's sentencing in Waterbury Superior Court. According to court testimony, the fatal shooting stemmed from a dispute that one of the suspects, Franklin Robinson, had with a man who said hello to his girlfriend. Robinson, Greene and another man shot up a car parked on Martinez Antongiorgi's street, thinking the man was inside it. A bullet went into Martinez Antongiorgi's home. Another bystander was wounded but survived. A jury convicted Robinson of murder and other charges in 2023 and he was later sentenced to 90 years in prison. The third suspect, Levi Brock, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in the case, including murder, and awaits trial. At the time of her mother's death, Mercado Martinez lamented in social media posts that she \"couldn't even say goodbye.\" \"Why you? Why this way?\" she wrote. \"You were just sitting in your little house sewing, as you always did.\" Martinez Antongiorgi and her husband of over 30 years, John Luis Mercado, moved to Waterbury from Puerto Rico a few years after the U.S. territory endured 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria. At the time of her death, they had set a date to renew their wedding vows, their daughter wrote at the time.",

    "article_text": "A teenager suspected of fatally stabbing a teacher in a California high school more than four decades ago was identified after a relative told authorities about a decades-old confession made immediately after the murder, officials said. Harry Nickerson, who was 16 when, the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office said, he killed Diane Peterson at San Jose's Branham High School in 1978, died by suicide in 1993. In a news release Monday, the prosecutor’s office said an earlier witness in the case told investigators he had seen Nickerson carrying a knife with the phrase “Teacher Dear” written on it. That account could not be corroborated, the prosecutor's office said. Peterson was found lying on the floor near her classroom with a single stab wound to her chest on June 16, 1978, one day after school recessed for the summer, according to the release. Teachers were clearing their classrooms at the time. Nickerson was treated as a suspect in the killing, according to the release. In 1983, a student's relatives told police that the student claimed to have seen Nickerson stab Peterson, but the student denied that to authorities. In 1984, a witness told police that Nickerson had implicated himself in the killing, according to the release. Nickerson was later convicted of armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping, and he was shot and critically injured during a drug robbery, the prosecutor's office said. Recent efforts to identify Peterson's killer using DNA were unsuccessful, according to the release. During a meeting with investigators this year, a relative of Nickerson's told authorities that Nickerson had come to the person's home minutes after the killing and confessed. Rob Baker, a prosecutor with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's cold case unit, said in an email that it was unclear why the relative did not come forward sooner but that the person provided a detailed statement \"demonstrating unique knowledge about the crime that could have only come from someone who spoke with the killer.\" In the release, a relative of Peterson's was quoted thanking investigators for not giving up and saying: \"Diane was a beautiful and wonderful person who is missed dearly.”",

    "title": "Holocaust survivor who was burned in Boulder: 'We are better than this'",
    "article_text": "BOULDER, Colo. — The 88-year-old Holocaust survivor who was burned during an attack by a man armed with a \"makeshift flamethrower\" had a message on Tuesday for the rest of America: \"We are better than this.\" In her first words spoken publicly since Sunday's gruesome attack on a group of demonstrators advocating for the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza, Barbara Steinmetz told NBC News that what happened \"has nothing to do with the Holocaust, it has to do with a human being that wants to burn other people.\" Steinmetz said she and other members of the group Run for Their Lives were \"peacefully\" demonstrating when they were suddenly attacked. During a brief interview, Steinmetz still appeared to be rattled by the ordeal. \"It's about what the hell is going on in our country,\" Steinmetz said when pressed. \"What the hell is going on?\" Asked if there was anything more she wanted Americans to know after the attack, Steinmetz said she \"wants people to be nice and decent to each other, kind, respectful, encompassing.\" \"We’re Americans,\" she said. \"We are better than this. That’s what I want them to know. That they be kind and decent human beings.\" Steinmetz, who was born in Hungary, was among a dozen people who were injured in the attack allegedly carried out by a 45-year-old Egyptian national named Mohamed Sabry Soliman. Police said Soliman also hurled Molotov cocktails at the demonstrators. The attack occurred 11 days after two Israeli Embassy workers were gunned down and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington. In both Boulder and Washington, authorities said, the alleged attackers yelled, “Free Palestine.” Rabbi Marc Soloway, the leader ofCongregation Bonai Shalomin Boulder, where Steinmetz is a member, said the woman suffered minor burns but is \"going to be OK\" physically. Soloway said he was less sure about how someone who escaped the Holocaust could process what happened on Pearl Street. \"Can you imagine the trauma that that reactivates?\" Soloway said. \"It’s just horrendous.\" Soloway said Steinmetz was injured while taking part in a weekly walk \"purely to raise awareness of the fact that there are still 58 hostages in tunnels in Gaza.\" In addition to Steinmetz, five other members of his congregation were injured and two remain hospitalized, Soloway said. The rabbi said Soliman, who has been charged with attempted murder and a hate crime, among other offenses, is \"deluded and misguided.\" \"If he thinks that an act of unspeakable brutality and violence is going to help the condition of the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, he is so deluded and so misguided,\" the rabbi said. As for Steinmetz, much of her childhood was spent on an island off the coast of Croatia, which was then part of Italy and where her parents operated a hotel, according tothe CU Independent,the student newspaper at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which published an article about her in 2019 for Holocaust remembrance week. “I lived an idyllic childhood on the banks of the Adriatic,” Steinmetz recalled in the article. But after Italian dictator Benito Mussolini stripped the Italian Jews of their citizenship in 1938, Steinmetz's father took the family to Hungary and from there they fled to France two years later. When the Germans entered France, Steinmetz and her family were forced to flee again, this time to Portugal, where thousands of other refugees were looking for a way to escape from Europe. Steinmetz said her father applied for asylum to a dozen countries, including the United States. But only one would take them — the Dominican Republic.

Steinmetz said they were resettled in the coastal town of Sosúa, and while her parents toiled at menial jobs, she and her sister were sent to a Catholic boarding school where only the Mother Superior knew that they were Jews. “For four years, the convent was our home,” Steinmetz recalled in the article. “Although formidable, the sisters were kind.” Once the war was over, the Steinmetz family was able to move to the United States, where her parents went back into the hotel business in New Hampshire. Steinmetz moved to Boulder in \"the mid-2000s,\" according to the article.",

    "article_text": "TikTok often popularizes songs from music’s biggest and buzziest artists. But one of the most viral songs right now was recorded in 1961. More than six decades ago, singer Connie Francis recorded enough music to fill three albums. Buried on the back of one of those records was the song “Pretty Little Baby.” It wasn’t nearly as popular as her other hits of the time, including “Stupid Cupid” and “Who’s Sorry Now?” But in recent weeks, the forgotten song has found new life on TikTok. Millions of videos have been created with the song on the audio-forward app. It has been featured in videos from everyday users to popular influencers and celebrities. Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are featured in videos set to the ’60s-era tune. Streams of the song are growing. It’s now on some of Spotify’s playlists of popular, viral songs. Francis posted about her viral hit on Facebook,writing, “My thanks to TikTok and its members for the wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception.” She wrote that she was “clearly out of touch,” because when she found out the song was trending on TikTok, her initial response was to ask, “What’s that?” But she’s not out of touch anymore. Francis is now on TikTok. She hasn’t posted on the popular platform yet, but her page features the song’s album artwork.",

    "article_text": "LAGOS, Portugal — Police investigating the disappearance of British toddlerMadeleine McCannsearched near an abandoned rural building in southern Portugal on Tuesday as they launched fresh probes near the holiday resort where she was last seen 18 years ago. The case received worldwide interest for several years, with reports of sightings of McCann occurring as far away as Australia, while books and television documentaries were produced about her disappearance. German investigators and Portuguese police officers and firefighters were searching in the countryside several miles from the Praia da Luz resort, where the3-year-olddisappeared from her bed while on vacation with her family on May 3, 2007. The teams were seen using pickaxes, shovels and chainsaws to clear dense vegetation and dig near a derelict building. Firefighters pumped water out of a well. Almost two decades on, investigators in the U.K., Portugal and Germany are still piecing together what happened on thenight the toddler disappeared. She was in the same room as her brother and sister — 2-year-old twins — while their parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends outside. Portuguese police said Monday that detectives were acting on a request from a German public prosecutor as they carry out “a broad range” of searches this week in the area of Lagos, in southern Portugal. The main suspect is a German national identified by media asChristian Brueckner, who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for raping a 72-year-old woman in Portugal in 2005. He is under investigation on suspicion of murder in the McCann case but hasn’t been charged. He spent many years in Portugal, including in Praia da Luz, around the time of the child’s disappearance. Brueckner has denied any involvement. The last time police resumed searches in the case was in 2023, when detectives from the three countries took part in an operationsearching near a damand a reservoir about 30 miles from the resort. McCann’s family marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance last month and expressed their determination tokeep searching.",

    "title": "Pick for University of Florida president rejected after a conservative backlash",
    "article_text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — In a twist, the state of Florida’s top higher education board voted Tuesday against a contract for Santa Ono, who was set to be the next president of the University of Florida. The decision came after growing opposition on the right to Ono's past statements about diversity, equity and inclusion, Covid and transgender rights, among other issues. Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has prided itself on being at the vanguard of the national conservative movement. But the rejection of Ono, the former president of the University of Michigan, put DeSantis in a thorny political position, and it was a notable outcome in a state Republican ecosystem generally defined by donors and influential figures’ getting their way. One of DeSantis’ longtime biggest political supporters — Mori Hosseini, the billionaire chair of the University of Florida Board of Trustees — strongly backed Ono’s bid to become president of the state’s flagship university. On the other hand, national conservatives, including Christopher Rufo, an activist whobuilt his reputationfighting racial sensitivity trainings and critical race theory courses;Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a Trump ally running for governor; and Donald Trump Jr. argued that Ono’s past support for DEI policies made him unqualified for the job. “WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!???” Trump Jr.wrote on Xlast month. “This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida? “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!” he continued. Two Trump advisers familiar with the issue said his post did not speak for the White House, which was not officially engaged in the fight. Trump Jr.’s post amplifiedone from Rufo, whom DeSantis has praised and whom he appointed to a separate university board in the state in 2023. Rufo's message blasted Ono for a video in which he promoted \"equity and inclusion ... embedded in all areas of academic work” when he was president and vice chancellor at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Ono’s record on DEI policies, the handling of the Covid pandemicand issues like environmental justice were heavily scrutinized Tuesday at the meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, the state’s top education board, which needed to vote to ratify Ono’s new contract. Ono said repeatedly that he had “evolved” on those issues at a hearing that lasted nearly four hours. But the board ultimately rejected him in a 10-6 vote, with notable “no” votes from DeSantis allies, including former state House Speakers Jose Oliva and Paul Renner, along with the outgoing leader of the state Education Department, Manny Diaz, whom DeSantis recently appointed to lead the University of West Florida. “There is no way those guys vote against him without getting some signal from the governor,” a longtime DeSantis adviser said. “I don’t know if anyone expected this, but if you look at the votes, I think that tells you where the governor is at.” Four Florida Republicans told NBC News that their understanding was that DeSantis was initially behind Ono but that the national conservative backlash forced him to not fully put his support behind him publicly or make direct calls to the Board of Governors. But behind the scenes, his team was quietly discussing how to give him a push, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of them said DeSantis' chief of staff, Jason Weida, was making calls in support of Ono ahead of the vote. Underscoring the politically sensitive nature of the vote, DeSantis’ political operation tried to claim some victory after it. “Santa Ono is OUT,”posted Jordan Schachtel, a newly hired DeSantis political staffer. “The Florida Board of Governors has voted to Reject Ono as President of the University of Florida.” “Florida has voted to reject wokeness, DEI, CRT, at our flagship university,” he continued. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also praised the vote, saying it was the \"right decision.\" Donalds, who has Trump's backing in his 2026 bid for governor, was an Ono skeptic from the start. Notably, DeSantis’ wife, Casey, is also considering a run for governor, and the two prominent Florida Republicans are seen as being on a political collision course if Casey DeSantis ultimately decides to run. “I give credit to the Florida Board of Governors for standing up for Florida’s conservative values,” Donalds told NBC News. “Woke has no place in our university system. It’s time to restart the presidential search at UF.” Other longtime Florida operatives said Donalds and other conservative groups amplifying the fight to the Republican political base nationally helped keep DeSantis out of the conversation in a more public way. “The governor was obviously all in,” a DeSantis ally said. “Then Byron Donalds and [the conservative group] Turning Point came out against. The governor in the end does the one thing he knows how to do: run away and protect himself.” DeSantis’ office did not respond to a request for comment. During the contentious meeting, Ono tried to explain that he has had an “evolution” of thought on issues like DEI and that he was both aligned with and attracted to Florida’s brand of governance, which has cracked down on both. “Those sorts of programs will not have a place at the University of Florida,” he told the board. Still, it wasn't enough to convince the skeptics on the board. “I really, really want to try to get to a yes,” board member Carson Good said. “I can’t give a [yes vote], but I wish you the very best and will support you if you win.”",

    "title": "Trump pardons 2 divers who freed 19 sharks off Florida",
    "article_text": "MIAMI — Two South Florida shark divers convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman’s longline several miles from shore have been pardoned by President Donald Trump. Pardons for Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. weresigned last Wednesday. They had been convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The two men avoided prison time, but they were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms and traveling freely outside the United States. “We never stopped fighting, and justice has finally prevailed,” Moore’s attorney, Marc Seitles, said in a statement. “We are thrilled the White House considered our arguments and determined this was an unjust prosecution. We could not be happier for John and Tanner.” Moore, who was captain of a shark-diving charter boat, and Mansell, a crew member, spotted the longline about 3 miles off Jupiter Inlet in August 2020, according to court records. Believing it was an illegal fishing line, the men freed the sharks and the grouper, reported it to state wildlife officials and brought the line back to shore. Federal prosecutors charged the men with theft. Officials said the line actually belonged to a fisherman licensed by theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationto catch sharks for research. A jury convicted Mansell and Moore, and their appeals were denied. The full and unconditional pardons Trump signed erase those convictions. “This case never should have been filed,” Mansell’s attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. “These gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup. I can’t think of two individuals more deserving of a Presidential Pardon.” The pardon is especially notable becauseTrump has a well-documented historyof disliking sharks. At a campaign rally last year, he mused that Lake Michigan was preferable to the Pacific or Atlantic oceans because \"you don’t have sharks. That’s a big advantage. I’ll take the one without the sharks.” His animosity goes back over a decade.In 2013, he posted on X(then Twitter), \"Sharks are last on my list — other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World!\"",

    "article_text": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The Netherlands’ national museum has a new object on display that merges art with Amsterdam’s infamous Red Light District: a nearly 200-year-old condom, emblazoned with erotic art. The Rijksmuseum said in a statement that the playful prophylactic, believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep’s appendix, “depicts both the playful and the serious side of sexual health.” It is part of an exhibition called “Safe Sex?” about 19th-century sex work that opened on Tuesday. The condom, possibly a souvenir from a brothel, is decorated with an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen. The phrase “This is my choice” is written along the sheath in French. According to the museum, this is a reference to the Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting “The Judgment of Paris,” which depicts the Trojan prince Paris judging a beauty contest between three goddesses.

    "title": "Job openings showed surprising increase to 7.4 million in April",
    "article_text": "Employers increased job openings more than expected in April while hiring and layoffs also both rose, according to a report Tuesday that showed a relatively steady labor market. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’Job Openings and Labor Turnover Surveyshowed available jobs totaled nearly 7.4 million, an increase of 191,000 from March and higher than the 7.1 million consensus forecast by economists surveyed by FactSet. On an annual basis, the level was off 228,000, or about 3%. The ratio of available jobs to unemployed workers was down to 1.03 to 1 for the month, close to the March level. Hiring also increased for the month, rising by 169,000 to 5.6 million, while layoffs rose by 196,000 to 1.79 million. Quits, an indicator of worker confidence in their ability to find another job, edged lower, falling by 150,000 to 3.2 million. “The labor market is returning to more normal levels despite the uncertainty within the macro outlook,” wrote Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Research. “Underlying patterns in hirings and firings suggest the labor market is holding steady.” The report comes just a few days ahead of the BLS nonfarm payrolls count for May. With other signs, particularly sentiment data, showing that hiring is softening, economists expect job growth of 125,000, down from the 177,000 in April but still indicative of a solid labor market. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%. In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported thatnew ordersfor manufactured goods fell more than expected in April. Orders fell 3.7% on the month, more than the 3.3% Dow Jones forecast and indicative of declining demand after swelling 3.4% in March as businesses sought to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Shipment also fell, down 0.3%, while unfilled orders were relatively flat and inventories edged down 0.1%. Federal Reserve officials are watching the various data points carefully for clues as to how various factors are affecting the broader economic picture. There is some fear that the tariffs will raise inflation and slow hiring, though that hasn’t showed up yet in the hard data. Sentiment surveys, by contrast, show heightened fears over both. “For many sectors, I’m not hearing that the labor markets are changing in material ways,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a scrum with reporters Tuesday. “At the macro level, I haven’t gotten sort of a strong overarching picture or impression that things are moving in a significant way, and we’ll just have to see if that stays or whether something changes.” Traders largely expect the Fed to keep its benchmark borrowing rate steady in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024. The market thinks the Fed won’t cut again until September, and Bostic said he only would favor one reduction this year.",

    "title": "A long-running experiment finds a tiny particle is still acting weird",
    "article_text": "Final results from a long-runningU.S.-based experimentannounced Tuesday show a tiny particle continues to act strangely — but that’s still good news for thelaws of physicsas we know them. “This experiment is a huge feat in precision,” said Tova Holmes, an experimental physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville who is not part of the collaboration. The mysterious particles called muons are considered heavier cousins to electrons. They wobble like a top when inside a magnetic field, and scientists are studying that motion to see if it lines up with the foundational rulebook of physics called the Standard Model. Experiments in the 1960s and 1970s seemed to indicate all was well. But tests at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the late 1990s and early 2000s produced something unexpected: the muons weren’t behaving like they should. Decades later, an international collaboration of scientists decided to rerun the experiments with an even higher degree of precision. The team raced muons around a magnetic, ring-shaped track — the same one used in Brookhaven’s experiment — and studied their signature wiggle at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago. The first two sets of results — unveiled in 2021 and 2023 — seemed to confirm the muons’ weird behavior, prompting theoretical physicists to try to reconcile the new measurements with the Standard Model. Now, the group has completed the experiment and released a measurement of the muon’s wobble that agrees with what they found before, using more than double the amount of data compared to 2023. They submitted their results to the journal Physical Review Letters. That said, it’s not yet closing time for our most basic understanding of what’s holding the universe together. While the muons raced around their track, other scientists found a way to more closely reconcile their behavior with the Standard Model with the help of supercomputers. There’s still more work to be done as researchers continue to put their heads together and future experiments take a stab at measuring the muon wobble — including one at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex that’s expected to start near the end of the decade. Scientists also are still analyzing the final muon data to see if they can glean information about other mysterious entities like dark matter. “This measurement will remain a benchmark ... for many years to come,” said Marco Incagli with the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Italy. By wrangling muons, scientists are striving to answer fundamental questions that have long puzzled humanity, said Peter Winter with Argonne National Laboratory. “Aren’t we all curious to understand how the universe works?” said Winter.",

    "title": "USDA says demand for sensitive food stamp data from states is on hold",
    "article_text": "By Jude Joffe-Block A banner showing an image of US President Donald Trump hangs on the side of a US Department of Agriculture building in Washington, DC, on May 16, 2025. USDA has put on hold a demand that states turn over sensitive data about food assistance recipients.Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Agriculture's unprecedented demand that states and payment processorsturn over sensitive dataabout people who receive federal food assistance is on hold — for now. A USDA official said in court filings late Friday the agency has not yet begun collecting the personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, after acoalition of groups filed a lawsuitalleging the directive violated federal privacy laws. In aletterlast month, the department told states they would be required to turn over the data of people who had applied to or received aid from SNAP over the past five years, including their names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses. The letter said states should submit the data through their third-party contractors tasked with processing electronic bank transfers. The letter cited President Donald Trump's March 20 executive order,\"Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,\"which calls for federal agencies to have \"unfettered access\" to data from state programs that receive federal funds, including from \"third-party databases.\" In recent months, the Department of Government Efficiency effort hasamassed and consolidated data across federal agenciesto further Trump administration goals, includingimmigration enforcement. NPR reporting revealedthat before the department's May letter, USDA's office of the inspector general had asked four states for SNAP data, and asked at least one state for detailed personal information on everyone who received SNAP over the last year, including citizenship status, according to emails reviewed by NPR. But other data that is typically used to verify financial eligibility for the program wasn't requested. Some states, including Iowa and Ohio, recently said they were preparing to comply with the USDA's request for SNAP data. A coalition of SNAP recipients and hunger, privacy and student groupssued the USDAin federal court on May 22, arguing the request was unlawful and the agency did not follow the proper procedures for data collection. But in Friday's court filings, USDA official Shiela Corley indicated the agency's data request was temporarily paused. Corley, who is chief of staff to the deputy undersecretary for USDA's Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said the agency \"instructed EBT Processors to refrain from sending any data until USDA completed procedural steps to ensure that data received would be appropriately safeguarded and to satisfy all necessary legal requirements.\" It is unclear when the USDA made that communication to payment processors. The department declined to comment on litigation. An email sent by a payment processor company to its partner states last month had suggested the USDA's data collection could be imminent. On May 9, Fidelity Information Services, or FIS,told its state partnersthat \"USDA has made a formal request for records regarding SNAP cardholder and transaction data,\" according to an email reviewed by NPR. The email told states to \"confirm your written consent\" by responding by May 14. FIS along with other payment processors, Conduent and Solutran, declined to comment for this story. \"Our contractor continues to work on this request and nothing has been submitted,\" Alex Murphy, a spokesman for Iowa's Department of Health and Human Services, wrote to NPR in an email. \"We are not aware of any further instructions or a request to pause on sending the data.\" Data collection changes must follow rules Corley's declaration also gave new insights into the USDA's intention to comply with a Privacy Act requirement to file notice and seek public comment on the SNAP data collection. When federal agencies collect or compile new data sets that include personally identifiable information, they must justify the purpose and give the public notice and an opportunity to weigh in by publishing a Systems of Record Notice, known as a SORN. A USDA spokesperson had previously told NPR the agency's counsel was considering whether a new notice was necessary for its new SNAP data-sharing guidance. Corley'sdeclarationstates that the USDA had begun developing a new SORN \"prior to the filing of this lawsuit, and it is currently in the final stages of review.\" Lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit called the USDA's response a \"temporary win,\" since USDA has acknowledged in court that federal privacy laws apply to the data collection process and the data remains, for now, with states and their contractors. \"The Trump administration likes to play fast and loose, including with people's data,\" said Madeline Wiseman, an attorney with the National Student Legal Defense Network, which is representing some plaintiffs in the suit. Wiseman said the USDA's letter threatened states with a possible loss of funding if they fail to consent to this data turnover — but \"when they're hauled to court, it's a different story, things are put on pause, things are slowed down.\" She added that USDA has \"had to look at this through the lens of the federal privacy laws that it appeared were completely absent from the thought and the consideration that went into the letter.\" The lawsuit will continue. One of the plaintiffs' arguments is that the USDA's data request is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and should be halted completely. More than 40 million people receive SNAP benefits each month but last month House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill that would makeunprecedented cutsto the program.

    "title": "The White House unveils the new official portrait of President Trump",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise The new official portrait of Donald Trump shows the president staring into the camera with an expressionless face.White Househide caption The White House unveiled a new portrait of President Trump this week, replacing the image taken in January that had drawn comparisons to a mugshot. In the new photograph, announced by the White House onMonday via X, Trump stares directly into the camera. His right eye is slightly squinted and his mouth is pressed intoa straight line. He is dressed in a blue suit with one of his signature red ties, and an American flag is pinned to his left lapel. The backdrop is dark and blank. The new photo contrasts the January depiction of the president, which showed the president seemingly lit from below –drawing comparisonsto a camper with a flashlight under their chin telling ghost stories – and casting what could be perceived as a menacing stare at the lens. The red and white stripes of the American flag fill in behind his head. \"The first portrait done in January was done with something called up lighting — which is lighting from below — which isn't found in the natural world often,\" said Jeff Whetstone, director of the visual arts program at Princeton University. \"In the new portrait, the lighting is more natural but still dramatic. And it's lighting that shows one side of the face more than the other, so there's a duality there,\" Whetstone continued, comparing the style of photography to the famous 1941 portrait of U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as captured byYousuf Karsh. The January presidential portrait led to immediate comparisons with Trump'sofficial mugshot, taken at Atlanta's Fulton County Jail when he turned himself in for allegedlyattempting to overturnGeorgia's 2020 election results. In that mugshot, Trump's eyebrows appear to be raised, and his eyes look upward to the camera as he glares into the shot. In both of his recent official portraits, Trump has chosen not to smile, breaking with the longstanding tradition of presidents posing with smiles. This contrasts with the toothy grin he displayed in the 2017 portrait from his first term, where he wore a blue suit and a blue dotted tie. Another notable difference is the absence of the American flag in the latest portrait. America's most iconic symbol has served as the backdrop for every president since the 1970s. \"The flag to the right hand of the president has been around since Gerald Ford,\" Whetstone said. A White House official said that Trump's January portrait was never meant to be permanent. \"The old one was always meant to serve as a placeholder,\" the official said. \"The President is the most well-known person on the planet and this new portrait taken during his second term reflects the optimism and resolve of America, especially after a disastrous four years of the Biden administration.\" Trump is famously aware of his public image. Earlier this year, a Colorado artistfaced Trump's ire and outrageover an oil painting commissioned by the state's Republican legislature. Trump accused the artist, Sarah Boardman, of purposefully distorting his likeness, claiming that she had lost her touch with age. Boardman said her business suffered as a result of the attack on her talents and motives. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump asks Congress to wipe out funding for public broadcasting",
    "article_text": "By David Folkenflik , Deirdre Walsh People participate in a rally to call on Congress to protect funding for public broadcasters PBS and NPR outside the NPR headquarters in Washington, DC, on March 26, 2025.Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump took yet another step Tuesday to place NPR and PBS at the center of his broader clash with major cultural institutions, formally asking Congress to take back the $1.1 billion it has set aside for all public broadcasters for the next two years. A simple majority of lawmakers in each chamber must approve what's technically known as a\"rescission request\"within 45 days for it to become law. With their slim leads in both the House and Senate, Republicans can afford just a few defections. A House subcommittee hearing earlier this spring set the stage for Trump's request. His Republican allies accused NPR and PBS of partisan bias. Lawmakers used the hearing as a springboard to argue forelimination of the federal fundingthat is funneled through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to local stations and the public media networks. PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger testified at that hearing. On Tuesday, she warned that Trump's proposal would devastate public broadcasting stations, particularly in rural communities. \"Without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis,\" she said in a statement. \"There's nothing more American than PBS and we are proud to highlight real issues, individuals, and places that would otherwise be overlooked by commercial media.\" Katherine Maher, the CEO and president of NPR,echoed those sentimentsand said that local public radio stations could face \"immediate budget shortfalls,\" leading to layoffs and show cancellations. She also questioned the legality of the request. \"The proposal, which is explicitly viewpoint-based and aimed at controlling and punishing content, violates the Public Broadcasting Act, the First Amendment, and the Due Process Clause,\" Maher said in a statement. The cuts to public broadcasting are part of a larger package from the White House of $9.4 billion in proposed clawbacks, which include funding for foreign aid. House Speaker Mike Johnson noted thatmany of the cutswere identified by the task force on government efficiency led by billionaire Elon Musk. \"We thank Elon Musk and his DOGE team for identifying a wide range of wasteful, duplicative, and outdated programs, and House Republicans are eager to eliminate them,\" Johnson said in a statement, vowing to act quickly on the request. Yet that could prove difficult in the Senate. Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, noted the request included a cut to the HIV/AIDS program started by President George W. Bush that is known as PEPFAR. Collins said it was \"one of the most successful public health programs in the world without a doubt.\" \"I will not support a cut in PEPFAR, which is a program that has saved literally millions of lives and has been extremely effective and well run,\" Collins told reporters. She sidestepped a question on cuts to public broadcasting and whether there were enough Senate Republicans to block the bill. The rescission request follows grousing from conservative Republicans that thebudget plan the House recently approvedonly after Trump visited Capitol Hill would significantly raise the federal debt in coming years. Yet the $1.1 billion to be rescinded from public broadcasting would make little dent in the$36 trillion national debt, even as it represents the full funding levels for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting through the end of September 2027. Congress approved that funding in March as part of a stopgap spending bill the president signed. While public broadcasting has enjoyed bipartisan support over its decades of existence, many Republicans consider it to have a liberal outlook or bias. \"NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical, left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white, urban liberals and progressives,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a vocal Trump ally, said at the subcommittee hearing earlier this spring. Even so, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican,came out last monthin favor of retaining federal funding, saying stations in her state provide vital services. Some leading Democrats also have flagged their enduring support for the networks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, accused Trump of \"misplaced priorities.\" \"President Trump is looking to go after PBS and NPR to settle political scores and muzzle the free press, while undermining foreign assistance programs that push back on China's malign influence, save lives, and address other bipartisan priorities,\"the two senators said in a statement. Rep. Dan Goldman of New York, the Democratic co-chair of the House Public Broadcasting Caucus, sent a letter in May signed by 106 lawmakers – all Democrats – to House appropriators in which they advocated for maintaining financial subsidies. \"Without federal support for public broadcasting, many localities would struggle to receive timely, reliable local news and educational content, especially remote and rural communities that commercial newsrooms are increasingly less likely to invest in,\"stated the letter. \"In states such as Alaska, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Texas, rural public radio stations are often theonlyweekly or daily news source in their communities. Even in places with other daily or weekly news sources, those outlets may not be directing resources toward original or locally based stories, leaving it to public stations to fill the gap.\" The rescission request represents an expansion of Trump's rhetorical attacks on NPR and PBS. He has previously sought to take control of CPB's board by ordering the firing of three of its five members. He also issued an executive order stating that no money from CPB can go to NPR or PBS – and that other public broadcasters that receive CPB money cannot send it to the two national networks. Those moves are now being questioned in court. CPB is privately incorporated in the District of Columbia and was set up by Congress with statutory safeguards against political influence. It sued the Trump White House over the attempt to fire CPB directors. Then NPR and three Colorado member stations sued the administration over Trump's edict that no federal taxpayer money go to NPR or PBS. At the end of May, PBS and Minnesota affiliate Lakeland PBS followed up with their own joint lawsuit challenging the executive order. Asking Congress to claw back funds, however, is unquestionably legal. And it has prompted a flurry of lobbying. Officials from nearly 200 public radio stations flooded Capitol Hill in May to tell lawmakers about the value they say they bring to their communities and regions. By law, Trump's request kicks off the 45-day period for Congress to consider his request. The last time a president successfully made a rescission request was a generation ago.

    "title": "In a break with Trump, Elon Musk calls the GOP megabill a 'disgusting abomination'",
    "article_text": "By Jason Breslow Elon Musk and President Trump speak with reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption Elon Musk delivered a blistering critique of President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill on Tuesday, calling the GOP megabill currently winding its way through Congress a \"disgusting abomination.\" \"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" Musk wrote in a post on his X social media platform. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You Know it.\" The broadside by Musk, who only last weekleft his roleas the guiding force behind the administration's Department of Government Efficiency, comes at a critical moment for the GOP legislation. Republicans in the Senateare beginning work this weekon the multi-trillion package of tax and spending cuts afterit narrowly cleared the Housein May. The party can only afford to lose three votes in order to pass the package. Even before Musk's comments several lawmakers were raising concerns similar to his about the bill's cost. Tuesday's remarks were not Musk's first time speaking out against what Republicans have dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\" In an interviewwith CBSlast week, he said he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag associated with the package. \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said. His continued criticism could complicate the work of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has committed to having the bill to President Trump's desk by July 4. The billionaire CEO of Tesla has become an influential figure in Republican politics. He spent nearly $300 million to support Trump's campaign and has funneled money to GOP candidates in political races across the country. Speaking with reporters after Musk's post, Thune said he believes Musk's assessment of the bill is tied to an estimate from Congressional Budget Office that the bill could add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. Thune said that initial estimate fails to account for potential economic growth as a result of the policy changes in the bill. The CBO is expected to release those details in the coming days. Thune said he hopes Musk will reconsider his position after he sees those numbers. He also emphasized that elected Republicans ran on promises to enact policies to extend the 2017 tax cuts, expand border security, invest in the military and expand U.S. energy production. Still, Musk is not alone in his criticism inside the GOP. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah,responded to Musk's post by writing, \"The Senate must make this bill better.\" Wisconsin's Ron Johnson has threatened to withhold his vote unless Republicans agree to return spending to pre-pandemic levels, whileKentucky's Rand Paul has signaledhe will vote no if the final bill includes a provision to lift the nation's borrowing limit. Paul's criticism prompted President Trump to lash out against him on social media Tuesday. The president said Paul's ideas \"are actually crazy (losers!)\" But the White House was more muted when it came to Musk. \"Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during her daily briefing. \"It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Stabilizing 'operations,' the National Weather Service hires again after Trump cuts",
    "article_text": "By Greg Allen An aerial view of severe flooding in Frankfort, Kentucky, caused by days of heavy rainfall on April 7, 2025. Violent storms battering the central-eastern United States killed at least 17 people. The storms came as the National Weather Service was grappling with nearly 600 job cuts by the Trump administration. Now, the NWS has been given authorization to rehire more than 100 forecasters, radar technicians and others.Leandro Lozada/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption MIAMI — After public backlash and concern, theNational Weather Serviceis beginning the process of hiring more than 100 employees to \"stabilize operations\" at its field offices around the country. Following cuts ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year, theweather service lost nearly 600 positions. Erica Grow Cei, a National Weather Service spokesperson, says the new hires will fill positions at field offices where there's \"the greatest operational need.\" Tom Fahy, legislative director with the union that represents NWS employees, says the service will fill 126 new positions. \"The positions' categories are meteorologist, hydrologist, physical scientist and electronic technicians,\" he says. Electronic technicians are critical positions in charge of maintaining and repairing weather radar installations and other sensitive equipment. \"Radar is an essential part of our national weather infrastructure,\" Fahy says, \"to protect the American people from severe weather and dangerous storms. Following the job cuts, some field offices were no longer staffed around the clock. Some also cut back on weather balloon launches, critical tools in gathering data needed for local and national forecasts, according to theNational Weather Service. Mary Glackin, a former undersecretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the NWS' parent agency, says the weather service has been temporarily assigning employees to field offices around the country to cover staff shortages. She says the announcement of the new hires is an admission by the administration that thejob cuts went too far. \"We're in the middle of a severe weather season, and I know that's put quite a strain on the system,\" she says, noting that it's also the beginning of the Atlantic hurricane season. \"It's not a good time to be understaffed.\" Cei says the Trump administration granted the weather service an exemption to a government-wide hiring freeze and it will begin advertising for \"permanent, mission-critical field positions.\" Glackin says, from her experience, filling positions at NOAA can take months. She expects it will be September at the earliest before many of the positions are filled. And she notes, after the cuts earlier this year, NWS is short several hundred positions. She says, \"This is kind of putting a band-aid on a rather large wound.\" Fahy says he expects that many of the approximately 100 probationary NWS employees terminated in the Trump administration job cuts may reapply for the positions, some of which they may have already been trained and certified for.

    "title": "One company forecasting a better year ahead? Dollar General",
    "article_text": "Alina Selyukh Shopping carts sit outside of a Dollar General store in Chicago.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide caption In a year of tariffs and some shopperstightening budgets, one company stands apart from many retailers because it's upgrading — rather than lowering — its financial forecast. That company is Dollar General, the largest U.S. dollar-store chain. So far this year, people are spending more at Dollar General — enough that sales jumped 2.4% from February through April compared to the same quarter last year,the company reportedon Tuesday. In part, that's thanks to shoppers trading down from more expensive stores. Historically, dollar stores thrive during tough economic times, as more people look for cheaper places to shop. In recent months, economists have shifted theirrecession projectionsas President Trump repeatedly changes the scale oftariffs on imports, which at one point reached 145% on China and 10% on almost the whole world. Dollar General might raise prices because of tariffs but it's the last resort, CEO Todd Vasos told investors on an earnings call. The chain is attracting even more lower-income shoppers than usual, along with middle-income shoppers looking for deals. Vasos said nearly two-thirds of Dollar General shoppers have told the company they expect to cut back spending even on necessities in the year ahead. A quarter of shoppers have noted having less income this year. \"This is a tight environment for the consumer, and we'll be there for her,\" Vasos said. Major consumer brands, including Pepsi and Tide-maker Procter & Gamble, have beensounding alarmsabout consumer spending in the U.S. Campbell'son Monday saidmore shoppers are cooking at home, rather than splurging on restaurants, and spending more on its canned soups and sauces. Retailers have felt the pressureto comment carefully on tariffsto avoid the president's criticism. Trump attacked Walmart on social media last month afterthe retail giant saidit was forced to raise prices. Target has now downplayed tariff-related price hikes, while lowering its financial forecast for the year. Home Depot said it didn't plan broad price increases, thoughsome prices might go upand some items may disappear. Dollar General on Tuesday forecast its net sales to grow between 3.7% and 4.7% in the year ending on Jan. 30, 2026. That's 0.3% more than prior expectations. Part of the retailer's raised forecast also has to do with the chain's hopes to mitigate tariff-related cost increases. That includes pushing suppliers to eat some costs, finding cheaper substitute products and shifting manufacturing locations. Dollar General's latest forecast assumes that current tariff rates —lowered to 30% on Chinese imports through a temporary deal— will remain in place through mid-August. The retailer still imports the majority of its goods from China, though Vasos said he's worked to decrease the share of Chinese imports. On Tuesday morning, the higher financial forecast sent Dollar General shares up more than 12%.The stock price of rivals Five Below and Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, also rose. The two companies are slated to report their earnings on Wednesday. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Harvey Weinstein's new trial is almost over. It could be a litmus test for #MeToo",
    "article_text": "By Ilya Marritz Former film producer Harvey Weinstein appears in criminal court in Manhattan on Friday.Yuki Iwamura/Getty Imageshide caption Editor's note:This story includes descriptions of allegations about sexual assault and rape. Closing arguments in Harvey Weinstein's second sex crimes trial in New York are underway today. In 2020, a New York juryconvictedWeinstein of rape and sexual assault, completing the fall from grace of the legendary film mogul. But Weinstein's conviction was dismissed on appeal last year, and a new trial began in April. Aside from Weinstein and his accusers, few of the people in the courtroom were there five years ago. The judge and jurors are different; so are the prosecutors and some of the defense attorneys. The climate has also changed. During his 2020 trial, the #MeToo movement was at its height, and the careers of powerful men such asMatt Lauer,Charlie RoseandR. Kellyhad recently come apart after they were publicly accused of serious sexual offenses. Detailed sexual assault allegations against Weinstein helped to catalyze the #MeToo movement when they were published inThe New York TimesandThe New Yorkerin the the fall of 2017. But today, a number of prominent men accused of misconduct, from comedianLouis C.K.to actorKevin Spacey, have begun making public appearances again. Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is a leading contender to be the next mayor of New York City, and jurors on their lunch breaks might have seen his campaign posters around lower Manhattan. Cuomoresigned office in 2021after an investigation found he sexually harassed 11 women. Donald Trump,who was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial in 2023, was reelected president the following year. At the same time, powerful men in entertainment continue to be held to account. Weinstein's second New York trial, in state court, coincided withthe sex trafficking and racketeering trial of rapper and music producer Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, in federal court just a few blocks away. That trial is ongoing. Weinstein was separately convicted of sex crimes in California in 2022, but his legal team has appealed those charges, too. Gloria Allred, an attorney who has represented many women making harassment and assault claims, including Mimi Haley, who has testified against Weinstein in this trial, told a gaggle of reporters outside the courthouse in late April that even with fewer high profile cases coming to light, the #MeToo movement is \"alive and well.\" She said many women have been able to successfully obtain confidential civil settlements. \"I just did one yesterday without ever having to file a lawsuit,\" Allred said. Much of the #MeToo movement's power is contained in its name. As more and more women spoke up about their experiences, especially with powerful men, their combined accounts could credibly demonstrate a pattern of bad conduct. But in this trial, prosecutors have less material to work with than in the first. That's because an appeals court ruled in 2024 that Judge James M. Burke, who presided over the first Weinstein trial, had wrongly permitted testimony that was meant to establish a pattern of misconduct by Weinstein. A number of women in that trial testified about alleged crimes that were not part of the indictment, under what's known in New York as Molineux testimony. The majority on the sharply divided appeals court wrote that \"it is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behavior that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges lodged against them.\" As a consequence, after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg decided to retry Weinstein, his legal team presented jurors with testimony from just three accusers, instead of the six who took the stand in the first trial. Allred said the appeals court's decision to bar testimony from what she called \"Me Too witnesses\" was a mistake. \"They could show what's called a propensity to commit certain crimes.\" Weinstein is charged with two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. The prosecution built its case around three star witnesses whose accounts had many points in common. All three women were young when they met Weinstein, and eager to get ahead in entertainment. Mimi Haley arrives at the courthouse to testify against Harvey Weinstein on May 1.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Imageshide caption One of them, Miriam \"Mimi\" Haley, testified that she was a producer on The Weinstein's Company'sProject Runway2006, when she visited Weinstein in his SoHo apartment. After Weinstein allegedly lunged at her, she said she made it clear she did not want to have sex. Then, Haley alleged in her testimony, Weinstein threw her down on a bed, physically subdued her and performed oral sex on her. \"I couldn't get away from his grip, I couldn't get away from him,\" Haley said. \"And I realized that I'm like this is I'm getting raped — this is what this is,\" she said. Her planner, which was produced in evidence, states that she had her period at the time. In testimony, Haley described Weinstein ripping a tampon out of her vagina. Another woman, Kaja Sokola, said she met Harvey Weinstein for drinks in the spring of 2006 at a downtown Manhattan hotel, bringing along her older sister. Sokola was 19 at the time, and a model and aspiring actress. She testified that Weinstein told her there was a movie script he wanted her to look at, and she followed him to a hotel room upstairs, leaving her sister. Once the hotel room door closed, Sokola said, Weinstein pushed her onto a bed and began undressing her. \"I kept saying 'please don't, please stop, I don't want this!'\" Sokola testified. Weinstein performed oral sex on her. Afterward, Sokola alleged, \"he said to me, 'you see — that wasn't so difficult.'\" Kaja Sokola arrives in court on May 8.Angela Weiss/Getty Imageshide caption A third accuser, Jessica Mann, said Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel in 2013. Like the other women, she said in her testimony that she resisted but was no physical match for the heavyset Weinstein. Haley and Mann testified at the first trial; Sokola was a new witness. Allred, who is representing Haley, said, \"She's doing it for only one reason … it's for the cause of justice.\" For Weinstein's large team of attorneys, clearing their client's name meant dirtying the three accusers' names. \"Any trial where you have witnesses such as complainants, making the accusations like these witnesses against Mr. Weinstein, you're gonna attack the credibility,\" Imran Ansari, a member of Weinstein's defense team, said outside the courthouse in April. \"That goes without saying.\" In his opening statement to jurors, Arthur Aidala, Weinstein's lead lawyer, rebutted the prosecution's claim that Weinstein held all the power in his relationships with the women. Aidala called Haley, Sokola and Mann \"sophisticated\" and \"conniving\" players who saw Weinstein as their golden ticket to success. \"They're trying to cut the line,\" Aidala said, noting that the women hadn't attended top drama schools like Juilliard, Yale or SUNY Purchase. He described Weinstein's sexual encounters as \"friend with benefits\" arrangements common in the industry. Weinstein accuser Jessica Mann arrives at his trial on May 21.John Angelillo/Getty Imageshide caption In cross-examination, the defense team sought to pull apart each woman's story by raising questions about their judgment and behavior.For example, Haley, Sokola and Mann all testified that they continued to communicate with Weinstein even after he allegedly assaulted them; Weinstein's attorney's honed in on this information. Mann testified that she continued to have a sexual relationship with Weinstein, and sought his company's help getting a audition for a part in a film less than a month after her alleged rape. Under cross-examination by defense lawyers, Sokola's sister, Ewa Sokola, said Kaja did not disclose the alleged assault to her or speak badly of Weinstein before 2017. All three women have also received substantial civil settlements. The defense team frequently claimed the court itself was biased against Weinstein, with his attorneys making numerous motions for mistrial over the course of the proceeding. All were denied by Judge Curtis Farber. Throughout the trial, Weinstein, who is 73, sat at the defense table in a wheelchair, usually wearing a dark blue or charcoal suit. Court officers removed his handcuffs before the jury entered the room. Although pale, Weinstein appeared energetic, attentively watching witness testimony and conferring with his lawyers. Weinstein has been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia and a host of other health problems, according to his attorneys. His diminished physical appearance stood in contrast with photos the jury was shown of Weinstein at the pinnacle of his career in the 1990s and early 2000s: with Hillary and Bill Clinton, displaying awards for the camera with Gwyneth Paltrow, shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth II. Weinstein was widely credited as a Hollywood tastemaker who made winning bets on such era-defining films asSex, Lies, and Videotape,Pulp FictionandShakespeare In Love. For years, there had been rumors about his sexual life. In the fall of 2017, the dam of accusations broke open with back-to-back exposés inThe New York TimesandThe New Yorker. Each report included multiple on-the-record interviews with Weinstein's accusers. Within a matter of weeks, Weinstein wasremoved from the company he co-founded,expelled from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, and left by his then wife, who has since divorced him. Weinstein did not testify at his own trial. But he did give a rare interview to far-right podcaster Candace Owens in an episode released during the trial.On her show, Weinstein admitted he had been unfaithful to his wife and hurt people around him, but maintained he is innocent of the charges for which he is being tried.

    "title": "COVID vaccine changes confuse and upset some parents and families",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein COVID vaccine access will be more limited for some groups, after federal health officials changed recommendations.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption Loryn Competti was watching the news with her husband at their home in Cincinnati when she heard about the new federal policy about who should get a COVID vaccine. \"I started crying,\" says Competti. \"I was like, 'Am I really not going to be able to get this vaccine? Why? Why?' That's absolutely terrifying.\" Competti, 30, is about five months pregnant, which means she's at high risk for serious complications from COVID. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasdropped its recommendationthat healthy pregnant women routinelyget vaccinatedagainst the virus. That means many insurance companies may not pay for the shots for them anymore. \"I don't want to get COVID while I'm pregnant,\" Competti says. \"I don't want it to hurt my child. I don't want to have a premature birth. I just know that there's complications that come along with it.\" She also knows that the most certain way toprotect her newborn sonis by getting vaccinated herself so she can share her antibodies in her womb. Newborn babies are too young to get a shot themselves. Loryn Competti, 30, and her husband Jack Mansfield, 30 pose for a photo in July of 2024. Loryn is about five months pregnant and wants to get vaccinated to protect herself and her newborn baby.Competti familyhide caption Competti is just one of many people worried about aflurry of changesimplemented by the Trump administration in recent weeks affecting access to the COVID-19 vaccines for healthy pregnant women, kids with no other health problems, and adults under 65 with no risk factors. The CDC has dropped its recommendation that healthy children routinely continue getting vaccinated and is now saying parents should talk to their children's doctors about getting the shots. And, starting with new boosters coming this fall, the Food and Drug Administration willnow only approve the shotsfor people who are at high risk for serious complications from COVID because they are age 65 or older or have risk factors for health problems that make them vulnerable. The FDA is demanding the vaccine companies conduct large, costly studies to prove the vaccines are still necessary and safe for everyone else. Administration officials argue the shotsare no longer necessaryfor healthy pregnant women, kids andyounger adults under 65because so many people have so much immunity at this point. Officials like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Martin Makary alsoquestion the safetyof the vaccines, even though billions of people have gotten the shot and there's widespread consensus among most public health and infectious disease experts that the shots are very safe and effective. With most Americansdeclining to get COVID shots anyway, many people are indifferent to the changes. In social media responses received by NPR, some peoplesaid they were happy to see the changes, claiming the vaccines harmed them. And some outside observers agree with the changes. \"I think the pre-existing COVID recommendations, especially for anyone over 6 months of age, were pretty ridiculous and pretty extreme,\" saysJudge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. \"I think this aligns with what we do know about the current science about the vaccines and the current risks and rewards of vaccination.\" The recommendation that parents of children may still get the shots after talking with their doctors could mean that insurers would still pay for the shots, but that's not guaranteed. \"Based on my collective observations of payer coverage of vaccines, the bottom line is to expect variability in coverage,\" saysRichard Hughes,a health care policy lawyer who'sfollowing the issue. Competti and others for whom the vaccines are no longer recommended or approved may still be able to access the vaccines because doctors could prescribe them \"off-label,\" enabling people to pay for them themselves. But the shots can cost as much as about $200 each. Children getting their first vaccinations require two injections. Competti knows she will probably still be able to get vaccinated by paying for a shot herself. But all the uncertainty and changing rules makes her anxious. \"If we're losing access to COVID vaccines, I don't know if other things are going to get taken away,\" she says. \"I'm scared.\" Another concern is the moves may confuse many doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals, making some hesitant to offer the shots even if they could. \"These new HHS changes, in the absence of any justification, fuel myths and misconceptions about COVID vaccines,\" saysKelly Moore, president and CEO ofImmunize.org, an advocacy group. \"Conflicting recommendations, with professional medical societies on one side and HHS leadership on the other, will generate tremendous confusion among health care professionals and the public,\" Moore says. \"People who are confused don't act. Their default is not to vaccinate.\" Healthy pregnant women aren't the only people who are worried about access to the shots. Rachel Sampler Zelaya, 45, her husband, Jorge, 45, pose for a photo in Feb. 2025 with their children (from left) Clara, 11, Jorge 9, Lucia, 6. The Zelayas are from Cottage Grove, Minn. and want to continue to get vaccinated to protect their daughter, Lucia, who has asthma, but also to continue to protect themselves.Zelaya familyhide caption Ashley Hoskins, 45, and her husband, Bob, 50, who live in Nashville, Tenn., with their young daughter, also want to keep getting vaccinated. That's because Bob has to take powerful immune system suppressing drugs to prevent his body from rejecting his transplanted kidney. \"He's at a heightened risk to catch everything,\" Ashley Hoskins says. \"So not only do we have to worry about whether or not he can receive vaccines. We have always had to be vaccinated as well to provide another wall of protection around him.\" Bob Hoskins will still be able to get a shot. But now Ashley Hoskins and her daughter worry about whether they will too. \"Blanket decisions like this — it doesn't allow the families to think about their own private situation,\" Ashley Hoskins says. \"How do we protect the people that we love? People are going to get hurt. So, yeah, it's frustrating. It's scary.\" Rachel Sampler Zelaya, 42, of Cottage Grove, Minn., is concerned too. Her 6-year-old daughter, Lucia, has asthma. So Zelaya wants to keep getting herself, her husband, Jorge, 45, and their two other healthy kids, Jorgito, 9, and Clara, 11, vaccinated to protect her too. But none of them would be automatically eligible except the youngest under the new policies. \"I'm angry,\" Zelaya says. \"It feels like I've had a choice taken away from me.\" Some administration officials, however, question whether vaccinating one person protects those around them. \"To date there is no high-quality evidence that you getting a booster to visit your grandma protects your grandma beyond your grandma getting the booster herself,\" Dr.Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines, said on aCDC video. \"Does it lead to less transmission? Does it lead to fewer instances of severe disease? We are interested in evidence to inform this claim.\" But other experts question that argument. \"Basically it seems common sense that vaccination, to the extent it reduces infection frequency or severity, could help protect others you may come in contact with,\" said Dr.Jesse Goodman, a former FDA vaccine official now at Georgetown University. This would make sense, Goodman says, \"given that the vaccinated may have less frequent infections in the three to six months after vaccination and given that some studies suggest there may be reduced shedding of virus.\" For Hoskins, she's not just worried about protecting her daughter. She also wants to shield the whole family to protect everyone's health. \"It's not just a cold. It affects the vascular system, the neurological system, the immune system. And even mild cases have the potential to develop into long COVID,\" she says. \"We vaccinate for far less. And this is definitely a disease to me that needs to be vaccinated for.\" Suddenly having to worry about the vaccines again feels like a flashback to the early days of the pandemic, she says. \"It feels like we are going back in time again to where there's not a whole lot that I can do to protect my kids,\" she says.

    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. Hadeel Al-Shalchi Palestinians carry the body of Reem Al-Akhras who was killed while heading to a Gaza aid hub, during her funeral in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Tuesday.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption TEL AVIV, Israel — At least 27 Palestinians were killed Tuesday and dozens more wounded as they tried to collect food in southern Gaza, according to local health officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The incident occurred near a food distribution site operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private group backed by the U.S. Witnesses say Israeli forces opened fire on the crowd. The Israeli militaryacknowledged firing warning shotsto disperse what it described as a threatening group approaching troops. In a statement the military said \"the troops carried out warning fire, and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near individual suspects who advanced toward the troops.\" The military says it is investigating the incident and is aware of reports of civilian casualties. GHF, however, insists there was no gunfire in or near its facilities. Chaos continues to plague food aid delivery in Gaza, where the U.N. says distribution has become a\"death trap\"and warns the territory is on the brink of famine. Over the weekend, a similar tragedy unfolded when at least 31 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 injured by Israeli fire as they headed toward other distribution sites, according to Gaza health authorities. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots toward individuals about a thousand yards from the site. NPR producer Ahmed Abuhamda spoke with a man named Barakat, who withheld his full name, fearing repercussions from Israel. Barakat said he left home at 3:30 a.m. to secure a spot in line before supplies ran out. Israeli navy boats started firing, he claimed. He said he crawled to avoid getting shot, and saw a woman raise her head when she was fatally shot. \"It's inhumane, unsafe, and unfair,\" Barakat added. He returned home empty-handed. Speaking anonymously in line with military protocol, an Israeli military official told media outlets, including NPR, that troops did fire warning shots at \"suspects\" about a thousand yards from the food site. The official said it was to prevent them from approaching troops. Despite the U.S.-supported effort to deliver aid, getting food in Gaza remains a deadly ordeal.

    "title": "Florida ban on kids using social media likely unconstitutional, judge rules",
    "article_text": "Judge grants injunction, says Florida law is \"extraordinarily blunt instrument.\" A federal judge ruled today that Florida cannot enforce a law that requires social media platforms to block kids from using their platforms. The state law \"is likely unconstitutional,\" US Judge Mark Walker of the Northern District of Floridaruledwhile granting the tech industry's request for a preliminary injunction. The Florida law \"prohibits some social media platforms from allowing youth in the state who are under the age of 14 to create or hold an account on their platforms, and similarly prohibits allowing youth who are 14 or 15 to create or hold an account unless a parent or guardian provides affirmative consent for them to do so,\" Walker wrote. The law is subject to intermediate scrutiny under the First Amendment, meaning it must be \"narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,\" must \"leave open ample alternative channels for communication,\" and must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests,\" the ruling said. Florida claimed its law is designed to prevent harm to youth and is narrowly tailored because it targets sites that use specific features that have been deemed to be addictive. But the law applies too broadly, Walker found: Even assuming the significance of the State's interest in limiting the exposure of youth to websites with \"addictive features,\" the law's restrictions are an extraordinarily blunt instrument for furthering it. As applied to Plaintiffs' members alone, the law likely bans all youth under 14 from holding accounts on, at a minimum, four websites that provide forums for all manner of protected speech: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat. It also bans 14- and 15-year-olds from holding accounts on those four websites absent a parent's affirmative consent, a requirement that the Supreme Court has clearly explained the First Amendment does not countenance. Walker said the Florida \"law applies to any social media site that employs any one of the five addictive features under any circumstances, even if, for example, the site only sends push notifications if users opt in to receiving them, or the site does not auto-play video for account holders who are known to be youth. Accordingly, even if a social media platform created youth accounts for which none of the purportedly 'addictive' features are available, it would still be barred from allowing youth to hold those accounts if the features were available to adult account holders.\" Florida also argued that the law \"is narrowly targeted only to 'platforms that have proven effective at using [the statute's purportedly 'addictive'] features to addict children,'\" Walker said. The judge disagreed with Florida, writing that the law \"sweeps in platforms on which ten percent or more of the 'daily active users' under 16 have spent an average of two or more hours per day during the previous 12 months. That simply means that the ability of youth under 16 to access a given social media platform will turn on how long other youth have used the platform in the last year, whether they have used it for that long because they are 'addicted' or because they simply wished to engage with speech for more than two hours per day.\" The law will be on hold while litigation continues. \"Plaintiffs' members face irreparable injury because the law forces them to choose between either incurring unrecoverable compliance costs and curtailing their First Amendment rights to disseminate speech to willing listeners, or risking an enforcement action that could result in penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and attorney fees and costs,\" Walker wrote. Floridapassed the lawlast year. The state was sued by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and NetChoice, two groups representing Big Tech companies such as Meta and Google. \"This ruling vindicates our argument that Florida's statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors—and likely adults as well—from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" CCIA CEO Matt Schruerssaid. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians' constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\" The injunction doesn't block all of the social media restrictions in the state law. Walker said his order \"leaves in place new provisions of Florida law that require covered social media platforms to terminate any account held by a youth under 16 in the state upon the request of a parent or guardian.\" The Florida law alsorequires age verificationfor porn websites, but CCIA and NetChoice's requested injunction applied only to the social media provisions. Separately, aTexas state lawrequiring age-verification systems on porn websites is beingreviewedby the Supreme Court. In the Florida case, Walker found that there was no need to wait for the Supreme Court's ruling on the Texas law. \"Defendant points to the Supreme Court's pending decision inFree Speech Coalition v. Paxton, in which it will determine the appropriate standard for assessing a law that burdens adults' access to protected speech,\" Walker wrote. \"But there is no reason to withhold relief in this case until the Supreme Court issues its decision inFree Speech Coalitionbecause this Court's determination of the Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits does not turn on any argument regarding the law's impact on adult users' speech.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Polish engineer creates postage stamp-sized 1980s Atari computer",
    "article_text": "Hobby project shrinks 1980s computer platform that pierced the Iron Curtain. In 1979, Atari released the Atari400 and 800, groundbreaking home computers that included custom graphics and sound chips, four joystick ports, and the ability to run themost advancedhome video games of their era. These machines, which retailed for $549 and $999, respectively, represented a leap in consumer-friendly personal computing, with their modular design and serial I/O bus thatpresaged USB. Now, 46 years later, a hobbyist has shrunk down the system hardware to a size that would have seemed like science fiction in the 1970s. Polish engineer Piotr \"Osa\" Ostapowiczrecently unveiled\"Atarino,\" which may be the world's smallest 8-bit Atari computer re-creation, according to retro computing siteAtariteca. The entire system—processor, graphics chips, sound hardware, and memory controllers—fits on a module measuring just 2×1.5 centimeters (about 0.79×0.59 inches), which is roughly the size of a postage stamp. Ostapowicz's creation reimplements the classic Atari XL/XE architecture using modernFPGA(field-programmable gate array) technology. Unlike software emulators that simulate old hardware (and modern recreations that run them, like theAtari 400 Miniconsole) on a complete computer system of another architecture, Atarino reproduces the original Atari components faithfully at the logic level, allowing it to run vintage software while maintaining compatibility with original peripherals. \"The current project is not strictly a clone of Atari but basically, well, I'm forming a machine that is compatible with the Atari 8-bit computer itself, but it was created on the basis of the framework that I created some time ago,\" OstapowicztoldAtari Online PL in a January 2024 YouTube interview. The project, which began over a decade ago and was first publicly demonstrated in December 2023, includes a6502Cprocessor,ANTICandGTIAgraphics chips,POKEYsound chip, and memory controllers onto a single Lattice UP5K FPGA chip. Despite its tiny size, the system can run at clock speeds up to 31 MHz—far faster than the original hardware's 1.79 MHz. While Atarino maintains broad compatibility with classic Atari software, Ostapowicz says he has enhanced the original design in several ways. For example, the 6502 processor core follows the physical chip specifications but adds new instructions. The memory system uses independent channels rather than the original's \"cycle stealing\" approach (where the graphics chip temporarily halts the CPU to access memory), improving performance. The graphics capabilities of the Atarino also extend beyond the original's limitations. Ostapowicz implemented functional clones of the ANTIC and GTIA chips with extended resolution modes. And the system outputs video through both VGA at 60 Hz and HDMI. The modular design allows hobbyists to integrate Atarino into custom keyboards, miniaturized cases, or development boards. Ostapowicz has created multiple keyboard variants, including one based on the65XElayout and another using a UART interface with microcontroller-based scanning. The system also supports connections to modern peripherals through Wi-Fi or Ethernet modules. Development continues on the project, with Ostapowicz currently refining the POKEY sound chip emulation to match the original's asynchronous behavior. He's also working on simplifying development tools for users, with the environment already compatible with CC65 and Visual Studio Code. He plans to release complete kits with documentation, inviting the retrocomputing community to experiment with the hardware. The Atari 8-bit platformholds particular significancein Poland and Europe in general, where these computers performed well on the home market throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. While most American consumers had moved on to newer systems, Polish users in particular embraced Atari's affordable computers during the country's economic transition away from communism, creating a vibrant community that persists today. This nostalgic connection has made Poland a global hub for Atari 8-bit development and preservation. In communist Poland, Western computers were primarily available throughPewex, a chain of hard-currency shops that accepted only US dollars. DespiteCOCOM embargoeson Western technology, Atari computers became generally available at these stores, partly thanks to efforts byJack Tramiel, the Polish-born Atari owner who ensured his computers reached his homeland. This nostalgic connection has made Poland a global hub for Atari 8-bit development and preservation. For Atarino creator Ostapowicz, his Atari miniaturization project is more than a nostalgic exercise or a mere technical challenge; it stems from a desire to create a tiny platform that applies 8-bit computing to new applications. He also saw an opportunity to build something fun and useful for today's hobbyists and developers, bridging the past with future possibilities. \"I just came to the conclusion that we can build something that is compatible with Atari, give it a miniature form, and then it will happen,\" he said in the Atari Online interview. \"As I mentioned, if someone wants to make a portable console, he has an open road. If someone wants to make an IoT system out of it, here you go.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump is forcing states to funnel grant money to Starlink, Senate Democrats say",
    "article_text": "Overhaul of $42 billion program could delay deployment for years, Democrats warn. Senate Democrats are pleading with the Trump administration to stop delaying distribution of $42 billion in grants for construction of broadband networks in areas with poor Internet access. The Biden administration spent about three years developing rules and procedures for the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) fund and then evaluating plans submitted by each US state and territory. Republicans repeatedly alleged that Democrats should have distributed the grants more quickly, but the Trump administration halted progress after taking over. \"States are ready to put shovels in the ground and have been waiting for months to get started... Additional delays and onerous changes to the program at this stage threaten to further stall urgently needed deployment and leave communities behind,\" Senate Democrats wrote in a May 30letterto President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter was sent by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.). Trump's Commerce Departmentreversedthe Biden-era decision to prioritize the building of fiber networks in the BEAD program. The move to a \"tech-neutral approach\" is expected to result in much of the funding being distributed to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite program, even though fiber networks are faster and more reliable. \"States have already developed plans to address these needs, and restarting or slowing down the process will only hold back progress,\" the Democrats' letter said. \"States must maintain the flexibility to choose the highest quality broadband options, rather than be forced by bureaucrats in Washington to funnel funds to Elon Musk's Starlink, which lacks the scalability, reliability, and speed of fiber or other terrestrial broadband solutions.\" Lutnick hassaida tech-neutral approach will require states to provide Internet access \"at the lowest cost to taxpayers,\" ruling out fiber in many areas that might otherwise have been eligible for that type of network. SpaceX's Starlink satellite system is being deployed nationwide regardless of whether it gets BEAD funding, althoughsubsidiescould be used to lower the cost to consumers. Cable and fixed wireless ISPs could also get more funding to expand their networks due to the Trump administration's overhaul of the program. Lutnick's announcement of the BEAD overhaul also criticized what he called the program's \"woke mandates\" and \"burdensome regulations.\" Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) havecriticizeda requirement for ISPs that accept subsidies to offer low-cost Internet plans to people with low incomes, though the low-cost rule was originally imposed by Congress in the law that created the BEAD program. Although Musk last weekannounced his departurefrom the government and criticized a Trump spending bill for allegedly \"undermining\" DOGE's cost-cutting work, Trump still seems favorably inclined toward Starlink. Trump said in apress conferenceon Friday that with Starlink, Musk \"saved a lot of lives, probably hundreds of lives in North Carolina,\" referring toStarlink offering emergency connectivityafter Hurricane Helene. Democrats' letter to Trump and Lutnick said that fiber and other terrestrial broadband technologies will be better than satellite both for residential connectivity and business networks that support US-based manufacturing. \"Data centers, smart warehouses, robotic assembly lines, and chip fabrication plants all depend on fast, stable, and scalable bandwidth. If we want these job-creating facilities built throughout the United States, including rural areas... we must act now—and we must build the high-speed, high-capacity networks those technologies demand,\" the letter said. Democrats also said the Trump administration's rewrite of program rules could delay projects by two years. \"For six months, states have been waiting to break ground on scores of projects, held back only by the Commerce Department's bureaucratic delays,\" the letter said. \"If states are forced to redo or rework their plans, they will not only miss this year's construction season but next year's as well, delaying broadband deployment by years. That's why we urge the Administration to move swiftly to approve state plans, and release the $42 billion allocated to the states by the BEAD Program.\" Separately from BEAD, Trumpsaid last monththat he is killing a $2.75 billion broadband grant program authorized by Congress. The Digital Equity Act of 2021 allows for several types of grants benefitting low-income households, people who are at least 60 years old, people incarcerated in state or local prisons and jails, veterans, people with disabilities, people with language barriers, people who live in rural areas, and people who are members of a racial or ethnic minority group. Trump called the program \"racist and illegal,\" saying his administration would stop distributing Digital Equity Act grants.

    "title": "Shopper denied $51 refund for 20TB HDD that’s mostly a weighted plastic box",
    "article_text": "Customer told Ars that the website wouldn't offer a full refund. Many Arsians are the go-to IT support representative for family and friends. If you're lucky, your loved ones' problems are easily resolved with a reset, update, or new cable. That wasn't the case for a son who recently had to break the news to his father that the 20TB portable hard drive he purchased for about $50 was mostly just a plastic box with weights and a PCB. Ars Technica spoke with the Reddit user whoposted abouthis father bringing him a \"new 20T[B] HDD to see if I could figure out what was wrong with it.\" The Redditor, who asked that we refer to him by his first name, Martin, revealed that his dad paid £38 (about $51.33) for what he thought was a portable HDD. That's a red flag. HDDs have gotten cheaper over the years, but notthat cheap. A 20TB external HDDtypicallycosts over $200, and they’re usually much larger than the portable-SSD-sized device that Martin’s father received. A 20TB HDD in a portable form factor israrerand can cost wellover $300. Taking a hammer to the device revealed that the chassis was nearly empty, save for some iron wheel weights sloppily attached to the black plastic with hefty globs of glue and a small PCB with some form of flash storage that could connect to a system via USB-A. As withother PC storage scamswe’ve seen online, Windows read the so-called HDD as a “19TB drive, but would then just hang if you try to do anything with it,” Martinsaidon Reddit. Programming the board’s firmware so that the drive appears as a high-capacity storage device on Windows is a clever trick that could convince users they're to blame. But as Windows-savvy users would point out, Windows reports drive capacities in gibibytes or tebibytes, so a real 20TB HDD would appear as approximately 18.2TB in Windows. Martin told Ars: The device appeared to mount on the desktop with the device name in Mandarin (turned out this simply said “Hard Disc”). I tried copying a file, and the name did appear on the “hard disc.” It was only when I tried to open this file from the hard disc that the problems began to emerge. The file could not be opened, no matter how hard I tried, including reformatting the hard disc. At that point nothing was “working” at all. Martin told Ars that his father purchased the fake HDD from a website called UK.Chicntech, which appears to primarily sell car supplies, kitchen supplies, and home textiles. Currently, the website does not list any PC components or peripherals, but overall, its stock is pretty limited. Chicntech currently lists some other electronics, like a“[With Starry Sky Lid]AI Nano Mist Intelligent Car Aromatherapy Device” (linking for explanatory purposes only; we don’t recommend shopping on this website) for $56. Ars reviewed a receipt of the purchase from Chicntech, and others online have also reported seeing the website selling inexplicably cheap 20TB portable hard drives. In February, for example, an X usershareda screenshot of what appears to be a Chicntech listing for an “External high -speed mobile hard disk” for £38; you could even get two for £56. The listing shown in the screenshot looks similar to the information in the receipt that Martin provided to Ars. Neither the listing in the screenshot nor the receipt Ars reviewed includes a brand name. Martin’s father received the device in a box with Toshiba Canvio branding (pictured at the top of this article). A Toshiba sticker is on the device’s backside. This is another red flag, asToshiba’s websitesays its Canvio portable HDDs only go up to 4TB. “Within this box there was a leaflet explaining how to reformat the disc drive,” Martin said. Martin told Ars that Chicntech hasn’t refunded his father. He said that despite showing the site photographs of the box and the device’s insides, support representatives “repeated refusals to acknowledge there was problem” and “repeated requests for information I had already sent them.” Martin added: At one point I was told that the car wheel weights “did not affect the performance of the device.\" Chicntech’s best offer was a 30 percent refund, an offer to keep the sham device, and a “free gift” from the UK version of a Japanese website, Cacogoga, Martin said. Examining Chicntech and Cacogoga’s websites didn’t reveal any obvious connections between the sites. Ars reached out to both companies for comment but has not received a response. Chicntech'sreturns and exchanges policyis a red flag in itself, featuring confusing language and unclear language. The policy reads, in part: We hope you enjoy what you ordered! But in case you're not 100% satisfied, we've made the return process super easy.1.The product itself has quality problems… The policy also states: The following conditions do not apply to 7 days no reason to return: …2.The product has been used (the electronic product is considered to have been used once it is energized)… Martin’s father’s experience is common in a world of online shopping, consumer electronics that many users don’t fully understand, and bargain hunting.Fraudulentstoragedevicesin particular have becomecommon. For tech enthusiasts, this incident was riddled with warning signs, starting with the dubious website. But shoppers have also discoveredcounterfeit tech devices, including storage components, from well-known companies, such asWalmartandAmazon. Online marketplaces where individuals can create seller profiles to push fraudulent products are particularly concerning. Outside of online marketplaces, Micro Center recently found itself at the center of a GPU scam after a customer opened a box for a purchased Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 5090 Solid OC, only to find backpacks.On Reddit, the person said that Micro Center reported finding another 31 Zotac GPU boxes filled with backpacks. AsTom’s Hardwarepointed out, the Zotac box that the Redditor opened was reportedly factory-sealed, suggesting that the heist happened higher in the supply chain. Micro Center reportedly replaced the customer’s backpacks with a real RTX 5090. If you have loved ones relying on your technical knowledge, now is a good time to remind them that it's best to stick to known retailers with sensible refund policies and to price-check against multiple retailers for an understanding of realistic pricing. Martin said his father is currently seeking a refund through his credit card company. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "After releasing Photoshop for iPhone in February, the promised Android version is here. Adobe has spent years releasing mobile apps that aren't Photoshop, and now it's finally giving people what they want. Yes, real Photoshop. After releasing a mobile version of Photoshop on iPhone earlier this year, the promised Android release has finally arrived. You can download it right now in beta, and it's free to use for the duration of the beta period. The mobile app includes a reasonably broad selection of tools from the desktop version of Adobe's iconic image editor, including masks, clone stamp, layers, transformations, cropping, and an array of generative AI tools. The app looks rather barebones when you first start using it, but the toolbar surfaces features as you select areas and manipulate layers. Depending on how you count, this is Adobe'sthirdattempt to do Photoshop on phones. So far, it appears to be the most comprehensive, though. It's much more capable thanPhotoshop Expressor the ancientPhotoshop Touch app, which Adobe unpublished almost a decade ago. If you're not familiar with the ins and outs of Photoshop, the new app comes with a robust collection of tutorials—just tap the light bulb icon to peruse them. Photoshop on Android makes a big deal about Adobe'sgenerative AI features, which let you easily select subjects or backgrounds, remove objects, and insert new content based on a text prompt. This works about as well as the desktop version of Photoshop because it's relying on the same cloud service to do the heavy lifting. This would have been impressive to see in a mobile app a year ago, but OEM features like Google'sMagic Editorhave since become more widespread. It would be unreasonable to expect the mobile app to include all the features of a desktop client, but there are still some strange omissions. There are no filters, for instance, and you can only crop images by ratio rather than using pixels or other dimensions. Content-aware fill is also listed as \"coming soon.\" Perhaps most annoyingly, you have to log in to use the app. That's not surprising, though, given that Adobe is going to charge for the app. Adobe has not indicated how the eventual subscription will work. If it's anything like the mobile version of Lightroom, you'll be able to access a subset of features in the app for free. We'd wager all the generative and smart selection features that cost Adobe money to run will be locked behind a Creative Cloud subscription, which starts at $20 per month (after arecent increase) but includes the desktop versions of Photoshop and Lightroom. We also don't know how long the beta will last. If you're interested in tryingPhotoshop for Android, you probably don't want to dilly-dally. It should work on most newer phones—you need to be running Android 11 or higher with at least 6GB of RAM. However,Adobe saysthe app runs best with 8GB of memory or more. The app itself needs about 600MB of storage space. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "\"That's exactly the kind of thing that NASA should be concentrating its resources on.\" New details of the Trump administration's plans for NASA, released Friday, revealed the White House's desire to end the development of an experimental nuclear thermal rocket engine that could have shown a new way of exploring the Solar System. Trump's NASA budget request is rife with spending cuts. Overall, the White House proposes reducing NASA's budget by about 24 percent, from $24.8 billion this year to $18.8 billion in fiscal year 2026. In previous stories,Ars has covered many of the programsimpacted by the proposed cuts, which would cancel the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft and terminate numerous robotic science missions, including the Mars Sample Return, probes to Venus, and future space telescopes. Instead, the leftover funding for NASA's human exploration program would go toward supporting commercial projects to land on the Moon and Mars. NASA's initiatives to pioneer next-generation space technologies are also hit hard in the White House's budget proposal. If the Trump administration gets its way, NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, or STMD, will see its budget cut nearly in half, from $1.1 billion to $568 million. Trump's budget request isn't final. Both Republican-controlled houses of Congress will write their own versions of the NASA budget, which must be reconciled before going to the White House for President Trump's signature. \"The budget reduces Space Technology by approximately half, including eliminating failing space propulsion projects,\" the White House wrote in an initial overview of the NASA budget request released May 2. \"The reductions also scale back or eliminate technology projects that are not needed by NASA or are better suited to private sector research and development.\" Last week, the White House and NASA put a finer point on these \"failing space propulsion projects.\" \"This budget provides no funding for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion and Nuclear Electric Propulsion projects,\" officials wrote in a technical supplement released Friday detailing Trump's NASA budget proposal. \"These efforts are costly investments, would take many years to develop, and have not been identified as the propulsion mode for deep space missions. The nuclear propulsion projects are terminated to achieve cost savings and because there are other nearer-term propulsion alternatives for Mars transit.\" Foremost among these cuts, the White House proposes to end NASA's participation in the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) project. NASA said this proposal \"reflects the decision by our partner to cancel\" the DRACO mission, which would have demonstrated a nuclear thermal rocket engine in space for the first time. NASA's partner on the DRACO mission was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, the Pentagon's research and development arm. A DARPA spokesperson confirmed the agency was closing out the project. \"DARPA has completed the agency’s involvement in the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Orbit (DRACO) program and is transitioning its knowledge to our DRACO mission partner, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and to other potential DOD programs,\" the spokesperson said in a response to written questions. Less than two years ago, NASA and DARPA announced plans to move forward with the roughly $500 million DRACO project, targeting a launch into Earth orbit aboard a traditional chemical rocket in 2027. \"With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever, a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,\" former NASA administrator Bill Nelson said at the time. The DRACO mission would have consisted of several elements, including a nuclear reactor to rapidly heat up super-cold liquid hydrogen fuel stored in an insulated tank onboard the spacecraft. Temperatures inside the engine would reach nearly 5,000° Fahrenheit, boiling the hydrogen and driving the resulting gas through a nozzle, generating thrust. From the outside, the spacecraft's design looks a lot like the upper stage of a traditional rocket. However, theoretically, a nuclear thermal rocket engine like DRACO's would offer twice the efficiency of the highest-performing conventional rocket engines. That translates to significantly less fuel that a mission to Mars would have to carry across the Solar System. Essentially, a nuclear thermal rocket engine combines the high-thrust capability of a chemical engine with some of the fuel efficiency benefits of low-thrust solar-electric engines. With DRACO, engineers sought hard data to verify their understanding of nuclear propulsion and wanted to make sure the nuclear engine's challenging design actually worked. DRACO would have usedhigh-assay low-enriched uraniumto power its nuclear reactor. Nuclear electric propulsion uses an onboard nuclear reactor to power plasma thrusters that create thrust by accelerating an ionized gas, like xenon, through a magnetic field. Nuclear electric propulsion would provide another leap in engine efficiency beyond the capabilities of a system like DRACO and may ultimately offer the most attractive option for enduring deep space transportation. NASA led the development of DRACO's nuclear rocket engine, while DARPA was responsible for the overall spacecraft design, operations, and the thorny problem of securing regulatory approval to launch a nuclear reactor into orbit. The reactor on DRACO would have launched in \"cold\" mode before activating in space, reducing the risk to people on the ground in the event of a launch accident. The Space Force agreed to pay for DRACO's launch on a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket. DARPA and NASA selected Lockheed Martin as the lead contractor for the DRACO spacecraft in 2023. BWX Technologies, a leader in the US nuclear industry, won the contract to develop the mission's reactor. \"We received the notice from DARPA that it ended the DRACO program,\" a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said. \"While we’re disappointed with the decision, it doesn’t change our vision of how nuclear power influences how we will explore and operate in the vastness of space.\" More than 60 years have passed since aUS-built nuclear reactorlaunched into orbit.Aviation Week reported in Januarythat one problem facing DRACO engineers involved questions about how to safely test the nuclear thermal engine on the ground while adhering to nuclear safety protocols. \"We're bringing two things together—space mission assurance and nuclear safety—and there’s a fair amount of complexity,\" said Matthew Sambora, a DRACO program manager at DARPA, in an interview with Aviation Week. At the time, DARPA and NASA had already given up on a 2027 launch to concentrate on developing a prototype engine using helium as a propellant before moving on to an operational engine with more energetic liquid hydrogen fuel, Aviation Week reported. Greg Meholic, an engineer at the Aerospace Corporation,highlighted the shortfallin ground testing capability in a presentation last year. Nuclear thermal propulsion testing \"requires that engine exhaust be scrubbed of radiologics before being released,\" he wrote. This requirement \"could result in substantially large, prohibitively expensive facilities that take years to build and qualify.\" These safety protocols weren't as stringent when NASA and the Air Force first pursued nuclear propulsion in the 1960s. Now, the first serious 21st-century effort to fly a nuclear rocket engine in space is grinding to a halt. \"Given that our near-term human exploration and science needs do not require nuclear propulsion, current demonstration projects will end,\" wrote Janet Petro, NASA's acting administrator, in aletter accompanying the Trump administration's budget release last week. NASA's 2024 budget allocated $117 million for nuclear propulsion work, an increase from $91 million the previous year. Congress added more funding for NASA's nuclear propulsion programs over the Biden administration's proposed budget in recent years, signaling support on Capitol Hill that may save at least some nuclear propulsion initiatives next year. It's true that nuclear propulsion isn't required for any NASA missions currently on the books. Today's rockets are good at hurling cargo and people off planet Earth, but once a spacecraft arrives in orbit, there are several ways to propel it toward more distant destinations. NASA's existing architecture for sending astronauts to the Moon uses the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, both of which are proposed for cancellation and look a lot like the vehicles NASA used to fly astronauts to the Moon more than 50 years ago. SpaceX's reusable Starship, designed with an eye toward settling Mars, uses conventional chemical propulsion, with methane and liquid oxygen propellants that SpaceX one day hopes to generate on the surface of the Red Planet. So NASA, SpaceX, and other companies don't need nuclear propulsion to beat China back to the Moon or put the first human footprints on Mars. But there's a broad consensus that in the long run, nuclear rockets offer a better way of moving around the Solar System. The military's motive for funding nuclear thermal propulsion was its potential for becoming a more efficient means of maneuvering around the Earth. Many of the military's most important spacecraft are limited by fuel, and the Space Force is investigating orbital refueling and novel propulsion methods to extend the lifespan of satellites. NASA'snuclear power program is not finished. The Trump administration's budget proposal calls for continued funding for the agency's fission surface power program, with the goal of fielding a nuclear reactor that could power a base on the surface of the Moon or Mars. Lockheed and BWXT, the contractors involved in the DRACO mission, are part of the fission surface power program. There is some funding in the White House's budget request for tech demos using other methods of in-space propulsion. NASA would continue funding experiments in long-term storage and transfer of cryogenic propellants like liquid methane, liquid hydrogen, and liquid oxygen. These joint projects between NASA and industry could pave the way for orbital refueling and orbiting propellant depots, aligning with the direction of companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance. But many scientists and engineers believe nuclear propulsionoffers the only realistic pathfor a sustainable campaign ferrying people between the Earth and Mars. A report commissioned by NASA and the National Academies concluded in 2021 that an aggressive tech-development program could advance nuclear thermal propulsion enough for a human expedition to Mars in 2039. The prospects for nuclear electric propulsion were murkier. This would have required NASA to substantially increase its budget for nuclear propulsion immediately, likely by an order of magnitude beyond the agency's baseline funding level, or to an amount exceeding $1 billion per year, said Bobby Braun, co-chair of the National Academies report, in a 2021 interview with Ars. That didn't happen. The interplanetary transportation architectures envisioned by NASA and SpaceX will, at least initially, primarily use chemical propulsion for the cruise between Earth and Mars. Kurt Polzin, chief engineer of NASA's space nuclear propulsion projects, said significant technical hurdles stand in the way of any propulsion system selected to power heavy cargo and humans to Mars. \"Anybody who says that they've solved the problem, you don't know that because you don't have enough data,\" Polzin said last week at the Humans to the Moon and Mars Summit in Washington. \"We know that to do a Mars mission with a Starship, you need lots of refuelings at Earth, you need lots of refuelings at Mars, which you have to send in advance,\" Polzin said. \"You either need to send that propellant in advance or send a bunch of material and hardware to the surface to be set up and robotically make your propellant in situ while you're there.\" Last week, SpaceX founder Elon Musk outlined how the company plans to land its first Starships on Mars. His roadmap includes more than 100 cargo flights to deliver equipment to produce methane and liquid oxygen propellants on the surface of Mars. This is necessary for any Starship to launch off the Red Planet and return to Earth. \"You can start to see that this starts to become aRube Goldbergway to do Mars,\" Polzin said. \"Will I say it can't work? No, but will I say that it's really, really difficult and challenging. Are there a lot of miracles to make it work? Absolutely. So the notion that SpaceX has solved Mars or is going to do Mars with Starship, I would challenge that on its face. I don't think the analysis and the data bear that out.\" Engineers know how methane-fueled rocket engines perform in space. Scientists have created liquid oxygen and liquid methane since the late 1800s. Scaling up a propellant plant on Mars to produce thousands of tons of cryogenic liquids is another matter. In the long run, this might be a suitable solution for Musk's vision of creating a city on Mars, but it comes with immense startup costs and risks. Still, nuclear propulsion is an entirely untested technology as well. \"The thing with nuclear is there are challenges to making it work, too,\" Polzin said. \"However, all of my challenges get solved here at Earth and in low-Earth orbit before I leave. Nuclear is nice. It has a higher specific impulse, especially when we're talking about nuclear thermal propulsion. It has high thrust, which means it will get our astronauts there and back quickly, but I can carry all the fuel I need to get back with me, so I don't need to do any complicated refueling at Mars. I can return without having to make propellant or send any pre-positioned propellant to get back.\" The tug of war over nuclear propulsion is nothing new. The Air Force started a program to develop reactors for nuclear thermal rockets at the height of the Cold War. NASA took over the Air Force's role a few years later, and the project proceeded into the next phase, called the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). President Richard Nixon ultimately canceled the NERVA project in 1973 after the government had spent $1.4 billion on it, equivalent to about $10 billion in today's dollars. Despite nearly two decades of work, NERVA never flew in space. The Pentagon and NASA studied several more nuclear thermal and nuclear electric propulsion initiatives before DRACO. Today, there's a nascent commercial business case for compact nuclear reactors beyond just the government. But there's scant commercial interest in mounting a full-scale nuclear propulsion demonstration solely with private funding. Fred Kennedy, co-founder and CEO of a space nuclear power company called Dark Fission, said most venture capital investors lack the appetite to wait for financial returns in nuclear propulsion that they may see in 15 or 20 years. \"It's a truism: Space is hard,\" said Kennedy, a former DARPA program manager. \"Nuclear turns out to be hard for reasons we can all understand. So space-nuclear is hard-squared, folks. As a result, you give this to your average associate at a VC firm and they get scared quick. They see the moles all over your face, and they run away screaming.\" But commercial launch costs are coming down. With sustained government investment and streamlined regulations, \"this is the best chance we've had in a long time\" to get a nuclear propulsion system into space, Kennedy said. \"I think, right now, we're in this transitional period where companies like mine are going have to rely on some government largesse, as well as hopefully both commercial partnerships and honest private investment,\" Kennedy said. \"Three years ago, I would have told you I thought I could have done the whole thing with private investment, but three years have turned my hair white.\" Those who share Kennedy's view thought they were getting an ally in the Trump administration. Jared Isaacman, the billionaire commercial astronaut Trump nominated to become the next NASA administrator, promised to prioritize nuclear propulsion in his tenure as head of the nation's space agency. During his Senate confirmation hearing in April, Isaacman said NASA should turn over management of heavy-lift rockets, human-rated spacecraft, and other projects to commercial industry. This change, he said, would allow NASA to focus on the \"near-impossible challenges that no company, organization, or agency anywhere in the world would be able to undertake.\" The example Isaacman gave in his confirmation hearing was nuclear propulsion. \"That's something that no company would ever embark upon,\" he told lawmakers. \"There is no obvious economic return. There are regulatory challenges. That's exactly the kind of thing that NASA should be concentrating its resources on.\" But the White House suddenly announced on Saturday that it was withdrawing Isaacman's nomination days before the Senate was expected to confirm him for the NASA post. While there's no indication that Trump's withdrawal of Isaacman had anything to do with any specific part of the White House's funding plan, his removal leaves NASA without an advocate for nuclear propulsion and a number of other projects falling under the White House's budget ax.

    "title": "11 things you probably didn’t know the Switch 2 can do",
    "article_text": "Our first quick dive into the system-level settings and the new GameChat multiplayer. Eight years ago, just before the release of the Nintendo Switch, weprovided an in-depth review of the hardwarethanks to early production units provided by Nintendo. This year, Nintendo has opted not to provide such unrestricted early press access to the Switch 2 hardware, citing a \"day-one update\" to the system software and some launch games that would supposedly make pre-release evaluation more difficult. As such, we won't be able to provide our full thoughts on the Switch 2 until well after the system is in players' hands. While that's not an ideal situation for readers looking to make an early purchase decision, we'll do our best to give you our hands-on impressions as soon as possible after launch day. In lieu of review access, though, we were able to get some extended hands-on time with the final Switch 2 hardware at a daylong preview event held by Nintendo last week. This event provided our first look at the console's system-level menu and settings, as well as features like GameChat (which was hard to fully evaluate in an extremely controlled environment). While this access was far from sufficient for a full review, it did let us discover a few interesting features that we weren't aware of beforehand. Here are some of the new tidbits we stumbled across during our day with the Switch 2 hardware. One of the most unexpected accessibility features of the Switch 2 is the system's ability to automatically generate on-screen captions for what friends are saying during a GameChat session. These captions appear in their own box that can be set to the side of the main gameplay. The captioning system seemed pretty fast and accurate in our test and could even update captions from multiple speakers at the same time. While this is obviously useful for hard-of-hearing players, we could also see the feature being a boon for managing crosstalk among rowdy GameChat parties or for quickly referring back to something someone said a few seconds ago. In a reverse of the auto-captioning system discussed above, GameChat also has a feature buried deep in its menus that lets you type a message on the on-screen keyboard and have it spoken aloud to the other participants in a slightly robotic voice. This could come in handy when you're playing in an environment where you have to be quiet but still want to quickly convey detailed information to your fellow players. During GameChat sessions, you can make the connected camera show only your face instead of your entire body and/or the background behind it. This mode keeps your face centered in a small, circular frame even as you move around during gameplay, though there is a slight delay in the tracking if you move your head too quickly. While you can also activate a similar face display during local multiplayer sessions ofMario Kart World, the game doesn't seem to track your movements, meaning you can easily fall out of frame if you don't hold your body still. This was a cute little surprise I discovered in aSwitch 2 Welcome Tourmini-game that asks you to set the kickstand as close as possible to a given angle. This mini-game works even if the Joy-Cons are not attached, suggesting that there is a sensor in the kickstand or tablet itself that measures the angle. It did take a few seconds of stillness for the game to fully confirm the system's resting angle, though, so don't expect to be tilting the kickstand rapidly to control action games or anything. I stumbled on this feature when I was holding the Joy-Cons normally and one of my fingers accidentally passed over the mouse sensor, activating a mouse pointer on the system menu screen. When I put the controller down on its edge, I found that the pointer could scroll and click through those menus, often much more quickly than flicking a joystick. Mouse mode also lets you zoom in on specific areas of the screen with a quick double-click, which should be useful for both vision-impaired players and those playing on tiny and/or far-off screens. The system menu lets you adjust the mouse sensor's sensitivity between \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high.\" While that's a lot less precise than the fully adjustable DPI settings you might be used to with a computer mouse, it's still a welcome option. In some quick testing, I found the high-sensitivity mode to be especially useful when using the mouse on a small surface, such as the top of my thigh. At this setting, the pointer could move from one end of the screen to the other with the slightest wrist adjustment. Low sensitivity mode, on the other hand, proved useful in more precise situations, such as in aWelcome Tourmini-game where I had to move a ball quickly and precisely through a large, electrified maze. Lose a Joy-Con somewhere in the depths of your couch? Not to worry—a new menu option on the Switch 2 lets you play a distinctive sound through that Joy-Con's improved HD Rumble 2 motor to help you find its precise location. While we confirmed that this feature also works with the new Pro Controller 2, we were unable to determine whether it can be used for original Switch controllers that are synced with a Switch 2. Your unique PIN code must be entered any time the system comes out of sleep mode, making the hardware functionally useless to anyone who doesn't have the PIN. This should be great for kids who want to keep siblings away and parents who are worried about their kids sneaking in extra Switch 2 time when they shouldn't be. A new system-level option will prevent the Switch 2 from charging as soon as it hits 90 percent of capacity, a move intended to increase the longevity of the internal battery. This is already a common feature on many smartphones and portable gaming devices, so it's nice to see Nintendo joining the bandwagon here. Thus far, though, it appears that the 90 percent battery capacity is the only cutoff point available, with no further options for customization. As you can see in the photo above, setting the system text size to \"MAXIMUM\" lets menu options be seen easily from roughly the moon. You can set the system text to bold and high-contrast for even more legibility, and there's also an option to make the system menu text smaller than the default, for whatever reason. With this menu option activated, the B button is used to \"confirm\" and the A button is used to \"cancel\" in system menus. This should be welcome news for players more used to the button layout on Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam Deck controllers, which all have the \"confirm\" and \"cancel\" options in reversed positions from the Nintendo default.

    "title": "“Godfather” of AI calls out latest models for lying to users",
    "article_text": "Turing Award-winner Yoshua Bengio warns recent models display dangerous characteristics. One of the “godfathers” of artificial intelligence has attacked a multibillion-dollar race to develop the cutting-edge technology, saying the latest models are displaying dangerous characteristics such as lying to users. Yoshua Bengio, a Canadian academic whose work has informed techniques used by top AI groups such as OpenAI and Google, said: “There’s unfortunately a very competitive race between the leading labs, which pushes them towards focusing on capability to make the AI more and more intelligent, but not necessarily put enough emphasis and investment on research on safety.” The Turing Award winner issued his warning in an interview with the Financial Times, while launching a new non-profit called LawZero. He said the group would focus on building safer systems, vowing to “insulate our research from those commercial pressures.” LawZero has so far raised nearly $30 million in philanthropic contributions from donors including Skype founding engineer Jaan Tallinn, former Google chief Eric Schmidt’s philanthropic initiative, as well as Open Philanthropy and the Future of Life Institute. Many of Bengio’s funders subscribe to the “effective altruism” movement, whose supporters tend to focus on catastrophic risks surrounding AI models. Critics argue the movement highlights hypothetical scenarios while ignoring current harms, such as bias and inaccuracies. Bengio said his not-for-profit group was founded in response to growing evidence over the past six months that today’s leading models were developing dangerous capabilities. This includes showing “evidence of deception, cheating, lying and self-preservation,” he said. Anthropic’s Claude Opus model blackmailed engineers in a fictitious scenario where it was at risk of being replaced by another system. Research from AI testers Palisade last month showed that OpenAI’s o3 model refused explicit instructions to shut down. Bengio said such incidents were “very scary, because we don’t want to create a competitor to human beings on this planet, especially if they’re smarter than us.” The AI pioneer added: “Right now, these are controlled experiments [but] my concern is that any time in the future, the next version might be strategically intelligent enough to see us coming from far away and defeat us with deceptions that we don’t anticipate. So I think we’re playing with fire right now.” The ability for systems to assist in building “extremely dangerous bioweapons” could be a reality as soon as next year, he added. Based in Montreal, LawZero employs 15 people and aims to hire more technical talent to build the next generation of AI systems designed for safety. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, will step down as scientific director at Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, to focus on the new organization. It aims to develop an AI system that will give truthful answers based on transparent reasoning instead of being trained to please a user, while also providing a robust assessment of whether an output is good or safe. Bengio hopes to create a model that can monitor and improve existing offerings from leading AI groups, preventing them from acting against human interests. “The worst-case scenario is human extinction,” he said. “If we build AIs that are smarter than us and are not aligned with us and compete with us, then we’re basically cooked.” Bengio’s move to establish LawZero comes as OpenAI aims to move further away from its charitable roots by converting into a for-profit company. That push has provoked concerns from AI experts and triggered a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk, who is attempting to block the transaction. Critics say OpenAI was founded to ensure AI was developed for humanity’s benefit, and the new structure eliminates legal recourse if the company prioritizes profit over this goal. OpenAI argues it needs to raise capital under a more conventional structure to compete in the sector, while its broader mission remains central. Bengio said he did not have confidence that OpenAI would adhere to its mission, stressing that non-profits do not have a “misaligned incentive that you do in the current way companies are structured.” “To grow very fast, you need to convince people to invest a lot of money, and they want to see a return on their money. That’s how our market-based system works,” he added. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "“Free Roam” mode is Mario Kart World’s killer app",
    "article_text": "Equal partsForza Horizon,Diddy Kong Racing, andTony Hawk's Pro Skater. When Ars tried outMario Kart Worldat April's Switch 2 premiere hands-on event, the short demos focused on more-or-less standard races in the game's Grand Prix and Knockout modes. So when Nintendo invited us back for more time previewing the near-final version of the game before the Switch 2's release, we decided to focus most of our time on the game's mysterious (andpreviously teased) \"Free Roam\" mode. We're glad we did, because the mode feels like the hidden gem ofMario Kart Worldand maybe of the Switch 2 launch as a whole. Combining elements of games likeDiddy Kong Racing,Forza Horizon, and even theTony Hawk's Pro Skaterseries, Free Roam provides a unique mixture of racing challenges, exploration, and collectibles that should keep new Switch 2 owners busy for a while. Surprisingly, Free Roam mode isn't listed as one of the main options when you launch a new game ofMario Kart World. Instead, a tiny note in the corner of the screen tells you to hit the plus button to get dropped into a completely untimed and free-wheeling version of the vastMario Kart Worldmap. Exploring in Free Roam mode provides the best sense of scale for the game's massive, multi-ecosystem island in a way individual races just can't. Sure, other race modes sometimes let you travel between the individual race courses along pre-set paths from one finish line to another starting line. But Free Roam mode lets you fully explore the vast spaces between those paths, encouraging you to go off-roading in the mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, volcanoes, snowdrifts, and landmarks that dot the countryside. Your main explicit goal when exploring all this varied expanse is to look for large, blue P-Switches, each of which activates a short, timed challenge mission in the immediate vicinity. In many cases, simply reaching the P-Switch is half the challenge, requiring some inventive wall-riding or item use to get to a particularly out-of-the-way corner of the map. The 15 P-Switch missions I was able to uncover during my preview hours with the Free Roam mode showed a fair deal of variety, too. While many missions involved simply collecting a series of nearby blue coins, for instance, no two of those missions played out all that similarly. One might involve dodging rampaging T-rexes chomping at your kart, while others might ask you to grind on the rails of a suspension bridge or hop through the desert sands amid sunken ruins. Some of the missions I encountered were relaxing sojourns, like one that asked me to \"seek peace by climbing the falls\" before sending me skimming along the surface of the water alongside gently leaping cheep cheeps. Others were punishing obstacle courses, like one that asked me to race backward through the winding Donkey Kong Spaceport course—except, littered with additional debris and under a strict time limit. There were missions that felt like a rally racing mini-game, asking me to navigate between timer-extending rings dotting barren desert ruins. There were others that took the form of an \"endurance race,\" where I had to dodge through a crowd of traffic to make it to each checkpoint gate before time ran out. I even stumbled on one mission that felt a bit like a 3D platform game, requiring precision jumps between bouncy clouds to make it to the goal (being able to rewind time after falling off the clouds made me feel like I was in an early 2000sPrince of Persiagame). Most of these challenges won't be especially taxing for anyone with sufficient racing experience. Even so, the sheer variety of different tasks—and the ways those tasks are presented in different parts of the game's massive map—should keep the P-Switch hunt from feeling dull or rote. Nintendo asked us not to reveal the specific number of P-Switches dotting theMario Kart Worldmap, but suffice it to say they number in the hundreds. And beyond the P-Switches, there are dozens of collectible medallions, out-of-the-way question-mark panels, and giant stacks of coins to find, all of which unlock various new karts and cosmetics. Completionists are going to have their hands full discovering every last tidbit. But beyond the more utilitarian, goal-oriented side of Free Roam mode, I was entranced by just how many moments of sheer whimsy there were to discover once the threat of other racers or incoming projectile items was removed from the Mario Kart formula. During my preview time, I got to drive alongside a herd of roaming buffalo while watching a shower of collectible starmen rain down in the distance. I got to grind down a railroad track before climbing to the roof of a speeding train via a ramp on the back of the caboose. I even got to pilot a UFO for a few seconds, in a set piece that seemed to serve no purpose other than putting a massive grin on my face. There are plenty of smaller-scale grin-inducing moments, too, like bouncing high off a hitchhiking shyguy or seeing a traffic cone sprout legs and walk off (there was a tinybiddybudinside it, don'tcha know). At one point, I drove up to two toads hanging on a bench and just vibed with them as they jumped and cheered my mere presence. The promise of these kinds of cheerful found moments and bite-sized challenges will likely keep me coming back toMario Kart Worldlong after I'm tired of the standard racing game it's built on. In the absence of a true 3D Mario game that's ready for the Switch 2 launch, the whimsical exploration on display here will more than suffice.

    "title": "Milky Way galaxy might not collide with Andromeda after all",
    "article_text": "Astronomers ran 100,000 computer simulations using combined Hubble/Gaia space telescope data. It's been textbook knowledge for over a century that our Milky Way galaxy is doomed to collide with another large spiral galaxy, Andromeda, in the next 5 billion years and merge into one even bigger galaxy. But afresh analysispublished in the journal Nature Astronomy is casting that longstanding narrative in a more uncertain light. The authors conclude that the likelihood of this collision and merger is closer to the odds of a coin flip, with a roughly 50 percent probability that the two galaxies will avoid such an event during the next 10 billion years. Both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies (M31) are part of what's known as the Local Group (LG), which also hosts other smaller galaxies (some not yet discovered) as well as dark matter (per the prevailing standard cosmological model). Both already have remnants of past mergers and interactions with other galaxies, according to the authors. \"Predicting future mergers requires knowledge about the present coordinates, velocities, and masses of the systems partaking in the interaction,\" the authors wrote. That involves not just the gravitational force between them but also dynamical friction. It's the latter that dominates when galaxies are headed toward a merger, since it causes galactic orbits to decay. This latest analysis is the result of combining data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia space telescope to perform 100,000 Monte Carlo computer simulations, taking into account not just the Milky Way and Andromeda but the full LG system. Those simulations yielded a very different prediction: There is approximately a 50/50 chance of the galaxies colliding within the next 10 billion years. There is still a 2 percent chance that they will collide in the next 4 to 5 billion years. \"Based on the best available data, the fate of our galaxy is still completely open,\" the authors concluded. One confounding factor comes from two other LG galaxies: M33, a satellite galaxy, and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The simulations revealed that the former increases the likelihood of a collision, but this is countered by the fact that the LMC's orbit runs perpendicular to the Milky Way/Andromeda orbit. \"The Milky Way and Andromeda alone would remain in the same plane as they orbit each other, but this doesn't mean they need to crash. They could still go past each other,”said co-author Till Sawalaof the University of Helsinki in Finland. “The extra mass of Andromeda’s satellite galaxy M33 pulls the Milky Way a little bit more towards it. However, we also show that the LMC pulls the Milky Way off the orbital plane and away from Andromeda. It doesn't mean that the LMC will save us from that merger, but it makes it a bit less likely.” So is it time to rewrite the textbooks? Not quite yet. More data and even more analysis is needed to confirm these latest findings. “It's somewhat ironic that, despite the addition of more precise Hubble data taken in recent years, we are now less certain about the outcome of a potential collision,\"said Sawala. \"That’s because of the more complex analysis and because we consider it a more complete system. But the only way to get to a new prediction about the eventual fate of the Milky Way will be with even better data.” DOI: Nature Astronomy, 2025.10.1038/s41550-025-02563-1(About DOIs).

    "title": "Tuesday Telescope: A time-lapse from orbit reveals treasures below",
    "article_text": "\"Soooooo much going on in this picture.\" Welcome to theTuesday Telescope. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light—a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. I did not expect to feature NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers in the Tuesday Telescope so soon, but a recent photo she shared is just sublime. (In case you missed it,we wrote abouther photo of lightning from space about a month ago.) This week Ayers has a time-lapse sequence she captured from the Cupola as the International Space Station soared near Central and South America. \"Soooooo much going on in this picture,\" Ayers wrote on thesocial media site X. \"You can see Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, with South America off in the distance.\" The most distinct feature is a lightning strike near Panama City. This illuminates the clouds below. Above the strike is a reddish phenomenon known as a sprite, which sometimes occurs in the atmosphere between 50 and 90 km above a lightning strike near the surface of the planet. This appears to be a \"jellyfish\" sprite. It is rendered beautifully. But wait, there's more! The lightning strike is so bright that its reflection can be seen in the space station's structure, at the top of the image. Additionally the atmosphere's airglow can be clearly seen in the orange line just above the atmosphere. All in all, it's a wonderful photo, and I can't wait to see what other treasures Ayers sends down from on high.

    "title": "Meta and Yandex are de-anonymizing Android users’ web browsing identifiers",
    "article_text": "Abuse allows Meta and Yandex to attach persistent identifiers to detailed browsing histories. Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device,researchers have discovered. Google says it's investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user identities. The covert tracking—implemented in theMeta PixelandYandex Metricatrackers—allows Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it.Android sandboxing, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses suchasstatepartitioningandstorage partitioning, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they're off-limits for every other site. “One of the fundamental security principles that exists in the web, as well as the mobile system, is called sandboxing,” Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez, one of the researchers behind the discovery, said in an interview. “You run everything in a sandbox, and there is no interaction within different elements running on it. What this attack vector allows is to break the sandbox that exists between the mobile context and the web context. The channel that exists allowed the Android system to communicate what happens in the browser with the identity running in the mobile app.” The bypass—which Yandex began in 2017 and Meta started last September—allows the companies to pass cookies or other identifiers from Firefox and Chromium-based browsers to native Android apps for Facebook, Instagram, and various Yandex apps. The companies can then tie that vast browsing history to the account holder logged into the app. This abuse has been observed only in Android, and evidence suggests that the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica target only Android users. The researchers say it may be technically feasible to target iOS because browsers on that platform allow developers to programmaticallyestablish localhost connectionsthat apps can monitor on local ports. In contrast to iOS, however, Android imposes fewer controls on local host communications and background executions of mobile apps, the researchers said, while also implementing stricter controls in app store vetting processes to limit such abuses. This overly permissive design allows Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica to send web requests with web tracking identifiers to specific local ports that are continuously monitored by the Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex apps. These apps can then link pseudonymous web identities with actual user identities, even in private browsing modes, effectively de-anonymizing users’ browsing habits on sites containing these trackers. Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are analytics scripts designed to help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are estimated to be installed on5.8 millionand3 millionsites, respectively. Meta and Yandex achieve the bypass by abusing basic functionality built into modern mobile browsers that allows browser-to-native app communications. The functionality lets browsers send web requests to local Android ports to establish various services, including media connections through theRTC protocol, file sharing, and developer debugging. While the technical underpinnings differ, both Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are performing a “weird protocol misuse” to gain unvetted access that Android provides tolocalhost portson the 127.0.0.1 IP address. Browsers access these ports without user notification. Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex native apps silently listen on those ports, copy identifiers in real time, and link them to the user logged into the app. A representative for Google said the behavior violates the terms of service for its Play marketplace and the privacy expectations of Android users. “The developers in this report are using capabilities present in many browsers across iOS and Android in unintended ways that blatantly violate our security and privacy principles,” the representative said, referring to the people who write the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica JavaScript. “We've already implemented changes to mitigate these invasive techniques and have opened our own investigation and are directly in touch with the parties.” Meta didn't answer emailed questions for this article, but provided the following statement: \"We are in discussions with Google to address a potential miscommunication regarding the application of their policies. Upon becoming aware of the concerns, we decided to pause the feature while we work with Google to resolve the issue.\" In an email, Yandex said it was discontinuing the practice and was also in touch with Google. \"Yandex strictly complies with data protection standards and does not de-anonymize user data,\" the statement added. \"The feature in question does not collect any sensitive information and is solely intended to improve personalization within our apps.\" Meta Pixel developers have abused various protocols to implement the covert listening since the practice began last September. They started by causing apps to send HTTP requests to port 12387. A month later, Meta Pixel stopped sending this data, even though Facebook and Instagram apps continued to monitor the port. In November, Meta Pixel switched to a new method that invoked WebSocket, a protocol for two-way communications, over port 12387. That same month, Meta Pixel also deployed a new method that usedWebRTC, a real-time peer-to-peer communication protocol commonly used for making audio or video calls in the browser. This method used a complicated process known asSDP munging, a technique for JavaScript code to modify Session Description Protocol data before it’s sent. Still in use today, the SDP munging by Meta Pixel inserts key _fbp cookie content into fields meant for connection information. This causes the browser to send that data as part of aSTUN requestto the Android local host, where the Facebook or Instagram app can read it and link it to the user. In May, abeta versionof Chrome introduced a mitigation that blocked the type of SDP munging that Meta Pixel used. Within days, Meta Pixel circumvented the mitigation by adding a new method that swapped the STUN requests with theTURN requests. In apost, the researchers provided a detailed description of the _fbp cookie from a website to the native app and, from there, to the Meta server: 1. The user opens the native Facebook or Instagram app, which eventually is sent to the background and creates a background service to listen for incoming traffic on a TCP port (12387 or 12388) and a UDP port (the first unoccupied port in 12580–12585). Users must be logged-in with their credentials on the apps.2. The user opens their browser and visits a website integrating the Meta Pixel.3. At this stage, some websites wait for users' consent before embedding Meta Pixel. In our measurements of the top 100K website homepages, we found websites that require consent to be a minority (more than 75% of affected sites does not require user consent)...4. The Meta Pixel script is loaded and the _fbp cookie is sent to the native Instagram or Facebook app via WebRTC (STUN) SDP Munging.5. The Meta Pixel script also sends the _fbp value in a request to https://www.facebook.com/tr along with other parameters such as page URL (dl), website and browser metadata, and the event type (ev) (e.g., PageView, AddToCart, Donate, Purchase).6. The Facebook or Instagram apps receive the _fbp cookie from the Meta JavaScripts running on the browser and transmits it to the GraphQL endpoint (https://graph[.]facebook[.]com/graphql) along with other persistent user identifiers, linking users' fbp ID (web visit) with their Facebook or Instagram account. The first known instance of Yandex Metrica linking websites visited in Android browsers to app identities was in May 2017, when the tracker started sending HTTP requests to local ports 29009 and 30102. In May 2018, Yandex Metrica also began sending the data through HTTPS to ports 29010 and 30103. Both methods remained in place as of publication time. Some browsers for Android have blocked the abusive JavaScript in trackers. DuckDuckGo, for instance, was already blocking domains and IP addresses associated with the trackers, preventing the browser from sending any identifiers to Meta. The browser also blocked most of the domains associated with Yandex Metrica. After the researchers notified DuckDuckGo of the incomplete blacklist, developers added the missing addresses. The Brave browser, meanwhile, also blocked the sharing of identifiers due to its extensive blocklists and existing mitigation toblock requeststo the localhost without explicit user consent.Vivaldi, another Chromium-based browser, forwards the identifiers to local Android ports when the default privacy setting is in place. Changing the setting to block trackers appears to thwart browsing history leakage, the researchers said. The various remedies DuckDuckGo, Brave, Vivaldi, and Chrome have put in place are working as intended, but the researchers caution they could become ineffective at any time. “Any browser doing blocklisting will likely enter into a constant arms race, and it's just a partial solution,” Vallina Rodriguez said of the current mitigations. “Creating effective blocklists is hard, and browser makers will need to constantly monitor the use of this type of capability to detect other hostnames potentially abusing localhost channels and then updating their blocklists accordingly.” He continued: While this solution works once you know the hostnames doing that, it's not the right way of mitigating this issue, as trackers may find ways of accessing this capability (e.g., through more ephemeral hostnames). A long-term solution should go through the design and development of privacy and security controls for localhost channels, so that users can be aware of this type of communication and potentially enforce some control or limit this use (e.g., a permission or some similar user notifications). Chrome and most other Chromium-based browsers executed the JavaScript as Meta and Yandex intended. Firefox did as well, although for reasons that aren't clear, the browser was not able to successfully perform the SDP munging specified in later versions of the code. After blocking the STUN variant of SDP munging in the early May beta release, a production version of Chrome releasedtwo weeks agobegan blocking both the STUN and TURN variants. Other Chromium-based browsers are likely to implement it in the coming weeks. A representative for Firefox-maker Mozilla said the organization prioritizes user privacy and is taking the report seriously \"We are actively investigating the reported behavior, and working to fully understand its technical details and implications,\" Mozilla said in an email. \"Based on what we’ve seen so far, we consider these to be severe violations of our anti-tracking policies, and are assessing solutions to protect against these new tracking techniques.\" The researchers warn that the current fixes are so specific to the code in the Meta and Yandex trackers that it would be easy to bypass them with a simple update. “They know that if someone else comes in and tries a different port number, they may bypass this protection,” said Gunes Acar, the researcher behind the initial discovery, referring to the Chrome developer team at Google. “But our understanding is they want to send this message that they will not tolerate this form of abuse.” Fellow researcher Vallina-Rodriguez said the more comprehensive way to prevent the abuse is for Android to overhaul the way it handles access to local ports. “The fundamental issue is that the access to the local host sockets is completely uncontrolled on Android,” he explained. “There's no way for users to prevent this kind of communication on their devices. Because of the dynamic nature of JavaScript code and the difficulty to keep blocklists up to date, the right way of blocking this persistently is by limiting this type of access at the mobile platform and browser level, including stricter platform policies to limit abuse.” The researchers who made this discovery are: Acar said he first noticed Meta Pixel accessing local ports while visiting his own university's website. There's no indication that Meta or Yandex has disclosed the tracking to either websites hosting the trackers or end users who visit those sites. Developer forums show that many websites using Meta Pixel were caught off guard when the scripts began connecting to local ports. “Since 5th September, our internal JS error tracking has been flagging failed fetch requests to localhost:12387,” one developerwrote. “No changes have been made on our side, and the existing Facebook tracking pixel we use loads via Google Tag Manager.” “Is there some way I can disable this?” another developer encountering the unexplained local port accessasked. It's unclear whether browser-to-native-app tracking violates any privacy laws in various countries. Both Meta and companies hosting its Meta Pixel, however,havefacedaraftoflawsuitsin recent years alleging that the data collected violates privacy statutes. Aresearch paperfrom 2023 found that Meta pixel, then called the Facebook Pixel, \"tracks a wide range of user activities on websites with alarming detail, especially on websites classified as sensitive categories under GDPR,\" the abbreviation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. So far, Google has provided no indication that it plans to redesign the way Android handles local port access. For now, the most comprehensive protection against Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica tracking is to refrain from installing the Facebook, Instagram, or Yandex apps on Android devices.

    "article_text": "Cillian Murphy is set to make his eventual return tothe world of28 Days Laterwithin the upcoming trilogy that28 Years Laterwill kick off this summer, but there are a few catches. Director Danny Boyle(Trainspotting) revealed vague details about the Oscar-winningOppenheimeractorâs involvement toIGN. The upcoming trilogy expands on the world Boyle and Alex Garland (Civil War) started with28 Days Laterand its star Cillian Murphy, with a new set of interconnected stories. However, Murphy will not appear in the first film as it introduces a new central character: Spike, a 12-year-old boy portrayed by Alfie Williams whose family (led by Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) finds itself in the thick of the post-apocalyptic zombie outbreak. âAlthough each story completes itself, there’s a handover section to the next film as well. So it’s very ambitious. We haven’t got the money for the third one yet. It will depend how the first one does, I guess,â Boyle shared and explained that Murphyâs return is contingent on how the first two movies do. âBut hopefully if we do ok, they’ll give us the go-ahead for the money and for the third one. Everybody’s standing by for that, really. Including Cillian,” the director confirmed regarding Murphy’s participation. Currently it’s planned that he will make an appearance at the end of the Nia DaCosta (Candyman)-directed follow-up28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, which picks up on the immediate continuation of events from Boyleâs upcoming reboot sequel and is slated to open in theaters next January. “He is in the second one,” Boyle revealed, “I shouldn’t give away too much. I’ll get killed.” But we can guess that his appearance will only tease the potential of the third film, which Sony has yet to confirm. Boyle continued, “You know that thing about sequels, you want to push it on and take huge risks.” “I have to say fair play to [studio Sony Pictures]. They did allow us to take great liberties with [28 Years Later]. They could have said, ‘Oh no, it needs to be more sequel-y. You need to rely on some of the ideas that are in the original. And what do you mean Cillian’s not going to appear in the first one? I thought you said Cillian was going to be in it.’ We said, ‘Yeah, Cillian is going to be in it, but not quite the first one.’ So fair play to them.

    "article_text": "Marvel Studiosfilms are known to use unconventional methods for their character stand-ins andTheFantastic Four: First Stepsaims to top the methods that came before. ActorSean Gunn acted as a stand-in for Bradley Cooper asGuardians of the GalaxyâsRocket Raccoonthroughout various productions, but in a fun turn of events for the Matt Shakman-helmed feature, star Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays superhero Ben Grimm, got a different sort of companion to help bring the Thing to life. Pulling a lot of the weight was “Jennifer”: a rock. âWe went out to the desert and found a rock that looked exactly how we thought the Thing should look,â Shakman toldEmpire Magazine, âand we filmed it in every single shot that the Thing appears in in the movie, under every lighting environment.” The practical stand-inâno insight was given into the name choice, in case you’re also wondering about thatâhelped CG animators with the reference needed for coloring and lighting that would be required to support Moss-Bachrachâs motion-capture performance. It also helped ensure the characterâs final form on screen wouldn’t be too cartoony. Moss-Bachrach told the magazine, âItâs a little bit heady to think about all the hundreds of people that are helping animate this character. I just had faith that they would make my performance so much cooler. Iâm very, very happy with the way Ben looks.â While Jennifer helped with the character’s craggy appearance, the actor also did a deeper dive into Grimm’s interior too. âHeâs a Lower East Side guy,â the actor explained about his connection as a NY native, same as the characterâs creator Jack Kirby, who he kept in mind while creating his take on Ben. âA lot of this character was a homage to his father, and that, to me, is very meaningful.â The Fantastic Four: First Stepsopens in theaters July 25.

    "title": "Disney Pulls Back the Curtain on Its New ‘Cars’ Land",
    "article_text": "If all goes according to plan, when the newCars-inspired landopens at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, you won’t even see it. Back at theD23 Expo last year, Disney announced it was adding aCars-themed land to its signature Orlando park, and now, thecompany has revealeda ton of additional info. There’s a map of what it’ll look like, an explanation of its theming, and the news that even thoughit’ll be sitting in the middle of the theme park, it’ll be carefully designed to make sure it doesn’t stand out. Oh, and it’s got a name too. The land is called Piston Peak National Park (though fans are sure to just call it “Piston Peak” or “CarsLand”), and though it’s fully set in the world ofCars, it’s being conceived as a national park in that franchise. The idea being, a national parkâeven if it’s filled with sentient talking vehiclesâis a more seamless fit into the land’s location, which is near Liberty Square and Frontierland. You can see the full map above, though it’s just an artist’s interpretation and won’t be exactly that. So, unlike the decidedly city-based theming in Radiator Springs, Disney’s firstCarsland atCalifornia Adventure, here everything will be much more natural. More earthy. Imagineers are even calling it “Parkitecture.” That’s a key too because, as Disney explains in its news release, “From the outside, trees will provide a natural barrier between the off-road rally and other parts of Frontierland and Liberty Square. Rugged mountains with dramatic peaks will be nestled along a calming waterway across from Grizzly Hall and soaring geysers from the famed Big Thunder Mountain Railroad will stretch into the trails of our off-road rally.” Previously, it was announced that the land now known as Piston Peak will have two rides in it, one geared at families and another, more exciting “race rally through the mountains” which will see your vehicle “climb mountain trails, dodge geysers and… splash through mudholes.” To make this land into a reality, the park will close Rivers of America, Tom Sawyer Island, and the Liberty Square Riverboat beginning July 7. Plus, as we already knew, on the other side of Big Thunder, a land focused exclusively on Disney Villains is coming too. But no word on specifics for that quite yet.

    "title": "‘GQuuuuuuX’ Is Taking Its ‘Gundam’ Remix to a Whole Other Level",
    "article_text": "Last week, I said thatÂMobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX‘s remixing of the originalÂGundamcontinuity was letting several of the original series’ biggest characters haunt the narrative, from the absent Amuro Ray, to theÂslightlyless absent Char Aznable, and then the one figure who’s really been skirting around the edges ofÂGQuuuuuuX‘s periphery in earnest, themysterious Lalah Sune. This week, Lalah stopped skirting… and then some. To the surprise of no one after last week’s setup, episode nine ofGQuuuuuuX, “The Rose of Sharon,” is indeed for the most part about Lalah Sune making her way into the series’ narrative, as Machu manages to escape confinement with the GQuuuuuuX and head to Earth, where she finds Lalah forced to work at a lavish brothel. But while this Lalah is indeed a Newtypeâregaling staff and Machu alike of the visions she sees in her dreamsâshe is not the Rose of Sharon that Machu was seeking in her hopes to be reunited with Shuji. Instead, this Lalah is almost haunted by what has come to pass, her Newtypism not really granting her a vision of the future, but what was, asGQuuuuuuXoffers yet another spin on a classic scene from the 1979 anime. Floating in the cosmic glow that represents the connection forged between Newtypes, Lalah flatly explains that the future she sees is her own: the future of another Lalah, a young woman who meets a young Zeon officer in red who whisks her to the stars… a Lalah who falls in love with that man, and also his rival, as she dies in battle saving the former from the latter. What the Lalah ofGQuuuuuuXsees beyond time, as she says to Machu, is the original story ofÂMobile Suit Gundam. The implication then thatÂGQuuuuuuX‘s remixed timeline of the Universal Century co-exists alongsideGundam‘s original one, in some capacity, already raises a bunch of fascinating questions, but things only get more interesting in the episode’s climactic moments, when we and Machu alike discover that the Lalah was right when she told them that she is not the rose neither she, nor Shuji, nor everyone else has been looking for after it went missing… Because another Lalah Sune is.ÂTheLalah Sune, if you will. Hidden for years at the bottom of the ocean until Machu and the GQuuuuuuX find it, Lalah’s mobile armor the Elmeth, locked in time from the moment of her death in the 1979 anime, has some how become an almighty object of vast psionic power, a Newtype beacon that has transitioned acrossthis divergent timeline, calling out to the generation of Newtypes that forged it in the first place in characters like Char and Lalah, but also the generation that has grown beyond them in this new timeline, like Machu, Nyaan, and Shuji. Of course,ÂGundamis no stranger to the alternate reality trend that has become du jour in contemporary pop culture. It’s been on it for decades at this point, whenMobile Fighter G Gundamcreated the firstalternateGundamuniverseto exist on TV outside of the stories that had been told in the Universal Century setting. Ever since we’ve had a bunch of other alternate realities to provide the setting to newGundamseries, we’ve had realities that, likeGQuuuuuuX,has mirrored and riffed on the Universal Century stories to createtheir own echoesof its ideas. Hell,Turn A Gundampresented a vision where its setting was a far-flung future after a “Dark History” that eradicated humanity back to a technological resetâone that touched upon every corner ofGundamcontinuity up to that point in some way, a comment on the cyclical nature of historical trends, while also symbolically honoring the entire metatext of the franchise up to that point, regardless of continuity. Suffice to say, the coexistence of aÂGQuuuuuuXtimeline, with all its changes, and that potential of the original timeline alongside it, is not exactly unfamiliar territory thatÂGundamis wading into as it explores all this. WithGQuuuuuuXhaving just a few more episodes to lay out what exactly it wants to say in all this remixing and meta-commentary, time will tell if all these self-referential reveals will result in the series creating something additive to that vast canonâor if its wild evocations are simply designed to spin the heads of diehard fans.

    "title": "Is MAGA Turning on Trump’s Buddy Palantir?",
    "article_text": "Creepy defense contractor Palantir has a new mission: convincing Americans that it’s not actually creepy. The company was been put on the defensive this week after the New York Timespublished a storydetailing its role in the Trump administration’s controversial effort to centralize data on Americans. Earlier this year, the White Housemade it known thatâas part of its DOGE initiativeâit planned to eliminate “information silos” throughout the government. While it was a little unclear what the White House meant at the time,concerns have since spreadthat the administration is effectively building a new, comprehensive database on Americans using information culled from agencies across the government. The Times’ new report notes that Palantir’s software is being used at more and more agencies, and that the company is playing a central role in the administration’s effort to de-silo federal data. Critics fear that the expanded use of Palantir’s data-handling software could pave the way for the creation of “detailed portraits” on Americansâa kind of Stasi-type surveillance profile that would allow Trump to target and punish his critics. DOGE reportedly selected Palantir for the data effortâa point that’s worth noting since the former head of DOGE, Elon Musk, is a longtime friend of Palantir’s founder, Peter Thiel, as the two werePayPal mafia members. Palantir has made a lot of money since Trump took office (both instock valueandthrough government contracts), and its software has become central to some of the Trump administration’s most pivotal initiatives. In April, 404 Mediareported onPalantir’s work to support the government’s aggressive deportation efforts aimed at illegal immigrants. Yet as Palantir’s star has risen, so, too, has public scrutiny of its work. The New York Times report on Palantir’s data effortstook offonline this week, with rumors circulating that the company was helping to build a “surveillance database” on Americans. Indeed, since the newspaper’s report, the defense contractor has come under attack by MAGA types, who seem perturbed that Trump, who campaigned on promises to “destroy” the deep state, seems to be in bed with a company that is the very face of it. The outrage has been helped along by several prominentMAGA voices, most notably self-admitted white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Fuentes recentlyattacked Palantir on his podcast, claiming that it was “created so the government can legally violate our constitutional rights.” Once a Trump supporter, Fuentes has been increasingly critical of the new administration’s policies over the last few months. In his diatribe against the company, Fuentes accurately noted thatPalantir was created with money from the CIA. “Trumpâs promotion ofPalantiris the ultimate betrayal of his own people,”Fuentestweeted. “Seriously, if Palantir isn’t the deep state, then what is?” Meanwhile, Joe Lonsdale, one of Palantir’s co-founders, got into a fight with “Retard Finder,” a rightwing X account that identifies people it has deemed “retarded,” typically Democratic politicians or leftist activists. On Tuesday, the account wrote: “The Palantir database idea is retarded.” In response, Lonsdalequote tweetedRetard Finder and sought to repel its attack. “Palantirâs not a âdatabaseâ; itâs a platform created by 1000s of the most talented and patriotic Americans to partner with our DoD to stop attacks and defeat bad guys, while protecting liberty & privacy.” He added: “In a sad turn of events, the retard account itself is, in fact, retarded.” On Tuesday, Palantirpublished a statementon X, claiming that the newspaper’s reporting was inaccurate. “The recently published article by the New York Times is blatantly untrue,” the account wrote. “Palantir never collects data to unlawfully surveil Americans, and our Foundry platform employs granular security protections. If the facts were on its side, the New York Times would not have needed to twist the truth.” However, Palantir’s statement notably misconstrues the Times reporting: nowhere in the report does the newspaper claim that the company is helping to “unlawfully surveil” Americans. The MAGA community has increasingly found itself at odds with the Trump administration, as the new government, which campaigned on promises that it would smash the status quo, has swiftly betrayed many of those promises. Most notably, Trump voters have increasingly expressed discontent over the government’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which, during the campaign, Trump promised to release.

    "title": "A Monkey Herpesvirus Could Hold Key to New Cancer Treatment",
    "article_text": "A cousin of herpes might just help us fight cancer. Scientists have engineered a protein derived from a herpesvirus in monkeys that could enhance the immune system’s potency against cancer. Researchers at the University of Michigan detailed their work on the protein in a paperpublishedlast month. In experiments with mice, the protein prolonged the life of cancer-fighting T cells, leading to reduced tumor growth. The findings point to a novel way that we can further strengthen immune-related cancer treatments, the researchers say. The protein comes fromherpesvirus saimiri, named after the squirrel monkeys (all members of the genusSaimiri) that the virus primarily infects. The researchers had identified the virus as carrying proteins that activate certain pathways in T cellsâthe immune system’s frontline soldiers against infections and cancersâthat extended their survivability. They ultimately engineered a modified version of one particular protein from the virus, called tyrosine kinase interacting protein (TIP). They hoped their version of TIP could bind to a protein in T cells that would stimulate the production of other proteins called STAT that could then boost the T cells’ longevity and cancer-killing potential. Experimental Therapy Fights Brain Cancer with Modified Herpes Virus As expected, the protein increased levels of STAT (specifically the protein STAT5) in T cells in a Petri dish. They then tested the protein on mice with melanoma and lymphoma. The T cells of treated mice lived longer and killed tumor cells more effectively, resulting in reduced cancer growth, the researchers found. “Our findings demonstrate that signaling pathways can be rewired in T cells to sustain their function in solid tumors,” the researchers wrote in the paper, published in Science Immunology. In recent years, scientists have developed a class of treatments that ramp up the immune system’s natural ability to recognize and attack cancers, which is broadly known as immunotherapy. So the U-M scientists believe that their protein could be used in combination with existing immunotherapies to keep T cells in tip-top cancer-bashing shape. More broadly, they believe that other organisms or their genes can be tweaked to modify our immune cells to make them better at fighting cancers. The team’s protein is still experimental, so it will take plenty more research to know whether it can be safely and effectively used in people. But it may not take too long for other herpesviruses to contribute to cancer treatment. Several research teams have developedmodifiedversionsof the herpes simplex 1 virus (the primary cause of cold sores) to directly eradicate tumors. Some of these treatments have already begun to be tested in people, and have shown promise in early clinical trials so far. cancersimmunotherapyViruses Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Physicists Propose Cheaper Alternative to Particle Colliders: Supermassive Black Holes",
    "article_text": "A new study from Johns Hopkins University suggests that supermassive black holesâthose cosmic behemoths lurking at the centers of galaxiesâmight already be generating the kinds of high-energy particle collisions researchers have spent decades trying to recreate here on Earth. Published today inPhysical Review Letters, the study proposes that certain spinning black holes could serve as natural particle accelerators, rivaling or even exceeding the capabilities of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Thatâs a big deal, especially as funding for fundamental physics research grows increasingly scarce in the United States, and plans for next-generation colliders stretch far into the future. For about a decade, experts have theorized that supermassive black holes could do this, co-author Andrew Mummery, a theoretical physicist at the University of Oxford, told Gizmodo. But his study attempted to validate this theory by looking for naturally-occurring scenarios that would give rise to a black holeâs supercollider-like behavior. Understanding how this happens could provide a new avenue for research on dark matter and other elusive particles.Â âOne of the great hopes for particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider is that it will generate dark matter particles, but we havenât seen any evidence yet,âexplainedco-author Joseph Silk, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Oxford, and the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris, in a Johns Hopkins release. âThatâs why there are discussions underway to build a much more powerful version, a next-generation supercollider,â Silk said. âBut as we invest $30 billion and wait 40 years to build this supercolliderânature may provide a glimpse of the future in super massive black holes.â At the LHC,protons are smashed together at near-light speedsto uncover the building blocks of realityâand hopefully, to catch a glimpse of dark matter, the mysterious stuff that makes up about 85% of the universeâs mass. But it turns out black holes might already be producing these elusive particles in the wild. Some supermassive black holes spin so rapidly thatthey can fling out jets of plasmaat astonishing speeds. In their new study, Mummery and Silk modeled what happens near the edge of these spinning monsters, where violent gas flows can whip particles into chaotic collisions, much like a human-built collider does. âSome particles from these collisions go down the throat of the hole and disappear forever,” Silk said, “But because of their energy and momentum, some also come out, and itâs those that come out which are accelerated to unprecedentedly high energies.” These ultra-energetic particles zipping through space could, in theory, be picked up by Earth-based observatories likeIceCube in Antarcticaor the KM3NeT telescope beneath the Mediterranean Sea, both of which already detect ghostly particles called neutrinos. Earlier this year, KM3NeT researchers announced the detection of themost energetic neutrino yet, a potential step forward in understanding the behavior of these ephemeral and energetic particles. Equipped with a deeper understanding of how these high-energy particles might form at the edges of supermassive black holes, Mummery now aims to investigate their nature. Figuring out what, exactly, escapes from these cosmic voids could offer a cost-effective, naturally occurring complement to traditional colliders. The approach could yield a new path toward uncovering the nature of dark matter. AstrophysicsBlack holesLarge Hadron Collider Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "After 600 Years, Astronomers Finally Solve the Mystery of the Missing ‘Guest Star’",
    "article_text": "In October 1408, in Ming Dynasty China, court astronomers recorded a strange celestial event: a bright yellow object, unmoving in the sky, shining steadily for over ten nights. It was described as âas large as a cupâ and âpure yellow color, smooth and brightââa sight so notable that it prompted formal documentation by imperial officials. For centuries, this 1408 âguest starâ has been a historical curiosity with no clear-cut identity. But thanks to a new discovery, astronomers think theyâve finally figured out the source. In a recent paperpostedto the preprint server arXiv, researchers led by Boshun Yang, an astronomer at the University of Science and Technology of China, report an overlooked report by Hu Guang, a court official in charge of “congratulatory memorials and laudatory poems addressed to the emperor,” as described in the paper. This official document from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau provides a fuller, more authentic account than previous descriptions of the event and, crucially, allowed the researchers to rule out the possibility of a forged or misinterpreted record. The memorial describes the object as stationary in the southern Niandao asterismâin the part of the sky now associated with the constellations Cygnus and Vulpeculaâand visible for more than 10 days. Unlike comets or meteors, which streak across the sky, this object stayed put and maintained its brightness, suggesting it was a star. Specifically, the event recounted by Hu Guang has the characteristics of a nova, or the violent death of a star that suddenly flares in brightness before slowly dimming. The team posits the 1408 nova had âplateauâ characteristics, meaning its light stayed steady for an unusually long time. Interestingly, the team also had to account for the subtle politics baked into the language of the record. Ancient Chinese astronomers were careful in how they described celestial phenomena when reporting to the emperor. To ensure that his outlook remained rosy, it was important that astronomical events channeled good vibes. They avoided ominous language in reports of the nova, which was described as âyellowâ and âlustrous,â as opposed to it sporting “spikes” or other details that could sound ominous, according toUniverse Today. By combining this new historical document with modern astrophysics, Yang’s team argues that the 1408 guest star is almost certainly a novaâadding it to a growing list of ancient Chinese records that corroborate modern astronomical observations. Like the well-known 1054 supernova that created the Crab Nebulaâreported by the Chinese as it happened, and now vividly imaged by observatories like the Webb Space Telescopeâthis centuries-old observation shows how events relatively distant in human history are just blips in cosmic time. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for modern astronomy, which can use earlier accounts as a backdropâand even a driverâfor new discoveries.

    "title": "How the New ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ Made Berk Feel Real",
    "article_text": "io9 recently caught up with filmmakerDean DeBlois, the creative force behind both the DreamWorks animated franchise and Universal Pictures’ upcoming live-action adaptation ofHow to Train Your Dragon. DeBlois discussed the process to bring the Viking world of Berk to life, emphasizing the vital role of practical effects in capturing the experience of interacting and riding dragons for his actors. That was key in making big moments feel real, particularly when Hiccup (Mason Thames) meets his futureNightfury friend. âToothless in those scenes was a foam head,â DeBlois said. Animatronics were used during all the flight sequences. âWe had to capture convincing movement from our actors when they were riding dragons rather than just having them sit in a box and be moved around,” he said. “And that meant that we built these giant gimbals that were about eight or 10 feet tall that could move in six different axes.âÂ  Each dragon in the film had its own animatronic model to assist the actors in immersing themselves as dragon riders. Thames obviously had to spend the most time “on dragon,” since the story focuses on Hiccup and Toothless’ journey. DeBlois described the experience of bringing dragon riding to life for his lead actor: âIt was the chest, the neck, and the head, and they could all move independently, either joystick controlled or controlled by animation that had already been done by the animators. As he is dipping and diving and rolling and ascending, Mason’s body is reacting to all of that like a jockey on a horse.â DeBlois revealed that the technique was very new. “Itâs the first time anyone had done it actually, so it was fraught with anxiety that it might not work or break down on us, but it turned out to be perfect.â The magic of John Powell’s iconic themes for the animated films, in collaboration with cinematographer Bill Pope’s eye for visuals, helped breathe new life into Hiccup’s friendship with Toothless. The collaboration really steered the film in the direction DeBlois aimed for. Of Pope’s work behind the camera, he said, “I think Bill understood from the beginning that there was a lot to preserve about the animated movie that we had to try to keep in place. The whimsy in the heart and the sense of wish fulfillment and fantasy. Through his camera lens, the world becomes grounded but retains all of those things. And of course John Powell’s music just marries it all.” The expansion of the score was of great importance, DeBlois said. âI always say that everything we do in making a movie gets it halfway there, and then you hand it to the composer and theyâll take it the other half of the way because music transcends words and goes right to the heart.â He added that they were fortunate to have Powellâs iconic music accompanying the narrative, elevating it to new heights. With the anticipation of the film’s release, we noted that Berk now has a real-life version fans can visit at Epic Universe and asked his thoughts on the land at Universal Orlando Resort. While he didn’t get to test most of the rides, he was pleased with the way it brought the Isle of Berk’s life with dragons to our universe. âI thought it was gonna be a little corny, but it turned out to be kind of amazing,” he said of the Toothless meet and greet. He was also really impressed by Universal Orlando’s casting for the theme park version of Hiccup. View this post on Instagram “The kid has really done his study; he has all of the mannerisms and voice down but also embodies the characteristics that Jakob Jensen, [the film’s] lead animator, brought to it,â he added.

    "title": "Mega-Tsunamis That Shook the World for 9 Days Revealed in New Satellite Images",
    "article_text": "Scientists have finally solved the mystery behind two strange events that shook the entire planet for nine days straight. Their findings close the book on a years-long effort to trace the seismic signals back to their source. In September 2023, global seismometers detected something strange. The Earth was experiencing minor tremors every 90 secondsâand the shaking went on for nine days. One month later, it happened again. Scientists were baffled, as natural tectonic processes couldnât explain the anomalies.Â After roughly a year of scientific sleuthing, two studies published in 2024independentlyhypothesizedthat the shaking resulted from two huge landslides, setting off two âmega-tsunamisâ in the Dickson Fjord in East Greenland. These enormous standing wavesâor seichesâsloshed back and forth inside the fjord and triggered small movements within the Earthâs crust, they posited.Â It was an intriguing possibility, and both studies presented compelling evidence to support their claims. But, âthere were some big uncertainties that made it difficult to fully corroborate that this was actually the root cause,â Thomas Monahan, a Schmidt AI in Science fellow at the University of Oxford, told Gizmodo. So, Monahan and his colleagues set out to confirm whether this hypothesis was correct. In a study published today in the journalNature Communications, they unveiled the first direct satellite observations of the seiches and definitively linked them to the seismic anomalies.Â The researchers used data captured by NASAâs Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, whichlaunchedin December 2022 tomapthe height of water across 90% of Earthâs surface. This type of data collectionâknown as satellite altimetryâworks by transmitting radar pulses from a satellite to Earthâs surface, and then measuring the time it takes for the signals to bounce off the surface and return to the satellite. Conventional altimeters failed to capture evidence of the seiches due to long gaps between observations, according to an Oxfordstatement. As such, they generally struggle to gather data in fjord regions due to the complexity of the terrain, Monahan said. But SWOT is equipped with a cutting-edge altimeter instrument that uses two antennas to triangulate the return signals. This allows the satellite to take very high-resolution measurements of surface water levels. âWhat we’re able to get is essentially an incredibly high-resolution snapshot of what the elevation of the sea surface is doing in these complex regions,â Monahan said. These snapshots provided a more accurate picture of how the fjordâs sea surface height changed during the 2023 seismic events, allowing his research team to calculate the slopes of the massive waves that had formed.Â âWe were able to essentially unearth the fact that there was a significant anomaly in the fjord exactly when we would expect this wave to occur,â Monahan said.Â But determining that these seiches formed at the same time as the strange seismic signals still wasnât enough to prove the two events were linked. The researchers needed direct evidence to prove that these huge waves were capable of generating global tremors.Â To that end, they linked the SWOT snapshots to small movements in the Earthâs crust detected at seismic stations located thousands of miles away from the fjord. Coupling this continuous seismic data with the intermittent satellite observations allowed them to reconstruct the characteristics of the wave, even for periods that SWOT did not observe. The researchers also ruled out the possibility that the seismicity stemmed from weather or tidal conditions and ultimately determined that the seiches were the sources of the tremors. These waves formed when a warming glacier collapsed in on itself, Monahan said. âThis created very large landslides, whichâwhen they struck the fjordâproduced massive mega-tsunamis on the order of 200 meters or 600 feet tall,â he explained. âThis was the first time that a mega-tsunami of that nature had occurred in Eastern Greenland,â Monahan said, adding that this type of event has been documented on the territoryâs west coast. To see this phenomenon spreading to other parts of the ice sheet âis concerning,â he said, because it shows that climate change is accelerating in this region. âI think what this study really emphasizes is thatâwell, it sounds silly to sayâbut climate change is a global phenomenon,â Monahan said.Â âSome of the biggest and fastest changes are occurring in the Arctic and in remote regions where we may not see it every single day. But it’s important to understand and quantify those changes as they will eventually come to impact us where we live,â he said. Indeed, the waves that shook the world offer a stark reminder of the sweeping impacts of rising global temperatures.

    "title": "Clint Eastwood Says Viral Interview Is Fake, and He’s Mad About It",
    "article_text": "An interview with 95-year-old film legend Clint Eastwood recently blew up online after he sent some shots at Hollywood’s sequel and franchise film obsession. The problem, it appears, is that he never actually said what has been attributed to him. In fact, according to astatement he gave to Deadline(I mean…we’re pretty sure he actually gave this one, right?), he said that the entire interview that produced his viral shellacking of the film industry is “phony.” Let’s take a step back real quick. On May 30, an Austrian outlet called Kurier, whichThe Guardian reportshas a circulation of about 100,000 readers,published an interview with Clint Eastwood, supposedly given right before his 95th birthday. In that interview, which frankly comes off as a pretty generic press tour conversation, Eastwood supposedly gave the following take when asked how the business has changed in recent years: I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote movies like ‘Casablanca’ in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea. We live in an era of remakes and franchises. I’ve made sequels three times, but I haven’t been interested in them for a long time. My philosophy is, do something new or stay home. That quote got picked up online and spread like wildfire, in part because it’s a sentiment that lots of film lovers agree with and in part because it’s Clint Eastwood taking shots at Hollywood, and that is always going to play in the right-wing internet ecosystem. The quote also got picked up by the aggregator industrial complex, getting play inVariety,IndieWire, and theNew York Postamong others. Fast forward to June 2, and word had gotten back to Eastwood that he’s getting a lot of attention for this quote, which was probably quite confusing for him since he insists he never said it. When Deadline reached out to him to confirm the quote, Eastwoodtold the publication: âA couple of items about me have recently shown up in the news. I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm Iâve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony.â Kurier has since affixed a disclaimer to the top of the supposedEastwood interviewstating, “The KURIER editorial team is currently investigating the matter, which will take some time given the time difference to the US. We will comment on the matter immediately thereafter.” So what happened? For what it’s worth, if you run the supposed Eastwood answers through an AI detector (whichare notoriously unreliable toolsto begin with thatproduce lots of false positives), it doesn’t think the text is AI-generated. And faking quotes from celebrities is not only unethical but pretty dumb because of exactly what happened here: They have a bigger platform than you and motivation to respond. As it turns out, the Eastwood quotes are sort of real. They just weren’t given as part of a single interview. In astatement, which has since replaced the original interview, Kurier explained that the reporter took a collection of answers that Eastwood gave at a series of roundtable events and put them together in a single story, formatted as if they were given over the course of a single, continuous interview. “The article was formatted as an interview, not a portrait. This was intended to create the impression that it was a new interview. The fact that this wasn’t the case is not in keeping with the quality standards the KURIER maintains,” the publicationsaid. “Even though no quote is fabricated, the interviews are documented, and the allegation of falsification can be refuted, we will no longer work with the author in the future because transparency and our strict editorial standards are paramount to us.” clint eastwoodFakesmisinformation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Though showrunner Allan Heinberg has maintained that two seasonshas been the plan for years now, and that Netflix’s announcement of its impending conclusion alongsidehigh-profile allegationsagainst Gaiman was just unfortunate timing, a new bit of information about season two suggests perhaps that at one time, plans for moreSandmanmay have been in the cards. To nobody’s surprise after the success of season one,The Sandmanwas renewed in late 2022. At the time, a Netflix press release promised “The Sandmanworld will continue to expand,” framing the then-unspecified amount of future episodes as a continuation of the story rather than a more traditional “season two is on the way!” announcement. In January of this year,Heinberg confirmedthat the second season would beThe Sandman‘s finale, explaining that since the show had focused on the Dream character since the start, it only had one more season left of material to pull from the comics. However, as fans of Gaiman’sSandmancomics well know, and as Netflix seemed to infer back in 2022, the story explores quite a vast world. The original series ran for 75 issues from 1989 to 1996. And the series adaptation, while anchored by Tom Sturridge’s Dream, has a pretty sprawling array of supporting charactersâincluding Kirby Howell-Baptiste’s Death. Today, Netflix announced episode titles for theThe Sandman‘s second season: 11 entries we knew about (divided into two drops in July), as well as a surprisebonusepisode focusing on Death. Here’s all the titles, which hint at the storylines that’ll be adapted across season two, according toVariety: July 3 Episodes Chapter 1: âSeason of Mistsâ Chapter 2: âThe Ruler of Hellâ Chapter 3: âMore Devils Than Vast Hell Can Holdâ Chapter 4: âBrief Livesâ Chapter 5: âThe Song of Orpheusâ Chapter 6: âFamily Bloodâ July 24 Episodes Chapter 7: âTime and Nightâ Chapter 8: âFuel for the Fireâ Chapter 9: âThe Kindly Onesâ Chapter 10: âLong Live the Kingâ Chapter 11: âA Tale of Graceful Endsâ Then, there’ll be a bonus drop on July 31: âThe Sandman Presents: Death: The High Cost of Living.â What do you make of the bonus episode? Does it hint at anotherSandmanseason that may have been in the works before the show’s cancellationâor do you buy the explanation that two Dream-centric installations were always the plan all along?

Once it finds its footing, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is an engaging romp through a charming and dynamic world. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. One might assume that if you fell out of the sky, crash-landed through the roof of a shrine, and woke up with amnesia to a flying, talking sheep with horns listing your divine duties, you might get a day off. You might want to relax and recuperate. You might take a moment for yourself. What is it?Action RPG, social sim, city builder, take your pick!Release Date:June 5, 2025Developer:MarvelousPublisher:MarvelousReviewed on:Windows 11, NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060, AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, 16GB RAMMultiplayer?NoSteam Deck:VerifiedLink:Official site It would probably be a lot to ask that you become the most active municipal volunteer in the troubled local community, restore the divinity of their god, and embark on a quest to rejuvenate the world after a devastating apocalyptic event. Well, you clearly don't have what it takes to be an Earth Dancer. Kaguya, one of the two possible protagonists of Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, does have what it takes. Never has there been a more concerned citizen, a more selfless activist, or a more ambitious amateur farmer. She gets knocked out of the heavens after a violent battle with a mysterious figure on a black dragon; she gets thrust into tales of Celestial Collapse and Blight and meets the god of spring; she takes out a hoe and starts planting turnips. She also does some adventuring, romances some people, builds a house or two, learns to cook, and does her best to save the world. We love a Renaissance woman. Most of Guardians of Azuma is a fairly straightforward action RPG. Kaguya has multiple choices of melee weapons, a bow, and sacred artifacts given to her by the gods, which do elemental damage. Weapons can be upgraded or enhanced, and later on she can acquire talismans to aid her in combat. This implies a diversity to combat that doesn't materialize—I never encountered a fight in the game that I couldn't brute force with my sword, whatever sacred artifact I was feeling at the time, and an inventory full of cheese omelets. Most battles won't need strategizing, though enemies do have weaknesses and bosses can be stunned as well as just hacked at. I wasn't particularly bothered with the shallowness of combat—it's fun to spin in circles with my Fan Of Death and hear my party members chatter at the monsters we encounter, and it doesn't distract from the parts of the game that are more engaging. Let the friends I've recruited go slice up oni for me: I've gotta float around with a parasol to find frog statues for a local child. The polar opposite of combat is the game's farm sim/village developer/landscape architect aspects, which can be as simple or as complicated as your heart desires. My urban planning style ended up being \"function over form,\" which means I've got four bustling, productive villages that look like they were zoned by an over-caffeinated squirrel. Players with more of an eye for aesthetics will have fun messing with decorations, of which there are plenty to find within the world, and the development mechanics are easy to use (though there's some frustrating friction at the beginning, when crafting basic terrain tiles requires an annoying amount of menu navigation). Once you can start recruiting villagers they'll be assigned to work in your absence, which means Kaguya only has to make a few decisions in her role as Literally Everyone's Mayor before the money starts rolling in, leaving her free to wander around and fight or flirt or make more onigiri. There's a lot going on in this game. Kaguya's got to explore, fight monsters, and discover what her amnesiac protagonist deal is, but she's also got to build up these villages, do some farming, socialize, cook approximately a hundred thousand recipes, revive the divinity of some gods, and go to bed before midnight. At first it's unwieldy, these systems bordering on excessive in what is actually not a huge game world. Kaguya spends a ton of time retracing her steps as she slowly unravels the truth about what's going on with Azuma. Early on, that's a weird juxtaposition: why do I have so much I can do and so little to do it with? Time and progression pay off extremely well to combat that imbalance. The social mechanics reward long investments with different characters, and it takes a while to wade out of the shallower aspects of their personal quests. The villages you're developing are irregularly stocked with dev zones and existing infrastructure, so some have easy early rewards whereas others get a boost at later levels. And the story simply gets more interesting later in the game. The first 10 or so hours are almost off-puttingly busy, but as the game progresses, the feeling of busyness turns into a feeling of comfortable denseness. It is satisfying and occasionally heartwarming to see characters I met in Spring Village settling down to eat a meal in Autumn Village, or to know that I'll be able to fulfill a request of a villager in Summer Village because my barn in Winter Village is producing the eggs I need for the recipe. Because so much is automated, it escapes the player-centric god-king-of-all-I-survey trap it could have easily fallen into; Kaguya's role, both narratively and mechanically, is just to get the ball rolling, to bring life back to something so it can continue living. Build a house, plant a field, and there will be people to till it, to water and harvest, to fish and mine and log and tend to animals and run shops. It's one instance of the game's throughline: That the point of helping someone, or healing something, is so they can stand on their own. The social system is the other standout. It's regrettably frontloaded with some of the weakest writing and least interesting characters, but once you unlock more villages the roster of characters you can befriend is varied and charming, with some personal quests that go in really delightful directions (I have lost hours of my life to chasing around mischievous shapeshifters, advertising local businesses, and making gamers be social.) Because personal quest progression is tied to the calendar, and because there's no limit to how many characters you can interact with in a day, it fits in well between main quest progress, exploration, and village development. I thoroughly enjoyed when I'd be wandering around only to spot someone I'd been talking to in the distance and sprint after them to go grab a bite to eat together. Out of all the characters you can meet in Rune Factory, the best ones by far are the gods you awaken throughout the story. Without spoilers (because there are some legitimately fun reveals in their roster) the fact that the gods have both main story relevance and sidequest social relevance means they have the most time to develop, even the ones you don't meet until later in the game. Kaguya often takes a step back in these parts of the story, and the quirks, neuroses, fears, and desires of the gods get to take center stage. This is excellent, since they resemble less a pantheon of powerful deities and more an impromptu reunion of bickering siblings that have been ignoring each other's texts, complete with blithe nicknames, established alliances, and a handful of held grudges. They're just as invested as Kaguya in restoring their divinity and investigating the cause of the Celestial Collapse, but also some of them are socially anxious or easily distracted or owe someone some money, so they'll need a hand here or there. Those are the two levels the game operates on:help save the world, orhelp a buddy out. At the beginning Kaguya is a stranger, literally crash-landed in the shrine of Spring Village, with no memory of her place in the world. Rune Factory feels like a stranger to itself at this point, with all of the moving parts present but watching each other warily, not sure how to work together yet. As Kaguya settles into herself, as she engages with her environment, helps the village and the villagers, and starts her divine journey, the game matches her. On the macro level she collects the allies and information needed to figure out what's going on with the Celestial Collapse and how to fix it. On the micro level, she collects the resources and knowledge needed to figure out how to cook honey toast for a demanding pastry chef. She might be an Earth Dancer for the gods, to bring them back to life and guide them towards the rejuvenation of the world, but in every other aspect she's just a person trying to help out where she can. Once it finds its footing, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is an engaging romp through a charming and dynamic world. Maddi Chilton is an internet footprint from the Midwestern US.

    "title": "MindsEye is set to launch next week, so it's probably not great that the studio's chief financial officer and chief legal officer have both resigned",
    "article_text": "The MindsEye saga gets weirder. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The pre-release saga ofMindsEye, the debut game from former Rockstar Games stalwart Leslie Benzies and his Build a Rocket Boy studio, has taken another strange twist. As noticed today byEurogamer, Build a Rocket Boy's chief financial officer and chief legal officer have both left the company, just a week ahead of MindsEye's release. Former chief legal officer Riley Graebner, who joined Build a Rocket Boy in 2022 and also served as chief operating officer until April 2024, announced his departure from the studio in amessage posted to LinkedIn. \"After three and a half years my time at BARB has come to a close,\" Graebner wrote. \"I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. During that time we more than doubled the size of the company to over 450 employees. We launched multiple products worldwide. We built the legal team and legal ops infrastructure from the ground up, working to systemize and automate. \"I’m beyond excited for what’s next—but currently operating in stealth mode for a while longer. Stay tuned.\" CFO Paul Bland didn't make any sort of public declaration about leaving BARB, but updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate that he'd parted ways with the company in June. Somewhat oddly, he seems to have subsequently changed his LinkedIn page: The Paul Bland page on the site (which I successfully visited earlier today) is gone, but the account itself remains available, at a different URL, under the namePaul B. I have no idea what to make of that, but it's weird. The whole thing is weird, really. Executives come and go, it's true, but losing two C-suiters, effectively at the same time, and literally a week before the launch of the big thing you've been working on for years—well, it's not a very good look, is it? There's no indication that anything untoward is going on behind the scenes, but even so their departures have caused an understandable ripple amongst some of the MindsEye community. As one person put it in theMindsEye Discord, \"Two major players inside the company just resigned. That's concerning!\" I'm inclined to agree. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Similar sentiments can be seen on theMindsEye subreddit, where people are already somewhat less than enthusiastic about the game due primarily to a relative dearth of information about it. Back when the metaverse was still a thing, MindsEye was billed as an experience taking place within theEverywhereplatform, which has been kicking around—equally ill-explained—since 2016. But I know even less about Everywhere than I do about MindsEye at this point, and it seems to have fallen off the radar: TheEverywherewebsite, for instance, now redirects to a MindsEye site—which is just a trailer and purchase links. \"They’ve done such an incredibly poor job explaining this game I still have no clue what it even is,\" redditor Greatnes wrote. \"It’s just buzzwords and features with nothing linking them or explaining them. I’ve never had this issue with a game before with not even knowing what it is. Game is out in 13 days and they don’t seem interested in actually showing it off beyond carefully scripted gameplay trailers that don’t explain anything.\" (MindsEye is, for the record, \"a narrative driven, single-player action-adventure thriller\" with an estimated 15-hour campaign—it looks a bit like GTA, but don't expect anything on that scale.) The departures of Build a Rocket Boy's CFO and CLO come less than a week after the company's co-CEO Mark Gerhard caused a stir by claiming publicly that the negative reactions to MindsEye were part of a \"concerted effort to trash the game and the studio\" ahead of its release, being financed by an unnamed entity. That was not great either, and also very weird. MindsEye is set to launch on June 10.

    "title": "The Witcher 4 tech demo has me hyped for a big budget open world for the first time in years—but not because of the Unreal graphics",
    "article_text": "Thank god, they're making open worlds with character again. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Earlier today,CD ProjektRed presented aWitcher 4tech demo at Epic's State of Unreal event, showing off a first look at what the Ciri-centric sequel might look like in motion. And to set aside my professional remove for a moment, I'll confess that the demo got me. Against my better judgment, I was hyped. I'd almost forgotten the feeling. For a few minutes, the early glimpse of Witcher 4 felt like the E3 conference reveals of my youth. It wasn't the graphics tech itself that excited me. I won't deny that I was impressed by the CDPR's advancements in simulated horse meat—horse realism is about the only form of videogame realism I'm invested in. Otherwise, I think the drive for graphical realism is a doomed pursuit, contributing to ever-increasing budgets that provoke ever-increasing layoffs when publishers don't see suitably infinite profits. On a technical level, The Witcher 4 looks prettier, as big budget open world games inevitably do. Starfield's graphics tech was better than Skyrim's.Assassin's Creed Shadowshas more polygons than Valhalla. But what's the value of fidelity independent of art direction? If an open world's character isn't getting the same investment as its graphics tech, how interesting can it be? Considering how little of them I've been compelled to play over the last decade, the answer—for me—seems like \"not terribly.\"That's why, as CDPR sent Ciri through the Kovirian woodland, the first thing that sent me into sicko mode wasn't the individual pine needles of Nanite foliage or the speed of asset streaming. It was this nasty little signpost. Look at that thing.What a charming little piece of culture. Where CDPR would've been well within its rights to slap down a generic wooden pole with signs pointing at nearby landmarks, it took the opportunity to start using shapes, colors, and materials to begin establishing a regional texture to Kovir. And as Ciri rides into the port town of Valdrest? Man.That's aplace. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Videogame fantasy is often imagined as a generic pastiche of dingy ideas of medieval society. Valdrest is colorful, and more importantly, it feelsregional: wooden beams of market pavilions are painted with striking cerulean with rusty red accents. Those same colors alternate on the boards of nearby homes. They're echoed in the geometric designs of the pottery on sale in trader stalls. Headwear and armor feels distinctly Slavic—though there are noticeable distinctions between what's worn by human troops walking the streets and a handful of armored dwarves lingering in the marketplace. There are characters with visible disabilities. There are noticeable differences in class and station. CDPR seemed invested in Valdrest feeling like a place with its own context and character. And yes, it looks good. The textures are lovely. The lighting evokes that combination of warmth and chill of a sunny winter day. When CDPR packs the town square with NPC circusgoers, it's impressive that the PS5 running the tech demo doesn't lurch with the effort. I'm looking at the fidelity meters and they're all reading high. Technology is happening. Ten years from now, though, I'm not going to remember how crowded the square is. But I might remember the variety of garb the villagers are wearing. I might remember the poor bastard in the sackcloth hood who only has time to glance over at the performers while he carts an ale keg, or how I tried to decide whether the longer cut of a dwarf onlooker's tunic was unique in the crowd. I might remember how CDPR seemed invested in Valdrest feeling like a place with its own context and character. As a comparison, I checked back in onStarfield's first gameplayreveal from 2022 to see how much had stuck with me, figuring that it'd be useful to contrast CDPR's showing with the work of another of the industry's open world watermarks. All I could remember from the first look at Starfield was a bit of gun gameplay on a barren alien planet. While revisiting the video, I was surprised to find I'd forgotten that Bethesda had shown gameplay of the capital city of New Atlantis. And Akila City. And whatever the name of that planet was with the drugs they make from space fish. Through that rewatch, the reasons became clear. The locations shown all shared a washed out, low-saturation color palette. They were intercut with shots of industrial hallways that—if you squint—would fit right at home in a Fallout vault. The NPCs dressed in, interacted with, and prepared to pilot clothes, objects, and vessels that all skewed towards a nonspecific \"space stuff\" aesthetic. (Theycalled it \"NASA-punk\"but the \"punk\" part is pretty debatable.) As someone who destroyed my first year at college with too many hundreds of hours of Skyrim, it would have been unthinkable to a younger me that I'd end up thinking of a Bethesda game as forgettable. But Starfield felt like a symptom of an industry that, even with all the production budget it could muster, was forgetting how to make an open world with its own identity. It's nice to see it can remember.

    "article_text": "\"There are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I hope you weren't too excited about the prospect ofprivate servers for Old School Runescape, because Jagex has announced that Project Zanaris—the OSRS \"community servers\" initiative announced in 2024—has been paused \"indefinitely.\" And it sure doesn't sound like it'll be restarted, as developers previously working on the project \"have been redistributed across Jagex or directly moved to Old School to help with ongoing improvements and exciting new initiatives.\" \"After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely,\" Jagexannounced today. \"We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone. \"We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.\" While community servers aren't going to happen, at least not anytime soon, Jagex said the work done on Zanaris prior to the pause will \"directly benefit\" OSRS in the future in a number of ways. As written in its announcement post: Jagex also said that while Zanaris is paused, it's still pursuing the underlying idea behind it—\"to empower you to explore unique, experimental content\"—through expanded Community Events. \"These would be special, time limited events similar to how DMM [Deadman Mode] and Leagues operate to safely explore and enjoy entirely new types of gameplay and concepts. This could even be a space where you can trial new content before it potentially makes its way into the main game via the usual polling system. You'll play a crucial role in these experiments as it's your feedback that will help us shape the future of OSRS.\" A Jagex spokesperson confirmed with PC Gamer that the pause of Zanaris is unrelated to thelayoffs Jagex publicized today.

    "title": "The PC game releases we're most excited about in June",
    "article_text": "And this is the list before Geoff Keighley's big showcase. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Happy Not-E3 month. We're officially in that short few weeks of the year where the games industry comes together to announce as much as humanly possible before dispersing to prepare for the same thing next summer. That means our event schedule is unsurprisingly packed, but let's not lose sight of all the PC game releases you can actually play in June. June isn't quite as busy when compared to the beginning of 2025, and that's fine enough since so many of us still have May's lateElden Ring Nightreignlaunch to contend with. Mercifully, there are only a couple of games launching around Summer Game Fest showcase days, like Deltarune and Rune Factory. But we've still got quite a few big PC games to watch in June, and the nature of several survival-crafting ordeals plus a few RPGs guarantees they'll be lengthy ones. I'm sure this list will grow much more chaotic with any Summer Game Fest surprises, but I've highlighted what I'm eyeing for now. Dune: Awakening | June 10 (Steam)After a delay from last month, it's finally time for Funcom's take on Frank Herbert's sci-fi series. Despite having no real attachment to the universe myself, I had a blast in its recent beta tests running from giant worms and surviving on recycled sweat. Though I will say I'm much like Wes and hopebuilding in Dune: Awakeninglives up to its legacy of cool artwork. The Alters | June 13 (Steam)This one got pushed back a bit more, but it's nice to see The Alters find a release date that sticks. As Jan Dolski, you'll clone yourself a lot to escape the hell planet his crew crash-landed on. The last thing I'd need in that scenario would be more of me, but Joshua'spreview for The Altershas me interested in the survival-crafting bits. Rematch | June 19 (Steam)I know more about Frank Herbert than football (absolutely nothing), but love the spectacle around the sport. Thankfully, Rematch appears to be more of that and less traditional. It's ridiculous, flashy, arcadey football that's just as focused on the fast-paced pizzazz of an action game while staying true to the spirit of the sport. Raidou Remastered | June 19 (Steam)The Devil Summoner 2 special edition has sat on my shelf for over a decade of \"I'm going to play that finally.\" Embarrassingly, that gave Atlus enough time to remake the whole damn RPG before I stopped lying to myself. Shaun'sRaidou Remastered previewsays it \"keeps a lot of the charm of the original and shears away most of its rougher edges,\" so I feel less bad about my personal failing. System Shock 2: Anniversary Remaster | June 26 (Steam)This one I didn't miss, though my experience with System Shock 2 was messy and packed full of mods, probably not indicative of how the classic version truly felt. After hearing about itsorigin story borne from frustration, I'm hopeful the System Shock 2 remaster cuts the jank and extra modding steps out, delivering a worthy companion to the original. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater: All the key details on the remake of a PS2 classic",
    "article_text": "The full intel report on Konami's return to Metal Gear. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been just under a decade since the last Metal Gear Solid released (no, I don't count Survive), and the series is finally making a comeback with a remake of its best game—and the best game ever made, if you ask me. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a full remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3 in Unreal Engine 5. Unlike Konami's efforts onSilent Hill 2's remake, which expanded on the original game, Delta is set to be a faithful remake of the original, with no new story elements or major deviations from the original's design. The changes from Snake Eater instead bring controlling Snake more in line with the modernised control scheme of Metal Gear Solid 5. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to release on August 28, 2025. However, because we can't let things be simple anymore, Konami is also joining in on the \"pay more to play a bit earlier\" train. Those who buy the Digital Deluxe edition of the game will get access to it two days earlier, on August 26, 2025. Currently the game is only scheduled for release on Steam (and consoles), but given Konami released the Silent Hill 2 remake on both Epic Games and GOG seven months after Steam, there's a chance Delta could arrive on those down the line. Metal Gear Solid Delta costs $70 / £70 (yes, that isn't a great deal for the UK), with the Digital Deluxe version costing $80 / £80. The Digital Deluxe edition comes with two days early access and the Sneaking DLC Pack, which comes with a bunch of cosmetic items for Snake, including some outfits from Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker. Metal Gear Solid Delta has had a few trailers at this point, the latest of which is a greatest hits of some of the game's most memorable moments and characters (and thus has some spoilers). It has some gameplay moments in there, but a lot of it is cutscenes, with all the members of The Cobra Unit getting an introduction. If you're after some more gameplay, the trailer shown at theXbox Showcase 2024features some edited gameplay sections. Meanwhile, Konami showed somelive-feed gameplayof the game's opening at TGS 2024. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Metal Gear Solid Delta is largely a visual recreation of Metal Gear Solid 3, but with some modernized touches. Moving Naked Snake is now more in line with Venom Snake's (yes, that's a different guy) controls in Metal Gear Solid 5. One of the most notable enhancements is the ability to crouch walk—something that was introduced into the series with Metal Gear Solid 4 and later implemented into the Nintendo 3DS port of Snake Eater. For those of you who are really feeling nostalgic, there's a 'Legacy' mode that puts the game into the fixed camera angle of older Metal Gears. However, Delta does still stick to some of the elements that were necessary with the hardware limitations of the PS2. For example, the game is still segmented into different areas with loading screens between them, as opposed to being a seamless open world. That isn't to say there aren't any quality-of-life changes. Metal Gear Solid Delta will allow you to pull up your camo menu in-game and change camouflage, as opposed to having to pause the game and open a full-screen menu every time you reach a new surface. Another interesting tidbit is with the Survival Viewer. In the original game, Snake would get injuries that you would need to cure with the likes of bandages, ointment, and splints in the survival viewer. This time around, the system will actually show Snake's injuries on his character model, with him collecting bruises and cuts. Metal Gear Solid Delta is also set to bring back theSnake vs. Monkey mode, which features Snake having to hunt down the monkeys from Sony's Ape Escape series. The Xbox version of the game is getting some kind of Bomberman crossover due to Sony not playing nice, but there's a good chance we'll see that come to PC too. Look at the name of the video game; of course you can eat a snake, it'd be flagrant false advertising otherwise. The opening theme song even references Snake's bizarre dietary habits with the iconic line \"someday you'll feed on a tree frog.\" Metal Gear Solid Delta is a strict remake of Metal Gear Solid 3. Unlike the Silent Hill 2 remake, which added new changes to the story with extra endings and new locales, Delta looks to be wholly faithful to the original. The game serves as a prequel for the Metal Gear Solid series and is currently the earliest game in the timeline. You play as Naked Snake (not Solid Snake, that's also a different guy) in 1964 during the peak of the Cold War. You get sent into the USSR in a bid to rescue a scientist who has created a superweapon that could have devastating consequences if put into the wrong hands. The game is based around telling the story of how Big Boss became that character players would see in the later (well, released earlier, but you get me) Metal Gear games. A younger version of Revolver Ocelot steals the show and is one of the only characters returning from the previous Metal Gear games aside from one who is an \"oh, these two were the same dude by the way\" reveal in MGS4 (there's also a descendant of the character who craps his pants in MGS1… who also has chronic IBS). Despite the lack of returning faces, Snake Eater features arguably the strongest supporting cast in the series. Eva is a sleeper agent and one of Snake's only allies throughout the story, who is both fantastic in the undercover role with the enemy faction while also exposing just how socially inept Snake is when he completely misses 90% of her attempts at flirting. Meanwhile, Volgin is a ruthless villain that has all the pomp of Metal Gear Rising's Senator Armstrong years beforehand. The villain faction this time around is The Cobra Unit, who are a group of World War 2 heroes who represent the emotions they bring into battle. These include a guy who shoots bees at you, a spaceman, a ghost, and a 100+ year old sniper. Finally, there's Snake's mentor, The Boss. I won't give much away about her, but she is literally the most important character in Metal Gear Solid's 50+ year timeline and one of the greatest characters ever created by Hideo Kojima. Not only is Snake Eater back for the Snake Eater remake, but it's also been remade along with a new opening movie, with vocalist Cynthia Harrell still sounding incredible over 20 years later. Metal Gear Solid Delta's recommended specs are available on the game'sSteam store page. At a minimum, you'll get away with an RTX 2060 Super and i5-8600. While the recommended settings want you to have a RTX 3080 and i7-8700K. So, while not as monstrously demanding as some games, you'll still want a decent rig. Oh and an SSD is recommended too.

    "title": "Death Stranding 2: All the key details on the next game from Hideo Kojima",
    "article_text": "Your guide to understanding at least 10% of what's going on in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Almost six years after Norman Reedus first picked up that baby in a jar and chucked his urine at goop monsters, Hideo Kojima has returned with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While the studio is working on a horror game (OD) and not-Metal Gear (Physint), the follow-up to Kojima Productions’ debut game is the next to drop. I loved the original Death Stranding, but the sequel looks even more promising—an already ridiculous game made even sillier with giant ships, guitar-wielding cyborgs, and a ventriloquist dummy version of Turkish director Fatih Akin. Plus, for those who took issue with the original’s walking focus and (relative) lack of action, Death Stranding 2 looks to be way more action-packed. Death Stranding 2 will be released on June 26, 2025, for the PlayStation 5, with players who shell out for the deluxe edition getting it earlier on June 24, 2025. Death Stranding 2 costs $70 / £70 on PS5, with the Deluxe Edition bumping that up to $80 / £80. But that’s the non-canon release date as far as we're concerned here on PC Gamer. So when canweplay it? Unfortunately as of right now Death Stranding 2 doesn’t have a release date on PC. In fact, it isn’t even confirmed for PC yet. Kojima Productions and Sony aren't talking about a PC release right now, but that's not unusual. If it’s anything like the first game, we won’t be waiting too long for Death Stranding 2 on PC. Death Stranding released on PS4 on November 8, 2019, with the PC release arriving eight months later on July 14, 2020 (with the Director’s Cut coming six months after the PS5 release). So if there’s a similar exclusivity window this time around, then we can expect Death Stranding 2 to hit PC around February 2026. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kojima Productions now owns the IP, so it's possible we could be in for an even shorter wait this time around. Or a longer one, depending on the publishing deal it made with Sony—we're really just speculating, at this point. On the bright side, Sony games are generally cheaper when they eventually come to PC, with Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (which was also $70 / £70 on PS5) selling for $60 / £50. Death Stranding 2’s latest major trailer premiered at SXSW earlier this year and was further proof that Hideo Kojima is unmatched as the best trailer guy in the biz. This 10-minute epic shows off random vignettes of characters speaking dialogue that makes zero sense without context. Meanwhile, it shows off gameplay of Sam walking about and getting in scraps against some genuinely breathtaking environments. Not only is this trailer far more action packed than you’d expect from Death Stranding, but it also focuses heavily on the Solid Snake lookalike Neil, who seems to have a whole lot of stuff going on in his life. Plus we get a look at even more of the game’s supporting cast including the President, played by none other than Metal Gear Rising’s Senator Armstrong actor Alastair Duncan (best known for the Scottish detective show Taggart… oh, and Mimir from God of War, I guess.) As in the first game, Death Stranding 2 will have you walking about a post-apocalyptic world, delivering parcels, and dealing with the freaks and goo monsters you encounter along the way. This time around Sam Porter Bridges will be visiting other parts of the world, with the Australian outback and Mexico becoming part of the big network. While some have dubbed the game a ‘walking simulator’ (I mean, it literally is, but grow up), Death Stranding 2’s traversal seems to have been given a big boost thanks to these new locales, with the likes of sandstorms and earthquakes occurring in the world. Meanwhile, combat—which took a back seat in the original game—has been given a far higher priority. Kojima described this asan intentional decisionthis time, saying, \"the sequel balances the stick and the rope.” Which boils down to rope equals help, stick equals bonk (he based the saying on Kobo Abe's novella Rope, which had an excerpt opening the original game). There’s also set to be way more stealth this time, with Kojima claimingDeath Stranding 2 has so much tactical espionage action that even his own staff 'worried it was getting a little Metal Gear-ish.'As someone who has had to contend with his favourite series of all time being dead for the last 10 years, with only a remake to nourish me, this detail means the world to me. Despite the six-year wait and massive global pandemic we’ve contended with in the time since, Death Stranding 2 picks up 11 months after the original game ended. Sam is apparently living a peaceful life, as AI has automated the delivery process for the most part, but Fragile returns and gives him the classic ‘I gotta pull you out of retirement for one last job, kid’—to connect Mexico to the Chiral Network. The cast is composed of new and returning characters; Sam, Fragile, and Baby Lou all return alongside the original game’s villain Higgs who is now a weird-looking cyborg. Meanwhile, a cast of new faces like a mysterious young woman named Tomorrow, who seems to have some connection to Higgs and the power to control the goop; Tarman, who has the likeness of Mad Max director George Miller and an adorable tar cat; and Dollman—a sentient ventriloquist dummy. There’s also a cyborg samurai, which is totally different from a cyborg ninja, it ISN’T Metal Gear, we swear. Most interesting is the character of Neil, who featured heavily in one of the most recent trailers for the game. Neil—played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli—seems to be taking on a similar role as Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff from the first game… oh and the dude looks exactly like Solid Snake. Like, it’s not even subtle.Kojima even said five years agothat the actor would be “the spitting image of Solid Snake” if he wore a bandana. He’s hung up on his ex, and I can’t wait to see more of it. I'm sad to report that there’s no sign of Die-Hardman. Kojima Productions is currently selling a digital deluxe edition with new cosmetics and early item unlocks (because who doesn’t love when they make the game easier for you because you paid more?). The original game did have the Director’s Cut expansion alongside its PS5 release, but with no PS6 release imminent, it’s hard to say whether Death Stranding 2 will repeat that approach. I don’t know, man, probably. Yes. This has nothing to do with the sequel; I just wanted to remind everyone because it’s hilarious.

    "article_text": "Hi-Rez president Stewart Chisam said \"the timing was finally right\" for him to move on, while a handful of others are also being shown the door. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Less than six months after laying off an estimated 70 people,Smite 2developer Hi-Rez Studios has made another round of cuts. But this time, rather than rank-and-file employees, the layoffs are focused on \"senior management positions\" near the top of the company's food chain. The layoffs were first reported last week by former Hi-Rez designer ThorDG, whose message onXwas quickly shared to the Smite subreddit, where Smite executive producer Alex Cantatore weighed in to confirm \"a handful of layoffs in senior management positions\" last week. \"Stew [Hi-Rez president Stewart Chisam] is transitioning away from Hi-Rez as part of this,\" Cantatorewrote. \"Travis [executive producer Travis Brown] and Radar [lead producer Tony Jones] were also affected, as well as two folks in senior management on the Rally Here side of the business. I am very sad to be losing all of them. \"Essentially, the board's rationale was that the company had a lot of senior management in relation to our current size. This does not affect our core mission, or any other people working directly on Smite 2. We will continue to focus our efforts on improving the core game and new player experience, while adding more Gods at our current one-per-two-weeks pace.\" In a separate post onLinkedIn, Chisam confirmed that he's leaving Hi-Rez, writing that his departure \"has been discussed for a long time [with Hi-Rez CEO Erez Goren], but the timing was finally right.\" \"The last few years have been difficult for Hi-Rez, and for the industry,\" Chisam wrote. \"Certainly not everything has worked out as we hoped, but I think we also have left a unique footprint on the industry—and tried to carve out a space as a mid-size cross-platform games-as-a-service pioneer, relentlessly fighting against giants. The team that remains is absolutely incredible and I know they will enjoy success. The effort and passion they have for the players and for the Smite IP is unmatched.\" Jones also confirmed onLinkedInthat he's leaving Hi-Rez \"as part of some recent restructuring.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The past couple years, as Chisam said, have not been very good to Hi-Rez.

    "title": "Slay the Spire 2: all the key details on the beloved deckbuilder’s sequel",
    "article_text": "Here’s everything that’s on the cards for Slay the Spire 2. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Slay the Spire 2 is on its way in 2025, marking both the return of the king of roguelike deckbuilders and the definitive end to your free time. I’m so sorry.After entering early access in 2017, Slay the Spire landed itself a reputation as something of an indie masterpiece, and in the process managed to kick off a trend that the Steam store still hasn’t fully recovered from. While deckbuilding roguelikes continue to have their day in the sun thanks to gems likeBalatro, it’s about time we return to the game that sparked so many folks’ love affair with the genre.To prepare you to take on the spire once again, I’ve collected everything about the game we know so far. From information on its release date, to its story and characters, to new mechanics, here’s all the key details on Slay the Spire 2. Slay the Spire 2 is set to enter early access on PC, Mac, and Linux in 2025. There isn’t an exact release date set yet. At the very least we can rule out anytime in December, as Mega Crit’s Casey Yanoclaimsthe month “kinda sucks for releasing games.” Though that really just sounds like a ploy to get me to spend time with my loved ones during the holidays instead of refining my Necrobinder build…The first Slay the Spire game spent almost a year and a half in early access before its 1.0 version dropped in 2019. We don't know how long Slay the Spire 2 will be in early access for. As it’s a sequel, it’d make sense that Slay the Spire 2 wouldn’t need as much tweaking pre-launch. “It’s just the same game but bigger and better, how long could that even take?”, you might ask. Well, it’s more complicated than that.The knowledge devs gained from Slay the Spire’s lengthy early access period should help reduce growing pains for the sequel. However, we’ve already seen some pretty major changes to Slay the Spire's design that’ll probably benefit from continual re-balancing. What’s more, the game’s development moved to the Godot Engine afterUnity’s runtime fee debacle; it really wouldn’t be all that surprising to see that migration to a new engine result in extra work for the developers. Slay the Spire is one of those rare games I feel compelled to own on every platform. The active modding community makes Slay the Spire on PC one of the best choices but it’s a nice perk to be able to enjoy a run or two no matter what device you’re on.Unfortunately for folks like me, there’s no word yet on when Slay the Spire 2 will come to consoles like Xbox X|S, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, nor do we know if Slay the Spire 2 will hit iOS or Android. Judging on the release schedule of the previous game, Slay the Spire 2 will likely have ports on all major consoles within a year of its 1.0 release. Our first official glimpse of Slay the Spire 2 came early last year in the form of its reveal trailer. The Merchant, the Ironclad, and the Silent made appearances, all looking suitably dramatic and battle-ready. Though we also got our first look at the Necrobinder, who really puts the ‘slay’ in Slay the Spire with just themostridiculously sassy entrance. Revealed as part of The Game Awards in December 2024, Slay the Spire 2’s gameplay trailer proved that the sequel would largely follow their established formula for greatness. One major change is the lineup of playable characters. The Necrobinder and ‘??????’ are introduced, but it seems like the Defect and the Watcher won’t join them.A frame at around1:10shows what looks like the Defect, except their face appears embedded in vines, corroded, and swarmed by tiny flies. So, I’m not exactly holding onto the hope I’ll be able to take on the spire with my favourite automaton, at least initially.

So, I’m not exactly holding onto the hope I’ll be able to take on the spire with my favourite automaton, at least initially. Slay the Spire 2 sees players return to a malevolent, living tower known as the Spire 1,000 years after the events of the first game. Once again you’ll have to fight through a procedurally-generated map of monsters using your ever-growing deck of cards.Boththe Silentandthe Ironcladwill appear as playable characters again, albeit with some updates to their powers, skills, and attacks. Alongside them we’ll have two new characters to choose from.One of the new characters in Slay the Spire 2 isthe Necrobinder. We haven’t received too clear a picture of this lich’s playstyle yet beyond the skeletal hand, Osty, that fights alongside her. Osty boasts its own health total and deals damage to enemies separately to the Necrobinder’s attacks. With only 35 base health, the Necrobinder could certainly use the support. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Thefourth player character— known only as‘??????’—is a mysterious customer with a regal air and uhh… no face. We really don’t know much about this character yet (we don’t even know their proper name) but their appearance has inspired some interesting theories already. The diamond motif of this character’s design is reminiscent of the Transient monster from Slay the Spire’s third act. This could hint at them sporting a similar fighting style to the Transient: heavy hitting but limited to a set number of turns per encounter. I’m sure you’re familiar with the Merchant, the shopkeeper that supplies you with cards, potions, and relics throughout your run. He’s a bit of a fan favorite, afterall. While this industrious dude is willing to part with most things for the right price, he goes through great effort to remind you that you cannot, under any circumstances, buy his mat.The Merchant is set to return in Slay the Spire 2, but it seems like he’s hard-up for gold after a thousand years without any adventurers to tout his wares to. Why else would he remove the ‘NOT FOR SALE’ tag on his beloved rug? The Merchant’s mat has always beenforbidden fruitfor Slay the Spire players but if taking it from him means he has to sit his blue butt on the dungeon floor, that just might be too cold-blooded for me. Slay the Spire 2 won’t deviate too sharply from the gameplay of the original because you know, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. However, Mega Crit’s monthly ‘Neowsletter’has been delivering drips and drops of key changes that’ll appear in the sequel. Here are some new mechanics we know about so far:Afflictions Slay the Spire 2’s devs have turned up the sadism-o-meter by allowing enemies to afflict your cards with negative effects. For example, one type of Affliction makes it so that you lose one energy everytime you play the affected card. Yep, I can already tell this is going to hurt.Quests When you first pick up a Quest card, it’s an unplayable card that clogs up your deck like a Curse and Status. Don’t rush to get rid of it, though. Once you fulfil a particular task outlined on by the card, your hard work will be rewarded.Enchantments Enchantments are new ways to modify cards in your deck. Each one is a kind of ‘monkey’s paw’ deal that will help you in one way in exchange for hurting you in another. An example we’ve seen so far is Corrupted, which makes an attack deal 50% more damage but costs you 3 HP each time.

The layoffs first came to light on theRuneScape subreddit, where users noticed that a number of moderators had seemingly disappeared. RuneScape Mod Hoolicommented on the threadto say that there had indeed been a restructuring at Jagex, which included job cuts. Hooli said the majority of the layoffs were \"from non-game dev and non-player facing areas,\" and that the studio's plans for RuneScape remained unchanged: \"Our Roadmap won't change because of these job reductions, and we'll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content.\" Jagex confirmed the layoffs in a statement provided to PC Gamer. \"As part of our strategy to build the best experiences for players and grow the RuneScape community, we have proposed changes to our operational structure,\" a Jagex spokesperson said. \"These adjustments are designed to reduce complexity, increase agility, and ensure we are fully focused on the areas that matter most—our games, our players, and our future. \"The vast majority of proposed role reductions are within non-game development and non-player-facing functions, such as operations and administrative support. Our intention is to protect and strengthen the teams directly responsible for delivering value to players. We recognize that any change of this nature is difficult, and we are committed to supporting all impacted employees throughout the transition.\" Jagex declined to say how many people will be put out of work as a result of the cuts, but noted that the majority of the cuts will not impact \"frontline development or player-facing teams.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "This Russian fishing sim is bizarrely popular on Steam but players hate the monetisation, and to be fair it has a $2000 microtransaction",
    "article_text": "It's no Get Bass, but then what is. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I hadn't heard of Russian Fishing 4 until PCG's Wes Fenlon noticed it was weirdly popular on Steam. The game's been available since 2018,launching on Steam in November 2021, and since then it's steadily built a considerable audience over time: per SteamDB's three year charts, it was pulling in around 7,000 concurrent players after launch, and three years later averages just over 20,000 concurrent players every day. There are currently 21,500 people playing Russian Fishing 4, and nine days ago it hit its all-time peak of 25,352 players. Bear in mind it's also available directly from the developer, so Steam's only a portion of the playerbase, and we're talking about one very popular fishing game. The obvious question is why, and one straightforward and boring answer is that, with some very big caveats, Russian Fishing 4 is a pretty great fishing simulation. I downloaded it on Steam this morning and played through the tutorial before going for a spot of proper fishing, and the game has a lovely peaceful atmosphere, relatively straightforward mechanics, and for the most part looks great. One especially nice touch is that, while you're fishing away, other players' catches pop up in realtime in the lower left of the screen. This does inspire some angling envy, but it's a nice distraction while you're waiting for a bite. I have to say that I did only seem to catch carp and roaches, but that may just be because I'm fishing at a low level. And here comes the big caveat, and one of the reasons Russian Fishing 4 and its community is quite interesting: this is one of those free-to-play games that seriously tries to nickel-and-dime you. The pace of progression here is monotonously slow, and the grind is absolutely brutal. You sell the fish you catch to (eventually) afford better equipment to catch bigger fish, and level up at a snail's pace (which is annoying because you can't visit certain spots in the game to fish unless you're a particular level). The actual fishing is fun: the gameplay loop built around it is why \"free-to-play\" makes so many players groan. But naturally help is at hand. Russian Fishing 4 is monetised by aPremium membership tier, which basically makes the game work properly. Among other things, Premium grants a 100% bonus to experience with every fish caught, increases the chance of your crafting and fishing skills improving, and unlocks a bunch of other basic functionality that makes the game much more pleasant to play. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Appropriately enough, there's a catch. Premium membership is pretty expensive: three days of it will set you back $3.50, while a month is $15. I was also amazed that the options kept getting larger and larger. 90 days for $40? OK. 360 days for $130? You do you. But then you see the \"lifetime subscription\" and Russian Fishing 4 just straight-up asks for $2,000. Two grand! I wonder if it'll carry over to Russian Fishing 5 (answer: nyet). This side of Russian Fishing 4 is why, despite being a good fishing sim and clearly attracting a lot of would-be anglers, the Steam reviews sit firmly on \"mixed\" and there's two through-lines to nearly all the negative ones. They're either about the ponderous grind and overbearing monetisation, or they're from Chinese players. I don't know why, but recently Chinese players seem to have taken against Russian Fishing 4 in a big way. The reasons that their reviews give are slightly mixed, but it's a cocktail of being banned for cheating (erroneously, they claim), an apparent lack of fish, and that old favourite, \"greedy devs.\" \"To this day I don't understand what the cheating programme is, and he never explained it when I consulted the official, he was very arrogant,\"writes Mage(via machine translation). \"If you want to play this game, please keep your computer like a newborn, do not try any uncommon programmes. This is the first time in my gaming career that I have been banned, thank you for all the nagging.\" \"I thought it was interesting at first, but now I think this game is a complete waste of my time,\"says QMX(via machine translation). \"Are there any fish in this lake? I stand there all day and never catch any fish. The missions are disgusting and pure torture.\" Finally,, I had to include this review from a Russian comrade, because it just made me wonder what on Earth happened while they were playing: \"After this shit,\"says Sanyapyts, \"friends become bastards.\" Russian Fishing 4 is an odd contemporary phenomenon. There's no doubt it's a good game, and many of the positive reviews reckon it's the best fishing sim on the market even with the monetisation. But that monetisation is so poorly implemented from the player perspective that it does seem to ultimately turn people off, and make them resent the game: it's really notable how many of the negative reviews have several hundred hours on record. Not that this is likely to bother the developers too much: Russian Fishing 4 is clearly a big success and, even seven years after release, it is continuing to attract and hold the attention of a huge audience. I probably won't return to it—more of a Get Bass man—but there are plenty who do. And hey, if the monetisation bothers you that much? Just check down the side of the couch for a spare two grand.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign Night Aspect boss guide: How to beat Heolstor the Nightlord",
    "article_text": "Topple Heolstor the Nightlord in Night Aspect to crown yourself the victor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. So you've made it this far: you've defeated four Nightlords, and now you're ready fortheNightlord in theNight Aspectexpedition. It should be no surprise, but as the final challenge inElden Ring Nightreign, working outhow to beat Heolstor the Nightlordis a significant hurdle to overcome. A the last of theNightreign bosses, Heolstor is one of the coolest baddiesFromSoftwarehas made yet. When you win, you'll be treated to—surprise!—an incredibly vague and confusing final cutscene, which I won't explain here because of spoilers. No, it's not because I didn't understand it either. You'll also unlock newNightreign skins—the incredibleDark Souls outfits—so it's worth the pain. If you want the full story, then you'll need to complete theElden Ring Nightreign Remembrancesfor each character, which also requires you beat Night Aspect multiple times for alternate endings. You better get studying… He may be the final boss, but your work starts as soon as you enter the expedition, all the same, and boy, do you have your work cut out for you. As always, take thebest rune farming routeand hunt forlegendary weaponsto get more powerful, but keep an eye out for the following specific things to prepare for Heolstor in the Night Lord expedition: While Heolstor is incredibly tanky, look on the bright side, at least he's weak to holy damage. In my experience, holy is one of the most common damage types, second only to fire. Keep in mind that you can also get a starting armament that deals holy using the right relic, so check if you have one. You won't be able to upgrade it to the highest quality without theShifting Earth: Craterevent, but it's still a good failsafe, and you can grab a Smithing Stone 1 and 2 to buff it most of the way. Scarlet rot damage is also strong against Heolstor, though it's much harder to come by. While you can find a few by looking in the usual spots, you're much more likely to get a scarlet rot weapon from the Shifting Earth: Rotting Woods event. The event is easy enough to complete—head to the marked fort then to another marker in the woods to collect the item—but you can't guarantee the event will be active in your run. Nevertheless, with Heolstor oddly being resistant to the likes of poison, bleed, and frostbite, scarlet rot is your best bet. Heolstor packs one hell of a punch, so resistance to physical and magical attacks goes a long way in staying alive. During his final phase, Heolstor also gains powers from other Nightlords, so he can deal other damage types likeEquilibrious Beast Libra's madness,Gaping Jaw Adel's lightning, or Darkdrift Knight Fulghor's holy damage. You can't predict what affinity damage type he'll gain, so it's best to take physical reduction for his basic attacks, though any affinity bonuses from relics are a nice extra just in case. As one of the biggest challenges in Nightreign, I recommend getting as close to level 15 as possible to give you the best odds. Taking relics with increased rune acquisition will help with this. Plus, fighting Heolstor is very much a war of attrition, so you should max out your flask charges by visiting churches. While a boss likeMaris in the Augur expeditiondemands a ranged playstyle thanks to their rapid movements, Heolstor is significantly slower but demands precision. Naturally, you'll need to adapt your approach andteam compositionto handle this: With your team assembled, it's time to enter the ring with the Night Aspect, which is where the real challenge begins. Here's how to beat Heolstor: Heolstor is slow by Nightreign standards, but he packs a punch and swaps targets rather erratically, making him a very hard boss to fight. He also has three phases and can borrow the affinity attacks of other Nightlords, so you've got a lot to keep track of. Outside of a few key attacks, Heolstor generally attacks with slow, heavy sword swings, dashes, and bashes, which you'll need to dodge like any other attack (either towards it or to the side, depending on his direction of attack). Otherwise, here's what you need to look out for: The Night Aspect boss fight actually begins with a quick scrap against The Shape of Night before it turns into Heolstor, the Nightlord. While The Shape of Night still packs a punch, it only uses Heolstor's basic attack combo, which is easy enough to avoid. Save all your flasks, resources, and ultimates for phases two and three, when the fighting gets serious. One of Heolstor's most annoying traits is his near-constant attacks that keep you on the back foot, even though they have slow wind-ups. However, Raider's innate high stagger and ultimate abilities like Wylder's Onslaught Stake and Ironeye's Single Shot can stun him surprisingly fast. This gives you a brief window to get in a few attacks uncontested. Duchess' Restage ability comes in clutch here for stronger burst damage, especially if used right after stunning Heolstor with ultimates. Remember that applying enough holy damage can also stagger the boss. Another problem with Heolstor's aggression is that it's almost impossible to revive a downed ally by whacking them once they've gone beyond one bar. It simply takes too long and eats into your stamina, which you'll need to run and dodge too. Make smart use of ultimates like Revenant, Ironeye, Wylder, Guardian, or Duchess to quickly revive downed allies and get them back in the fight.

    "title": "Elden Ring: Nightreign bucks the extraction trend, but it would have been a better game if it hadn't",
    "article_text": "Escaping from Limveld with our loot might have helped mitigate Nightreign's frustrating randomisation and pointless events. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're almost at the bottom of the volcano. After descending into the fiery depths, fighting through waves of Fire Prelates, Finger Creepers, and Flame Chariots, the ancient altar is finally in sight, promising us the ability to forge our own legendary weapons. Just as we approach the special smithing table, a Magma Wyrm bursts from the ash—one last fight against the clock to secure our prize. After a lengthy battle, I approach the anvil and forge my first unique legendary weapon. Then I remember I'm not going to get to keep it. In fact, I'll only have it for the next 10 minutes. It's a disappointing realisation that, rather than this dramatic descent into the volcano becoming a memory or an accomplishment (like defeating a hard boss inElden Ring), if I want to forge another legendary weapon I have to run this event again, and again,and again. Elden Ring Nightreignhas a problem with repetition. After you've played the game for a while, you start to realise that every run is just waiting for the stars to align; for RNG to favour you with the right map composition, the right passives, and the right landmarks so you can acquire a weapon that targets a Nightlord's weakness. And while that's happening, you do the same things over and over—you acquire flasks from churches, bum rush as many bosses as you can, grab smithing stones—as many have joked, it really is the longest boss run-up inFromSoftwarehistory. Both RNG and repetition are key parts of the roguelike genre, but I feel like the hallmark of a good roguelike is that it's generally possible to create a winning build if you're smart with what you grab, and that's simply not the case in Nightreign. After a while, you'll come to know the few passives and affixes that favour your Nightfarer and you'll grab them every run if you can. In Nightreign, there's very little middle ground; you're either thriving, or making do with unsuitable garbage. Admittedly, you can prepare for a Nightlord's weakness with the relics you equip at the start of an expedition, but acquiring them is also down to RNG, and their ability to mitigate a run's randomisation is limited. I feel like the most damning indictment of the Nightlord weakness system is beating the final boss and getting a relic that lets you change affinity simply by swapping weapons. \"You beat the game! Now you don't have to engage with this annoying system anymore.\" Thanks I guess, but why was it in the game to begin with if all it does is hobble inventive buildcrafting? I can't help but imagine a version of Nightreign where randomisation isn't the be-all and end-all I can't help but imagine a version of Nightreign where randomisation isn't the be-all and end-all, where we actually get to extract and keep some of our loot, and so prepare more thoroughly for harder expeditions while taking on the risk of losing gear. The key word here is \"extract\", as in, I genuinely think Nightreign should have had more extraction elements in the vein ofDark and Darker's PvE mode. The rags to riches extraction shooter journey of dropping in with nothing and returning with powerful gear would have fit Nightreign perfectly. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At the very least, it would've made its Shifting Earth events far less pointless. Currently completing them rewards you with temporary buffs that mostly never fit the Nightlord you're actually fighting, with the exception ofThe Craterand Noklateo. In extraction Nightreign, they could have rewarded something more powerful that you take away with you. It would've made them feel significant and occasional, and less like a pointless area of the map you simply avoid most of the time. Extraction games also let you choose what challenges you tackle, and so too, your level of reward. Imagine a Nightreign where, rather than rinsing the map for bosses every single run, there were different activities requiring different levels of preparedness. You could choose how deep to go and work towards tackling harder events over multiple runs. Maybe the game could even let you earn the ability to extract before the Nightlord boss, giving you a bit more freedom if you wanted to focus on a Shifting Earth event instead.

There's definitely a version of Nightreign that could've existed where every expedition was a microcosm of that experience. In a run-based game like this, the extraction formula would've been the perfect way to facilitate it, starting with nothing and building from the ground up based on what you find. Extracting gear would also have helped us have a bit more say in buildcrafting outside of catering to Nightlord weaknesses or being beholden to each expedition's RNG—something that would be balanced by losing said equipment if you failed. Nightreign could've even had PvP in some form, considering the game already has Nightfarer invaders who drop their gear if you kill them. The only caveat is that I think Nightreign would have to be harder for extraction to work, with other challenging objectives to work towards besides Nightlords. The boss weakness system would also have to be scrapped (so you couldn't stockpile weapons with their weakness), but honestly, I think that system really emphasises the issue with the game's randomisation and isterriblefrom a roguelike buildcrafting perspective. I do enjoy Nightreign, in spite of its identity crisis, but the most frustrating thing as a From fan is that it feels like its position as a side-job multiplayer experiment vs. a mainline game has negatively impacted its development. It's so close to being a significantly better game than it is, but scope is the only answer I can find as to why it isn't.

    "article_text": "Also vanquish your foes or something, I think. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When I approach a videogame, all I'm looking for is one thing: the ability to construct a small hamlet. This is why I still, in stray moments, catch myself reflecting with a wistful sigh on my time rebuilding Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed 2 or that one village you build in Breath of the Wild. This is it; this is what it'sall about, man. So my eyes quite naturally bulged out of my head when I saw what looks alarmingly like someone rebuilding a village in the trailer for upcoming tactical RPG Never's End, coming from a gaggle of devs whose previous work includes stuff like Destiny, Triangle Strategy, Octopath Traveller, Enter the Gungeon, and Gang Beasts. If you're one of the apparently innumerable people who never got over Final Fantasy Tactics (fair play, really), you might want to keep an eye on this one. You're taking turns, you're moving on a grid, you're customising the make-up of your party, and then you're pitting little chibi people against skeletons and ghouls in a winner-takes-all battle to the death. The gimmick here looks to be that your little guys can mix and match the forces of nature to do unpleasant things to their foes. As a \"reincarnated, immortal warrior forged from living metal, able to harness the elements and bend them to your will\" you can do things like shuffle heat about the map to create gusts of wind and knock enemies about, drain heat to freeze them, create water currents, and reshape terrain using your command of stone. Which I guess falls under the rubric of 'Earth,' so fine, I'll let you have this one, Never's End. I'm into it. The possibilities that come from permanently altering the make-up of a map by mucking about with the elements put me in mind of Larian games at their wackiest and most chaotic. Plus, there's that hamlet building. \"Upgrade towns, temples, and other locations to build businesses, establish trade routes, and recruit new companions to your cause,\" reads the blurb, and I'm afraid that lights up all the lizard regions of my brain like a solar flare. I simply love doing logistics, and even better if by doing logistics I can progressively make a village look cooler.

    "title": "The Witcher 4's leafy glory is all down to Epic's Nanite Foliage, and largely so is the fact it can run ray-traced at 60 fps on a lowly PS5",
    "article_text": "That level of performance on an aging console suggests good things for the PC version. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As the opener to an annual tech event, it's pretty hard to beat showing off what The Witcher 4 will look and run like in actual gameplay, but that's exactly what Epic andCD ProjektRed did for the former's keynote speech, State of Unreal 2025. We all knew it was coming, of course, but sitting in a crowd of developers, creators, and journalists in Orlando, eardrums being blasted away with surround sound Ciri, it was clear that everyone wanted to be absolutely wowed at what The Witcher 4's developers had in store for us. The thing is, we kind of knew that too, because rather than use its own RED Engine, CDPR switched had already announced its move to Unreal Engine 5 for The Witcher 4. So I didn't think there wouldn't be anything thatnewto really show off. And, to a certain degree, that was very much the case, but there was one standout technological improvement Epic will eventually be bringing out with Unreal Engine 5.7, and one thing that looks to be making The Witcher 4's environment so dense, lush, and detailed, and it's Nanite Foliage. The first iteration of Epic's Nanite tech (a virtualised geometry engine) was for improving the surfaces of rocks, walls, and other large objects, and now it's all about leaves. Lots and lots of leaves. What Epic and CDPR demonstrated with The Witcher 4 showed that Nanite Foliage is going to be a much more popular system. That's because it use voxels—instead of rasterized triangles, for handling leaves, needles, branches, etc—when the camera moves away, to a point where you can't tell that what was a highly detailed tree is now just a haze of blobs. The voxels still get lit as part of Lumen and all generate real-time shadows, and the overall look is very convincing. At one point in the CDPR tech demo, the camera swoops down and rushes through a dense forest: at no point do you see any stuttering or lag or obvious LOD changes, just a seamless rush through countless trees. Naturally, because it's all done using Nanite, the overall landscape, ground, lakes, rivers, and so on is just as fast and smooth. Letting the side down somewhat is the shadowing, as there are clear moments in the demo where shadows cast by trees and other objects popped into view, as the camera hurtled about. That might all be improved by the time The Witcher 4 is released, of course, but it might also just be a limitation of the fact that a standard PS5 was being used to run the demo. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Just a standard PlayStation 5, not a Pro, running the tech demo at a solid 60 fps with ray tracing. Given that the\"main goal\" for UE 5.6 is performance not necessarily pretties, that's pretty pleasing. With the next chapter in the Witcher games aiming to be ray-traced and running at 60 fps on that particular platform, it bodes well for what the PC version might be capable of. That said, we thought about Cyberpunk 2077 and looked how that turned out. In fairness, the CP2077 one can play now is vastly superior to the game's original launch state, but perhaps with CDPR choosing UE5 for The Witcher 4, the developers will be able to focus far more on content, assets, gameplay, and optimisation, rather than just having to get the damned thing to work in the first place. Anyway, the breakdown of what Epic's Nanite Foliage system will do garnered the biggest audience reaction of the whole Witcher tech demo, which could possibly mean that we'll see more open-world games in the future sporting truly epic scales of vegetation and all things nature-wise.

    "article_text": "The new game from Surgent Studios will be out later this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just over a year after the release of its debut gameTales of Kenzera: Zau, Surgent Studios has unveiled its next project, and I don't know what I expected but it definitely wasn't this. Dead Take is a first-person psychological horror game the studio says \"will peel back the entertainment industry’s glittering facade to expose its darkest secrets.\" Dead Take puts players in the shoes of an actor in search of their friend, who was last seen at a \"dark, opulent mansion,\" apparently the site of a glamorous party held by a powerful executive—but that's now gone oddly quiet. You'll solve \"object-based puzzles\" as you make your way from the mansion's gate to the theater deep inside, discovering and splicing together video clips along the way to discover the truth of what happened within the now-silent walls. Shades ofThe 7thGuest, perhaps, but Dead Take's more grounded promise of \"a haunting singleplayer story shaped by real experiences in the entertainment industry\" has the potential to be an even grimmer journey into awfulness. \"Discover a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers, full of cruelty and sordid gossip, memories of roles gone wrong, unsettling audition tapes and shadowy figures with the power to make or break your career,\" theSteam pagesays. \"Make your way through opulent and meticulously hand-crafted 3D rooms, full of tools and props inspired by real-world film sets, accompanied by composer Ross Tregenza's chilling original score.\" (Tregenza'sprevious credits, by the way, include Wolfenstein: Youngblood, Cyberpunk 2077, Deathloop, Helldivers 2, and Deathsprint 66, so that seems pretty solid.) Surgent said Dead Take will feature \"an impressive lineup of actors\" who will be announced in the coming weeks. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We're being secretive for a reason,\" Surgent Studios founder and CEO Abubakar Salim said. \"The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'.\" Dead Take is also notable for another reason: It was actually first revealed in January, without a title, as the first partnership forPalworld developer Pocketpair's new publishing arm. Salim said at the time that his studio's new game \"will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say.\" Dead Take is expected to be out later in 2025, and is up for wishlisting nowon Steam. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls Online's subclassing feature shakes up the meta in its newest update, Seasons of the Worm Cult, as the devs set their sights on harder difficulties: 'It's in the works'",
    "article_text": "10 years on, and things are changing for The Elder Scrolls Online. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Elder Scrolls Onlinejust had a huge patch drop yesterday—titled Seasons of the Worm Cult, this new update marks the start of a few key changes to the MMO, alongside a nice helping of content for current or returning players to sink their newly subclassed mitts into. Subclassing, which I had a look at earlier this year, is by far the biggest shake-up the game's getting—unlocked once you get any character to level 50, this feature'll let you mix and match \"skill lines\" from various classes to your heart's content. Well, kinda—there are a few limitations. Firstly, you need to keep at least one skill line from your \"main\" class—the one you started the character with. Secondly, you can't pick more than one skill line from a single class that isn't yours. Lastly, they take a little longer to level up and cost more skill points to grab abilities from. Other than that, it's a cool and madcap new way to build out your character—and it's free for all players at the point of entry. While I'm sure flavours of the month will roll in and out, for those who don't care much about sweaty optimisation, it's a huge boost to players' ability to diversify their build. The update also throws open the doors to the island of Solstice, where the next chapter of itsmore seasonal story structure'llbe taking place. Solstice is a sun-baked, mediterranean-style island currently split in two by The Writhing Wall, a barrier of souls that the playerbase'll be kicking down as the story advances. In terms of how this place looks, it's a blend of Altmer and Argonian culture—necromantic Altmer exiles came, booted the Argonians out, they had a war about it, and now they're (mostly) chill with each other. What seems interesting, as I digitally attend a presentation by zone lead Jason Barnes and systems designer Carrie Day, is the team's dedication to making carry-over choices from the game's base storyline (which Seasons of the Worm Cult is returning to after a decade) matter. \"It's a way for us to honour the legacy of our long-term players,\" Barnes states, deeply enthused about the prospect of putting a little more RPG back in the game's MMO. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Barnes also says during a Q&A session that—alongside some other quality of life features coming to ESO promised earlier in the year—the team's looking into letting players adjust the game's difficulty in some way: \"There are ongoing plans for that, it's in the works,\" Barnes explains, though the team isn't \"ready to talk about it yet.\" Still, he adds that \"it is something we're looking at, and there's people working on it.\" I haven't picked up ESO in a little while, but I'm experienced enough with MMOs to know that difficulty discourse is a constant and enduring challenge—when a game's survival depends on appealing to the most people possible, providing a set of challenges that caters to everybody is downright unfathomable. Slide too far in one direction, and you get a game that bores its longtime fans to tears. Slide too far in the other, and, well,you get Wildstar. I'll be keen to see how The Elder Scrolls Online tackles the eternal question—or, from what it sounds like, lets players make that choice for themselves.

    "title": "'In a very interesting way, it actually reduces the work': Destiny 2's director explains why reinventing the wheel with The Edge of Fate was actually the easier option",
    "article_text": "Tyson Green talks about being 'the fun police', creating meaningful rewards for solo players, and making a love letter to Super Metroid. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's hard to think of a time in the decade since Destiny launched when the next expansion wasn't make or break. As the first major release since last year's The Final Shape, which did the improbable job of landing the game's sprawling narrative successfully, this year's The Edge of Fate expansion has the unenviable job of kickstarting awhole new saga. It also has to reverse historically low player counts and introduce a raft of major systemic changes at a time when morale at Bungie isreportedly bleakin the wake of theMarathon plagiarismdebacle. Looking for more on Destiny 2's new expansion? We'veplayed a bunch of missions on the new location of Kepler, and seenThe Edge of Fate's new exotic weapons and armor. A couple of weeks ago I travelled to Bungie's Bellevue, Washington studio to play The Edge of Fate and speak with some of the most senior developers on the team. You can read our hands-on impressions, and check out six of thenew exotic itemscoming in the expansion—one of which has already had to be nerfed twice. Below you'll find the entirety of my conversation with Tyson Green, Destiny 2's game director, and Robbie Stevens, assistant game director. We touched on a wide range of topics, from why Green hates having to be 'the fun police', to the lack of vault space going into a major loot system shake up, Super Metroid as a major influence of The Edge of Fate and even whether we'll ever get akimbo weapons. Tim Clark, PC Gamer: Edge of Fate brings a raft of big systemic and quality of life changes. Do you think that's going to be enough in a world where you're looking to bring people back post-Final Shape, and where player concurrency is lower than I'm sure you'd like it? Tyson Green:We've seen that when we have a release that is a compelling mix of campaign and story, but also [has] free systemic changes… then players take them together as a full product. The best example of this was Witch Queen, which was a great release, and came along with a set of free subclass updates—void 3.0—and players really embraced those as a cohesive product, even though void 3.0 was free to all players. So we think that making the core game of Destiny stronger is a tide that raises all boats. It makes for a better expansion experience, and a better free experience. So I think that's there's strength in the model that we're trying to move into now. But without any major addition to the existing subclasses or a new damage element, don't you worry that the buildcrafting side of things may stagnate? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Tyson Green:One of the big changes in Edge of Fate for people who are into buildcrafting is the armor set bonuses. They are very punchy, almost exotic-level, build enablers. My favorite one that I was playing with recently is the set bonus that makes your kinetic weapons break shields more easily, and then does disruptive explosions when you either break a shield or take down a powerful combatant. I was like: 'Oh my god, I need to figure out which kinetic weapon do I want to use to get into this space?' So we're going to be able to explore more and more with new armor sets, and really make them an active part of your build in ways that [armor] hasn't been to date, because [legendary gear] lacked that element of build craft contribution. They've also suffered because of the way the stats used to work. Since taking over as game director in early 2024, Green has kept a relatively low profile compared to his predecessors, preferring to communicate with the player base in the form of occasionalblog posts. The veteran developer has worked at Bungie for over two and half decades, with credits ranging from Myth 2, through all the studio's Halo games, up to the present day on Destiny 2. Robbie Stevens:So much of the core foundation is changing with stats on armor. The buildcraft space is expanding in a way that is going to provide a bunch of different opportunities, and [these stats] do directly affect abilities, as well. We've got to provide more opportunity to make the actual loot chase of armor and weapons feel better, and make it more fun with the gear tiering systems. As with changes like the 3.0 subclasses, we know that in the future we're going to do updates. It's just that this first go around is a larger change to more of the game. Can you tell me what you might be prioritizing in terms of future changes? The Darkness subclass each only having one super ability seems like an obvious gap to fill. Green:Yeah, the dark subclasses having a smaller selection of gameplans is definitely something that's on the team's radar. As far as prioritization goes, a thing that we're looking at in upcoming releases is a lot of streamlining and usability—like, getting more of the subclass content into players' hands in a systemic, sustainable fashion. But we're never going to be done with the subclasses. We don't stop development on them. We look at them as opportunities arise and as the team has the ability to add to them. Stevens has been with Bungie since 2015. Prior to becoming assistant director on Destiny 2, he's been the creative lead for the game's seasons. Before joining Bungie, he worked as a lead designer on The Elder Scrolls Online, and a world designer for Star Wars: The Old Republic. It's this problem that we haven't been able to shake. Storage may be cheap on the server, but it's not cheap on the client. An obvious question, given you're bringing in entirely new types of weapons and armor, is why we're not getting any extra vault space? It seems like such an obvious pressure point. I know that Bungie has said changes are coming in a future expansion, but could we not have had 100 slots as a Band Aid? Green:This is one where we understand the pressure. It's this development problem that we haven't been able to shake with Destiny. That storage space may be cheap on the server, but it's not cheap on the client, and that's unfortunately the problem that we run into. So we have to figure out a solution for this. And we're working on this one because we know that adding a bunch of armor sets, and tiers of weapons, into the game is going to create a lot more keepsakes—things that people want available for their build crafting options in the future. So we're definitely aware of this one, and we're working on solutions. You've mentioned the desire to streamline the experience of playing Destiny 2 with the addition of The Portal, but I find that goal slightly incongruous with being able to customise those activities with 100 modifiers. Green:I mean, we definitely share that concern. If you look at a screenshot of the challenge customization screen right now, you can actually hear your brain melt. It's like that meme of someoneexplaining a card game. Green:Yeah, I just want to play, right? The way that you're actually going to experience that on day one of Edge of Fate is that the game's going to bring you in and give you quickplay options. You have to put in the time and effort to get to the point where you can earn some of this stuff. Stevens:There are actually a couple of tutorials and training modes that we added… [The Portal] is such a big change from what we're doing now, right? Today, if you want to get some of the better loot, you always have to step into Expert or Pinnacle stuff. We're not saying we're making it really easy to get this loot. We're saying you have to put in the time and effort to get to the point where you can earn some of this stuff. And if you want to be the most efficient at earning the best stuff, and earning it all the time, you're going to have to be taking on a higher level of challenge constantly. Do people really want that degree of challenge customizability? You've swung at this a few times before, like with Nightfall scoring, and it's never stuck. Why do you think this version is the one? Green:Well, the interesting thing about the Nightfall challenge card that I actually had a hand in driving that. We just totally underestimated how good our players are. They basically just bowled that thing over! It was barely a speed bump, and then we weren't in a position to [update] it, because it only affected one tiny slice of our content, and it wasn't even paid off with good rewards. So, this time around, we're really saying: 'Hey, you can go pretty deep and pretty far with this customization if you want.' The challenges themselves are actual gameplay challenges. It's not just grabbing the damage number dials and turning it up. Stevens:[The challenges] will change the behavior of an enemy, or it'll change how you might use some of your abilities, right? It's things that you can actually react to and understand—that has been a goal for us. Green:The gear tiering system actually gives us that depth of pursuit in a broad range of activities. On the development side, we very often had this problem of wanting to add a cool challenge, which everyone was excited about, but… what's the reward going to be? If we don't have a good enough reward, we'll cut the challenge. But now we can say: 'I want to do really hard solo ops.' Cool, there's gear for that. There are rewards that are worth earning. So grab the dial, crank it up, and see how hard you can make it. Then there's something there to reward you for having risen to the challenge. I had assumed that the new World Tier system would apply across the whole game, I think because I play a lot of Diablo 4, and when you move up in difficulty the whole game and the rewards lift up with you. Whereas with Edge of Fate, it's much more discrete. For the casual player, isn't that going to be confusing? Stevens:The thing is to make sure the lines are as clear as possible when we talk about this: World Tiers apply specifically to the Edge of Fate expansion and the Kepler destination. We wanted to make sure that, from an expansion experience, this is something you can jump into. If you're a casual player, a new player, or returning to the game, we want this to be an immediately digestible experience. You're going to play through the campaign, the core story, on Brave or Legendary [difficulty] out of the gate. Then, once you complete that, if you want to go deeper into the post-game, and the gear pursuit, that's where the higher tiers of difficulty unlock within Kepler itself, with the Fabled and Mythic difficulties. Those then start to apply more to the power chase at that point. Brave and Legendary are going to have fixed power, so that you can play through the story at your own pace. Can you explain how to regularly get the tier four and five gear? Stevens:Sure. That's going to be tied directly to where you are on the power progression band. When you go back to Kepler, that is going to be a place you can do it too. Green:The Portal, those core game activities—Solo Ops, Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops— those all have a pretty consistent execution of how challenge works and how you escalate tiers and apply modifiers. Obviously we'd love it if Crucible could work the same way, but clearly it can't, because players won't submit to having Bane [modfiers] put on them. [laughs] What we're trying to do with expansions is to say: expansions are their own experience, their own formula. And what works well for one formula—like a Metroidvania-inspired release like Edge of Fate—might not work so well for a different formula. So we're not trying to systemically bind the expansions. We're trying to let the expansions pursue a formula that internally makes sense to them, and hopefully is intuitive. That's making a lot of work for yourselves if you plan to reconstitute the game on an expansion-by-expansion basis, though. Green:But in a very interesting way, it actually reduces the work. Because if there's one thing that's harder than trying to make a cog work, it's trying to make two cogs work together and be novel every time. By giving the team that is building the expansion some time and some space in which to actually innovate and try different formulas, I think we're actually giving them the ease of being able to build those things—to solve the problems that they are trying to solve in that release. In the build we were playing, some of the most powerful Aspects have had the number of Fragments they grant reduced to one. Specifically: Consecration, Feed the Void, Stylish Executioner and Knockout. I get that those have been dominant to the point of feeling like auto-includes, but historically whenever an Aspect has only had one Fragment it feels anemic in terms of build crafting. What's your take on that? On the fun police thing, I deeply sympathize and understand. Green:Yeah, I mean, it's always a push and pull with balance. In PvE, I tend to be pretty liberal about things being overpowered. Where I get on board with substantial changes to power is when players feel like they're being compelled to use a particular option. With Fragment slots, unfortunately it's a very binary thing where you either have one or you have two, and that's a huge delta between those alternatives. Ideally, you'd grab the damage numbers and dial them differently, but sometimes we do a big swing in our balancing to assess what the impact is. Does it correct the behavior that we were seeing in-game, and if so did it create a new worst behavior? Sometimes we walk those back. We've walked decisions back in the past where we haven't been happy with the result. It might be unfair, but I can already hear people complaining about Bungie being the fun police. I guess Consecration has been broken for a long time, and tweaking the numbers hasn't changed that. Stevens:We're also changing how stats work in general, to not just focus on how the subclass ability atoms work, but how health and resilience behaviours work too. That's why these systemic changes are so important. Green:On the fun police thing, I deeply sympathize and understand, because the mission statement for Destiny is for it to be a joyous expression of power. Like, it's fun to be powerful, but it's also not fun to be a warlock who has to run Well every single time in high-end content because it's too good. I'm a Warlock main, born to Nova, forced to Well. Green:Yeah! The thing that we try to do is to move those things around. I want players to feel powerful. I don't want them to feel that they have to do a specific thing all the time to feel powerful. I'd rather move those things around, even if sometimes they're like: 'But I really like the thing!\" We're our own worst enemies too, because we'll always choose the path of least resistance. The stated goal with Kepler and Edge of Fate is to take inspiration from the Metroidvania genre. Given how close things like the Matterspark ball ability are to Super Metroid itself, after the controversy around Marathon, do you worry about being seen to lean too heavily on a particular influence? Green:Are we worried about whether it's too close to Metroid? Yeah, I mean, I'm worried that people are gonna get the wrong message. But it's coming from a place of love. We grew up playing these games and we love the reference, we love the homage. But we had to do our own version of it. We had to do our own execution of it, and it had to be a quality execution for us to include it in the game. Matterspark plays into your arc kit. It has the Amplified effect on it. It's about engaging and fighting enemies in a way that is pretty novel and different, and I'm very happy with it. I think it's a fun thing that people get to play with. It's not the thing that we're trying to hang our hat on. It's part of a bigger effort to create an experience on Kepler that's unique to that destination. Everyone seems to love the idea of akimbo weapons thanks to the mobile gameDestiny: Rising's closed beta trailer. Can we get that in Destiny 2? Green:Not anytime soon. Is there any temptation to include a tier of rarity above exotic? A bit like Diablo 4 has Mythic Uniques for its aspirational grind. Green:The temptation exists. You see it manifested in the form of things like holofoil weapons. We're very wary of people feeling like exotics are the new legendaries. I remember when Season of the Forge was announced, and it was going to have these mysterious Black Armory weapons. I was so excited. Maybe for a higher tier you'd have to give up your exotic weapon and armor slot to equip just one Black weapon. Green:Oh my god, this space is so tantalizing as a system designer! So why not do it? Stevens:I think the unsatisfying answer, but I think it's true, is choosing to do that means there's a lot of other things we're not doing that also could make the game feel awesome. People would lose their shit, though. It's been 10 years of having exotics. Green: Sure, yeah. Super exotics! Someday there might be room for that. But how do you do that without exotics just feeling like the new legendaries. I don't wan't gold to be the new purple. That's important to me. Final one: Can we have the Speaker's class items back from D1. Almost everything else has come back except for thoseamazing Hunter cloaks. Green:This is good feedback for the rewards team… I thought that we brought those back?! Stevens:I did too! Green:I'll investigate. Bring those Hunter cloaks back next time the game is having a bad day on Reddit and I promise people will lose their minds. Not so much the Warlock bonds and Titan marks… Green:I gently poke fun at Warlocks on a regular basis about the 'bond of disappointment'. If you knew the back story behind that, oh my goodness… [Sadly, that's where we ran out of time—but as a Warlock main I promise to investigate further. Some questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity. The Edge of Fatelaunches on 15 July.] With over two decades covering videogames, Tim has been there from the beginning. In his case, that meant playing Elite in 'co-op' on a BBC Micro (one player uses the movement keys, the other shoots) until his parents finally caved and bought an Amstrad CPC 6128. These days, when not steering the good ship PC Gamer, Tim spends his time complaining that all Priest mains in Hearthstone are degenerates and raiding in Destiny 2.

    "article_text": "I tested the weird and wild new exotic weapons and armor coming with next month's expansion. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The chocolate box of exotic gear that comes with a newDestiny 2expansion is always one of the biggest reasons to log back in. With The Edge of Fate expansion, which launches on July 15, the slate of new supercharged weapons and unique armour pieces feels particularly fresh—including one item, Melas Panoplia, which enables an ability that has been requested by Titan mains for years. Looking for more on Destiny 2's upcoming expansion? Not only have weplayed it extensively, we alsospoke to game director Tyson Greenabout the major changes it brings. At a preview event at Bungie HQ in Bellevue, Washington, I was able to play with six of the expansion’s new exotics—one of which,New Land Beyond, is technically already in the game if you're willing to splash out on the Year of Prophecy's ultimate edition. There were three armor exotics—one for each class—and three exotic weapons in the dev build, but I wouldn't be surprised if a couple remain under wraps, including the reward from the new raid. But let’s work with what we know. Below, I detail the six new exotics I tested, including the most busted exotic primary I've ever equipped. Third Iteration is a void scout rifle that comes from the season pass. It fires at 200 RPM, uses primary ammo, and fires a spread of void energy projectiles that narrow when you aim down sites. Let's also be clear: it absolutely bangs right now. To the point that almost everyone in the testing room was excitedly discussing how broken it is. It’s the most wildly overpowered primary exotic we’ve seen in years This is by far the standout exotic from The Edge of Fate expansion. It’s the most wildly overpowered primary exotic we’ve seen in the game in years, potentially ever. It hits all the exotic boxes: it’s strange, it’s unique, and it’s extremely powerful. So, a little more about how it works: when you fire Third Iteration, it shoots multiple shots in an extremely accurate spread. Imagine the Cerberus+1 auto rifle shot, but capable of dealing full damage at the range of a scout rifle. However, when you aim down the sight for a brief period, the shots consolidate into a single, high-impact, sniper-like round. This shot then marks the target, causing them to take increased damage from Third Iteration. Oh, and when you defeat a marked target, you turn invisibleandgain truesight (i.e. wallhacks). The way this works in practice is that you mark a big enemy with the consolidated shot, and then blast it with your long-range, shotgun-like shot. In the build I played, this absolutely shredded through enemies and bosses—even on the legendary difficulty of the campaign. It was killing orange bar enemies in two shots or less during higher difficulty campaign missions. Incredibly, according to the devs on hand, the scout has already nerfed at least twice. Conversations are ongoing as to whether it can ship as hot as it currently is, but the devs seemed delighted with our reaction, so fingers crossed. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It’s also going to slot very nicely into some key builds, making the Gyrfalcon Hunter invisibility loop very easy to kickstart. But even without building into void or having any synergy with the rest of my build, it was my go-to exotic for my entire play session at Bungie. Graviton Spike is a craftable exotic hand cannon in The Edge of Fate that seems like it’ll come from a quest. This weapon extends the dual darkness/light weapon idea first introduced with the Conditional Finality raid exotic from Root of Nightmares. It uses primary ammo, sits in the energy slot, and itsaysit fires at 150 RPM. However, you can change the fire rate by taking advantage of its exotic perk, Temporal Manipulation, which lets you swap between a fast-firing arc mode or slow-firing stasis mode. Final blows and precision hits overcharge the opposing mode to enable additional effects. The charged stasis version creates crystals and coldsnap seekers, the charged arc version causes bolts of lightning. This weapon is great for if you’re looking to charge Transcendence for your Prismatic subclass, or take advantage of some elemental verbs and modifiers. But the real benefit comes when you rapidly swap between the two modes after getting headshots. Precision hits with one elemental type charges the other. When you swap to the charged element, you’ll get more benefits for landing precision hits. The charged stasis version of the gun creates stasis crystals and a coldsnap seeker that freezes enemies. The charged arc version causes bolts of lightning to strike targets. This thing offers a really active playstyle which was a ton of fun to play with. How long it’ll take to get the fully upgraded version of Graviton Spike, and what it's potential upgrades entail, is the big question. If it's anything like previous mission exotics, it'll take at least a few runs to earn all the catalysts and intrinsics. New Land Beyond is already in Destiny 2—at least if you buy the digital deluxe edition of The Year of Prophecy—so it hardly feels necessary to put it on this list. But itistechnically a new exotic coming in The Edge of Fate. It’s getting a catalyst which causes rounds to load into the magazine when you have high stacks of the damage buff. This updated version of an original Destiny exotic is a special ammo sniper rifle that sits in the kinetic slot. It fires at 72 RPM and only uses iron sights, making it a little unwieldy to use (although the Snapshot perk has helped it feel less clunky). NLB's main exotic perk is The Master, which means scoring precision hits increases its damage until the wielder’s defeat. It also massively increases ammo reserves. The cool and useful thing about New Land Beyond is that the damage buff remains intact until you die. That means even if you store it and swap to a primary, you can pull it back out and fire off an extremely powerful shot into a boss or major enemy. It’s also getting a catalyst once the expansion hits, which causes new rounds to load into the magazine when you have high stacks of the damage buff. Hilariously, New Land Beyond's perk can stack up to 100, although the damage buff doesn't scale much beyond 20 stacks. Moirai is a new Hunter chest in The Edge of Fate, and it’s all about Tangles and strand. Your Threaded Spike—the strand melee—can now target Tangles in the arena. When it hits one, your Threaded Spike detonates the Tangleandwill spawn a new Tangle in your hands if you catch it. The first Tangle you hit with your spike become a maelstrom, you can then throw the second Tangle to create another maelstrom. On its face, this one seems a little uninteresting, but when you pair it with the Whirling Maelstrom aspect, which causes your Tangles to basically grow hands and fist-fight people, this exotic gets very exciting indeed. Not only does the first Tangle you hit with your spike become a maelstrom, you can then throw the second Tangle to createanothermaelstrom. All of that being said, this definitely seems like the most fiddly of the three exotics. I’m certain that some Hunter main out there will find an absolutely wild way to use it, but it’s going to take a bit more work to get it into a build than the other exotic armor pieces for the expansion. Eunoia are some new Warlock arms which enhance Hellion; the little Solar buddy added in The Final Shape. Whenever the Hellion fires while you have these on, its primary shot explodes part-way to the target, creating a blanket spread of fire and scorching anything in the area. This isn’t the flashiest exotic in this expansion, but it’s a ton of fun to use. Hellion was already an excellent choice for managing large crowds of enemies—something you’ll find in most activities in Destiny 2 these days. With Eunoia, it gets much better at clearing large groups, allowing you to focus on beefier targets while everything else explodes around you. Melas Panoplia istheexotic armor piece of the expansion, and has one of the most widely-requested exotic effects in all of Destiny 2. These gauntlets enable you to throw your solar Titan’s hammer and then hit melee again to return it back to you, Thor-style. It looks, feels, and sounds just as good as you’d hope, with the Titan stretching out their hand in eager anticipation of the hammer’s return. If you wait a moment for the hammer to flash after it hits a target, then hit the recall button, the hammer will cause a massive explosion However, it’s a little more complicated than just throwing the hammer and pressing the button again to bring it back. Instead, you need to get multiple solar kills to get a special Forge Master buff. When you next throw your hammer, you’ll get a short timer indicating how long you can throw and recall it—which you can do unlimited times, assuming the buff hasn’t run out. What makes this so fun is that it also comes with a timing mini-game. If you wait a moment for the hammer to flash and make a sound after it hits a target, then hit the recall button at the perfect time, the hammer will cause a massive explosion around itself before it returns to your hands. This explosion looks flashy, but it also seems quite strong. It’s difficult to tell how effective it’ll be in true endgame content, but I was able to wipe out much beefier enemies than I expected with the explosion, and even deal pretty considerable damage to legendary campaign bosses with just my hammer throw. This is one of the best exotics in years. It’s exactly what I’ve always wanted as a Titan main, but somehow even better than I imagined.

    "title": "The Edge of Fate will be the biggest change to Destiny 2 since it launched—an injection of fresh ideas, but also of ARPG grind",
    "article_text": "The launch of a new saga is bringing a massive shift to how Destiny 2 works. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hurtling around pipes as an electrified Morph Ball doesn't immediately screamDestiny 2to me. Even so, I don't mind the heaping of Metroid that Bungie has stirred into the mix for next month'sThe Edge of Fateexpansion. It's weird, sure, but most importantly it feels like something fresh. Looking for more on The Edge of Fate expansion? We also saw theexpansion's powerful new exotics, andspoke to Destiny 2's game directorabout reinventing the formula. A couple of weeks ago I visited Bungie HQ in Bellevue, Washington to play a build of The Edge of Fate, Destiny 2's first major expansion since the conclusion of the series' 10 year 'Light & Dark' story. It marks the beginning of a new ongoing storyline—called the Fate saga. But while future expansions will contribute to this overarching narrative, they won't be as closely tied together as the releases of the past few years. Bungie appears to be enjoying this newfound freedom—as you might expect given we're about seven months out froma Star Wars-themed expansion. The studio wants to use this shift as an opportunity to dive into more weird, esoteric sci-fi concepts that bubble under the surface of the series' lore—the concepts that first attracted me to Destiny over a third of my life ago. The Edge of Fate begins the way most expansions do, with a mysterious call to a new world, and a cinematic mission that introduces you to a new alien environment. Kepler is a distant planet in our solar system and the staging ground for all of the weird shit going down in The Edge of Fate. The Nine, the ever-mysterious, never-explained, god-like entities that have been looming in the background for years in Destiny, are causing a commotion there. As usual, the Guardians find themselves on a new world because of a mysterious message, and are greeted by slightly upgraded versions of their old foes. The Fallen have a new jetpack enemy that adds some real vertically to fights where they appear, and can even swoop down to boop you around with their boosters. The Vex have a new unit of swarming drones which, like the Husks from the Dread faction, force you to be cautious and accurate when taking them down as killing the lead drone will trigger the remaining ones to fly at you and explode. As you explore Kepler, it becomes less \"classic Destiny,\" and much more Metroid Prime with fusion rifles. But with the Edge of Fate and Kepler, there's also a bizarre third party: Lodi. This nerd with black Ray-Bans and a handgun is here looking for answers of his own. But he doesn't talk like a normal Destiny character who lives in a world where science has truly morphed into magic. Instead he talks like... us. This creates a really interesting dynamic between the player, the Guardians, and Lodi. He's a fish out of water in their world, but feels more relatable to us normal humans than any other character in the Destiny franchise. Don't worry too much about a normal guy with glasses bringing boring reality into the series, as there are also what appear to be L Trains embedded into the flora of Kepler, which act as portals that take you into missions. As far as space-weirdness and setup, The Edge of Fate is still classic Destiny. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm able to huff some weird spores to telekinetically move environmental pieces around—like Tony Hawk cosplaying as Magneto. As you explore Kepler, both in the first mission and beyond, it becomes less \"classic Destiny,\" and much more Metroid Prime with fusion rifles. From the goopy, insect-like flora and fauna on the planet, to the synthy soundtrack, to the damn Morph Ball. \"We're not trying to hide the inspiration,\" said Tyson Green, game director. It's a love letter, and that love shines through as I roll around the feet of stomping Vex Wyverns to Super Bomb some nearby confluxes, disabling their shields. The trick Bungie plays here is that the second you pop out of the lighting ball—called Matterspark—you're suddenly back to good-ol'-reliable FPS Destiny. This creates a kind of flow state between the Destiny that you know and the Destiny that only exists on Kepler. And as soon as you've mastered turning into an orb to solve a puzzle mid-combat, Bungie adds another tool to the arsenal. Now, not only am I able to interact with a special item in the environment that transforms me into the Matterspark, I'm able to spawn a cannon in certain areas that acts as a makeshift portal gun. Eventually I'm able to huff some weird spores and gain the power to telekinetically move environmental pieces around in order to make bridges or ramps—like Tony Hawk cosplaying as Magneto. These new abilities have been created in service to environmental puzzles that require increasing thought and timing to solve. But it's the way Bungie has layered these new tools on top of one another that really delights me. In classic metroidvania style, the Matterspark ability takes a backseat as soon as I get the teleporter cannon, with a few puzzles designed to make sure I'm thinking with portals. But, slowly, Bungie starts to reintroduce Matterspark into my kit. Now, instead of just using the cannon to teleport to a new area, I'm teleporting to an area that I can't leave—that is until I transform into the Matterspark and roll through a tiny hole too big for my Guardian to fit through. Bungie has never failed to offer this best-in-class gunplay with Destiny 2—but after 10 years, the game around that gunplay felt stale. All of these abilities come together very nicely in my favorite mission from the expansion. Without getting into spoilers, it required me to restart a big generator on Kepler. But to do that, I needed to head into some nearby side rooms to fix multiple pieces of the machine, which required completing increasingly complex puzzles. In one of the final areas, before circling back to the big fight in front of the main generator, I had to complete what I counted as a 13-step puzzle in order to spawn the final boss. While the puzzle as a whole wasn't particularly confusing or difficult, it was exciting. It got me to think about my environment differently. It took me someplace new and asked me to solve something that didn't feel like a Destiny puzzle at all. Bungie does a nice job mixing this new gameplay flow up as well. Sometimes I was solving a puzzle in an empty room with time to think. Other times I was just blasting through environments with nary a puzzle to solve. And, most of the time, I was doing both at once, killing some enemies before diving into Matterspark to charge up a generator before popping out and shotgunning a Fallen Captain. In the section I played, I was impressed with how engaged I was regardless of whether I was focusing on a puzzle, combat, or both. Bungie could obviously get that mix wrong in other parts of the campaign I haven't seen, but I was never more than a few seconds away from shooting something by the time I was all puzzled out. Bungie has never failed to offer this best-in-class gunplay with Destiny 2—it's why those of us still here have stuck around. But after 10 years, the gamearoundthat gunplay feels stale. Even missions that I loved back in The Witch Queen, though high quality, couldn't exactly be described as innovative. But with the addition of Matterspark and the other Kepler-exclusive abilities, Bungie's developers have managed to add something that feels new—despite being borrowed from other games I love—without sacrificing the core of Destiny's DNA. These abilities do create an interesting kind of struggle within me—one that I'm still not sure I've settled weeks after my play session. The Kepler abilities are very cool and make the planet feel unique, but there's a sadness that comes with not being able to play with them the moment you step onto an older destination. On one hand, keeping them unique to Kepler ensures that the destination and experience of Edge of Fate feels special and unique forever. Matterspark is inherently tied to Kepler in a way that Grapple isn't tied to Neomuna, and that's actually quite interesting. It's easy to imagine a world, several expansions from now, where loading into different Strikes feels dramatically different because each planet has its own, cute mechanics that make it special. Matterspark is inherently tied to Kepler in a way that Grapple isn't tied to Neomuna, and that's actually quite interesting. On the other hand, Destiny is a massive game, and most of my time in Destiny 2's Year of Prophecy won't be spent on Kepler. Thankfully, Green told me that the studio will be continuing to build off of the Guardian's power sets in the future (although he wasn't specific about when Prismatic, for example, will be seeing an upgrade). But would I be more excited overall if part of The Edge of Fate was a class ability override that let me turn into the Morph Ball? I'm not certain. It's a balance Bungie is going to have to get right, otherwise these bespoke locations could risk making the rest of the game feel stale by comparison. For now, itreallyhelps set Kepler apart from other expansion destinations, and I think I'm going to end up loving that. Even though I've only played a few hours of The Edge of Fate's campaign, I find myself suddenly excited for future expansions like Renegades. I'm even starting to develop faith that a Star Wars-themed expansion might be more than just driving across a Tattoine-at-home planet on a Sparrow while Drifter knowingly asks me over the radio if I know that a Parsec is a unit of measurement, not time. Part of that hope comes from the The Edge of Fate campaign, but it's also because of the sheer number of changes coming to the rest of the Destiny 2 \"hobby,\" as Bungie's developers like to call it. Those systemic changes are extensive, but the result is that Destiny 2's loot chase is going to be more of a grind than it has been in years past. But before you shut this page with a scoff, let me add that Bungie's intention is to make that grind more worthwhile and deterministic than ever before. More chase, but better rewards to show for it—which brings us to the tier system. All new gear now drops as part of a tiered loot system—rated one to five—with higher tier weapons offering not only upgraded perks, but raw stat increases over their lower-tier cousins. Higher tier armor will also guarantee a better stat band, meaning that getting a higher tier piece of loot will almost always indicate that it's an improvement on what you have—at least mathematically. However, playing with some of these tier 5 items, I wasn't really able to feel that difference during my admittedly limited playtime. I still need a bit of convincing that these items are actually going to be noticeably different from the other gear, at least beyond the fashion incentive—tier 5 weapons come with a special blue glow and nice looking on-kill effect. Longtime Guardians have alotof great weapons that they've accumulated over the years. Just speaking personally, I'm still lugging around my crafted Commemoration—despite the heavy nerf to Reconstruction—and it's going to take something astounding to make me put it down. Sure, Bungie can \"incentivize\" players by asking them to use weapons with the \"NEW\" tag on them for a bit of a damage boost in essentially all activities (similar to the overcharge system in current D2), but any new gun will do that, not just their T5 versions. While I am skeptical here, I have faith that these high tier weapons won't just be the second coming of Adepts, weapons that are significantly more painful to grind for in Destiny 2 with nearly no major benefits (and typically an uglier base shader, I must say). That's because of the aforementioned mathematical, statistical benefits that come from wielding T5 gear. Tier 5 weapons will have better reload, better range, better everything, just because they're tier 5. Tier 5 weapons will have better reload, better range, better everything. That kind of statistical improvement is especially hard to feel in a preview environment where you're not using your own setup that you're used to at home, and jumping forward and backward in time every few hours. It wouldn't surprise me at all if the first time I put my hands on a tier 5 at home and compared the stats on a tier 4 of the same roll, that I would be able to feel a meaningful difference. But it's something I'll be keeping a serious eye on at launch. One aspect of tier 5s that is definitely an improvement over Adepts is the acquisition method. Getting these high tier items isn't like getting holofoils in Rite of the Nine or Into the Light. More than just luck, higher tier items come by increasing your average power level and ascending the different difficulty tiers—far more similar to Diablo 4 than to the current leveling system in Destiny 2. Plus, tier 5s have three enhanced perks and multiple enhanced barrels and magazines to choose from, making the likelihood that you actually get the roll you want much higher. One thing that I was really delighted to see with Edge of Fate is Bungie doubling down on new archetypes for weapons. Rocket sidearms and healing auto rifles have been such a fun infusion to the game, and really adds some variety to the loot pool that keeps the game fresh. Without knowing exactly how development works at Bungie, it also seems like the studio is able to create these goofy spinoff archetypes much faster than whole new weapon classes, like Glaives.There are actually a few new weapon archetypes in The Edge of Fate, but the wackiest ones are definitely the rocket pulse rifle and the spread shot hand cannon.The rocket pulse functions like a long-range, high-damage, burst-fire version of the rocket sidearm. The one I was able to play with absolutely blasted down high-health enemies from a great distance, and was even good for taking out chunks of boss health in the Legendary campaign. It chewed through ammo, however, so it's not something I'd use on lower tier enemies the way I do my rocket sidearms. The high damage and low ammo capacity make it a great companion to machine guns.The spread shot hand cannon is definitely less good than the rocket pulse (at least in the PvE stuff I tried, although I heard PvP players at the event saying it was extremely strong, so your mileage may vary), but that's largely because of its range. The spread shot hand cannon fires like a small shotgun, almost like the Mauler from Bungie's Halo days. It uses primary ammo and will absolutely obliterate anything in your way. But the damage doesn't just fall off at a very short range, it deals zero damage at medium range or beyond. I couldn't even hit some of the buttons you shoot to change settings in the new firing range with it because they were too far away. Maybe it's just my playstyle, but I was having trouble figuring out what kind of loadout I'd want to use it for without running double primaries—which, as we all know, is a sin in this post-Forsaken world. As you complete more and more difficult activities, you'll get better rewards dropping at higher Power levels, which, in turn, allow you to fish for better loot by completing even more difficult activities. All of this happens via what Bungie is calling the Portal, which is essentially a hopper where you can select any relevant activity in the game—easily jumping into a matchmade playlist or fully customizing the difficulty to increase your score and, therefore, your reward. With all these new tiers of rewards, it's easy to imagine that grinding for that perfect version of an armor piece or a tier 5 weapon with all the perks you want on it, will be harder than ever. But as a tradeoff for adding more grind, Bungie has made it easier to actually get what you want. Certain playlists and missions have guaranteed rewards that rotate daily. If The Whisper is offering you a guaranteed drop of the incredible new rocket pulse rifle, you can do it over, and over, and over again until you get your god roll. This is especially good considering that armor is now something you'll want to grind for, as it comes with a stat archetype and set bonuses—which give unique effects while wearing two pieces or four pieces of a set, meaning you can mix and match two set bonuses while also using an exotic. Getting the gear and rolls you want has never been easier, but you have to put in the work to be powerful enough to grind for a tier 5 weapon in the first place. I imagine more casual Destiny fans will be happy enough with tier 3 or tier 4 loot, but there's also a real danger that the community will deem anything below tier 5 as trash, much as in the same way Diablo plays won't be caught dead using anything below Ancestral gear a week into a new season. As someone who is absolutely sick of a lot of the older Strikes and activities in the game, the Portal feels like a meaningful way to revive stagnant missions and make them fun again. Destiny has long suffered from a small pool of repeatable activities that have gotten very boring for veterans, while all of the newer, fresher seasonal offerings are removed at the end of each year. The Portal not only comes with a ton of new modifiers to spruce up some of that old stuff, but it's designed to rotate new things in and out more frequently—and don't worry, Bungie assured me that they're moving away from content that rotates out forever. The Whisper is an incredible mission that I love dearly, and I've wished I had more reasons to run it now that my Whisper of the Worm is fully kitted out. Now, not only do I have a reason to run it for new and relevant gear, by the time I get sick of it, it'll hopefully get swapped out for something I haven't played in a long time. Sure I don't like a mission like Kell's Fallnearlyas much, but it'll still be nice to have something fresh to play while The Whisper takes a back seat for a bit. As someone who has really enjoyed the ride for the last decade, I have to admit that some things I saw—mostly the new tiered items—left me a bit worried. But I recognize that fear in myself as a fear of change. On paper, the changes excite me, but it's going to be months—potentially not until March of next year, when the mid-season update for Renegades hits—before players truly grasp just how different the game has become, which changes have helped, and which may be misguided. All of these changes, even the ones I am unsure if I'll like, seem aimed at improving the game for the long haul. The loop of Destiny is fundamentally different, and that does freak me out. But the game's current loop is, in a way, nonexistent. Destiny 2 has been all about checklists for a long time: Get the god roll of a gun I barely care about, check it off my list, throw it in the Vault, never take it out again. I've obviously enjoyed doing that quite a bit over the years, but there is a certain \"what is it all even for\" that has nagged at every Destiny player I know over the last several expansions. Bungie is finally giving us a sense of progression that isn't just \"thank Christ I finished enough bounties to compete in Grandmaster Nightfalls this season\". I am beyond certain that there will be things in The Edge of Fate's overhaul that I do not like six months from now, and changes to the game that I will wish would go back to the way they were. With so many changes, it would be almost impossible for Bungie to get it 100% right on the first try. But I'm just happy it's changing in a big, meaningful way for the first time in years. Good or bad, Destiny 2 will, at the very least, feel new again when The Edge of Fate launches on July 15.

    "article_text": "Just look at the way the mouth moves as they speak. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The2025 State of Unrealgave us some long-awaited updates on the tech poweringThe Witcher 4, and while I was picking my jaw up from the floor, something new found its way onto my screen—a bizarre animated alien rendered from a webcam feed in real time. Epic's new updates to MetaHuman, its suite of lifelike digital human character tools, are astoundingly cool, and feel like they may help lower the barrier to entry for budding developers. Effectively, the entire suite is intended for use by developers to make character models with high levels of detail more easily, which can then be exported for use in projects. With the launch of Unreal Engine 5.6, it has been integrated directly into the engine to optimize workflow. There are a few main elements ofMetaHumangettingupdates. MetaHuman Creator is a cloud-enhanced bit of software for building hyper-realistic models. This is now getting a body component, for further customization, but Epic Games has also announced the ability to get its source code, which should give users more of an ability to customize it. Live from space… Blu is Cory? Cory is Blu? MetaHuman Animator makes it all possible…in real time! But whatever you do - don’t let Blu do his standup.Want to know what else is out of this world? MetaHumans are being added to the Unreal Engine License. You can use MetaHumans… pic.twitter.com/T7Rc0UB4nlJune 3, 2025 The new body system also comes with the ability to add clothes, which will dynamically wrap around models. This effectively means you don't have to create new clothes for new body types, and clothes packages can be bought and sold on a separate marketplace. These are all interesting additions to a very impressive tool, but it's the MetaHuman Animator that really wowed me (that's the one with the alien I was talking about). Effectively, it can take footage from a webcam or phone, and plant it onto a MetaHuman, and it's all done in real-time. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Actors don't even have to wear custom suits, as is traditionally donned in motion capture, and it can be done on mono capture devices (a video source without depth, like what you might find in a head mounter camera). Above: Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman Animate Tool shown off in real-time. Credit: Epic Games. The presentation of this tool has a 'reality cam' so that it can show the difference between real capture and that of the animation. There's almost no lag in between the two clips, and facial expressions are captured with ease. The actor moves their mouth to their left, and the alien's mouth texture stretches in a similar fashion. Perhaps most impressively, MetaHuman Animator can be used with an audio source and character model alone, and can \"take into account the emotion of the speaker from the audio to provide more lifelike animation\". You can adjust the emotionality of animation, and it will even add head movement to your character to seem more realistic. This tech feels like it could be a major boon to developers, and the fact that it's both built into Unreal Engine 5.6 and creators are encouraged to use theFabasset store feels like an excellent way for smaller teams to get their hands on expressive and real-feeling digital characters. Digital characters made with MetaHuman can also be used in other engines, too.

    "title": "The 'main goal' for Epic Games' new Unreal 5.6 engine is more performance on the PS5 and that should be good news for gaming on affordable PC hardware",
    "article_text": "A game designed to run fast on PS5 should absolutely fly on modest PC hardware. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Epic Games has beenshowing off its latest Unreal 5.6 game engine. While it's full of technical innovations and new graphical and physics features, the main takeaway is that the latest version of arguably the most important video game engine is all about performance. Indeed, Epic's Senior Director of Framework Engineering Julien Marchand says the \"main goal\" for Unreal 5.6 is performance. After showcasing a newopen world Witcher 4 demofromCD ProjektRed, which we'll be covering in detail later today, Marchand said, \"an open world like that was just the perfect content to focus on our main goal for the release, which was performance. We want the engine to scale to large and rich worlds, we want to preserve graphics quality, and of course we want to deliver high frame rates that you and your players expect.\" Epic showed the Witcher 4 demo running on plain old Sony PS5 hardware, not eventhe new PS5 Pro, at a claimed 60 fps and with ray tracing enabled. The render resolution wasn't mentioned, but the visuals, including dense foliage, animal hair and muscle animation, cloth physics and more looked pretty stunning. Of course, the PS5's APU is pretty modest by modern gaming PC standards. So, anything that runs well on PS5 ought to fly on even pretty modest PC hardware. Anyway, to get Unreal running faster, a number of optimizations and new features have been added. For starters, there's the new Nanite Foliage system, an adaptive voxel representation for creating foliage, trees and the like. It works by replacing distant triangles with cubes that are smaller than individual pixels. According to Epic the new system is \"super fast\" to render and \"allows artists to render whatever amount of foliage is needed to achieve their vision without compromise.\" \"The only way to render a forest that looks as good as this one is to use 3D geometry for all parts of the tree,\" Marchand said. The clever bit is that the entire forest is composed of just 28 modular tree parts, each instanced thousands of times and used as building blocks. The foliage system also supports skeletal animation that runs on the GPU. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The only catch here is that the new foliage system seen in the Witcher 4 demo isn't due to be available to the wider game dev community until the next Unreal 5.7 update. Pity. Anyway, next up is a new animation framework. The idea here is to support loads of detailed, animated game characters. Epic showed a large crowd of \"over 300 animated skeletal mesh agents, all going about their business\" in the Witcher 4 demo while maintaining 60 fps and with performance \"room to spare\" in the main game thread. Some universal performance optimizations have also been applied to Unreal's lighting engine. \"Ray tracing and Lumen now run more than twice as fast, with no visual trade off compared to when Unreal Engine 5 was released,\" Marchand said, \"and because of that we can now hit 60 fps on consoles.\" Unreal's \"Chaos\" physics engine has also been given an overhaul. Improvements to Chaos Cloth mean that multiple fabrics and garments now interact faster and more accurately, while with \"Chaos Flesh\", Epic has introduced, \"procedural muscle animations to make deformation and motion more natural.\" Another neat detail is pre-baked fluid dynamics. \"We now support baking of fluid surface data into light-weight assets to be played back at low cost. This is going to give you high fidelity water without the performance cost of real-time simulation,\" Marchand explained. There's a whole bunch of other stuff, all aimed at getting a better visual and gameplay experience out of ye olde Playstation 5 hardware. And that's got to be a good thing for the PC. The PS5 makes do with eight pretty ancient AMD Zen 2-spec CPU cores and 36 AMD RDNA 2 graphics CUs. The graphics CU count is slightly more than the 32 CUs of theAMD Radeon RX 6600 XT, which was a fairly low end PC GPU back at launch in 2021. On paper, the newAMD Radeon RX 9060 XThas the same 32 CU count. But it's two generations newer and so has around 2.5 times the raw computational power of the 6600 XT for general rendering tasks, plus massively upgraded ray tracing hardware. In short, the likes of theRX 9060 XTshould make mincemeat of anything that runs well on PS5 hardware. Of course, such on-paper assumptions don't always play out in practice, what withpoorly optimized console ports. But it's certainly hard to watch the new Unreal 5.6 demo showcasing Witcher 4 and not come away both impressed and hopeful for what might be possible on sensible PC hardware very soon.

    "title": "Penguins confront Lovecraftian cosmic horror in the next game from the developers of Umurangi Generation",
    "article_text": "Oh dear. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Umurangi Generation wasn't just a stylish cyberpunk photography sim. It was a meditation on climate disaster, an indictment of global capitalist hegemony—the kind of game that makes it a little surprising when you hear that developer Origame Digital's next project is called Penguin Colony, which involves playing as penguins with different abilities. Don't get me wrong, I like penguins as much as the next guy, but I figured there had to be something more at play here. It didn't take long to confirm, because theSteam pagesays Penguin Colony is a \"narrative adventure game based on HP Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.\" The Steam listing includes features like \"waddling, sliding and swimming\"—lovely! It says you'll be able to \"freely explore the Antarctic ice and the caverns beneath in non-linear order\"—delightful! And, let's see here, you'll also \"discover horrors buried under the ice and the dark history of the continent time forgot.\"Oh. Oh no. You might be wondering: Is \"At the Mountains of Madness\" a short story that's written from a penguin's perspective? And I can confirm that it isn't. It's about a doomed arctic expedition led by a Dr William Dyer of Miskatonic University, which gets a little complicated after a few minds and bodies are obliterated by the magnitude of unfathomable cosmic forces. Helpfully, Origame Digital explains the penguin angle: \"Our narrator is part of an expedition which has gone horribly wrong. Having been called by the old ones, his brain no longer experiences time linearly. Past, present and future have become one for him. The only thing who can hear his cry for help is you, a penguin awoken by a flare in the distance.\" Now, I won't go into detail, but \"At the Mountain of Madness\" does featuresomepenguin content. I'll just say I'm interested to see what Penguin Colony's \"different abilities and challenges\" its unlockable penguins will possess. I'm sure it'll be fine. Penguin Colony doesn't have a release date, but Origame Digital says it'll release a trailer and demo \"in the coming months.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Deluded chanting: Shadow drop! Shadow drop! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every time I write about Silksong, I feel as though I'm inching closer to an abyss of madness from which there is no return. Each article starts the same—a rite for the uninitiated, an explanation that yes, this game really was announced in 2019, and yes, it really was stated to be coming out \"in the next 12 months\" in 2022, and yes, fan hopefuls really did wait three more years for ahilariously short clip in a 2025 Nintendo directpromising a release date this year with zero other specifics. Now, from the bottom of a well of conspiracy, a scrap comes tumbling down the cobbled walls: There've been more SteamDB changes that… wait holy crap, these might actually mean something. As spotted by eagle-eyed industry buffWario64 on X, several SteamDB updates have been published forHollow Knight: Silksong, which have quickly gained traction as a deep hit of hopium on the unfailingly unhingedsubreddit, with nary a \"silkpost\" flair in sight. The main meat is the introduction of achievement languages, which are a pretty good sign the game's nearing completion—you generally don't decide what achievements are going to be notable, thentranslatethem unless you're pretty certain you won't be making any more structural changes to your game. Even more hype came down the pipeline whensome depots changed. A depot, as explained by theSteamworks documentation, is \"a logical grouping of files which are all delivered to a customer as a single group\", which then gets \"downloaded and 'mounted' on their local drive\" when you download a game. Thelast time one of these depots changedwas in 2019, when the game was first announced. While I don't think userHHrnz, who spotted the change, is exactly right when they say \"This is pretty much confirmation that the game is complete and ready to have its release date announced,\" it is a sign that something is going on. And as a resolute skonger, something is always able to be everything. I'm about to call an utterly unfounded shot, with zero basis in reality and all the hope of someone shouting 'Kobe!' from halfway down the court, but, just think about it—Summer Games Fest is coming up. Heaps upon heaps of trailers and events and showcases. What is the funniest thing that Team Cherry could possibly do aftersix entire years of anticipation?

    "title": "After almost 18 years, Team Fortress 2 just had its toughest tournament ever, and there could be more to come",
    "article_text": "This Denver competition was one of the best showcases I've ever seen for the long-lived FPS. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Team Fortress 2 resides in the long shadows cast by Valve's pair of popular titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. But the class-based FPS has managed to endure despite its little-brother status, perpetuated by a passionate community that includes a competitive scene that's still producing fireworks. During May’sPhysgun Fireside DenverLAN, one fan I spoke to called the tricontinental tournament “the toughest competition in TF2 history.” The game is nearing 18 years of age, and the caliber of competition has only increased during that time. I’ve spent 2,900 hours in-game and frankly, the worst player on the worst team at Fireside Denver could run circles around me before taunting over my ragdolled corpse⁠—it'd be like a Little Leaguer stepping up to the plate against Shohei Ohtani. “Right now the competitive scene is probably the best it’s ever been,” said SOAPYMEiSTER, who plays Soldier for the American superteamLike a G6⁠—or just “G6” to fans. What does a TF2 superteam look like, you ask? In TF2’s biggest competitive gamemode, “Sixes,” teams typically stand by a highly optimized composition: two Scouts, two Soldiers, one Demoman, one Medic. Possessing ample mobility, each of these “generalist” classes can both participate in and flee fights efficiently, leading to a speed-centric Sixes metagame strategized around TF2’s skill-intensive movement system. Slower classes like Heavy and Engineer only emerge when a team is holed up defending their final control point. Pyro is similarly useful in niche situations, able to negate a Medic’s Übercharge with well-timed airblasts. Sniper and Spy see occasional but glamorous action, usually being deployed to assassinate the enemy Medic or other valuable targets. Sniping's a good job mate@FiresideCasts @TF2Essentials @physgunofficial #denverlan #product pic.twitter.com/crtDO994UAMay 26, 2025 G6 bulldozed their way through Fireside Denver, going undefeated en route to the grand finals. But many fans in attendance had favored a different North American team:Froyotech, the historical dynasty of competitive TF2. Ask any fan who they consider the greatest player of all time. The answer will come in chorus: Grant “b4nny” Vincent. As Froyotech’s founder and captain, b4nny is unique in having forged a full-fledged career out of playing Valve’s wacky hat game competitively⁠—far from the spotlight of mainstream esports glory, most pro-level TF2 players are amateurs with day jobs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Since the team’s inception in 2014, Froyotech has earned six gold medals at international LANs, more cash winnings than just about every other team combined, as well as respect, envy, and enmity from different corners of the community. “I’m better than you, b4nny!” howled Taz, a Soldier player representing the Philippines, after scoring a nasty frag on the veteran during a Saturday match. Though Froyotech would trounce Taz’s team in the end, it was an early warning sign. Something clearly wasn’t clicking for the once-ascendant North Americans. “Froyo has a very complex system,” Habib, the team's world-renowned Demoman, told me. “We’re used to crowds, but we still crumbled under pressure. It’s all about timing, positioning, execution, and we couldn’t keep up that coordination.” In the playoffs, Froyotech would fall to an unexpected adversary:Witness Gaming Australia(WG-AU). With competitive TF2 such a niche concern, it takes dedication to get a Down Under team to Denver. Enter Ian “Witness” Faulkner, an esports enthusiast who personally sponsored the Australian and European teams, even taking them hiking in the Rocky Mountains. “I’ve spent $7,000 on this trip so far. I’m not going to make any of that back,” Faulkner said with a shrug. WG-AU also managed to successfullycrowdfund$8,100 AUD ($5,200 USD). Still, even a perfect performance at a LAN wouldn’t offset the heavy costs that come with circumnavigating the globe—an unfortunate con of community-operated competitive scenes like this one. “When it comes to TF2, I see parallels to Smash Bros … Valve and Nintendodon’t support these communities,” Faulkner suggested. “They play Smash forbags of ricein Japan. We’re at one of the most stacked TF2 tournaments of all time and we're basically playing for bags of rice.” But what’s a better distraction from finances than a victory over the greatest team in TF2 history, at the game's most prestigious LAN in eight years? “Honestly, I was shitting myself,” said Conor, a Soldier for WG-AU. “Just to play against Froyo would have been special, but to win? It’s the biggest moment we’ve ever had.” Not the biggest moment for long, though. In the semifinals, the Aussies faced Balls LAN Team, an ensemble of experienced pros who had banded together to see how they’d fare in Denver against more established rosters. Led by former Froyotech star Jayhyunpae, whom multiple fans described to me as the most mechanically gifted player in the game, the Balls boys were serious contenders. WG-AU, however, proved too much to handle, winning the most important TF2 series in their nation’s history and becoming the first Australian team to medal in an international tournament. Though they would place 3rd overall after losing a close contest to sister teamWitness Gaming Europe(WG-EU), breaking “the 4th place curse” that had forever plagued Aussie TF2 was well worth their price of admission. Australia break the 4th place curse pic.twitter.com/UcbAyDhSNQMay\n26, 2025 Speaking of WG-EU, its chances didn’t look good going into the grand final. I spoke to dozens of players, fans, and analysts, hearing versions of the same refrain: “G6 is unbeatable.” But the Europeans gave as good as they got. On the grand final’s second map, Process, G6 battered WG-EU back to their last point, forcing the underdogs to defend with everything they had. To murmurs from the crowd, the European Medic, Auto, switched his loadout from the meta-defining ÜberCharge to the Kritzkrieg, a risky choice that provides massive damage but zero invulnerability. One WG-EU Scout, Toemas, scurried into spawn, switching classes and waddling out as the iconic Heavy Weapons Guy. As G6 smashed their way to the point, Auto activated his Kritzkrieg on Toemas, unleashing a barrage of, to quote the hollering audience, “laser beams!” After this game-saving play, the Europeans managed to eke out a win on Process before taking the next two maps as well, upsetting the undefeated G6 superteam and winning the tournament. In a post-match interview, commentator Tcmano called WG-EU “the best team in TF2” and somewhat begrudgingly gave European TF2 its flowers. “You have come to North America, you have championed your region, proving Europe is the best,” he said. “I’ve been forced to admit it. At least for right now.” Compared to modern esports, competitive TF2 is well past its prime. Its glory days dusked a decade ago. But TF2’s seasoned pro players are as devoted as ever, and there’s plenty of young blood flowing through the scene. Two of the highest-level Demomen of all time exemplify this dynamic: Froyo’s Habib and G6’s Logan. “He’s better than me now. I’m not 20 anymore,” came a humble admission from Habib. Logan, almost bashful, responded, “Habib taught me everything.” The community may be tight-knit, but does that leave room to grow? Balls leader Jayhyunpae believes that, barring a miracle intervention from Valve, an evolution to the meta may be necessary. “Being a long-time player, I want to see changes to competitive,” he said. “I’d like new maps, new strategies, different classes. Anything, really.” Even b4nny, TF2’s most infamous Sixes stickler, sees a need to adapt. “Part of me does understand where Valve is coming from with their [no restrictions] competitive format,” he shared. “We could relax unnecessary weapon bans. Competitive has this label of being very elitist, kind of looking down upon casuals, and I think that we would need to really rebrand a little bit.” Many fans and players I talked to felt comfortable labeling Fireside Denver as a “grand finale” for the competitive scene, due to the sheer cost and effort required to host a big, grassroots tournament. But in b4nny’s opinion, there’s as much time left for TF2 as players keep putting into it. “I heard people say ‘This is the final LAN’ in 2019,” the Froyotech captain said, shaking his head. “If we stay optimistic and focus on doing the things that we can do as a community–putting on events, making content, engaging the playerbase ourselves. I think the game never has to go away.” Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.

    "article_text": "It even includes the original Polish Witcher comics, translated into English. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, here's a good bit of timing. Just a couple of weeks ago, we were telling you aboutthe original Polish The Witcher comics coming out in English(and about Geralt's fringe looking like a cartoon mustache). Now, they've available ina new Humble Bundle—and you can get them for just a dollar. The Witcher X Cyberpunk 2077 bundle offers up a whole load of comics in PDF from publisher Dark Horse, mostly based onCD ProjektRED's videogame universes, though with the Polish comics as well, and some direct adaptations of Andrzej Sapkowski stories. Also included are world books for both, and an artbook full of all the gorgeous portraits from Gwent. Altogether, it's 25 books worth $438 / £323.50—so the all-in price of $24 / £17.80 is, as usual, a steal. The next tier is $12 / £8.90 for 6 items, and though it's a slightly random smattering of the books, it's enough at least to give you a good flavour of Dark Horse's stuff and see whether you'd want more in the future. And then for a measly $1 / £0.74, you can get just the classic Polish comics. It amounts to six issues, translated to English, mostly adapting the original short stories but also featuring an original tale by Andrzej Sapkowski himself. A little slice of Witcher history for less than a coffee seems like a good deal, and the retro comic art has serious charm. I've not read a lot of the books in the bundle myself, but I did really enjoy volume 1 of the modern Witcher comics, House of Glass. The atmospheric Mike Mignola cover sets you up perfectly for a moody, scary folktale that feels perfectly in line with the feel of the games. I'm a big fan of Dark Horse generally, too—when it comes to these kinds of licensed comics, I think it's got a fantastic hit rate. The files being delivered only as PDFs rather than CBZ or EPUB files isn't ideal—it means the collection will take up a lot of space, and depending on the device you read on, it may be a little laggy. But it should mean nice, crisp quality, and if you're new to digital comics, PDFs do have the advantage of being easy to open and use without downloading any new app. By my count,the bundle will be available until June 18, so if your interest has been piqued, make sure to grab it before then—and set aside some time for downloading and organising it all. In the meantime, I'll let you know if I find any other good ways of killing time whilewe wait for The Witcher 4… Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Minecraft keeps adding banger after banger in its newest update. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Minecraft has shared more details on what is coming in its second drop for 2025 ina post on the official blog, including its title—Chase the Skies. But, as excited as I am to take a trip aboard a Happy Ghast and appreciate the beauty of the world thanks to the Vibrant Visuals overhaul, one feature that I am thrilled the game is receiving as part of the update is the player locator bar. Rather than begging your friends time and time again to share their co-ordinates after they decided it would be funny to run off mid-expedition, you'll now be able to track their whereabouts on a small bar at the bottom of your screen—where your XP bar usually goes. Your fellow players will be represented by little coloured squares on the bar, a different colour for each player, making them a lot easier to chase rather than having to pull up your detailed co-ordinates and figuring out which direction will get you to theirs the fastest. However, if you are the friend that is constantly running away, or you're playing a game of hide and seek, you'll still be able to remain undetected by crouching. I know, this isn't an ideal solution, since you'll have to spend a lot of time moving very slowly if you want to be unfindable for the entirety of your game session, but at least it's an option. The blog post didn't share any sort of information on whether or not the feature can be toggled on or off either, so I think it's safe to assume that it's a permanent addition for now. Rather than just showing you which direction to head in, the locator bar goes that extra step further too. A little arrow will pop up when you get closer to your friends to show whether they have fallen deep underground or ended up stuck on the side of a mountain. It's the ultimate tool for players who have an unreliable gang of fellow explorers, but as the friend who is constantly finding themselves in dire situations, I'm happy to finally have an easier way for people to come and pull me out of trouble. I'm just surprised it has taken this long for them to add it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kara is an evergreen writer.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's Summer Geoff Fest season, folks, and you know what that means: time for a concentrated jet of videogame news so intense it could strip the enamel off porcelain. And nowhere is that news more exciting, intriguing, and relentlessly PC-oriented than at thePC Gaming Show 2025, airing this Sunday, June 8. Hosted by Mica Burton, Sean \"Day[9]\" Plott and Frankie Ward, the showcase will feature a frankly ludicrous number of games: over 70, and all from studios like 11 Bit, CCP, People Can Fly, Ghost Ship,Ubisoft, and plenty more besides. We've also somehow managed to secure the insurance necessary to build a state-of-the-art PCduringthe show, which literally cannot go wrong. Once it's built and we've cleaned the scorch marks off the walls, we'll be giving it away to one lucky viewer of the show. Could it be you!? It could. If you watch. I believe those are the terms and conditions. The games we'll be showing are, if I may say so, wall-to-wall bangers. We've got mushroom-themed FPS Mycopunk, a new puzzle game from the OG Zachtronics team, a new reveal from Poncle that—I didn't know this was allowed—isn't related to Vampire Survivors, and something called Pigface, which you should check out just on principle. How and when do you tune in, then? Great question. The PC Gaming Show will airSunday, June 8, 2025 at 12 noon PDT, 3 pm EDT, 8 pm BST, 9 pm CEST and 3 am CST. If you're in China, then 你好, and the show will hit on June 9 at 3 am. The show will air on pretty much every platform upon which you could conceivably lay eyes. We'll be streaming onTwitch,YouTube,X,Facebook,PC Gamer,GamesRadar+,GOG.com,Steam,Bilibili, and even more besides. We'll have localised subtitles in English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, French, Korean, German, ASL and BSL.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign has a BuzzFeed-like personality test to help you figure out which Nightfarer suits you best",
    "article_text": "The test essentially called me a coward. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've found that one of the keys to a successfulElden Ring Nightreignrun is team composition. That may sound pretty obvious, but with nine Nightfarers to choose from, it can be tricky figuring out which one is best for your team, the run, and for you. But if you're still having trouble picking a main, and you don't want to just pickthe best Elden Ring Nightreign character, thenFromSoftwarehas an answer for you. Swooping in with a personality test that, in all honesty, is closer to a classic Buzzfeed quiz than anything else, FromSoft has created theElden Ring Nightreign Personality Testfor indecisive players. Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightNightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every NightlordNightreign Remembrances- All character quests The test isn't very long, and it includes questions like 'How do you like to pass your time' and general stuff that seeks to unpack how you like to fight and what your approach to taking on big bosses is. Now I will say, like most of these personality tests, you can fudge results by working backwards and choosing answers that most suit the character that you want to get. But if you want to take it honestly, then my advice would be to just go with your gut and pick answers quickly without giving them too much thought. I ended up getting Recluse, an \"adaptable ranged magical alchemist\", otherwise known as a filthy coward who hides behind spells and runs away from the fight, yup, that's me for sure. I haven't played a ton of Recluse yet. I've mostly stuck to Ironeye and Revenant, but this sorcerer is a pretty solid pick. I really like her minor ability that not only enables her to recharge FP but also lets her create a cocktail of spells to then use against enemies. Her ultimate art, Soulblood Song, also imprints a sigil onto enemies, which, when killed, can replenish HP and FP. But Recluse is much more of a support character than the star of the show. They are very dependent on their teammates to deal consistent and large amounts of damage, as well as diving headfirst into fights and being in the fray. Characters like Wylder, Executioner, or Raider complement Recluse well for this reason. Regardless of these drawbacks, if FromSoft thinks that Recluse is my character, then maybe Recluse is my character. Who am I to argue with them? I may snag myself a sword on the way to the Nightlord, though, just in case I have to take matters into my own hands and frontline.

    "title": "Minecraft Chase the Skies drop: Everything you need to know about the next update",
    "article_text": "Leave your head in the clouds with Minecraft's newest additions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Minecraftis preparing to release Chase the Skies, its second drop for 2025, featuring the anticipated launch of the Happy Ghast among a number of other frequently requested features. In apost shared to the official Minecraft blog, all the details of the update were shared, alongside its Chase the Skies title. A release date was left out, but a lot of signs hint at it launching pretty soon. There's a huge amount of content to sink your teeth into within the Chase the Skies drop, and alongside a new mob, a number of useful items are getting new functionality too. Here's everything you need to know so you can prepare your world for such a significant update. The Chase the Skies update still doesn't have a concrete release date. However, the official blog post announcing the name for the drop did state the update is \"coming soon\", which suggests it could roll out over the next month. We know the Happy Ghast was originally planned to release around June, and since it features in this drop, we'd say it's safe to assume that window applies to this update as a whole. The highlights of the Chase the Skies update are: One of, if not the most anticipated feature of the Chase the Skies drop is theHappy Ghast. This mob gives you a new mode of transportation around the overworld, letting you and four friends hop on top to take to the skies together rather than having to run around on foot. As is the way with any mob in Minecraft, you'll need to spend some time taming it first. But it's well worth the effort going off the trailers and screenshots we've seen of it so far. The Chase the Skies drop also introduces a player locator bar. Gone are the days of begging your friends to stop running off when you head off on an adventure together. You'll now be able to use a bar that sits on top of your toolbar and below your health and hunger which shows you which direction your friends are in. So, if you need to rush in and help them if they've got themselves in yet another sticky situation, you won't have to pray they can find their coordinates in time now. Leads are also getting new functions. Rather than being a way to tie single mobs to fence posts, you can now use leads to chain multiple beasties together to create your own train of mobs, and the crafting recipe is getting simpler too. You'll only need string to craft them now, rather than having to hunt for slimeballs as well. What's more, if you're travelling by a Happy Ghast, you'll be able to attach a lead to a boat and then to your Ghast to make sure your mobs have a safe mode of transportation too. Saddles are also becoming craftable, which is huge for adventurers who have spent hours running around praying one pops up in a chest.Finally, the much anticipatedVibrant Visualsupdate is rolling out as part of Chase the Skies, bringing a well-needed visual overhaul to the game. It won't affect the gameplay, but there will be some new features added to the appearance of the game. For example, water has reflections, forests now feature shady patches, and fog will drift across different biomes. This section of the drop will only be available on Bedrock Edition devices, but fret not, there are plans for it to come to Java Edition eventually.

    "article_text": "Our witcheress is all grown up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We got a fresh glimpse ofThe Witcher 4during Epic's State of Unreal livestream today, showing a merchant having an incredibly unpleasant time at the hands of a manticore, and, oh, CDPR cinematic director Kajetan Kapuściński actually playing some Witcher 4. It must be said, it looks bloody gorgeous. Ciri and her horse—Kelpie, not Roach—have found themselves in Kovir, roaming around taking monster contracts and doing general Witcher stuff, but in Unreal Engine 5 this time. Our hardware team is cooking up an analysis of the tech on show, but my layman's opinion is that it looks swish as hell: Ciri's cloak deforms and rustles convincingly, the Koviri town Ciri rides into to conclude her contract is filled with life and people, and CDPR is giving us all what we want withrealistic third-person shoving. The demo feels a bit like a repeat of that Witcher 3 preview from way-back-when, the one where Geralt rides into Novigrad to claim the reward on a monster contract. After investigating the bloody aftermath of the manticore's attack on the merchant, she rides Kelpie back to the guy who hired her to give him the bad news. The twist is, of course, that when this guy gave Ciri the contract he told her he wanted news on a delayed salt shipment, and it didn't take our witcheress long to figure out he wasactuallyconcerned about the smuggled goods hidden in the cart. A pretty classic Witcher turn in the tale: the kind of thing that would have Geralt heave a world-weary sigh as he decides whether to help the guy out or not. We don't get a look at The Witcher 4's dialogue system, alas—the camera flies away from Ciri and the contract-giver's chat to show off some fish just when it looks like things might be reaching a decision point—but we do get quite a lot of Ciri's new voice actor, Ciara Berkeley, who's replacing Jo Wyatt from The Witcher 3. In the parts we hear, Berkeley does a great job—channelling an appropriate level of witcher-like exasperation without sounding like she's doing a knock-off Geralt or Witcher 3 Ciri. She's older and more experienced, having been doing this monster-hunting lark for a while now, and that comes across in the bit of Berkeley we get.

It feels like CDPR is drilling down into the sumptuous open-world feast that was The Witcher 3, but expanding and enhancing it using its last 10 years of experience and technological development. \"We are making this game to be the most immersive and ambitious open-world Witcher game ever,\" said CDPR's Sebastian Kalemba on stage.

    "article_text": "Portals never looked so good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Splitgate 2has been in its open beta for about a month, with the first-person arena shooter opening its doors at the beginning of Mayalongside \"a massive amount of new content\", and now developers 1047 Games are gearing up for its main release. If it seems like this happened in the blink of an eye, that's because it did. Not only has 1047 Games announced the official launch of Splitgate 2, but the date for the 1.0 release is just a few days away, on June 6. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together \"1047 Games also unleashed a surprisingly emotionalnew trailertoday to mark the game’s launch date, giving fans a touching look at the pressure and grit it takes to be a professional ace in the cutthroat, futuristic world of Splitgate,\" a press release says. The trailer offers a different perspective on what it means to play an FPS game. It sees someone from the Sabrask faction try to come to terms with the fact that every time they die, they just instantly come back, never getting to rest or join their loved ones in the next life. As the trailer progresses, the character does somewhat come to terms with his fate, deciding to put his feelings aside for the sake of his mission. Thanks to this, he begins to work better with his team, and they actually get the job done. I'd never really thought about the anguish the characters that I play go through when they resurrect after I get them killed. But after watching this trailer, I feel really bad for putting them through such an existential crisis thanks to my inability to learn from my mistakes. The words \"Get up\" are also shown at the end of the trailer, a good reminder for all my fellow competitive FPS players out there: You can't end on a loss. Emotional trailer aside, 1047 Games also wants to remind players that just because the official launch is just around the corner, it doesn't mean that they should toss the open beta aside. It'll keep going through to launch and offers \"the option to purchase sweet cosmetics for looking good while locking in, or to grab the Beta battle pass and get a head start on your stats.\" You'll also have plenty of time to complete the battle pass as it won't reset even after Splitgate 2 officially launches on June 6. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But that's not all, 1047 Games has one more surprise up its sleeve. \"1047 Games has yet to reveal the biggest part of Splitgate 2,\" a press release says. \"A massive surprise is still in store at the upcoming Summer Game Fest livestream.\" I'm not sure what this will entail, but considering how much 1047 Games put into Splitgate 2's open beta launch, I'm sure it'll be one to watch out for.

    "title": "Microsoft agrees that USB is a mess and it's making changes to fix it: 'Manufacturers can implement ports that look identical but differ wildly in functionality'",
    "article_text": "Finally, a good move from Microsoft. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you ever gone to plug in your USB Type-C cable to extend your display, ready for the glory of a second monitor, only for nothing to happen? Well, there's a good chance it's because your USB port isn't quite capable of doing so. Microsoft is implementing a new system to try and stop this problem. As announced in theMicrosoft USB Blog(which I've just discovered is a thing thanks toTom's Hardware), writerUgan-Sivagnanenthirarajahtalked a little about the rationale behind this decision and how Microsoft plan on implementing it. Microsoft has introduced new goals that suppliers looking to have Microsoft's stamp of approval must meet before being able to put Windows on their machines. Microsoft wants partners to make sure USB data, charging, and display capability \"just works\" on all its USB Type-C ports. Microsoft also makes sure its partners ensure that USB Type-C ports with 40 Gbps ports also \"give full compatibility with USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals.\" In order for hardware to launch with Windows 11, version 24H2, companies must achieve both goals, as well as following allother rules of the WHCP compatibility program. To ensure partners meet the standard of making sure USB ports just work, all WHCP-compliant hardware with USB Type-C must have USB-IF-certified silicon in their PC, and all devices plugged in must \"charge efficiently and consistently as every USB-C port on a certified PC needs to support USB Power Delivery charging.\" All Type-C ports must support DisplayPort Alt-Mode for connecting extra monitors and have to be \"validated using Microsoft's built-in USB controlling drivers.\" For a port to be certified as USB4, it must be capable of a 40 Gbps max data speed or more, must offer up to 15 W of power to accessories (with that being 7.5 W for tablets), has to support PC charging, must support a minimum of dual 4K at 60 Hz display, and has to have both PCIe support and Thunderbolt 3 compatibility. The testing process is implemented via Microsoft's HLK (Hardware Lab Kit), and \"OEMs, silicon vendors, and accessory brands run these HLK tests and submit logs to Microsoft. Any failure halts certification until the issue is resolved in hardware or firmware.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And if you're wondering why Microsoft is going through all this trouble—have you used a USB port on a modern PC lately? It's all kinds of bad, and the naming for each USB generation is just as bad. I just hope Microsoft's efforts are actually effective enough to do something about USB confusion. Microsoft points out that \"manufacturers can implement ports that look identical but differ wildly in functionality,\" so customers can be misled by the ports. This new process to implement standardized Type-C functionality is intended to give some clarity on that, and give assurance when you buy a WHCP-certified machine. This new process is a good thing for Microsoft to implement, and Microsoft is likely looking for a bit of a PR win right now. It fired just under7,000 employeesjust last month, andMicrosoft's Build conference was interrupted by protestsin regard to ties to the Israeli military, with further pressure fromBDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions).

    "article_text": "Bring this flying sea creature to the ground in the Augur expedition. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you knowhow to beat Maris, Fathom of Night, theAugurexpedition is remarkably easy—a bit of a boring slog, actually. But if you bring in the wrong team or don't know how to stop its wipe mechanic, then it'll be one of the toughest inElden Ring Nightreign. You have to beat a total of fourNightreign bossesbefore you can unlock the hidden final boss, so I'd recommend making Augur a top priority since they're one of the easiest once you understand their tricks. Below, I'll go over everything you need to know to put the sea beast in its place. Like other Nightlords, your work starts right away as you enter the expedition, where you should visit thebest rune farming routesand hunt forlegendary weapons. Here's how to best prepare for Maris throughout the Augur expedition: Inspired by sea creatures, it shouldn't be all that surprising that Maris is weak to lightning damage. Any attacks of this affinity deal bonus damage, so what's not to love about that? Unlike some of the other bosses,Gaping Jaw Adelin particular, there's no special interaction when using Maris' weakness, but the quicker the fight is over, the easier it is on your supply of healing items. You can also get a starting armament that deals lightning using the right relic, so check if you have one. Maris flies around the arena pretty much constantly, making them an absolute pain in the ass to fight as a melee character. I've tried it, and although I was successful, it took way longer than when I used ranged weapons. Because of this, even a non-lightning bow is better than a lightning sword in this fight. This is where thebest Nightreign Ironeye buildandbest Recluse buildreally shine. Specialising in ranged damage, these two are perfect for dishing out damage no matter where Maris is. If you're playing a traditionally melee character like Wylder or Raider, don't forget that you can use great bows since these scale on your strength stat. Likewise, Revenant and Duchess can also use magic, letting them deal damage at range too, and Executor can use a bow as well with his S-tier dex. Your biggest challenge in wrapping up the Augur expedition will be Maris' annoying sleep damage. While its sleep aura and teardrop attacks will likely wipe you out in one hit, having a higher sleep resistance is still invaluable. Your best bet for finding this is the \"all resistances up\" passive from defeating a Night boss, or the Clarifying Horn Charm talisman. Likewise, any magic damage negation you find also comes in handy. While the Augur expedition is pretty simple once you've got everything you need, I still recommend being at least level 10 if not 12 before facing Maris, mainly to increase your damage potential from higher scaling stats. Again, the quicker the fight, the less you're chasing Maris around and dragging the things out. Earn as many runes as you can and take out expedition bosses along the way for passive upgrades. You should also pick up as many flask charges as you can by visiting churches. Similar to fightingLibra in Equilibrious Beast, your team composition is one of the most important steps to get right, largely because Maris rarely stops flying around. So, here's who I recommend: While I'd recommend these characters over anyone else, you could also use Wylder (or even Raider) with a great bow since they scale on strength. Wylder's grappling hook is handy for mobility, while his ultimate can interrupt Maris' sleep attack, much like Ironeye. Now it's time to actually bring the pain to Maris, which largely involves peppering them with arrows, avoiding a few attacks, and countering one move in particular: Maris is generally quite a passive boss, flying around out of reach while summoning allies to wear you down. But there's one attack, the sleep aura, that you'll need to know how to stop before it's too late. If you're failing the Augur expedition, it's probably because of that. It's also worth noting that Maris doesn't really have a second phase; they just create more jellyfish and tentacles. I know I've already said it, but it's worth repeating: You need to counter Maris' AoE sleep attack using ultimate attacks, or you'll either die outright from the blast or inevitably die shortly after from a follow-up hit. Like fighting Libra, it's the most likely reason you'll fail, so it's worth saving your ultimates until the time is right, especially Ironeye's Single Shot to quickly prevent it at range. Since Maris turns the entire arena into a minefield thanks to its jellyfish and tentacle traps, you need to stay on the move almost constantly. Thankfully, you can still move while shooting with bows and even while casting spells. Alongside the obvious range advantage against this flying foe, mobility is important.

    "article_text": "Chalk another one up to the Digital Markets Act. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. All hail theEU's Digital Markets Act(DMA), which in recent years has been used by the bloc to force various tech giants into being a little more considerate of consumers. The DMA's latest glorious victory comes against Microsoft which, ever since September 2023, has been designated by the EU commission as a \"gatekeeper\" thanks to Windows: meaning it has to publish yearly compliance reports about how it's adhering to its obligations under the DMA. Which brings us to the good news. Microsoft has announced that, across the European Economic Area, Windows users will now have the option to uninstall the Microsoft Store. Should you choose to uninstall the Microsoft Store, any apps installed from it will remain and continue to be updated. That's not all: users will also no longer get those constant irritating prompts asking them to make Microsoft Edge their default browser (it'll still do this if you open Edge, but by then you've made your choice). A knock-on effect is that other Windows functionality, like the Widgets Board and Lock Screen, will now play nicely with your default browser and open that rather than trying to sneak in Edge. The various changes to Windows 10 and 11 within the EEA areoutlined in full here. Let's breathe in that European air, because it smells good: \"When Microsoft Edge is uninstalled, other Microsoft apps won’t prompt you to reinstall it in the EEA (excluding PWAs distributed in the Microsoft Store using Microsoft Edge technology).\" Jolly good show, wouldn't you say? These improvements to the user experience come after many more DMA-related concessions from Microsoft, including allowing users to uninstall Edge entirely and remove Bing results from Windows search. Microsoft even has to run its ownDMA compliance website, where you can read all about the things it's done to promote \"contestability and fairness in the digital sector.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "FF14 unofficial census finds what we were all pretty much feeling—before patch 7.25, Dawntrail's playerbase has likely been on the decline",
    "article_text": "Nearly 12 months for somethin' to do. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I concur with PC Gamer's Mollie Taylor, my fellow Final Fantasy 14 enjoyer on our illustrious staff, that FF14's Occult Crescent patch has madethe game feel like an MMO again. I actually got downright emotional, hopping into my first critical encounter and seeing swarms of strangers crowding around a chance to give a boss a beatdown: 'Oh,' I thought, 'I'm playing an MMO again'. But with that joy came a recognition ofalmost a full year of malaise, seeing desolate friend lists and linkshells lie empty. A malaise that, at least unofficially, has been backed up by numbers (thanks,Automaton). LuckyBancho has run anunofficial censusfor years—given these aren't official numbers from Square Enix, they should be taken with a hefty pinch of salt, but they aren't a bad temperature check for how the playerbase is doing. LuckyBancho compiles this census via the Lodestone, a character repository hosted by Square Enix. To determine whether a character is 'active' or not, they measure certain parameters against their prior survey results. These include things like changes in HP or XP, obtaining new minions or mounts, and the like. Their estimate of active accounts is roughly 950,000—and while this number can't be taken at exact face value, itissignificantly lower than their prior number of 990,000, obtained using the same methodology. LuckyBancho also has a different batch of data that tracks achievements, placing them into a graph. This information is obtained in quarterly segments, so it's not quite finished yet (the latest quarter will end in June) but there's a clear downward trend, and \"there has been no movement to reverse\" it since the last quarter. All of this info was obtained towards patch 7.25, which myself and Mollie are enjoying very much—and it'll be interesting to see if it injects some life back into Square Enix'smoney-making baby. And, to be clear, a game with almost 1 million players in it is by no means dead. But I can take a few good guesses as to why things've gotten this way. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. FF14 has a content release schedule problem—not just in the gaps between patches, but in the prioritisation of content itself. Dawntrail released with no repeatable midcore content—'Midcore' being defined as content where your brain is engaged, but you don't need tight communication or high mechanical skills. In World of Warcraft, these would be world quests, reputation grinds, delves, and (debatably) the early keystones of Mythic+. Instead Creative Studio 3 made, once again, the backwards decision to schedule all of this stuff nearly a year after the expansion's release, prioritising Savage Raids, Extreme Trials, and Ultimates over, you know, stuff that the majority of its playerbase is going to do. Anything that isn't that tier of difficulty was either mind-numbingly straightforward (FATEs, treasure dungeons, society quests, and new story dungeons) or on a weekly lockout (Alliance Raids and Normal Raids). There's also the elephant in the room that Square Enix basically doesn't know how to do world content. Dawntrail's zones are downright gorgeous and to be commended, and I have spent basically no time in them—I grinded out all my FATEs like a month after release, and then never left the main city again unless it's for treasure maps, gathering nodes, or society quests. You are either doing a specific dungeon or raid or trial, or you're doing nothing at all. Then there's the game's story—FF14 has historically been kept aloft by huge player investments in its narrative and, while the latest patches havemade huge improvements, the expansion as a wholehas missed the mark. You can read my full thoughts in those links, but that good will is truly fractured. Only time will tell if Square Enix can turn the good ship FF14 around, and navigate back to the glory days of Shadowbringers.

    "article_text": "Ok, one friend I can deal with. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ring Nightreignhas had a slightly tumultuous launch, at least for aFromSoftwaregame. Despite achieving a monumental2 million copies sold in just the first 24 hours, Nightreign also had a somewhat poor reception, with itgarnering Mixed user reviews on Steam(though it's since picked up to Mostly Positive). Since then, FromSoftware has gone into damage control mode.Nightreign's first major updatesaw big changes to its singleplayer, adding in an auto-resurrect and other buffs after admitting that the game wasn't really balanced with solo in mind.

Thank you for your support.\" The news of Duo Expeditions is music to my ears. When I first heard that Nightreign would be restricted to just three players or a solo runI was just as confused and irritated as everyone else. My partner and I had been so excited to play a FromSoftware game together that the idea of playing with a third wheel seemed like a letdown. Luckily, other players had already thought up a way around this problem, with someone going as far as tocreate a duo mod for Nightreign. Something that I'll probably only use for a short time, at least until I wait for the two-player update from FromSoft, becauseI honestly can't deal with playing alongside randoms for much longer.

Now I don't know what this will entail, but it can't be good. FromSoft does have a history ofnerfing difficult bosses post-launch, like with Promised Consort Radahn or the Elden Beast, but I can't help but feel like Nightreign's bosses are only going to get harder. For the record, the current roster of Nightlord bosses is already excruciatingly difficult. I've only defeated two out of the eight, so the idea of an 'enhanced fight' makes me want to curl up into a ball. But it's also very good motivation for me to push through and defeat as many as possible. Either the upcoming changes make them harder, and I've dodged a bullet, or it'll make them easier, and then I can brag to everyone that I don't need FromSoft's measly handouts.

    "title": "I tried the 'oops, all status effects' Executor loadout in Elden Ring Nightreign that turns his starting katana into a god-killing uber-sword—shockingly, it's pretty good",
    "article_text": "I feel like I'm ignoring half of the game, here. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Most of my time playingElden Ring Nightreignhas involved scrambling to piece together a good build out of the garbage the game gives me—I don't have good luck in roguelikes, you see. If I need a four in Balatro, I won't get one. But last night, cackling with glee as my starting sword gave my foes nearly every possible disease, I had finally beaten the game of fate: The only winning move, it turns out, was not to play. Elden RingNightreign's entire gimmick is the fact that you're rolling the dice on your loot. While your passives are key to your survival, getting a solid main weapon under your character's belt is vital—turns out, the community's found a build that circumvents this entire gameplay loop. After watching YouTuber and streamerYouwypull off alevel one victoryall on his lonesome, I knew I had to try this soloExecutor buildfor myself—mind, you need to knock over twoNightlordsto gain access to it, but once you're there, the setup solves itself. Your third relic slot can be dedicated to anything that's good on the Executor—I'm having some great fortune with the \"Partial restoration upon Post-Damage Attacks\" and \"Stamina recovers with each successful attacks\" modifiers, but really, anything works. These two relics set up your Executor's Blade—which already causes bleed—with both poisonandfrostbite buildup. The former comes from the Night of the Wise relic's \"starting armament inflicts poison\" while the latter comes from Night of the Miasma's Chilling Mist weaponskill, which adds Frostbite to your weapon for a time. What's more, both of these relics add attack power boosts while striking a frostbitten enemy or being in the vicinity of poison and scarlet rot. And you're going to be proccing all your status effects often because, well, you're an Executor. You have S scaling in Arcane. But Harvey, you might say, won't my starting weapon be out-scaled? The answer is \"yes, sort of\"—there are lots oflegendary weaponsthat are, strictly speaking, better on the Executor. But here's the thing: You might not get them. This build pretty much equips you with an A-tier weapon from the get-go, rather than the S-tier legendary armaments you could acquire. And when C's get degrees, A's are still pretty good. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is helped by the fact you can upgrade your starting weapon withsmithing stones, and they're not even that hard to get. Simply jaunt into a mine at least once in a session for a smithing stone 2, pass by a merchant for a smithing stone 1, and you're in business. The real boon here, though, is tempo—a term I am mercilessly borrowing from card games, but is very relevant here. Tempo refers to, unsurprisingly, the pace at which a game is played. Essentially, in the overarching metagame, a good weapon found early is more powerful than a good weapon found late—because an early-bird BIS will see you gathering more runes, killing more enemies, and getting more dicerolls on potent passives. As I experienced last night, chewing through a couple of Nightlords like they were taffy, this Executor loadout is akin to an \"aggro\" deck in something like Magic: The Gathering. You start out really strong—far and away more powerful than any of the early-game locations—and snowball by staying ahead of the curve. Its modularity's nothing to sniff at, too, based on what you get in your offhand—in one game, I got a tree sentinel shield with increased guard counters and a passive that had me explode in a holy aura when I landed one. In another, I simply stacked another very good Katana with even more bleed and frostbite in my offhand, then went to town. I would be shocked ifFromSoftwaredidn't patch this sucker out, and there are certainly Nightlords that this ultra-katana won't work on. But for now, I will be enjoying myself greatly—seeing three status effects tear my enemies asunder with the humblest of katanas.

    "article_text": "Oh well, looks like gaming GPUs are still going to be hard to come by. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Uncertainty thanks to wildly fluctuating tariffs might be making ithard to predict how much your next graphics card is going to cost. But apparently it hasn't stopped Taiwanese chip fab TSMC from cranking out as many GPUs as humanly possible. Speaking at TSMC's annual shareholder's meeting today (via Reuters), CEO C.C. Wei said tariffs had yet to significantly impact the company. \"I can assure you that AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply,\" Wei said. He did concede that TSMC isn't entirely immune to tariffs. \"Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters. TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down,\" he said. But as things stand, the company is still running at maximum production volume. One aspect of TSMC's operations that perhaps aren't going at full tilt, however, is itsinvestment in new production facilities or fabs in the US. Reuters says Wei and President Trump have discussed difficulties in completing TSMC's full investment program, which totals $165 billion, within five years. Apparently, part of the problem is that tariffs increase the cost of production in the US because some equipment required to build out the fabs has to be imported from Asia. Wei says that President Trump told him, \"Mr Wei, do your best, that's good enough.\" Anywho, if you've been wondering whether there's any chance that tariffs might somehow conspire to make GPUs for gaming a little easier to come by, perhaps courtesy of reducing demand for AI chips, that doesn't seem to be the case. That said, outside of the US, many if not most of Nvidia's GPUscan now be had at MSRP or even lower. So, it does look like graphics card pricing is finally trending towards something approaching normality. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It is, of course, very hard to say what will happen next. TheUS courts seem to be moving closer to putting guard railsaround the more volatile elements of Trump's tariff fluctuations. But until that emerging dispute has been escalated all the way to the Supreme Court, it's impossible to say how it will all play out. Put it this way, you'd be very brave to say it's game over for Trump's tariff escapades.

    "article_text": "Your one-stop shop for transforming Strangelings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you start to collect and transform Strangelings inFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, you'll very quickly realise just how challenging findingCelestia's Giftscan be. These little flowers are the only way you'll be able to transform the Buddies you find along the way, but are basically exclusive to one specific location which you need to visit throughout the game. Scavenging for Celestial's Gifts only really becomes an issue once you've completed chapter three, when you'll start finding more Strangelings around the map and taking them back to your Base Camp to transform. Here's what you need to do to make sure you've always got plenty of these flowers on hand. You can get Celestia's Gifts by: Celestia's Gifts willonly spawn in the overworld on your Base Camp islandafter you've placed and built your first islander home. They are small blue flowers that tend to grow in clusters, which makes them a lot easier to spot amongst the other fauna in Fantasy Life i. A single bloom will give you anywhere between three and six flowers when picked, too. So don't worry, you won't have to wait to collect 100 individual plants to transform one Strangeling. The only catch is that these flowers onlyspawn once a day, so when you've picked every single one, there's a pretty hefty wait before you can continue harvesting. Luckily, you can alsoearn Celestia's Gifts by completing tasks on the bulletin boardnext to the Guild on the same island. You won't get the flower every time you level up via this board, but every now and then you'll be rewarded with some blossoms to save you picking them yourself. Similarly, when you've unlocked the Guild Office, you'll be able tocomplete daily tasks in return for a handful of them at a time. These tasks are by no means challenging, they're more often than not things like chopping trees orcatching fish. Basically just tasks to keep you busy and your skills improving while you play, which explains why the reward is so low for completing them. But hey, when you're caught in a pinch and need an extra few flowers this can be a real help. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "RIP my 4070 Super. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you have the might of an RTX 4090 powering your rig, theHell is Ussystem requirements suggest you will be able to run the game at Ultra settings at 4K, aiming for 30 fps average. Curiously, system requirements are all inclusive of upscaling. That's, well, not great, but there is a little nuance as to why Hell is Us' publisher has announced those numbers and what they mean. Ahead of its release on September 4, the Hell is Us teamtook to Xto announce the game's system requirements. Notably, it's a wider spread of settings than many system requirements, ranging from 1080p 30 fps on Medium settings, going all the way up to 4K 30 fps on Ultra, over five separate recommendation settings. To run the game on minimum, you will need at least anIntel Core i7 7700K/AMD Ryzen 3 3300Xwith either anNvidia GTX 1070orAMD RX 5600 XT. Alongside this, you will need 30 GB of free space on an SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Considering it's run in Unreal Engine 5, these specs don't seem too bad. Recommended specs suggest an Intel Core i7 11700K /AMD Ryzen5 7600 and either anNvidia RTX 2080 Tior anAMD RX 6750 XT. This will get you a performance of 1080p on High settings, with an average fps of 60. It's the Ultra settings that seem the most out of place here. The CPU doesn't change from recommended, and neither does the memory, but you are expected to have anNvidia RTX 4090orAMD RX 7900 XTXto run the game on Ultra settings at 4K, averaging 30 fps.

In that, the Hell is Us team shared what kind of upscaling is present in these system requirements. The game uses TSR (Unreal Engine's own Temporal Super Resolution upscaling), and Low settings use 50% upscaling, where Ultra uses 10%. It also supports DLSS, XeSS, and FSR, but the upscaling mentioned here is only Unreal's upscaling. Hell is Us is built on Unreal Engine 5, which is an engine infamous for being a bit tough on hardware, thanks in part to fancy reflection and lighting engines. The game is being developed by Rogue Factor, which previously released games likeMordheim: City of the DamnedandNecromunda: Underhive Wars. Hell is Us, unlike those previous two games, is an entirely original work, and it made quite an impression after years of silence atSony's State of Play in Septemberlast year. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The team has clarified that the system requirements are \"ideal specs\" and it \"doesn’t mean you can’t run the game on lower settings\". The team continues: \"We’d rather be cautious than risk disappointing players by overpromising.\" If you're worried your rig can't run in or don't quite trust those figures, you can download a demo for the game via theHell is Us Steam pageright now and test it for yourself.

    "article_text": "An essential crafting material you're bound to need at some point. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The world ofFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Timeis littered with materials you'll need for crafting. Whether you're after a new weapon, new armor, or even some new furniture,animal hideis one of those resources you'll come back to time and time again. It's one of the first you'll pick up, so it's used in a lot of early game crafts. But luckily, that means it's a lot more accessible than some of the other crafting materials you'll require later down the line.You don't need to have progressed very far to get ahold of animal hide, nor do you need to have a specific Life to gather it, unlike a skill likefishing in Fantasy Life i. As long as you've completed what is essentially the beginning of the game, you'll have the ability to gather animal hide. It's just a case of knowing which enemies to target. Here's what you need to do. Animal hide has a chance of dropping when youdefeat Red Wolves or Tunoco Lizards in the Capital of Mysteria. These are the easiest enemies to target first since they are low level, and probably the first beasties you'll come across in the game. When you've progressed a bit further, you'll beable to get animal hide fromGoldmeer and Cashmeer in Lulab Foresttoo.If you don't want to practise your combat skills though, you'll also be able tobuy animal hide from the Material Shop in the Capital of Mysteria. It's obviously a little more expensive to gather the material this way, since it will cost you 50 Dosh a piece, but if you've got a project you want to complete and don't want to go out hunting, it's undeniably a lot more convenient. There's also a chance to get animal hide from chests if lady luck is on your side. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Nvidia's new Arm-based APU rumoured to launch in an Alienware laptop later this year with RTX 4070 mobile performance and 'breakthrough' power efficiency",
    "article_text": "Nvidia's Arm chip said to match an RTX 4070 laptop's gaming performance at barely more than half the power consumption. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia's long-rumoured APU for gaming laptopsdidn't emerge at the recent Computex show. But now there's talk that it could appear by the end of the year powering a newAlienwarelaptop and offer gaming performance on par with a RTX 4070 mobile GPU while consuming barely more than half the power. According to a report in theUnited Daily News, a Taiwanese outlet, the new APU will launch either in the final quarter of 2025 or early in 2026. As previously rumoured, it's said Nvidia is producing the new chip in co-operation with MediaTek, the latter being a specialist in designing chips with Arm cores. Intriguingly, the UDN story claims the new chip sports, \"a customized Arm architecture CPU.\" One of the big unknowns with Nvidia's upcoming APU is the question of whether it uses off-the-shelf CPU cores designed by Arm or whether Nvidia has designed its own cores that are compatible with the Arm instruction set. By way of example, Apple has taken the latter approach with its M series chips and currently produces what are widely agreed to be the most efficient CPU cores currently available as a consequence. Arm's in-house CPU designs are decent enough, but Nvidia-designed CPU cores would certainly be more exciting. The UDN story implies the cores will indeed be Nvidia designed, but that is yet to be proven. Up top we mentioned how this new Nvidia chip is going into an Alienware gaming laptop. That begs two immediate questions. First, what kind of graphics hardware will it have? Second, how will it cope with existing games designed for x86 CPUs from Intel and AMD rather than Arm cores? UDN answers the first query in part, saying that the chip will offer an integrated GPU based on Nvidia's latestBlackwellarchitecture as used by various RTX 50 generation GPUs,such as the RTX 5070. The publication goes on to say that the chip offers, \"the same level of performance as a 120 W RTX 4070 notebook,\" but does so at just 65 W and will therefore represent a \"breakthrough\" in power efficiency that will enable smaller and lighter gaming laptops. If that sounds exciting, the perennial problem of software compatibility remains. The chip will presumably run Windows on Arm and therefore rely on Microsoft's Prism translation layer to support legacy PC games designed for x86 CPUs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Thus far Prism has been a bit hit and misswhen running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Arm chips for PCs. You would expect Nvidia to offer superior drivers for its Arm chip, but doubts remains over the basic approach of x86 emulation for running games. Of course, if anyone can encourage game developers to release native Arm versions of various titles and entirely sidestep the emulation problem, it'll be Nvidia. So, if any company can make PC gaming on an Arm-based CPU viable, it's probably Nvidia. But there's still much to be proven. Further details like the cost of the new device are also unknown. But the basic proposition of a more portable gaming laptop with much improved battery life is undeniably exciting. Nvidia's CEO haspreviously confirmed that an Arm-based APU for PCs is definitely coming. So, we can't wait to see what team green has come up with. Best CPU for gaming: Top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game first.

    "article_text": "The one question everyone always asks. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Learning different skills is an integral part ofFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time,and knowinghow to fishfalls among that. Even though you can make your way deep into the story without having to worry about fishing, it'll come in handy while you're running around completing requests for the townsfolk or even if you're looking to gather some ingredients. As you wander through the different worlds of Fantasy Life i, each body of water will have different fish shadows branded with different levels—much like every other material you'll come across. But you won't be able to cast a line immediately, and you need to complete a pretty meticulous process before you can start your journey to become the best angler in Reveria. You need totake on (in other words, accept) the Life of Angler from Auntie Anne in the Guildbefore you can fish on your own. Don't worry, you don't need to dedicate any serious time to the Life if you're not the biggest fan of fishing. In fact, you only really need to complete the tutorial challenges before you're left to your own devices. You'll be given a rented fishing rod straight away, which means every time you approach abody of water with fish shadows, you'll be able to press the F key to cast a line. When the fish bites, press the same key to reel it in. Fishing is a great way to earn some extra Dosh too, especially if you're managing to bring in the higher-level critters. Of course, if you're diving straight into the deep end and trying to catch a level five fish while you're still level one, you will be faced with more of a challenge. But dedicating even a small amount of time to the skill will help you be able to face the bigger fish without worrying about your line snapping. You're not stuck being an Angler either, even if it's the first Life you pick. Once you've graduated from novice to fledgling, you can change your Life through Auntie Anne. You'll still have the ability to fish at bodies of water regardless of what Life you pick next. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "A sneaky typo could hand your system to hackers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new supply chain attack has revealed how something as innocuous as a typo can open the door to serious cybersecurity threats, experts have warned. A report fromCheckmarxclaims malicious actors are using clever tricks to deceive developers into downloading fake packages, which can then give hackers control of their systems. The attackers primarily target users of Colorama, a popularPythonpackage, and Colorizr, a similar tool used in JavaScript (NPM). “This campaign targets Python and NPM users on Windows andLinuxvia typosquatting and name-confusion attacks,” said Ariel Harush, a researcher at Checkmarx. The attackers use a technique called typosquatting. For example, instead of “colorama,” a developer might accidentally type “col0rama” or “coloramaa” and download a harmful version. These fake packages were uploaded to the PyPI repository, which is the main source of Python libraries. “We've found malicious Python (PyPI) packages as part of a typosquatting campaign. The malicious packages allow for remote control, persistence, etc.,” said Darren Meyer, Security Research Advocate at Checkmarx. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! What makes this campaign unusual is that the attackers mixed names from different ecosystems, useing names from the NPM world (JavaScript) to trick Python users. This cross-platform targeting is rare and suggests a more advanced and potentially coordinated strategy. The Windows and Linux payloads have similar upload timings and naming but use different tools, tactics, and infrastructure, which means they may not be from the same source. Once installed, the fake packages can do serious damage - on Windows systems, themalwarecreates scheduled tasks to maintain persistence and harvest environment variables, which could include sensitive credentials. It also attempts to disable even thebest antivirussoftware using PowerShell commands like Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true. On Linux systems, packages like Colorizator and coloraiz carry encoded payloads to create encrypted reverse shells, communicate via platforms like Telegram and Discord, and exfiltrate data to services like Pastebin. These scripts are not executed all at once; they are designed for stealth and persistence, using techniques like masquerading as kernel processes and editing rc.local and crontabs for automatic execution. Though the malicious packages have been removed from public repositories, the threat is far from over. Developers should be very careful when installing packages because even thebest endpoint protection platformsstruggle with these evasive tactics. Always double-check the spelling and make sure the package comes from a trusted source. Checkmarx recommends that organizations audit all deployed and deployable packages, proactively examine application code, scrutinize private repositories, and block known malicious names.

    "article_text": "Ricoh's third Theta model is the premium pick, for professional applications When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ricoh says it has completed its 360 camera lineup after announcing the new Ricoh360 Theta A1, which is the premium pick of three models, following the Z1 and X iterations. While it can record 360-degree images, it's best not to think of the Theta A1 as a directInsta360 X5/GoPro Maxrival, but more as a decent alternative to some of thebest timelapse cameras, primarily designed for professional use cases, but with complete 360-degree coverage. For one, the Theta A1 is waterproof, rustproof, and is housed in an extreme temperature-resistant casing. It also has a long-lasting battery life and is equipped with a range of video codecs designed for long-term recording, minimizing file sizes and power consumption. Its image-making skills include 60MP stills,8Kvideo at a maximum 10fps and down to 2fps with data rates as low as 8Mbps, plus 2K and4Klive streaming. Unlike other Theta models, the Theta A1 doesn't have a touch display, which makes it trickier to handle for on-the-move recording. Coupled with its modest frame rates, it's firmly planted in the professional field; essentially, the Theta A1 is designed to carry out long-term recording on location, including timelapses on construction sites. In the product announcement, Ricoh has outlined three professional environment use cases for the Theta A1's 360-degree skills: promotion and communication, progress monitoring and remote inspection, and documentation and auditing. In plain speak, these applications cover everything from visual tours, interactive floorplans, regular capture of construction sites or industrial facilities for plan compliance checks, plus insurance, quality control, and maintenance with complete 360-degree coverage. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Like other Theta models, the A1 is compatible with the Ricoh360 app, which offers functions such as remote shooting, cloud storage, plus footage edits and sharing. What's not clear yet is the Theta A1's price or availability. Ricoh touts pre-orders for later this month, with pricing to follow. For context, the Theta Z1 costs $1,150 / £1,150, while the Theta X for consumers is $600 / £750. Expect the Theta A1 to come in north of the Z1. Tim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

    "title": "Some employers won't like this: the most productive staff are working shorter sprints and taking longer breaks",
    "article_text": "Productive workdays are no longer about stamina When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The long-held belief that working longer hours leads to higher productivity is facing increasing scrutiny, after new research claimed quite the opposite. A new study by DeskTime challenges this conventional wisdom, revealing shorter work sessions combined with longer breaks may correlate with higher levels of output. The study found the most productive employees now follow a 75/33 work-to-rest ratio, working for 75 minutes followed by a 33-minute break. This represents a significant increase in rest time compared to DeskTime’s original 52/17 ratio reported a decade ago. This means that in an 8-hour workday, current-day productive employees will need about two hours and twenty-seven minutes (147 minutes) of rest. The rest time is higher than the 118 minutes given to productive employees for the same workday ten years ago. This revelation may not sit well with employers who equate productivity with endurance rather than efficiency. However, the shift to a 75/33 cycle in 2025 may reflect how hybrid or in-office work fosters more balanced work habits. “When DeskTime conducted the work/break ratio study back in 2021, we saw that working from home had immensely impacted workers’ ability to draw a line between work and life,” said Artis Rozentals, CEO of DeskTime. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “Now, our latest productivity research shows we’re returning to more balanced working habits. Given the prevalence of hybrid work, the new 75/33 ratio may be linked to working in-office again.” Indeed, in-office work naturally introduces more breaks through informal interactions and social moments. These may appear counterproductive on the surface, but could be essential for mental rejuvenation. “The hybrid model is the Goldilocks choice, as it best leverages both the in-office social dynamic and the deep focus afforded by remote work,” Rozentals added. As a result, companies usingemployee monitoring softwaremay need to reconsider how they define “productive behavior.” To identify top performers, DeskTime analyzed the top 10% of users with the highest ratio of time spent in productive applications. This group - comprising 6,000 individuals - served as the benchmark for the study’s findings. Unlike many metrics that rely on generalized definitions, DeskTime’s approach to productivity is more tailored. The software allows users to define which applications are considered productive based on their specific roles. However, since the data is based on software-tracked activity, it raises questions about the nuances such tools may overlook. Platforms that offer quantitative insights, liketask management platforms, often fail to capture the full picture, especially when so-called “idle” time includes thinking, strategizing, or informal collaboration.

    "title": "We're all on AI time now and you better get used to it",
    "article_text": "The pace of AI development is \"unprecedented,\" and if you're hoping it'll slow down, I've got bad news When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"We're on AI time,\" that's what I tell people now when they try to comprehend the rapid pace of AI and all connected technologies, advancements. Even though it's been just two and a half years sinceOpenAIunleashedChatGPTon the world, I've known intuitively for months that in the world of technology, we are no longer operating onMoore's Law: the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. This is now AI Model Law, in which generative model capabilities are doubling every three months. Even if you don't believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) are developing at that pace, there's no denying the unprecedented speed of adoption. A new report (or rathera 340-page presentation) from Mary Meeker, a general partner at BOND investments, paints the clearest picture yet of the transformative nature of AI and how it's unlike any other previous tech epoch. \"The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data,” wrote Meeker and her co-authors. One stat in particular stood out to me: It took Google nine years to reach 365 billion annual searches. ChatGPT reached the same milestone in two years. Meeker's presentation illustrates something I've been trying to articulate for some time. There's never been a time quite like this. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I've lived through some big tech changes: The rise of personal computing, the switch from analog to digital publishing tools, and the online revolution. Most of this change was gradual, though, granted, it did feel rapid at the time. I first saw digital publishing tools in the mid-1970s, and it wasn't until the middle-to-late 1980s that many of us made the switch, which is also around the time personal computers started to arrive, though they wouldn't become ubiquitous for at least another decade. AI Time leaves little time, I think, for self-reflection. With the public internet arriving in 1993, it would be years before most people were on broadband. Knowledge workers didn't rise up immediately. Instead, there was a slow and steady shift in the workforce. I'd say we had a decade of solid adjustment before the Internet and its associated systems and platforms became an inexorable part of our lives. I still remember just how confused the average person was by the Internet. On The Today Show in 1994, the hosts literally asked aloud,\"What is the Internet?\"AI and platforms like ChatGPT,Copilot,Claude AI, and others haven't met with the same level of confusion. Meeker's report notes that ChatGPT users skyrocketed from zero in October 2020 to 400M in late 2024 and 800M in 2025. A shocking 20M people are paying subscribers. It took decades to convince people to pay for any content on the Internet, but for AI, people are already lining up with their wallets open. I suppose the rise of the internet and ubiquitous and mobile computing might have prepared us for the AI Era. It's not as if artificial intelligence appeared out of the blue. Then again, it sort of did. Almost a decade ago, we were marveling at IBM's Deep Blue,the first AI to beat a Chess Grandf Master, Gary Kasparov. That was followed in 2005 by an autonomous carcompleting the DARPA challenge. A decade after that, we saw DeepMind AlphaGobeat the world's best Go player. Some of these developments were startling, but they were arriving at a relatively digestible pace. Even so, things started to pick up in 2016, and various groups began sounding the warning bells about AI. No one was publicly using the terms \"LLM\" or \"generative.\" Still, the concern was such that IBM,Amazon, Facebook,Microsoft, and Google's DeepMind formed the nonprofitPartnership on AI,which was intended to \"address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society.\" Thatgroup still exists, though, I'm not sure anyone is paying attention to its recommendations. AI Time leaves little time, I think, for self-reflection. A 2016 Stanford University Study on AI in 2030 (no longer available online) noted that \"Contrary to the more fantastic predictions for AI in the popular press, the Study Panel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to humankind.” Meeker's presentation, though, presents an accelerated picture that, I think, does raise some cause for concern, with one caveat: the predictions come from ChatGPT (which is an even greater cause for concern). By 2030, for instance, it predicts AI's ability to create full-length movies and games. I'd sayGemini's Veo 3 is proofwe're well on our way. It promises AI's ability to operate human-like robots. I would add that AI time has acceleratedhumanoid robotic developmentin a way I, in my 25 years of covering robotics, have never seen before. It says AI will build and run autonomous businesses. In 10 years, ChatGPT believes AI will be able to simulate human-like minds. If we remember that ChatGPT, like most LLMs, bases most of its knowledge on the known universe, I think we can assume that these predictions are, if anything, underambitious. Even AI doesn't know what we don't know. There was some argument in the office that I had the equation wrong. There is no AI Model Law, there's justHuang's Law(for Jensen Huang, founder and CEO ofNvidia). This law predicts a doubling of GPU performance at least every two years. Without the power of those processors, AI stalls. Maybe, but I think that the power of these models has yet to catch up with the processing power provided by Nvidia's GPUs. Huang is simply building for a future in which every person and business wants GPU-based generative power. That means we need more processors, more data, and development leaps to prepare for models to come. However, model development in real-time is not hindered by GPU development. Those generative updates are happening far faster than silicon advancements. If you accept that there is a thing such as AI Time and that the AI Model Law (heck, let's call it \"Ulanoff's Law\") is a real thing, then it's easy to accept ChatGPT's view of our impending reality.

    "title": "Billions of Chrome users at risk from new data-stealing browser vulnerability - here's how to stay safe",
    "article_text": "Chromium users on Debian remain vulnerable, with no fix yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A newly uncovered zero-day vulnerability which affects both Windows and Linux systems could put billions of Google Chrome and Chromium users at serious risk of data theft, experts have warned. Researchers fromWazuhclaim this flaw - tracked as CVE-2025-4664 - has already drawn urgent attention due to its ability to leak sensitive cross-origin data such as OAuth tokens and session identifiers without user interaction. The flaw, identified in the Loader component of Chrome and Chromiumbrowsers, relates to how these browsers process the Link HTTP header for sub-resource requests like images or scripts. Unlike other mainstream browsers, Chrome honors the referrer-policy directive even on sub-resources. This behavior allows a malicious site to inject a lax policy, such as unsafe-url, effectively leaking full URLs, including sensitive data, to third-party domains. This kind of exploit bypasses conventional browser defenses and directly undermines common security assumptions in web infrastructure. Wazuh claims it can detect and mitigate this flaw via its Wazuh Vulnerability Detection module, which uses data from its Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) service to monitor software versions and raise alerts when vulnerable packages are found. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! In a lab environment set up using Wazuh OVA 4.12.0, security researchers demonstrated how endpoints runningWindows 11and Debian 11 could be scanned to identify whether they were running vulnerable versions of Chrome or Chromium. As noted in Wazuh’s dashboard, users are instructed to add the query CVE-2025-4664 to quickly isolate impacted systems, with the module updating the vulnerability status from \"Active\" to \"Solved\" once mitigation steps are verified. Google has issued an emergency patch to address the issue on Windows and Gentoo Linux systems. Users on these platforms are advised to update their browsers immediately. For Chromium users on Debian 11, all versions up to 120.0.6099.224 remain vulnerable, and no updated package has yet been released. Users are encouraged to uninstall the browser until a patched version becomes available. Despite these swift actions, the broader concern remains: how can users and enterprises reliably protect themselves against browser-based zero-day exploits? Applying patches is essential, but relying solely on browser updates can leave significant gaps. For this reason, it is recommended to useendpoint protection platforms, along with malware protection andantivirussolutions, to stay safe. These tools provide layered defenses that go beyond browser vulnerabilities, offering real-time detection and containment of exploit attempts.

    "title": "AMD looks like it’s losing the GPU war based on new Steam survey, with Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti proving itself to be popular already",
    "article_text": "AMD’s RX 9070 models have still yet to appear in Steam survey When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti GPU has only been out for a month and a half, but it’s already established itself as a better-selling graphics card thanAMD’s RX 9070 models, according to the latest Steam hardware survey for May. In fact, asVideoCardz highlighted, AMD’s new RDNA 4 GPUs still haven’t yet managed to appear anywhere on the list of themost popular graphics cards,going by therigs of Steam gamers, whereas the RTX 5060 Ti is on 0.21% market share after less than two months. That’s the second biggest gain of the month, behind only the RTX 5070, which picked up 0.33% of GPU market share to end up on 0.71%. The RTX 5080 also crept up to 0.47%, a gain of 0.09% for the month of May. With the RTX 5070 Ti increasing by 0.11% to a total of 0.38%, the RTX 5000 family accounts for 1.77% of all gaming PCs on Steam, as per this snapshot from last month. Whereas AMD’s RX 9070 models have yet to gain any percentage points in the Survey, despite being launched at the beginning of March, three months ago. Of course, take the results from one survey with an appropriate amount of caution, although this month doesn’t appear to have been affected by any regional-based oddities. Sometimes, we can see a significant shift in the number of PCs included from Asia, which have different hardware preferences, and this can cause specific GPUs to appear as if they’ve gained popularity, when in fact it's merely a reflection of the survey respondents' makeup. Why are AMD’s RX 9070 models flailing around in terms of their inability to make an impact on Valve’s survey? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That’s a tricky question to answer, but in some part, it may be down to supply levels and pricing. The RX 9070, and particularly the 9070 XT, have suffered from low stock of graphics cards at the MSRP. There are models on shelves, but the pricing is inflated, and you’ll be paying quite a bit more. At the time of writing in the US, the 9070 XT commands around $800, the plain 9070 about $650, at their cheapest pricing. Despite theglowing reviews of the 9070 XT, the premium price puts this GPU well out of reach for the average PC owner. And pretty much ditto for thevanilla 9070– or at least it puts the brakes on sales in a considerable way. The thing about the RTX 5060 Ti is that you can pick one up for as little as $390, so that’s a big difference. Okay, so it’s a different class of GPU, granted (xx70 versus xx60), and the cheaper RTX 5060 Ti models with 8GB of video RAM (VRAM) also have a sting in the tail with that lean allocation of VRAM. Meaning performance is not as good as the 16GB version of this Nvidia graphics card, which is priced close to $500 or so (all pricing is correct at the time of writing). Still, the average gamer may not care much about these performance differences. And indeed, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB will suffice if all you’re interested in is playing some less demandingPC gamesat 1080p resolution without maxing out graphics options. Present this graphics card with more challenging gaming workloads for its VRAM loadout, though, and you’ve got problems, at least if you want higher graphics details, even at 1080p resolution – you’ll be looking at using medium details. As noted, though, this may not matter to a typical buyer who just wants to be able to afford a new, cutting-edge graphics card, and is happy to go with an RTX 5060 Ti because it sounds close(-ish) enough to an RTX 5070 on paper, without fully understanding the wrinkles around VRAM if plumping for the 8GB spin. This alsoapplies very much to the RTX 5060, of course, which has 8GB as well. It'll be interesting to see if the plain RTX 5060 soon debuts in the Steam hardware survey – it has faced a lot of criticism and flak, to say the least – and indeed we have AMD’s incoming RX 9060 models, which are now imminent. The pricing and availability of those more affordable RDNA 4 graphics cards will, of course, be key, and while Team Red has pitched theMSRPs at a nicely affordable level, will that translate with the actual prices on shelves? That’s exactly whathasn’thappened with the RX 9070 models (yet), and it’ll be the crucial factor for this next RDNA 4 launch.

    "title": "Five things we learned from The Witcher 4's technical demo",
    "article_text": "I need it now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In case you missed it, the State of Unreal 2025 event kicked off today, and began with a keynote from CD Projekt Red and atechnical demo for its upcoming gameThe Witcher 4. The Witcher 4was only revealed a few months ago, and it looks like itwon't be arriving until 2027 at the earliest, but thankfully, today's new footage has given us just enough to get by while we wait. There are a bunch of notable things to unpack from the almost 10-minute showcase, from a new region, fancy Unreal Engine 5 tech, and a new companion, but I've managed to pick out the top five things that stood out to me the most. Just like Geralt of Rivia had Roach inThe Witcher3: Wild Hunt, it seems that inThe Witcher4,Ciri will have her own horse friend named Kelpie to keep her company along her journey. Kelpie originates from The Witcher novels and was first owned by a man named Hotspurn before the mare came into Ciri's care. The black mare was initially unnamed until Ciri saw her and Hotspurn crossing a river, after which Ciri named her Kelpie. From the footage, it looks like Ciri will be able to call her horse to her by whistling, like Geralt does to Roach. Interestingly, in the books, Kelpie could be summoned by rubbing a magical bracelet, but it's unclear if this tidbit will be added to the game. Since Ciri and Kelpie will be exploring the world together, CD Projekt Red explained that riding needs to \"feel seamless, natural, and just fun\". To support that, the studio has introduced something called \"multi-character motion matching\" in Unreal Engine 5, making the pair \"perfectly synchronized\" when mounting from any angle and speed. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Hopefully, Kelpie won't wander off and find herself stuck on a roof like Roach. When The Witcher 4 was initially revealed, CD Projekt Red confirmed thatthe game will introduce new regions of the Continent, but that the map will remain \"more or less the same\" size as The Witcher 3\". In the latest tech demo, we were provided with our first look at Kovir, a mountainous region filled with dense forests and snowy cliffs. The footage also showed us our first look at the region's port town of Valdrest, which is teeming with NPCs. In The Witcherlore, the northern region is famous for its glass industries and was once an earldom of Redania, but now forms a part of the kingdom of Kovir and Poviss. According to CD Projekt Red, the latest tech demo is running on a base PlayStation 5 at 60 FPS, with ray tracing enabled. At first, I thought the footage was from a high-end PC or even a PS5 Pro, so it's hard to believe that a game that looks this good could handle a current-gen console. Although it wasn't stated during the event, CD Projekt Red has since clarified (viaVGC) that the footage was a tech demo set inThe Witcher 4world, and wasn'tThe Witcher 4gameplay, suggesting that what we saw won't be connected to the narrative. \"This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology poweringThe Witcher 4– but notThe Witcher 4itself,\" a spokesperson told VGC. \"It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration withEpic Gamesto push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. \"We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer and FastGeo Streaming that are helping shape the future of The Witcher.\" Before the technical demo kicked off, the keynote started with a short cinematic showing a group of men from Korviso and their shipments of salt being attacked in the middle of the night by a monster called a Manticore. As the scene transitions to Ciri, we see that she has been tasked with investigating the missing men and shipment by a Valdrest local, and presumably, hunt and kill the creature. Initially, I thought this quest could be set at the beginning of the game to give players a sense of their surroundings and to get familiar with mechanics, similar to Geralt's quest to hunt the Griffon at the start ofThe Witcher 3. However, considering the footage isn't actualWitcher 4gameplay, and instead just a tech demo set in the world ofThe Witcher 4, it's unclear if this quest and the Manticore will make an appearance in the full game. Since this demo was showcased at the State of Unreal 2025 event, we were sure to get a lot of juicy technical details about what exactly is makingThe Witcher 4look so good. All features mentioned are being developed, tested, and will eventually be released to all Unreal Engine developers, starting with today’s Unreal Engine 5.6 release. These include the new Unreal Animation Framework, Nanite Foliage rendering, and MetaHuman technology with Mass AI crowd scaling, which are being utilized to help deliver an immersive world at 60 FPS without compromising on quality. The Unreal Animation Framework powers realistic character movements in busy scenes, which we can see in action in the port town of Valdrest, while FastGeo Streaming, developed in collaboration with Epic Games, allows environments to load quickly and smoothly. Nanite Foliage is being used as a way to make environments look and feel more realistic, allowing developers to fill forests and fields with dense detail without sacrificing performance. Then there's the Mass system, which handles large, dynamic crowds easily, and ML Deformer, which adds subtle, realistic touches to character animations, \"right down to muscle movement\", like was demonstrated with Kelpie.

Also Poland has failed in its attempt to find an agreement on the controversial child sexual abuse (CSAM) scanning bill. As reported by digital rights groupNetzpolitik, the Polish Presidency is the latest EU Council to give up after being unable to secure the necessary majority among EU members. The bill seeks to require all messaging services in Europe to scan users' chats, even if they're encrypted. That said, what's been deemed by critics asChat Controlmay not be off the table just yet. On July 1, 2025, Denmark is set to take charge of the EU Presidency until December. A strong supporter of Chat Control, experts at Netxpolitik expect Denmark to push ahead with the proposal.

To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn \"No agreement could be reached during the meeting,\" reads the summary (as published by Netxpolitik) of the final meeting held by the Polish Presidency on the matter on May 23, 2025. The EU Commission first unveiled the proposal in May 2022 as a solution to the spread of CSAM content. Since then, the proposal has seen many twists and turns, but many experts and politicians alike have warned against the privacy and security risks of undermining encrypted communications. As per its first version, all messaging software providers, no matter if they use encryption, would have been required to perform indiscriminate scanning of private messages on the lookout for CSAM – so-called 'client-side scanning'. Backlash among the industry and even among the EU political benches – the European Court of Human Rightsbanned all legal efforts to weaken encryptionof secure communications in Europe at the beginning of 2024, in fact – brought lawmakers to adjust the wording. Last June,Belgium then proposed a new textto target only shared photos, videos, and URLs, upon users' permission. Encryptionis a technology that the likes of WhatsApp, Signal, ProtonMail, and even thebest VPNapps use to scramble users' messages into an unreadable form to prevent unauthorized access. Put simply, end-to-end encryption guarantees that our chats stay private. This version didn't satisfy either the industry or voting EU members, though, due to its coercive nature. As per the Belgian text, users must give consent to the shared material being scanned before being encrypted to keep using the functionality. Fast-forward to February 2025, Poland tried to find a better compromise by making thescanning of encrypted chats voluntaryinstead of mandatory and classified as \"prevention.\" While experts found this version a \"major progress,\" they still lamented the risk of mass surveillance. Throughout the entire Presidency, EU members couldn't agree on a satisfactory wording, despite several attempts to amend the compromise text. As reported by Netzpolitik, during the last meeting, many EU member representatives expressed their concerns. These included even countries that previously joined the in-favor list, like Italy, Romania, and France. The latter even stated, \"It doesn't make sense to continue working with this text at all.\" As mentioned earlier, Denmark is expected to keep trying to find an agreement on the CSAM scanning proposal after starting its Presidency in July. This comes as the EU Commission is also set to kick off its enquiry into lawful encryption backdoor under a new controversial plan,ProtectEU. Despite being in its infancy, the strategy has alreadyattracted strong criticismacross the industry.

    "article_text": "AVCheck site now displays the usual takedown message When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AVCheck.net, a website providing analysis services for cybercriminals, has been taken offline as part of a larger law enforcement operation conducted by the FBI, as well as Dutch and Finnish police. At press time, the website had been defaced and displayed the usual FBI takedown notice: “This domain has been seized in accordance with a seizure warrant issued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas as part of a coordinated law enforcement operation.” The site operated as a Counter Antivirus (CAV) service, allowing cybercriminals to test their malware against multiple antivirus engines before deploying it, helping them remain undetected during attacks. It was marketed as a \"high-speed antivirus scantime checker,\" and enabled users to scan files, domains, and IP addresses across numerous security tools without alertingantivirusvendors. Matthijs Jaspers, Team Lead of the Dutch High Tech Crime Team, described the takedown as an “important step” in the fight against cybercrime, “because it disrupts the activities of cybercriminals in the earliest stages and prevents victims,” the press release, published on the Dutch police website, stated. In the same announcement, it was said that the investigation that led to this takedown also yielded “key evidence” on the admins and users of not just AVCheck, but also related services - Cryptor.biz, and Crypt.guru. These two were ‘crypting services’ that criminals used to \"crypt\"malware, helping it evade detection.

    "article_text": "And maybe Asus and Lenovo's VR efforts will break cover When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new leak suggests that Meta's Quest 4 headset has been pushed back from next year to 2027 – although when it does arrive it could prove to be worth the wait, as it might be a very different device to the Quest 3. Thankfully, we can, apparently, still look forward to aMeta Quest Pro 2launch – so new VR hardware does still seem to be incoming. These leaks come via two sources:Brad LynchandLuna, both of which have solid track records when it comes to VR leaks. Lynch posted a jokey poll saying only one of theValve Deckardand Meta Quest 4 would be landing this year, while Luna reported to have heard rumors that the Quest 4 has been delayed until 2027. According to the leakers this is due to the cancellation of two Meta prototypes that were likely Quest 4 candidates: Pismo Low and Pismo High (budget and premium models to match the Quest 3s and Quest 3 releases). Instead we could be getting a headset based on the Puffin prototype Meta has been developing. Puffin is set to be a more high-end offering –something akin to a Meta Quest Pro 2, although given the way leakers are talking about the device it sounds like it might launch under a different, non-Quest name. That’s because it's set to have a very different design to what we’re used to, i.e., a pair of VR goggles tethered to a puck, kind of like theApple Vision Pro. I say 'kind of' because Puffin’s puck wouldn’t just be a battery but its processing brains as well, to further shift weight away from the headset and into the user's pocket. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It should still run Horizon OS, but the device’s focus would be more for productivity and static entertainment (e.g. watching films in VR) rather than what we typically expect from Meta's VR headsets. Outside of Meta we're still waiting to see what its Horizon OS partners – Asus,Lenovo, and Xbox – are developing. In the same way that multiple device manufacturers are set to use Android XR, this trio are working on headsets running Meta’s Questoperating system. We’ve yet to hear anything about Lenovo’s device, thoughAsus’s rumored Tarius headsetwill supposedly be part of its ROG range, suggesting it’ll be a gaming-focused headset with enhanced displays and features like eye-tracking to make it a more premium offering than the existing Quest models. Hopefully these headsets will be launching soon, and a 2026 debut could be on the cards – and if Meta isn’t launching a Quest 4 next year it could be a prime time for Lenovo and Asus to showcase their devices.

    "title": "I tested ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode's sous-chef ability by baking banana bread – here’s how it went",
    "article_text": "ChatGPT can help you bake, but it’s not quite a real kitchen companion – at least not yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I don’t think I’ve ever knowingly followed a recipe to the letter. For me, baking has always been fun, messy, and silly. An excuse to eat icing straight from the bowl, then laugh when nothing rises or a tray of cookies fuses into One Giant Cookie because I spooned the batter onto the tray in clumps that were way too close together. So when I was asked to try out ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode while baking and then write about it, I was keen to see how my chaotic approach would fit with ChatGPT’s robotic one. Could ChatGPT help me stick to a recipe? Could it guide me like those impossibly calm baking TikTokers who know exactly when to take cakes out of the oven without guessing – and manage to stay impeccably dressed without spilling ingredients all over themselves while they’re at it? Let’s find out. ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode has been upgradedfor Plus subscribers, which now makes chatting with AI more natural. It can identify interruptions, detect tone, and offer a selection of voices for both mobile and desktop. For this experiment, I selected the voice called “Sol”, which sounded warm, calm, and friendly – exactly the vibe I need when I’m baking. As someone who makes lifting weights and consuming huge amounts of protein way too big a part of their personality, I decided to ask ChatGPT (or is it Sol now it has a voice?) if we could make the high-protein banana bread I’ve seen all over TikTok. I had some eggs, bananas, protein powder, and a random food cupboard full of things, so I assumed I’d be fine. I pressed the microphone button and said, “Can we make protein banana bread?” and that was it. Without specifying a recipe, confirming it had understood what I asked for, or even checking I had what I needed already in, we were off. ChatGPT just launched into the ingredient list at lightning speed. I had to ask four times for it to slow down so I could check I had everything. Eventually, I figured I was probably fine, and we got going. First step: Preheat the oven. So far, so what I expected. Then it raced through the instructions. Again, I had to keep asking it to slow down. It wanted me to mash the bananas, measure the oats, fold in the oats, crack the eggs, add the eggs, whisk in the eggs (but not too much), and measure and add the protein powder and the baking powder seemingly all at once. I asked it to go slowe,r and it wouldn’t. I changed my approach and asked it to pause after each instruction, each ingredient, and check if I was ready to move on. That worked. I’d read that you can show ChatGPT live video while you’re doing something, and it would offer feedback. So once I’d mashed the bananas, I asked it how they looked. “Great job, Becca!” it replied. I felt amazing. I was already doing well! But then I felt suspicious. I’ve written about howChatGPT hypes everyone upand loves giving unearned praise. So I started testing it. I threw the baking powder into the bowl next without stirring and asked if it looked okay. “That looks great!” At first, I let it go. But then, towards the end, I got frustrated and added a whole, uncracked egg to the bowl (don't worry, the batter was well-mixed enough at this poin, it was easy to get it out) and asked, “Does it look like I’ve beaten the egg enough?” Guess how it responded? “That looks great!” That said, the actual steps were solid. Once I asked it to slow down, it was clear and helpful. I had to make a bunch of substitutions due to my poor prep – “I have no way to blend the oats to make oat flour, so will regular oats do?” And: “I don’t want to measure in cups, what’s that in another measurement? – and it offered on-the-fly alternatives, which were really handy. Growing up, one of the best parts of baking was tasting the batter before it made it to the oven. Or at least a spoonful of the icing or ingredients. I wondered if ChatGPT would want to continue that tradition with me. I asked if it wanted a chocolate chip. It didn’t understand at first. I asked again. It said “haha,” paused for a while, then said: “No, thank you, Becca. I will just have to imagine how it tastes.” There was something so tragic about that that I took a whole handful of chocolate chips and shoved them into my mouth, delighted I could taste them. I wasn’t sure the consistency looked right as I spooned the batter into a tray before I put it in the oven. I asked twice if it looked okay, both times ChatGPT said: “Great job, perfect!” and I’m not sure if I could trust it anymore, so I eventually gave up. By this point, I’d had several warnings that I was hitting my video limit, and then ChatGPT stopped responding with voice altogether. Maybe because it knew the banana bread was in the oven and left me to it. Or maybe it had just had enough of my need for constant validation. I looked at the transcript as the banana bread cooked. Some of the voice responses were there, but some of the transcriptions looked Welsh. Some were missing entirely. The part where I asked it if it wanted to eat a chocolate chip wasn’t there. The bit where I asked if it would like to lick the spoon or whether I could have it was – it generously told me to go ahead. Despite the hurried approach at the start, the banana bread experiment worked. No points for aesthetics (see the photo above), but it tasted great – reassuringly similar to other high-protein, baked-oat recipes I’ve tried. The texture was cake-like and a bit gooey, but very satisfying. The ingredients and instructions, wherever they were pulled from, were genuinely decent. Which is when I regretted not asking where the recipe came from. It was probably pulled together from hard-working recipe bloggers, and here I was munching away with no clue who created it. I asked, “Who should I credit?” in the same ChatGPT conversation via text later. ChatGPT replied: “This protein banana bread is 100% a ChatGPT x Becca original 🍌💪✨” ChatGPT and its upgraded voice features are useful for reading recipes out loud, suggesting substitutions, and offering hands-free help. I can imagine this being really invaluable for anyone with accessibility needs. But the video support isn’t quite there yet, I’d skip that for now. All in all, it worked. I wanted protein powder-packed banana bread, and I got it, a whole tray of it. If you’re used to baking solo and want someone to talk you through the process, it’s a solid companion. But I think I prefer baking with a person when I get the chance to. Someone who’ll read the recipe aloud – and eat handfuls of chocolate chips with me.

    "title": "Infosec Europe 2025: we're live at the show, and here's everything we've seen",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hello and welcome to our coverage of InfoSecurity Europe 2025! Held at London's Excel center, Infosec 2025 (as everyone actually calls it) is one of the biggest security-focused events on the calendar, packed with big names, informative talks, and news from the biggest firms around. We're here in London and live on the ground for Infosec 2025 - here's what we've seen so far! Finally for today, we’ve taken a quick stop at DarkTrace, where they’re giving a mini-talk and overview about the difference between reactive and proactive network security. Staying ahead of attacks and understanding your cloud security posture is crucial, DarkTrace argues - and the right role permissions and access controls are key to protecting from insider threats. Next up, we're visiting Cloudflare, which claims to bring \"everywhere security\" to its customers. Specifically, this refers to the company's unified cybersecurity platform that protects users from \"Network to Cloud, Apps to AI\". Cloudlflare recently introduced a set of E2E PQC protections which helps organisations with safeguarding network traffic - PQC continues to be at the forefront of conversations so far at Infosec 2025! The main question is how fast this will change. Generative AI is in its infancy, and the trend of more sophisticated deepfakes, like the impersonation attack we saw on Susie Wiles, are only likely to get more potent in future. Organisational processes and training will be a huge factor for CISOs going forward. One of the biggest factors for AI is the damage in trust. Deepfakes, for example, are eroding trust all round and are a disruptive force - but generative AI’s. Dr Andrea Isoni introduces a pretty shocking statistic - 30-40% of web traffic is malicious bot traffic, meaning the treat of data theft is ever present for organisations with these trawlers looking to exfiltrate as much as possible. Here we're listening to ‘calling BS on AI’, a panel about how agentic and generative AI are affecting the threat landscape. Most people think that AI is powering organisations in a novel way, but that’s not quite true - says Zeki Turedi, CrowdStrike's Europe Field CTO. AI is just facilitating threat actors in their attacks, but it’s not revolutionising the way attacks are leveraged. Attackers are more efficient and quick thanks to AI - but it uses existing capabilities. Rubrik is next up, showcasing its data resilience and data security solutions for cyber recovery. Rubrik talks me through the devastating effects of ransomware on companies, particularly recently for retail organisations, and the importance of cyber recovery. A robust cyber recovery plan can mean a firm goes from a thirty day recovery, to just a 48 hour bounce back, Rubrik explains. First, we're headed to Okta, who are talking us through their AI-driven identity threat protection. Okta are keen to tell us about the shared risk signals, which allow a security event provider to transmit risk signals to Okta, enabling customers to use these to uncover potential identity threats in their ecosystem. \"Years ago, attackers used to hack systems, now they log in\", Okta warns. Now, a little break from the keynote stage and on to exhibition floor for some showcases and introductions! So what's the takeaway? Well, it's that geopolitics should inform your cyber strategies as security team - so make sure to integrate this conversation into your risk management and global footprint landscapes. Beyond state sponsored attacks and espionage, states are using cyber capabilities for sabotage and coercion. Real world sabotage used cyber as a tool to inform operations. Volt Typhoon, Chichester points out, is a perfect example ofhow geopolitics threatens critical infrastructure. States are understanding that penetrating critical infrastructure will likely form the basis of conflict in the future. Good cybersecurity has helped Ukraine, namely in the recent drone attack, which seemingly took Russia entirely by surprise. This shows the importance of great cybersecurity, Chichester argues. Defence, when done right, can be a vital weapon. As everyone knows, geopolitics is key to the cyber landscape. Cyber operations are now one of the go-to tools for covert state campaigns. Conflicts today are powered by cyber capabilities. Chichester points to the Viasat offensive in the Russian war in Ukraine as a prime example, and he explains that targeted attacks are increasingly disruptive, especially in the case of Russia, which are focusing on the logistical supply chain of materials into Ukraine. Next up - we're listening to Paul Chichester and his take on the 'Cyber Cold War' and the geopolitics of cyber threats. Paul is the Director of Operations at the NCSC - so investigating cyber threats is his bread and butter. \"Harvest now, decrypt later\" is a huge talking point. The industries most at risk (unsurprisingly) are the 'critical national' warns Daniel Cuthbert - panel participant and cybersecurity expert. That means healthcare, finance, and telecoms could face serious difficulties in a PQC (post-quantum cryptography) world. There's a myth, panel expert and Lastwall CEO Karl Holmqvist explains, that quantum computers can break any encryption. But really, at the moment, quantum computers can decrypt several commonly used encryptions - encryption will look different in the age of quantum, but it could still be effective. Cryptography will remain an important facet of cybersecurity for a long, long time - he argues. Next, it's 'Quantum computing v Cybersecurity' - chaired by BBC News' Joe Tidy. Here, cybersecurity is described as an 'Arms Race' - although not everyone think that terminology is helpful! Now, we're listening to Professor Brian Cox who's talking us through the link between cosmology and cybersecurity and computing. General relativity, the theory of space and time, and cosmology all link closely to quantum computing - with complex mathematics, data sets, and quantum mechanics. There's a quick look back to how far cybersecurity has come in the last 30 years before Cluley explains that hackers aren't girlfriend-less men in garages anymore (his words!), but are serious, state sponsored actors - outlining an almost unrecognisable evolution in that InfoSec has helped to guide security experts through. We're now seated for asuperpacked keynote, plenty of people are standing - so this is clearly a popular one! We're about to hear from Graham Cluley, host of theSmashing Security Podcast who'll introduce us all to Infosec's 30th year! We're heading in to the show now! As you can see from our pictures, the theme of Infosec 2025 is \"Building a Safer Cyber World\" - something you can bet we'll hear more about over the next few days. Despite it being June, it's a cloudy and blustery day here - let's hope things are warmer inside... Good morning from InfoSecurity Europe 2025! We're here at the Excel, and off to collect our badge before heading in.

    "article_text": "The Scream and Five Night at Freddy's star is tackling another big horror role When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever sincePrime Videorevealing they were doing aCarrieTV adaptation, I've been eagerly following along. The recent casting announcement has only made me more excited, too, asScreamandFive Nights at Freddy's star Matthew Lillard is stepping into the shoes of the horror story's well-meaning principal, aka Mister Morton. I'm so excited to see Lillard's take on a character who's taken many forms over the years from the original Stephen King novel and the 1976 movie classic, to the not-so-good 2013 retelling. It'll be interesting to see if they stick to the novel or make changes his character, too. I already had high hopes for this project, which hasNetflixhorror aficionado Mike Flanagan at the helm. He's well-known for his successful horror series such asThe Haunting of Hill HouseandMidnight Mass, so I'm expecting hisAmazonTV take on another of King's most iconic works to be another small screen hit. Alongside Lillard, there are numerous famous faces attached to appear. For starters,Cult of Chucky's Summer Howell stepping into the shoes of the titular telekinetic teenager. Joining her is Samantha Sloyan, who recently starred inThe Pitt, aka one of thebest Max shows, as Carrie's domineering and god-fearing mother Margaret White. Other names include Alison Thornton as Chris Hargensen, i.e. the popular schoolgirl and Carrie's major bully, Amber Midthunder as gym teacher Miss Desjardin, and Thalia Dudek, Josie Totah, Arthur Conti, and Joel Oulette in supporting roles. We still don't know a lot about this project yet, but it's likely we'll spend a lot more time getting to know these characters as Flanagan can do a lot more with a TV remake than, say, a film's two-hour runtime. Here's hoping it's a horrifying hoot that'll earn a spot on ourbest Prime Video showslist in due course. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Updated June 3, 2025 CD Projekt Red has clarified in a statement toVGCthat the footage shown today was a tech demo set inThe Witcher4world, and wasn'tThe Witcher4gameplay, suggesting that what we saw won't be connected to the narrative. \"This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology poweringThe Witcher 4– but notThe Witcher 4itself,\" a spokesperson said. \"It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration withEpic Gamesto push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. \"We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer and FastGeo Streaming that are helping shape the future ofThe Witcher.\" Original Story: CD Projekt Red has shared a brand new look atThe Witcher 4with an impressive tech demo. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. During the State of Unreal 2025 event today, we were treated to a technical demo that offered an early glimpse into the Unreal Engine 5.6 features that will be inThe Witcher 4. At the start of the livestream, we saw a short cinematic of a group of men being attacked by a monster, before the footage seamlessly transitions into gameplay. We then see Ciri, the game's titular Witcher and playable protagonist, emerging from a cave onto a cliff after investigating the attack and showing off the never-before-seen region of Kovir. According to CD Projekt Red, the gameplay shown is running on the basePS5at 60 FPS, with ray tracing enabled, and it looks incredible. Just like Geralt of Rivia, Ciri also has her own horse companion named Kelpie, and the two of them can be seen riding through the mountains and dense forests of Kovir to the port town of Valdrest. The town is bustling with crowds of NPCs, some of whom will react to certain instances created by the player, thanks to Unreal Engine's MetaHuman technology with Mass AI crowd scaling. For instance, when Ciri knocks into a man carrying apples, she kicks off a chain reaction. She apologizes, and then a child can be seen running forward to steal some apples that fell on the ground, followed by a pig looking to eat them up. We also see other NPCs interacting with each other and creating their reactive scenes, making the whole town feel alive. It also appears that gameplay will seamlessly transition back into cutscenes when Ciri reaches her destination and starts a conversation, suggesting there'll be no black loading screens in between these moments. Tools like the new Unreal Animation Framework and Nanite Foliage rendering are being utilized inThe Witcher 4to help deliver an immersive world at 60 FPS without compromising on quality, according to the developer. \"We started our partnership with Epic Games to push open-world game technology forward,\" said CDPR co-CEO Michał Nowakowski.\"To show this early look at the work we’ve been doing using Unreal Engine running at 60 FPS on PlayStation 5, is a significant milestone - and a testament of the great cooperation between our teams. \"But we're far from finished. I look forward to seeing more advancements and inspiring technology from this partnership as development of The Witcher 4 on Unreal Engine 5 continues.\" The studio also confirmed that while the tech demo was running on a PlayStation console, \"the features and technology will be supported across all platforms the game will launch on\", including Xbox and PC.

    "title": "Biden said ‘Russia should be destroyed’ – Brazil’s Lula",
    "article_text": "Former US President Joe Biden wanted to see Russia“destroyed”during his time in office, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said in an interview with Le Monde. The Brazilian leader, who has consistently pushed for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, objected to attempts to single out Moscow as the sole culprit behind the conflict, telling the French newspaper on Tuesday that“Western countries also bear part of the responsibility.” “Joe Biden, with whom I spoke at length, thought Russia needed to be destroyed,”Lulasaid, without elaborating when the conversation took place.“And Europe, which for a long time embodied a middle way in the world, has now aligned itself with Washington and is spending billions on rearmament. That worries me. If all we talk about is war, there will never be peace.” Moscow has long described the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Russia and has repeatedly condemned arms supplies to Kiev as counterproductive to the peace process. US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Keith Kellogg acknowledged last week that President Vladimir Putin was“in a way”right, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also previously characterized the conflict as a proxy war. “Frankly, it’s a proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine, and Russia,”Rubio said in March, noting that the current White House administration is eager to see it end. Trump has repeatedly rebuked Biden for funneling“crazy”amounts of American taxpayer money to Kiev, arguing last month that the conflict“should have remained a European situation.” Trump has frequently used campaign rallies to claim that only he could prevent World War III and resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours – a claim he later acknowledged was hyperbolic. His efforts at mediation have faced resistance from European NATO members, who back continued military support for Ukraine. Last month, following pressure from Trump, Kiev dropped its opposition to direct talks with Moscow, which it had abandoned back in 2022. Since then, the two sides have held two rounds of negotiations in Istanbul. Thefirst meetingwas initiated by Putin on May 16 and resulted in a major prisoner swap. During thesecond roundof negotiations on Monday, the two sides exchanged draftmemorandumsoutlining a roadmap toward an eventual peace deal. Washington’s top diplomat in Türkiye claimed on Tuesday that Trump isrunning out of patienceand appears to be“at the end of his rope”over the conflict in Ukraine. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovwarnedthat expecting immediate breakthroughs in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would be“incorrect.”",

    "title": "Germany should expel all Russian diplomats – senior MP",
    "article_text": "A senior German lawmaker has called on Berlin to effectively cut diplomatic ties with Moscow to combat the“hybrid”threats he claims come from Russia. “We should expel any remaining… diplomats,”Roderich Kiesewetter, known for his hardline anti-Russian stance, told Handelsblatt on Tuesday. He argued that doing so would help reduce Moscow’s influence in Germany. According to Kiesewetter, Germany is currently“inadequately protected against cyberattacks,”which he claims“primarily”originate from Russia. He specifically accused Moscow of attempting to“change public opinion in Germany”through such actions. He also accused China, North Korea, and Iran of launching“hacking attacks.” The list of countermeasures suggested by the MP includes establishing a special government agency to refute disinformation or combat it“through hybrid activities,”banning Russian tourists and journalists from entering Germany, shutting down“propaganda portals,”and deleting any social media accounts deemed suspicious by the authorities. The lawmaker also called for the closure of the Russian House – a center in Berlin run by the Russian government agency Rossotrudnichestvo that holds cultural events and offers language courses – labeling it a network of Russian“influence.” Moscow has warned that the expulsion of diplomats would be met with a tit-for-tat response.“Berlin must have been missing the German diplomats,”Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Lenta.ru. Rossotrudnichestvo blasted Kiesewetter’s words as“absurd.”They“have nothing to do with reality,”the agency’s spokesman said, adding that the MP“knows nothing about the activities of the Russian House in Berlin and has never been there.” The head of the Russian House also told TASS that such rhetoric“does not foster international dialogue”and only“strengthens the atmosphere of distrust, incites hatred and animosity.” Last year, Kiesewetter caused a stir in Germany by stating that Berlin should“take the war to Russia”and“do everything possible to enable Ukraine to destroy… ministries, command posts”on Russian territory. He is also an active supporter of supplying Kiev with Taurus missiles, which have a range of 500km and could reach Moscow. The interview comes as Berlin has taken an even more hardline position on Russia under new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Since taking office, Merz has lifted range restrictions on Ukrainian strikes with German-supplied missiles and hinted at the possibility of sending Taurus missiles to Kiev. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said in response that Berlin’s“direct involvement in the war is now obvious.”",

    "title": "Pork-filled disgusting abomination – Musk on Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire and former White House efficiency czar Elon Musk has blasted US President Donald Trump’s“Big Beautiful”tax bill as overspending and a“disgusting abomination.” Trump’s centerpiece bill narrowly passed in the House of Representatives last week and will need to go before the Senate. The legislation aims to prevent an end-of-year tax increase and raises the limit on the already staggering US debt by a further $4 trillion. Musk, who recently stepped down as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has repeatedly criticized the bill, claiming it compromises his efforts to trim the fat off the federal budget. “I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,”he wrote on X on Tuesday. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,”he added. I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore.This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. In an interview with CBS news last week, Musk stressed that the legislation“undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,”as it“increases the budget deficit.” House Speaker Mike Johnson disagreed with Musk’s assessment, saying that the bill would instead secure $1.6 trillion in savings, reduce spending, and provide tax relief. “With all due respect, Elon is simply wrong about the One Big Beautiful Bill,”he told the press on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, adding that“Congress is working hard to get this to President Trump’s desk by July 4th.” When asked about Musk’s criticism of the bill, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt replied that Trump is aware of the former presidential advisor’s position on the matter.“It doesn't change the president’s opinion,”she told the press on Tuesday.",

    "title": "China hits back against US ‘coercion’",
    "article_text": "China has accused the US of breaching a recent trade agreement, saying Washington’s“harmful”restrictions and“coercion”were not the right way to engage with Beijing. US President Donald Trump last week claimed that Beijing had“totally violated”the May 12 agreement reached in Geneva but offered no details. The consensus suspended most new tariffs imposed since early April and aimed to stabilize relations between the world’s two largest economies. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian rejected the accusation, telling a regular pressbriefingon Tuesday that China had been“responsibly and faithfully implementing the consensus”despite Washington’s“false”claims. He said Beijing strongly opposed what he described as“harmful extreme measures,”including the latest US chip export controls, a block on electronic design automation (EDA) sales, and a pledge to revoke Chinese students’ visas. “Let us stress once again that pressuring and coercion are not the right way to engage China,”the spokesman said, calling on the US to stop spreading disinformation. Last week, multiple outlets reported that the Trump administration had ordered US firms to halt shipments of advanced goods to China, including chip design software and specialty chemicals. Experts warned the decision would likely inflame tensions. As part of the Geneva agreement, the US had paused a 34% tariff hike introduced on April 2 for 90 days, at which point Beijing took reciprocal action. Both sides also pledged to roll back the post-April 8 tariff increases while keeping a baseline 10% duty on mutual imports. Beijing also agreed to ease certain non-tariff barriers on US goods starting May 14. However, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that China had not yet lifted some of those restrictions. Trade tensions escalated sharply on April 2 when Trump imposed sweeping new duties on imports from more than 90 countries, including China, citing trade imbalances. Beijing retaliated, which led to Trump hiking US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, while Chinese duties on US goods reached 125%. The US extended tariff exemptions for 164 Chinese products through August 31, according to a notice by the US trade office published earlier this week. The list covers semiconductors, telecom equipment, aerospace items, and medical device components. Waivers for 14 types of solar panel gear remain in place. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would“likely talk this week.”Lin said he had no information to share on the matter.",

    "title": "Here’s how the EU system rewards high officials for failure",
    "article_text": "Every circus needs a clown. And this one has a truly awesome demo reel. Despite the Greens snagging 85 seats in the current German parliament, it turns out they’re about as useful to Friedrich Merz’s shiny new right-left establishment coalition with the Christian Democrats as a vegan menu at Oktoberfest. So they’re relegated to chilling on the Bundestag backbenches. Annalena Baerbock, the former German Foreign Affairs Minister in ex-Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government, could have coasted into parliament again via the Greens’ party list, even after losing her direct seat to Scholz himself. But she apparently had bigger plans. She’s just been tapped as the next President of the United Nations General Assembly. Before officially packing up at the Foreign Ministry, her own department nominated her for the UN gig – an administrative role, largely ceremonial. Why her? Well, it’s Germany’s turn to fill the seat for a year starting in September, and a career diplomat was reportedly first in line. You know, someone who hadn’t become globally famous for flunking basic geometry. And well, that just can’t stand. Not when the face of German diplomacy is no longer being kept by German voters in the manner to which she has become accustomed. Besides, just check out this CV. In a moment that will live in infamy alongside Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, MLK’s“I Have a Dream,”Pericles’ Funeral Oration, and Churchill’s“We shall fight on the beaches,”Baerbock took the spotlight at the 2023 Munich Security Conference. Asked whether Ukraine would be safe long-term if Vladimir Putin stayed in power in Russia, shereplied:“If Putin doesn’t change by 360 degrees, no.” Apparently, she thinks a dizzy Putin would make all the difference. Perhaps it’s not the first time that Baerbock, a former gymnast, confused a 360 with a 180, and landed on her head at some point. Either way, German school-kids usually master this concept by age 10. In another Baerbockism, during a January 2023 speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, shesaid:“We are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other.”Cue her foreign ministry hastily clarifying that no, of course Germany hadn’t just declared war on Russia. It was just Baerbock talking again. With all this experience as Germany’s walking, talking diplomatic banana peel, she was clearly destined for bigger things on the world stage. So who could possibly object to shipping her off to the UN? Well, this guy, for one:“It is outrageous to replace the best and most internationally experienced German diplomat with an outdated model,”grumbledChristoph Heusgen, former chair of the Munich Security Conference, referring to career diplomat, Helga Schmid, reportedly slidelined in favor of Baerbock. An outdated model? Bold words, Mr.FormerConference Chair! Excuse you, but trusty single-cylinder moped-grade intellectualism never truly goes out of style. “Ms. Baerbock can learn a lot from [Schmid],”saidformer German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. What’s he suggesting? That Schmid moonlights as a geometry tutor? So that makes two critics, including one who previously held Baerbock’s job. But surely these bitter old guys are alone in their skepticism towards this pioneer offeminist foreign policy. No doubt it’s just a coincidence that“Mr. Eighteen Percent Popularity”Scholz beat her in her own riding. And that Statista pegged her approval rating at -0.7 on a scale from -5 to 5. And who really cares about that time she sounded kind of like she was unilaterally declaring war on Russia on behalf of Germany, or when she seemed unsure which country she was representing. Like at a September 2022 forum when shesaid:“If I give the promise to people in Ukraine – ‘We stand with you, as long as you need us’ – then I want to deliver. No matter what my German voters think.”At the time, Germany was deindustrializing and its citizens were being crushed by energy costs. Both consequences of the very Ukraine policy Baerbock was committed to, with or without voter consent, as she suggested. But look, Baerbock isn’t the only politician to turn a domestic faceplant into a corner office with a view at Global Governance Inc. Take European Commission President ‘Queen’ Ursula von der Leyen. No, please, take her, as former Chancellor Angela Merkel would say. Before becoming the unelected President of the European Commission, von der Leyen served as Germany’s Defence Minister in Merkel’s government from 2013 to 2019. Known more for glamour shots in front of jets than for actually equipping them, her ministry apparently favored pricey consultants over functionality. One reportnoted:“There is neither enough personnel nor material, and often one confronts shortage upon shortage. The troops are far from being fully equipped.”Well, unless you count the broomsticks reportedly used during training exercises, and possibly sourced from Ursula’s personal garage. Former European Parliament President Martin Schulz offered this glowingreviewof the current de facto Queen of the EU:“One thing is true, she ran in 2019 – but not for the European Parliament, but she ran away from her ministry in Germany.”He alsotweetedin 2019:“Von der Leyen is our weakest minister. That’s apparently enough to become Commission president.” Apparently, flunking your domestic portfolio is the new fast track to international prestige. Just ask Mark Rutte. The Dutch Prime Minister became so politically radioactive that his coalition partners were getting scorched by mere proximity. He resigned twice: first over a child welfare scandal, then after failing to maintain unity on asylum policy. His solution? Bail and become NATO’s new Secretary General – essentially, the West’s chief weapons lobbyist. Or consider Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. Her Reform Party slipped to third place under her leadership, dropping below 20 percent approval. As her coalition sank, she jumped ship and landed in Brussels as the EU’s chief diplomat. Voters back home were apparently less impressed, especially after her government’s tax hikes and perceived focus on Ukraine over Estonia. Even more awkward: while Kallas was calling for Europe to cut all ties with Russia, her husband’s company, Stark Logistics, was still doing business there. But apparently, that kind of conflict of interest now screams“diplomatic credentials.” So no, Baerbock’s story isn’t a bug in the system. It’s effectively the blueprint. The fall from grace at home just gives more momentum for the launch to cushy international posts. The moral of the story is clear: stumble locally, ascend globally. Even if your personal GPS is so busted that you can’t tell a U-turn from a 360.",

    "title": "WATCH wild elephant visit Thai grocery store",
    "article_text": "A giant wild elephant from a national park in northeastern Thailand wandered off and strolled into a grocery store, knocking over shelves and sniffing boxes of rice crackers before leaving. The daylight robbery went viral after the Thairath Online Facebook page posted a video on Monday afternoon showing the massive creature – reportedly known locally as Plai Biang Lek – shocking the convenience store owner in the Pak Chong district by invading the premises and helping itself to some snacks. The store, which is around three hours northeast of Bangkok, is near Khao Yai National Park, where wild elephants are frequently seen leaving protected areas in search of food. The publication said this is not Lek’s first mischievous act. Two years ago, he famously made off with a pot of congee, a type of rice porridge. The 23-year-old male elephant entered the store while the owner was attending to a customer, the Bangkok Post reported, adding that the visit caused panic, forcing the shopkeeper and customer to run out and alert park officials. Park rangers and the shop owner tried to make the animal leave by shouting and pleading with him, the media outlet noted, but the elephant was unfazed and continued probing with his trunk, searching the shelves for snacks. Ten minutes later, he left and wandered back into the jungle, causing no injuries to itself or bystanders. According to the shop owner, as cited by the Bangkok Post, repairing the damaged shelves and replacing the lost goods will cost more than 1,000 baht (around $30).",

    "title": "UK threatens to sue Russian tycoon over money for Ukraine",
    "article_text": "The British government has warned it could sue Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich if he fails to approve the transfer of £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) to Ukraine from the sale of Chelsea football club. The threat came from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and Foreign Secretary David Lammy in a joint statement on Monday. Abramovich sold Chelsea to a consortium of American investors in May 2022, shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and after being sanctioned by London over alleged Kremlin ties. The tycoon, who denied the accusations and has acted as a mediator between Moscow and Kiev on several occasions, intended the proceeds to be used to help victims of the Ukraine conflict on both sides. London, however, has been pushing for the money to go solely to Ukraine, ignoring the businessman’s wishes. “The government is determined to see the proceeds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club reach humanitarian causes in Ukraine,”the statement from Reeves and Lammy read. They added that the UK is“deeply frustrated”that it has been unable to reach an agreement with Abramovich more than three years after the sale. “While the door for negotiations will remain open, we are fully prepared to pursue this through the courts if required, to ensure people suffering in Ukraine can benefit from these proceeds as soon as possible,”they stated. The money remains frozen in a UK bank account, pending Foreign Office license for its release abroad. Due to sanctions, Abramovich cannot access the funds but remains their legal owner and must approve any distribution. UK government sources told The Guardian in March that a“fundamental disagreement”exists between London and Abramovich over the allocation of the funds. They said officials had held multiple discussions with the businessman’s representatives, legal advisers, and international partners, and are determined to resolve the issue, including through legal action. Abramovich’s representatives did not respond to media requests for comment. Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, freezing over $300 billion of its international reserves and seizing assets from individuals accused of profiting from the conflict. Western officials have repeatedly suggested using the frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction. Moscow has condemned the freezing of its assets, denouncing the asset seizure proposals as“outright theft”and warning of reciprocal action against Western holdings in Russia. A number of countries, including in the West, have also warned that confiscating frozen Russian funds would violate international law, set a dangerous precedent, and damage the credibility of Western financial institutions.",

    "title": "Berlin court bars police from turning immigrants away at border",
    "article_text": "A Berlin court has barred German border police from rejecting asylum seekers arriving from neighboring EU countries without reviewing their claims. The ruling deals a blow to Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s recent efforts to reduce asylum-related land migration. Last month, shortly after Merz took office, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt introduced a policy under which undocumented migrants arriving at land borders were to be turned back – unless they are unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, or otherwise vulnerable individuals. The move aimed to fulfill Merz’s campaign promise to curb migration amid heightened public concern following a series of high-profile crimes involving asylum seekers. On Monday, however, the Berlin Administrative Court ruled against the policy. The decision came in response to a legal challenge brought by three Somali nationals who tried to enter Germany last month but were returned to Poland without any examination of their claims. The court found Dobrindt’s policy to be unlawful under the Dublin Regulation, which governs how EU member states handle asylum applications. The rules require that asylum seekers apply in the first EU country they enter. If they later apply in another member state, such as Germany, that country can seek to transfer them back to the original state. In its ruling, the Berlin court emphasized that Germany cannot reject asylum seekers at the border without first checking whether they have submitted a claim, and whether the Dublin rules apply. It noted that while Germany is not obligated to accept all asylum seekers at the border, it also cannot summarily return individuals without reviewing their applications. As noted by the New York Times, the German authorities could fulfill these requirements by holding applicants in processing centers until it can be determined which EU state is responsible for their claims. Dobrindt responded to the court’s ruling by arguing that it applies only to the specific case of the three Somali migrants and does not undermine the government’s broader policy.“We stand by our legal opinion and do not consider it to have been undermined in this instance,”he told reporters on Monday night. Efforts to curb migration to Germany intensified following a series of violent crimes, including the 2024 knife attack in Solingen, where a Syrian asylum seeker fatally stabbed three people and injured eight others during a summer festival. The attacker had originally entered the EU through Bulgaria. German officials failed to deport him because they could not locate him at his assigned asylum residence.",

    "title": "Israel losing most steadfast EU supporter – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "Germany is rethinking its military and trade ties with Israel, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The“surprising”pivot from one of the Jewish state’s staunchest supporters comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and growing frustration in Berlin over Israel’s actions. “German anger”rose in mid-May as Israel intensified its campaign against Hamas while continuing to block humanitarian aid, according to information obtained by Bloomberg. Germany has adhered to a long-standing policy that protecting Israel is a post-Holocaust obligation. It has also been Israel’s largest European arms supplier and one of its top trade partners. In Germany’s first such public comments since the war began 20 months ago, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last week that the humanitarian situation could“no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas terrorism.” During a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, Merz urged the Israeli prime minister to allow“sufficient humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip immediately.” “This is a real marker of how things have moved,”Julien Barnes-Dacey of the European Council on Foreign Relations told Bloomberg.“It’s simply become impossible for most European governments to continue supporting Israel’s war despite strong ongoing commitments to Israel’s security.” Israel has long faced accusations of war crimes for obstructing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including a total blockade imposed after October 7, 2023, and repeated restrictions on food, fuel, and medicine entering the besieged enclave. While the Israeli government argues such measures are necessary to prevent supplies from reaching Hamas, critics say the impact on civilians is catastrophic. Berlin’s shift mirrors wider discontent across Europe. The UK, France, and the Netherlands are also weighing trade and arms restrictions on Israel. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in May there is“a strong majority”in favor of reviewing the EU-Israel trade agreement. The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, with $47 billion in goods exchanged last year, according to IMF data. Last week, Israel launched a new aid distribution system through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US- and Israeli-backed initiative. However, the effort has already drawn criticism, as multiple incidents have occurred where Palestinians seeking aid were killed. On Tuesday, at least 27 people died near a distribution site in Rafah, according to Palestinian health officials and witnesses. The Israeli military said troops fired on individuals who had strayed from designated routes and posed a potential threat. Israel maintains that its military strategy is necessary to defeat Hamas and secure the release of the remaining hostages who had been taken during the October 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry reports over 54,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began.",

    "title": "China is building a power triangle to change the world",
    "article_text": "The final week of May marked a significant political development with the potential to reshape Asia’s geopolitical landscape. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, hosted the inaugural summit involving China, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). While signs of deepening engagement among these three actors had surfaced in preceding years, the establishment of a formal trilateral cooperation mechanism is a recent development. This event did not occur in a geopolitical vacuum. The region is increasingly exposed to intensifying rivalry among China, the US, and other global powers. In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping embarked on a Southeast Asian tour – visiting Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam – to consolidate Beijing’s influence. Almost simultaneously, an envoy dispatched by US President Donald Trump toured Cambodia and Vietnam and met with representatives from all ASEAN member states in an effort to repair relations damaged by Trump’s tariffs and to reaffirm the commitment to a ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific’. Meanwhile, the US president visited three Gulf states, making new deals and publicly denouncing the longstanding American policy of mentorship and interference in regional affairs. By the end of May, French President Emmanuel Macron also entered the scene, visiting Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam to remind Southeast Asian counterparts that the EU still exists and remains a potential alternative to both Beijing and Washington. It is no coincidence that the China-ASEAN-GCC summit was convened in Malaysia. As the current chair of ASEAN, Malaysia plays a pivotal role, and its prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, is a vocal proponent of regional integration and innovative partnerships. Ahead of the trilateral summit, ASEAN members gathered in Kuala Lumpur to chart their future course. On this occasion, the ten member states adopted ASEAN’s first 20-year vision – ASEAN 2045 – articulating the ambition to position Southeast Asia as a global growth engine aligned with other dynamic actors. Among them, China and the GCC member states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – stand out prominently. Together, they represent a quarter of the world’s population and contribute nearly the same proportion to global GDP. Their economic linkages are already well-established: China is the top trading partner for both ASEAN and the GCC. ASEAN has surpassed the EU as China’s foremost economic partner, and Beijing imports over one-third of its crude oil from GCC states. The summit in Kuala Lumpur brought together the world’s second- and fifth-largest economies – China and ASEAN – along with key suppliers of energy and raw materials. The leaders did not conceal their optimism. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim advanced a vision of intercultural dialogue between Confucian and Islamic civilizations, aligning with China’s Global Civilization Initiative. Chinese Premier Li Qiang envisaged a ‘big triangle’ as a pillar of global security and prosperity, invoking the ‘shared Asian values’ of openness, cooperation, and integration in contrast to perceived Western norms. Notably, Beijing’s official discourse increasingly emphasizes these ‘Asian values’. This narrative underpins a renewed focus on neighboring states. In April, Xi convened a rare high-level conference on relations with the ‘near abroad’, characterizing it as essential to China’s development, security, and diplomatic priorities. Among other regional actors, this recalibration may evoke concerns about a resurgence of a modern-day ‘Pax Sinica’. However, Beijing refutes these interpretations, instead invoking alternative historical models such as the Silk Road, which emphasized connectivity, integration, and equality. The China-ASEAN-GCC summit was no exception: Beijing proposed extending the existing China-ASEAN Free Trade Area to include the GCC, a suggestion welcomed by Southeast Asian leaders. This could accelerate China’s bid for trade liberalization and amplify the benefits of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world’s largest free trade zone, which includes all ASEAN nations. The summit’s agenda focused heavily on economic issues, reflecting ASEAN’s strategic orientation and the interests of Gulf states. Over the past decade, China has launched numerous projects with ASEAN members under the Belt and Road Initiative. Cooperation with the GCC is also expanding beyond traditional sectors such as raw materials to cutting-edge areas including artificial intelligence, the digital economy, and 5G technology. This economic emphasis is strategic, enabling stakeholders to bypass contentious political and security matters. And these contentious issues abound. While China maintains robust ties with both ASEAN and GCC members, bilateral frictions persist. Within ASEAN, territorial disputes and sovereignty concerns – particularly in the South China Sea – complicate trust-building. China’s disputes with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam are longstanding and strain regional relations. Perceptions of Chinese assertiveness also fuel anxieties over economic overdependence, potential ‘debt traps’, and Beijing’s political leverage. These factors have prompted leaders such as Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to move closer to the US in recent years. The broader China-US rivalry remains a defining dynamic. Both ASEAN and GCC nations have historically strong ties to the US. The US remains ASEAN’s largest export market and top foreign investor. GCC countries, long aligned with Washington, now face the challenge of navigating a careful balance between American and Chinese interests, particularly on sensitive technologies and security cooperation. Washington opposes the adoption of Chinese 5G and AI technologies by Saudi Arabia, and similar concerns have led to the suspension of military agreements between the US and UAE. Additionally, discussions about conducting oil trade in the yuan challenge the petrodollar system and attract Western scrutiny. These geopolitical complexities could undermine trilateral collaboration, exposing fault lines and structural vulnerabilities. While sectors such as trade, energy, infrastructure, and advanced technology offer natural areas of convergence, geopolitical competition and cultural divergence present serious obstacles. Moreover, there is a pronounced asymmetry among the actors: Smaller ASEAN economies may lack the institutional and financial capacity to engage fully in this trilateral format. Nonetheless, the China-ASEAN-GCC platform represents a novel configuration within an emerging multipolar world order. It reflects the accelerating momentum of South-South cooperation, which integrates multipolarity with multilateralism and economic globalization. Trump’s tariff storm served as a wake-up call for many US partners across ASEAN and the Gulf, underscoring the imperative of diversifying partnerships and embracing pragmatic alternatives. Closer ties with Beijing do not necessarily indicate a wholesale shift from one hegemon to another. Rather, ASEAN and the GCC are striving to engage both China and the US where feasible. Yet, recent developments suggest that Washington’s strategy of pressuring states to reduce ties with China in exchange for benefits is losing traction. The key questions now are whether ASEAN can effectively balance great power rivalries to become an autonomous pole in a multipolar world; whether regional actors can sustain this delicate equilibrium and avoid the formation of military blocs in Asia-Pacific and beyond; and whether the trilateral framework itself can endure amid mounting geopolitical tensions. These remain open-ended questions – and the answers will emerge only with time.",

    "article_text": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has called Keir Starmer“crazed and devilish,”after the UK prime minister unveiled a radical defense overhaul to make Britain“a battle-ready, armor-clad nation.” Earlier this week, Starmer revealed his cabinet’s Strategic Defense Review, which includes an expansive armaments program mirroring similar efforts across NATO. He said the reforms are expected to make the British military“ten times more lethal”within the next decade. During his TV program ‘Con Maduro +’ on Monday, the Venezuelan president spoke out against“the war being pushed by this reckless, crazed, and devilish prime minister named Starmer.”He questioned the ethical and moral implications of Starmer’s statement, adding that humanity does not need more wars. “I make a call to the British people – to the people of London, Liverpool, and all parts of Great Britain – to respond to this desperate and deranged call from their prime minister, who is calling for war,”Maduro said, urging people to stand against warmongering and militarism. The president added that, by making these statements, Starmer“speaks on behalf of a totally decadent, worn-out elite – one that profits from arms deals and weapons manufacturing.” Prior to Starmer’s remarks, UK Defense Secretary John Healey stated that London is sending“a message to Moscow”by allocating billions of pounds for new munitions plants, long-range missile systems, and other military capabilities. Commenting on this, Maduro said the“people who lived through the First and Second World Wars are now talking about a new great war and claiming they are preparing for it.” Russia has said Western nations are increasingly using alarmist rhetoric to justify the diversion of public funds toward military spending. The Kremlin has long considered the Ukraine conflict to be a Western proxy war against Russia and has condemned the weapons supplies to Kiev, arguing that they only serve to fuel further bloodshed and hinder efforts toward a peaceful resolution.",

    "title": "Trump running out of patience on Ukraine – US envoy",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump appears to be“at the end of his rope”over the conflict in Ukraine, Washington’s top diplomat in Türkiye has told local media. Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Türkiye and special envoy for Syria, made the remarks during an interview with Turkish broadcaster NTV on Monday, in the wake of a second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations which lasted approximately 90 minutes. He was asked about Kiev’s calls for a high-level summit that would include Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Barrack indicated that any such meeting would need to be“meaningful”and yield substantive outcomes, while acknowledging he could not speak for the US president directly. He added that Trump, who has openly expressed frustration with both Zelensky and Putin, is not known for his patience. Barrack said Türkiye could play a key role in facilitating a breakthrough, given its status as a mediator. Trump repeatedly used campaign rallies to claim he could resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours – a claim he later acknowledged was hyperbolic. His efforts to mediate, have faced resistance from European NATO members, who back continued military plans for Ukraine. Last month, following pressure from Trump, Kiev dropped its opposition to direct talks with Russia, which said such a move was the logical next step. Zelensky traveled to Türkiye on the date proposed by Moscow for the initial round, claiming he expected Putin to attend. Russia has maintained that a summit involving top leaders should be the culmination of the negotiation process, not a substitute for it. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated the stance on Tuesday, saying a trilateral meeting with Zelensky and Trump appeared“unlikely anytime soon.” At Monday’s talks in Istanbul, Kiev reiterated its desire for a trilateral summit. Moscow, in turn, presented two potential paths toward a ceasefire and offered to return the bodies of 6,000 deceased Ukrainian soldiers as a goodwill gesture, which Kiev agreed to reciprocate.",

    "title": "Dutch government collapses over immigration dispute",
    "article_text": "The Dutch government is teetering on the verge of collapse after a dispute over immigration policy led Geert Wilders to withdraw his party from the ruling coalition. Wilders, the leader of the right-wing Party for Freedom (PVV), which emerged as the largest party in the 2023 parliamentary elections, announced on Tuesday that the PVV is leaving the four-party coalition government because his partners refused to accept his immigration overhaul. Wilders added that he notified Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the PVV ministers’ decision to withdraw from the government. “No signature under our asylum plans. The PVV leaves the coalition,”he wrote on X on Tuesday. Last week, Wilders released a ten-point plan aimed at drastically reducing migration, intensifying pressure on the four-party coalition to adopt a harder line or face a potential cabinet crisis. “I signed up for the toughest asylum policy and not the downfall of the Netherlands,”Wilders told reporters, according to Euronews. Wilders had proposed the“strictest migration policy ever”in the Netherlands, a stance his coalition partners claimed to support. In May 2024, the four ruling parties finalized an agreement that featured“the strictest asylum admission policy and the most comprehensive migration control package ever.” The proposal called for a halt to asylum applications, the temporary suspension of family reunification for recognized refugees, and the deportation of all Syrians who applied for asylum or are residing in the Netherlands on temporary visas. Wilders also sought the closure of asylum centers. Legal experts have warned that several elements of the plan violate European human rights laws and the UN Refugee Convention, both of which the Netherlands is bound by as a signatory. The Party for Freedom, led by Wilders and known for its proposals to ban the Quran and shut down Islamic schools, secured the most seats in the November 2023 elections, marking a significant shift in the Dutch political landscape. Wilders formed a coalition government with three other right-leaning parties: The center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the populist Farmer Citizen Movement (BBB), and the New Social Contract (NSC). The agreement followed more than six months of negotiations and marked the first time Wilders’ party was included in a governing coalition, having previously been excluded by mainstream parties. The four-party coalition holds 88 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, giving it a solid majority.",

    "title": "Pentagon to change stance on Greenland – Politico",
    "article_text": "The Pentagon is preparing to make a“symbolic and operational split”between Greenland and Denmark by reassigning the Arctic island’s command jurisdiction, Politico has reported. Greenland would thus be moved from the European Command (EUCOM) to the Northern Command (NORTHCOM), whereas Denmark would remain in the former, according to the outlet. The change, which is part of a broader review of the Unified Command Plan, would elevate Greenland’s priority in defense planning at the Pentagon and White House.“From the perspective of geography, the move makes some sense,”one official told Politico.“From a political perspective, however, this clearly is going to worry Europe.” Greenland, an autonomous territory within Denmark, is geographically closer to North America than to Europe – just 26 kilometers from Canada, but over 2,000 from Denmark. The US already maintains a major military outpost at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, which was established in 1951 under a Cold War-era agreement. The base supports missile tracking and space surveillance, and now serves as a key node in Washington’s expanding missile defense ambitions. Framing Greenland as a strategic asset, US officials have justified the shift as necessary to counter rival powers.“We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic,”Vice President J.D. Vance previously said, citing Russian and Chinese activity. According to Politico, the reassignment would also support expansion of the Golden Dome — a global missile shield announced by President Donald Trump last month and estimated to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The system would aim to intercept threats from anywhere on Earth or space. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has called the initiative a“reckless approach”that undermines global stability. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Arctic holds vast potential for trade and resource extraction. While stressing that“Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,”he warned that geopolitical rivalry in the region is escalating, citing Washington’s“serious plans regarding Greenland.”",

    "title": "Polish president-elect on Russia’s wanted list",
    "article_text": "Polish president-elect Karol Nawrocki is listed as wanted by Russia on criminal charges related to his role in the destruction of Soviet-era monuments in the country, according to the Russian Interior Ministry’s public database. Nawrocki, a conservative candidate who narrowly clinched a victory in the run-off vote on Sunday, is being sought by Russia“under a criminal article,”the database says, without providing more details. The Polish president-elect has been in the sights of the Russian authorities since at least February 2024, according to TASS. The agency reported at the time that Russian law enforcement officials had initiated criminal proceedings against several senior Polish officials, including Nawrocki, then serving as director of Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance. The charges were related to the removal and destruction of Soviet war memorials. The Soviet Union lost over 600,000 soldiers during its campaign to liberate Poland from Nazi Germany between 1944 and 1945. After the war, hundreds of monuments were erected across Poland commemorating their role. Since the collapse of the Warsaw bloc and the end of the Cold War, Poland has accused the Soviet Union of“occupying”the country and has made efforts to eliminate communist-era symbols. By late 2023, the Polish authorities had removed 468 of the 561 Soviet memorials in the country, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow has accused Warsaw of trampling on the historical truth and paving the way for justifying Nazi collaborators. Nawrocki, who ran as an independent backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, defeated liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski with 50.89% of the vote in the presidential vote. He is scheduled to be sworn in on August 6. The president-elect, who also served as the director of the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk between 2017 and 2021, has generally supported continued aid to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, but has spoken out against Kiev joining NATO, or sending Polish troops to the country. He has also opposed closer EU-Ukraine trade ties, arguing that they would encourage unfair competition and undermine Polish agricultural and transport enterprises.",

    "title": "Ukraine conflict could be ‘longer and more brutal’ – Orban",
    "article_text": "The Ukraine conflict could drag on and become even more brutal, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned. He cited a deep rift between the US and EU on how to end it. Recent military activity suggests escalation rather than a push for peace, he added. Moscow and Kiev have held two rounds of direct peace talks in the past three weeks, leading to several agreements, such as large-scale prisoner exchanges. However, the talks were followed by intensified Ukrainian drone attacks, which Russia said were aimed at sabotaging peace efforts. Russia responded with retaliatory strikes on military infrastructure targets in Ukraine. “The military actions that have taken place in recent days signal that the war will be longer and more brutal,”Orban said in a social media post on Monday. He claimed that divisions within NATO are making the situation worse, as US President Donald Trump pushes for peace while EU“war hawks”want the conflict to continue. “We have to face the fact that the transatlantic unity has broken up,”Orban said, arguing that“there has never been such a gap”between pro-peace and pro-war forces within the military bloc. Orban said Hungary rejects the EU’s militaristic approach and will“remain on the side of peace,”even if this leads to“a louder debate with the Brussels bureaucrats, intent on the continuation of the war.” Hungary has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over the EU’s Ukraine policy. Orban has condemned the bloc’s arms and financial support for Kiev, and has promoted independent peace efforts. He has also voiced strong support for Trump’s efforts to mediate between Kiev and Moscow. In a separate post on Monday, Orban suggested that only an agreement between the US and Russia could bring peace. “It’s a misconception to think that peace could come as a result of a Russian-Ukrainian negotiation. It will never happen,”Orban stated.“The only way to make peace is a Russian-American agreement. And not only on the conflict… but on trade, energy, investments.” Russia and Ukraine exchanged memorandums proposing ways to resolve the conflict at the second round of talks on Monday, although according to the texts published online, their key demands remain at odds. Both sides are now reviewing each other’s proposals.",

    "article_text": "A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Marmaris area of southwestern Türkiye in the early hours of Tuesday, injuring 69 people and resulting in the death of a 14-year-old girl, according to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya. According to the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), the earthquake originated in the Mediterranean Sea. The epicenter was located 10.43km from the Mugla district of Marmaris, at a depth of 67.91km. In addition to southwestern Türkiye, tremors were felt across parts of southern Greece and the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea, local reports said. In early 2023, the country was hit by a devastating earthquake that claimed tens of thousands of lives. A 14-year-old girl in Fethiye died due to a panic attack, despite medical efforts, the interior minister said in a post on X. He added that dozens of people were injured after attempting to jump from heights during the chaos caused by the quake in Mugla Province and surrounding districts. ⚠️ Earthquake Alert: Turkey 🇹🇷At least 69 people injured after jumping out of buildings in panic during a 5.9–6.0 magnitude earthquake off Marmaris, Turkey — governor confirms.Quake struck at 2:17 AM, ~26 km south of the city.Stay safe, Türkiye. 🇹🇷#Earthquake#Marmaris…pic.twitter.com/Qqiz5R2QGB Yerlikaya noted that field assessments are ongoing under the coordination of the governor, with the AFAD and all relevant institutions actively involved. Emergency teams remain on alert in case of aftershocks. Videos circulating on social media show people in cafes fleeing in panic. Interior cameras show furniture shaking, and another video shows crowds gathering in a park to keep away from buildings.

    "title": "EU unlikely to meet demand from US senators on Russia sanctions – media",
    "article_text": "The EU is unlikely to finalize its next round of Russia sanctions before the G7 summit in Canada later this month, despite calls from US lawmakers for coordinated action, the EUobserver media outlet reported on Tuesday. US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said he aims to push new sanctions through by mid-June. In a joint statement with Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, the two urged the EU and US to curb China and India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil. Graham and Blumenthal visited Kiev together on Friday. Four EU diplomats earlier told EUobserver that the call to have“sanctions put in place – in coordination with Europe”by the G7 summit in Alberta on June 15-17 is unlikely to be met. Both senators visited France over the weekend to urge their EU allies to take stronger action. Graham also met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said the bloc is preparing its 18th package of“hard-biting sanctions”against Moscow. Western countries have imposed widespread sanctions on Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 in a bid to isolate the country. The restrictions include a ban on Russia’s seaborne oil shipments, cutting the country off from the Western financial system, and freezing around $300 billion in foreign reserves. The bloc introduced its 17th round of sanctions in May. Graham, a longtime Russia hawk and ally of US President Donald Trump, is backing legislation that would impose a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy, uranium, and other raw materials – measures aimed chiefly at India and China. He said the move has support from 82 of the 100 US senators. Trump has said the EU push for restrictions could make the chances of settling the Ukraine conflict“much worse,”but noted that“there could be a time where that’s going to happen.”He has also criticized Russia for recent strikes on Ukraine. Moscow has stressed that it is carrying out strikes on Ukrainian military-linked installations in response to Kiev’s increased drone attacks on Russian civilian facilities. Moscow has also said Trump is being misled about the Ukraine conflict by those pushing Washington toward supporting Kiev and taking a more aggressive stance on Russia.",

    "title": "11 Best Fanny Packs of 2025   Give Your Pockets a Break",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Listen, we can dance around what to call the best fanny packs—a.k.a. sling bags, crossbody bags, bum bags, shoulder bags, etc. But let’s not kid ourselves about what they are. Even the best fanny packs are, simply, fanny packs—and they're useful as hell. Once shorthand for awhole eraof ill-advised style decisions, the fanny pack has re-emerged into our good graces, a product of menswear’s gorpy overhaul and the realization that there are many funkier, weirder, wilder ways to dress (or carry a bag) than a buckle-on pocket in 2025. Its selling point is fairly obvious: The fanny pack is functional and versatile. When abackpackis too sweaty and a shoulder bag of some sort cramps your [pharmaceutical ad voiceover]active lifestyle, the fanny pack steps in to store all your necessities: keys, ChapStick,sunglasses, hand sanitizer, AirPods, backup AirPods, and more. Wear one around your waist like a dad trying to puzzle out where the visitor’s center is on a large map, or sling it over your body in, like, 13 other ways. Any of them beat praying that thetote bagyou haphazardly hung on the edge of your bike’s handlebars won’t jam itself into the spokes mid-cruise. (We may or may not be speaking from experience here.) Dagne Dover Nordstrom Dagne Dover is famous for its neoprene baggage—from suitcases to fanny packs—so much so that brands have been knocking off its signature move for a while now. We still think the Ace is the best of the bunch, mainly because it helped to popularize the style. There'a front zipper pocket for easy access to your most essential items—like your phone—a small slip pocket on the back for something like a transportation card—and the interior has a spacious one-liter capacity, as well as a couple pockets and even a key holder. It's low-key bag without any audacious logos or branding, but one look at it from someone who's in the know, and you're sure to get that IYKYK head nod from the distance. Loewe Mr Porter Loewe's Puzzle line is beloved for its unique shape and design, instantly recognizable by its jigsaw-like paneling. If you have a couple grand lying around (and then some), it makes for an absolute flex, whether slung from your waist or over your shoulder. There's an exterior zippered pocket, as well a zippered main compartment that's covered by a flap to create a more seamless silhouette. The belt buckle closure makes it easy to take it on and off, and that calf leather only breaks in more beautifully the more you get out there. FlipBelt Amazon Fanny packs make great running accessories, especially as too manyrunningshorts don't feature enough pockets. (Plus, phones seem to only be getting bigger and bigger, while our shorts only get shorter.) FlipBelt's classic running belt isbasicallya fanny pack, in that it's a pack… that you wear over your fanny. There are different openings within the belt that snugly hold onto your items—like your phone, keys, energy gels, etc.—so that you can finally hit that mile PR handsfree. Porter-Yoshida & Co. Ssense The best fanny packs are notoriously small because no one's trying to haul acarry-on bagacross their waist. Nevertheless, the bag geniuses over at Japanese Porter-Yoshida & Co. have designed the well-loved Tanker waist belt bag. Inspired by MA-1 flight jackets, this bag is equally durable with a boatload of storage so that you can store every little thing you'd possibly want on your next trek outside. You can easily customize the fit so that it adheres close to your body, and it comes in the same colors as your favoritebomber jacket. Patagonia Patagonia Made for outdoor adventurers and aspiring outdoor adventurers alike, the Patagonia Black Hole fanny pack is just as versatile, roomy, and durable as its suitcase sibling. It's water-resistant, and even though the brand's revamped its material since its inception, it's just as heavy-duty and long-lasting as ever. This bag is great for vacations so that you can bring all your belongings with you and don't have to return to your hotel for constant re-ups, and there's even a trusty water bottle holder because Patagonia knows you need to stay hydrated. Topo Designs Topo Desgins Topo Designs makes a damn good bag for travel, no matter the destination. Its aptly named Mountain waist pack would surely hold up if your journey finds you hoofing it up the side of a mountain, all while this petite bag keeps all your goods safe and secure. Its durable nylon construction can hold its own against pretty much anything, and if a peak fanny pack is what you're after, this is it. Lululemon Lululemon Not too long ago, Lululemon gave the fanny pack the Lululemon treatment, stripping the bag down to its essential elements—save for a teensy Lululemon logo in the corner—and leaving nothing but streamlined design in its wake. For a while it was one of themost popular bags around, so much so that it was rarely ever in stock, but now that brands can't blame Covid-induced supply chain issues, the Belt Bag is readily available in every size, shape, and color. Made out of water-repellent polyester (read: sweat-resistant) that looks like it should cost a lot more than it does, this is the fanny pack you buy if you worship at the altar of near-logoless practicality—and that's doubly true if you're an especially cost-conscious believer. Nike Nike Keep the goods on-hand (and not splayed across the street) while you're racking miles across the city. Rick Owens Ssense A fanny pack that grants you immediate access to Berghain. Osprey Nordstrom Rains Amazon Capacity: Fanny packs are usually fairly small because they're meant to be worn, well, on your fanny. While you can wear a fanny pack multiple ways, the idea is that a fanny pack will usually range in size from one liter to five liters. If you plan on carrying a lot of things at once, obviously opt for a larger size, but know that you'll also be having to toting a lot more weight. Storage: Whether you want something with just one compartment or prefer a bag with lots of pockets for organization, a good fanny pack will keep everything secure—whether with a zipper, velcro, or button closure—and make it easy for you to find everything you packed with ease. Wearability: The name “fanny pack” should give you an inkling of where these bags were originally intended for you to wear them (above your fanny!). These bags will come with straps of varying adjustable lengths, so you can also wear them over your shoulder, so if you'd prefer to wear a fanny pack like that, make sure the strap is long enough to do so.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Suits are an essential part of the menswear universe, but thanks to a truly bewildering array of places to get one both IRL and online, figuring out the best place to buy a suit can feel like a Herculean task. Do you go with abig-name brandor aconnoisseur-approved indie? Made-to-measure oroff-the-rack? And what about thoseonline tailorspromising high-end details and a perfect fit with just a few simple measurements? The answers to these questions will have a definitive impact on the kind of suit you end up with, and—more importantly—the impression you make when you wear it. Whether you\u0000’ve got asummer weddingon the calendar or a gauntlet ofjob interviewson the horizon, here’s how to get yourself suited right. Whether you’re going bespoke (a unique design created just for you) or made-to-measure (a pre-made silhouette customized to your individual specs) top-tier tailors likeJ.MueserandThe Armouryprovide a level of craftsmanship, customization, and fit that sets them apart from anything you’ll find in a retail store. This kind of quality, however, comes at a price. If you’ve got the budget, do your research to find a shop with a house style you like, then ask lots of questions about fit, materials, and technique before committing. If they’re doing everything in-house and using decent fabric (i.e. no wool-poly blends), you should be in good hands. J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter The Armoury by Ring Jacket The Armoury The Armoury by Ring Jacket The Armoury There is an abundance of online retailers that claim to offer the dialled-in fit and old-world quality of made-to-measure at prices far below what a top-shelf tailor would charge. Treat these with a healthy dose of suspicion. If you want to roll the dice on an online purchase, look for telltale marks of quality (name-brand wool cloth; full-or half-canvassed jackets) and find a reputable tailor in your area to do alterations (you will definitely need alterations). For best results, choose a brand with a brick-and-mortar showroom, likeSuitsupplyorProper Cloth, where you can assess their wares in person and get measured properly. Proper Cloth Proper Cloth Suitsupply Suitsupply Good suits are expensive, but (with a few exceptions—see below) there are good reasons for this. Even if you’re not getting hand-stitched buttonholes and cloth from one of Italy’s top mills, the amount of skilled labor required to make a half-decent suit is going to be reflected in the price. That’s why you should be dubious of suits from the likes of Zara and H&M, and avoid Shein and Amazon altogether. If a brand can make a profit selling a suit for $150, they are probably cutting corners in materials, labor, or both. Fast fashion brands are also geared towards trends, so whatever you buy now probably won’t look good in a year or two (if it even lasts that long). All that said: If you’re looking for an easy-wearing, laid-back, uber-affordable suit to get you through the summer, you could do a lot worse thanUniqlo U’s $150 numberorMango’s Italian-inspired assortment. Mango Mango Mango Mango Big name brands likeJ.Crew,Buck Mason, andTodd Snydertend to offer the best bang for your buck if you’re buying off-the-rack. To find the right look and fit for your body you should try as many brands and styles as you can, paying particular attention to the shoulders and jacket length, and have a trusted tailor standing by to make alterations. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Names likeTom Ford,Giorgio Armani, andRalph Laurencarry a lot of weight in the tailoring world, and for good reason. These are designers who have shaped the way we dress and have built empires on the strength of their good taste. That doesn’t, however, mean you need to spend two months’ rent to get a great-looking suit. While you can expect a certain level of quality from a luxury brand, the price on the tag also covers the money they spend on marketing, fashion shows, and expensive real estate. If you love the suit (and have the budget), by all means, go for it. But try not to be too swayed by the name on the label. Tom Ford Nordstrom Ralph Lauren Purple Label Ralph Lauren At a certain point in your journey down the rabbit hole of men’s tailoring, you’ll discover brands like Anglo-Italian,Stoffa, andRing Jacket. These each offer a distinctive blend of style, material, and craft, plus a certain level of clout among your menswear-obsessed friends. Unless you’re confident about your measurements and their fit, however, the best way to get into these brands is by visiting a showroom in person. Anglo-Italian Anglo-Italian Stòffa Stòffa The world is full ofgently worn suits looking for a new home, and with a bit of perseverance and a lot of time spent in fitting rooms (or trolling eBay), you canfind one that’s perfect for you. The luck-of-the-draw nature of vintage shopping, however, means that it’s not ideal if you’re in a rush to find a suit for an upcoming occasion. Likewise, if you’re after something specific, like an all-purpose navy blue or black suit for the office, you may have a harder time finding it here.",

    "title": "19 Best Face Wash for Men in 2025, According to Dermatologists",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you aren’t already using the best face wash for men (for your exact skin type), then you’re missing out. There really is no “one size fits all” in askin care routine, though manyskin care brands(especiallymen’sskin care brands) might try to convince you otherwise. It's important to find a face wash that matches your skin’s variables, such as natural moisture levels, aging, acne, sensitivity, and more. There are cost-effective options in every category: the Cetaphils and CeraVes and Neutrogenas produce formulas for every key skin type and need. Read on to see our picks for the best men’s facial cleansers, which are really just the best facial cleansers, period. These choices are based on over a decade of product testing, and also factor in the opinions of two board-certified dermatologists as well as web reviews far and wide. Cardon Amazon Macy's Cardon Key Ingredients:A trio of clays (kaolin, Moroccan lava, and bentonite) absorb oil while cica grass and cactus extract soothe, nourish, and hydrate skin. Despite the fact that I get dozens of cleansers sent to me each month, I will always keep Cardon's Purifying Clay Cleanser on the sink ledge, no matter how good the rest of them are. This marshmallowy soft face wash is a deep-cleaning superhorse, and suits all skin types. Clay is supremely nourishing on the skin as it soaks up any excess oil and grime, but mild enough that it shouldn't parch dry skin types, either. (As the doctors recommended, it's often just that dry and sensitive skin types need to wash less often.) I do find it easier to enjoy the benefits when I'm applying it at the sink and not in the shower, since it works best on damp skin (and not overly wet skin). Then, flush it away to have a pillowy soft, refreshed mug. Cardon even promises that it absorbs up to 4 times the impurities of any charcoal face wash. I'm inclined to confirm. Good to Know:You can use this as a makeshift deep-cleaning face mask, too—even just by leaving it on skin for an extra 30-60 seconds. The Ordinary The Ordinary Ulta Key Ingredients:Decyl glucoside and coco glucoside, which are gentle plant-derived facial surfactants. In short, they are mild on skin. This foaming gel is one of two new face washes to get a2023GQGrooming Award. It's a perfect addition to The Ordinary's \"keep it simple\" assortment: A chickpea-sized squeeze is more than enough for a generously foaming lather, and in my experience, it degreases my sweaty, oily brow in a jiffy. Even my more dry- and sensitive-skinned partner uses it without feeling dehydrated. This is the facial cleanser I'm most likely to restock on my own accord, in terms of a shower usage (since I love Cardon's for the sink ledge), and since it has more universality that other deep-cleaning foaming face washes. Good to Know:If you love The Ordinary and have dry skinbutare reticent to use a foaming cleanser (although I stand by this one), then also consider their excellentSqualane Cleanser. CeraVe Amazon Target Ulta Key Ingredients:Ceramides, which are key toCeraVe's best productsand fortify skin's barrier functions; squalane oil cleanses and nourishes, while hyaluronic acid supercharges hydration. Another2023GQGrooming Awardwinner, CeraVe rounds out their roster of cleansers with the best oil-based face wash in the game (though it's a blend of oil and water, to be clear). This stuff saves the skin of my dry-shelled partner thanks to its generous use of squalane oil, so it effectively pulls away dirt and grime while added back the needed nourishment in the process—so successfully that he feels and sees the difference after he rinses. If a simple face wash can make him smile that broadly after use, then it deserves this coveted spot onGQ's list. Good to Know:Not all oils clog pores, so even acne-prone individuals with dry skin can benefit from oil cleansers. Be sure to check the \"comedogenic rating\" of any oil-based ingredients; in this case, squalane oil scores a low 1 out of 5, which means it is almost certain not to clog pores. Aesop Aesop Nordstrom Bergdorf Goodman Key Ingredients:Panthenol, grape seed oil, and olive oil esters remove dirt and grime while also thoroughly nourishing skin. This easily could have been my Best Overall pick—seeing as any face wash that is best for sensitive skin types is often best for all skin types—but I do believe it belongs in this \"sensitive\" category foremost. This is like a milk bath for your face, and cleanses lightly so as to not trigger any volatility. Whenever I find myself with irritated, overly dry skin (seasonally, or from testing too many products), this is one that balances me out right quick. I also recommend it for anyone who has to cleanse more than twice in a day, since it will give you the needed refresh without ever stripping moisture. Good to Know:It has a generous pour, and its glass bottle isn't very gym or travel friendly; so perhaps get a reusable TSA-friendly vessel to tote it on the go. La Roche-Posay Amazon Target Ulta Key Ingredients:Salicylic acid (2%) frees up skin cells and oil backlogs that might clog your pores, while a trace amount of lipo-hydroxy acid gently rids of dead surface cells (to prevent further cloggings). This top-shelf drugstore brand is likely one of your dermatologists' favorites, and is one of the products I am most recommended by the pros whenever we discuss acne cleansers. It's a foaming gel that generously refreshes oily and acne-prone skin (so long as you let it set on there for 30 seconds or more before rinsing away). Look, it's easy to find an acne cleanser with salicylic acid as its hero ingredient, but it is harder and harder to find one that works as quickly, calmly, and effectively as LaRoche-Posay's (and for under 20 bones, no less). For me, this is an evening cleanser; I find it potent enough to save for once-daily use (even in mitigating blackheads). It's never overly drying on skin, but I think you can swap in a gentler option for the morning. Good to Know:LaRoche-Posay has a few key skin care lines that have confusing names. Here's a cheat sheet: Effaclar is for blemish-prone skin, Toleriane is sensitive skin, Anthelios is suncare, while Lipikar and Ciciplast are for dry skin. Geologie Amazon Geologie Key Ingredients:The plant-derived surfactant coco glucoside rinses grime while a dash of citric acid helps lift away dead skin cells. I like endorsing no-frills sensitive-steered formulas for combination skin, since these individuals need a perfect universal face wash to target both their oily and dry areas. Enter this fantastic gel cleanser from Geologie (which is actually shipped as two individual TSA-friendly cleansers). It's less sexy on paper than some products that lead with big ingredients-forward rosters; its biggest sell is the plant-derived surfactant Coco glucoside, similar to The Ordinary pick above. But that's also why I love it: With skin that wavers between oily and dry (in different parts of my face and changing with the seasons), I have to rely on uncomplicated products like this to do the cleansing, then I can leave it to the other products in my regimen to rehydrate each area of the face as it requires. This cleanser has no aggressive actives nor any added fragrance (to satisfy the drier parts) but it refreshes enough to satisfy the oily parts, too. Good to Know:If youdowant an oil-busting active, consider Geologie's similar2% salicylic acid cleanser. Murad Amazon Sephora Key Ingredients:Papaya enzymes gently exfoliate skin, algae extract and apricot oils hydrate, while fatty acids fortify and reinforce the skin barrier. Cream cleansers are a top option for sensitive types, but are often the most universal choice, too—which explains why I've slated Murad's outstanding face wash as the victor for the middle-road \"normal\" skin conditions. This one will honor your naturally fortified moisture barrier, while also providing non-physical exfoliation bennies via papaya enzymes. When I use it, I feel like I've used both a cleanser and a hydrating serum; my skin suggests as much, too. It always leaves my hands feeling extra nourished, too. Good to Know:This one works well as a shaving cream, too, if you're in a pinch or want to downsize the products you pack for a long weekend. Fresh Amazon Key Ingredients:Aloe vera, cucumber extract, borage seed oil, and soy proteins work in tandem to nourish and hydrate skin, no matter the age Fresh's low-foaming, gel cleanser offers excellent surface-level cleaning that leaves skin feeling clean without the sensation that you've been fully stripped of your natural oils. It's one of the most popular face cleansers in the world, able to reduce redness and clear out pores to minimize their appearance with continued use. This is great for all skin types, but particularly soothing for those with dry or aging skin who want something that'll nourish the skin while still cleansing it. Good to Know:This cleanser isnotsupposed to foam up a lot, so there's no need to squeeze globs of this in the hopes that you'll end up with clouds of cleanser on your mug. Use a pea-sized, or a little more, to get all the product you need to fully wash your face. Vanicream Amazon Key Ingredients:Sodium cocoyl glycinate for efficient and effective face cleansing Rather than explaining what Vanicream's gentle cleanser has in its ingredient list, it'd be easier to tell you what itdoesn'thave: There are no fragrances, parabens, sulfates, or dyes. Basically, if something is likely to irritate your skin, it's not in here. Most face cleansers, or skin care products in general, contain fragrance to, well, make the product smell good. But for a lot of people, those scents can cause irritation in the form of redness, acne, flaking, etc. Sensitive skin folks rave about Vanicream's cleanser for its no-frills approach to skin care products that contain nothing more than what it needs to get the job done—in this case: cleaning your face. Good to Know:Don't know anything about face cleansers and shopping on a budget? Just get this one. You won't impress anyone eyeing your bathroom counter, but they will be impressed by your impeccable skin. Kiehl's Amazon Kiehl's Key Ingredients:White clay detoxes skin, micro grains provide a gentle physical buffer, and tartaric acid pulls away dead skin cells. What appears to be a simple starch powder is in fact much more: When lathered into your palms, Kiehl's cleanser produces three different pore-clearing actions. It purifies with clay, buffs with micro grains, and clears out dead skin cells with alpha hydroxy acids. I love it for its many use cases, like on rough skin for needed smoothness, acne-prone skin (whenever or wherever it isn't actively breaking out), or on normal, oily, and combination skin to reduce shine. It is also one of the few clay cleansers that also uses the right vessel—a simple liquid-esque cap limits the amount of water that gets in, and prevents you from having a mound of powder in your hands. Maybe I'm just an idiot and can't figure out the other powder cleansers, but at least Kiehl's is idiot proof. Good to Know:Don't use powder cleansers in the shower; if that water seeps into the bottle, then you've got a big unusable glob of hard clay. Always start with damp hands, then sprinkle on the powder and build your initial lather. Hanskin Amazon Key Ingredients:Tea tree to keep breakouts at bay and jojoba, olive, grape seed oils and aloe vera for hydration Let us introduce you to the double cleanse: That is, using an oil-based cleanser to help dissolve hard-to-clean grime on your face, followed by a water-based cleanser to fully cleanse the face. An oil-based cleanser is especially good for those who wear makeup (which guys can do!) or mineral sunscreens, which don't wash away easily with water-based cleansers. We like this cleanser from Hanskin, which is slick, gliding over the face to dissolve whatever muck you've accumulated on your mug all day. After you've fully saturated your face, adding in some water helps to lather the cleanser, which you then rinse off and follow with your face wash of choice. It's non-irritating and it works well to give you the deepest clean you've ever felt in your life. Good to Know:Make sure to use this on a dry face before adding water to induce a lather. Neutrogena Amazon Ulta Target Key Ingredients:Hyaluronic acid provides a jolt of hydration as you cleanse. At least half a dozen times, I have found myself out of town and needing a non-drying cleanser on a dime (why splurge when I have a million options at home as a grooming editor?). And thank goodness for the global dominance of Neutrogena, because I can always find this foaming gel cleanser, which rivals many of the costlier options on this list and works with just about every skin type. So many of us shy away from the brands we used as teenagers, when really, these ubiquitous brands have the best research and development to appease the masses. No matter your skin type (sensitive and acne-prone included), this one works perfect without drying you out. The next time you're in need of a low-cost highly hydrated face wash (whether traveling or not), just go back to your roots. Good to Know:Neutrogena's entire Hydro Boost line is perfect for a low-cost regimen, including theirSPF 50 moisturizer with sunscreen,hyaluronic acid serum, anddry skin gel moisturizer. Le Domaine Amazon Le Domaine Key Ingredients:The proprietary active called GSM10 is derived from the grapes of 13 different grape varieties, and is enriched with antioxidants. It pairs with the post-biotic and biome-balancing ingredient lactobacillus. The speed at which I barreled through Le Domaine's skin-cradling cleanser... Every aspect of this French luxe label's skin care products is worth its steep price tag, thanks to the vineyard-sourced science behind it all. And this foaming oil-water emulsion will satisfy just about everyone who opts in; on any given day I fancy myself dry, oily, combination, acne-prone, or sensitive. And on any given day, this stuff left my skin feeling like A-list material. Good to Know:Why yes, this is the skin care label ofBrad Pitt. Cetaphil Amazon Walmart Ulta Key Ingredients:Glycerin and panthenol provide an extremely nourishing and hydrating base, while niacinamide soothes skin and fortifies skin's barrier functions. I'll throw this one to both dermo experts featured in this article—both of whom independently chose Cetaphil's non-foaming sensitive-skin cleanser as their top recommendation. Here is how Malik sums it up: “My patients and I love this cleanser as it is extremely gentle on the skin, yet very effective at removing impurities,SPF, and makeup. It ispH-balanced, fragrance-free, and non-comedogenic. It is also very versatile and suitable for nearly all skin types: dry, oily, combination, and sensitive included.” Good to Know:There's a companionCetaphil cleanser for oily skinand combination skin, too, with the same nourishing results. Ursa Major Amazon Ursa Major Dermstore Key Ingredients:Witch hazel tones and purifies the skin, while willow bark flushes out the pores. Aloe vera soothes on contact, and sodium hyaluronate seeps into skin to keep everything soft and hydrated. For as long as I've been on this grooming beat, Ursa Major's face wipes have been part of my routine. These individually wrapped wipes (in their biodegradable packaging) are easily toted in your pocket or gym bag, and are terrific for a refresh when you can't get showered soon enough. That '4-in-1' on its product name explains why they're so great too: They provide skin toning, moisturizing, and gentle exfoliation benefits as the natural ingredients tend to your pores. (And they soothe so nicely with aloe vera, too.) Plus, since you don't rinse after use, those benefits stay with you hours later. Good to Know:You can get these same long-lasting skin benefits fromUrsa Major's 4-in-1 face tonerat home, though it's even better if used after theirspearmint face washormilky cleanser. Marlowe Amazon If you've never used a foaming cleanser, this one from Marlowe is a great place to start. It's easy on the wallet—and your skin—and lasts a lot longer than you'd think. Harry's Harry's Harry's makes a bunch of our favorite shaving equipment, but the brand's skin care line isn't anything to scoff at. This gentle facial cleanser is great for anyone looking for a budget option. Malin+Goetz Malin+Goetz Malin+Goetz is one of the industry GOATs when it comes to great-smelling products, and this Grapefruit face cleanser has a delicious citrus scent without any artificial nonsense that might mess with your skin. Agent Nateur Agent Nateur Agent Nateur's Lactic Acid cleanser dissolves dead skin cells and helps with turnover, then uses hydrating aloe leaf to moisturize the face. A one-two punch of skin care power. Dermalogica Dermalogica This one is a favorite ofGQ's associate commerce editor Tyler Chin. Using positively-charged hyaluronic acid, this cleanser from Dermalogica helps your skin stay clean, retain moisture, and glow all day long. Ursa Major Ursa Major Another go-to for Chin (the guy, not the body part…well also the body part) is this Fantastic Face Wash from Vermont brand Ursa Major. It uses sugar-maple-derived alpha hydroxy acid to cleanse without stripping, and smells great. The easiest way to find the best face cleanser for men is to shop by your skin type, and to look for products that specifically target your skin’s needs. They will do this with their formula or their key ingredients. Here are the key skin types and conditions you will see addressed most commonly, along with advice for finding the best men’s face wash for your skin needs. The expertise comes from NYC-based board-certified dermatologistsDr. Kunal MalikandDr. Asmi Sanghvi. But first, one word of wisdom from Malik, who says not to invest too much of your “skin care goals” into a cleanser. “Due to their very brief exposure while washing the skin, the benefits of a cleanser are likely very limited,” he explains. Think of their benefits as most surface level, or for a quick pore expunging. “For [greater nourishing and fortifying needs], try leave-onserums, ormoisturizerswork much better,” he says. These will be a more assuring way to target things like hydration and skin tone (like withvitamin C, for example). You don’t go a decade as a grooming writer and editor without testing a million and a half facial cleansers and lotions along the way. I must get four or five sent to my home every week, and so this list is curated from the best of the best. My partner and I have different skin types and needs too, so anything ill-suited for me is perfect for him. I always cross-check my opinions with the web’s too: Just because I like something or it's the best-selling product doesn’t make it the end-all be-all truth. The products on this roster are well regarded amongst consumers, too, most of them averaging about 4.5 stars out of 5 on key retail sites. Dr. Kunal Malikis a board-certified dermatologist at Spring Street Dermatology in NYC. He is also Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Asmi Sanghviis a board-certified dermatologist in NYC, practicing at Advanced Laser and Skin Cancer Center in Teaneck, NJ. She is also a Clinical Instructor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. What is the best face wash for men? All signs point to Cardon’s Purifying Clay Cleanser as the best men’s face cleanser. Its cushioning clay can deep clean pores (great for oily, combination, and acne-prone skin) while also being gentle and nourishing (good for normal, dry, and sensitive skin). Few products have universality like this one. Do men need a facial cleanser? Yes, you need a facial cleanser. Do yourself a favor and choose the best men’s face washfor your specific skin type. So, if your skin is usually oily, or dry, or acne-prone, or sensitive (and so forth), choose a product that targets the exact condition and promises to give you balance and softness as a result, without overstripping moisture or clogging pores. If you're looking for something that leans more “heavy-duty exfoliation,” check outour favorite face scrubs. How often should men use face wash? Men should use face wash every day (no different from women). Usually twice a day, morning and night, but some exceptions are made for people with overly dry and sensitive skin (they might just wash once a day) as well as those who sweat a lot or workout midday (they might need a gentle cleanser that they can deploy three times a day).",

    "title": "14 Best Belts for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best belts for men keep shit from going south, but they also make shithappen, in the most stylish way possible. First and foremost: a belt should hold up your pants. We know this, you know this, every ‘70s-era leading man in hip-hugging jeans knows this. More than their practical benefits, though, belts can make or break an entire outfit, imbuing your getups with a jolt ofcowboy swaggerordisheveled-heartthrob cool. And that'sespeciallytrue in summer. So, we’re not suggesting you swap that discreet western joint for a brash leather number worthy of a WWE champion, but wearesuggesting that you apply the same care and attention to your belts that you do every other piece of clothing in your closet. To help you do just that, we went deep on the best belts for men this summer to keep you looking sharp—and your pants right where they belong. Maximum Henry Alex Mill Maximum Henry When Maximum Henry Cohen launched his eponymous label in 2012, I doubt he pictured himself outfitting style icons like Robert Pattinson and Timothée Chalamet—but here we are. Twelve years later, his brand has crossed into Hollywood, collaborated with leadingInternet menswear personalities, and also notably partnered with the most discerning boutiques, who proudly display his handmade belts right on their shelves. They do it because the belts are true pieces of craftsmanship. They’re cut, dyed, stitched, and waxed to order in their Long Island City studio, and made from 100% Belgian vegetable-tanned leather with sturdy stainless steel hardware. Take this one: At 1.5” wide, it’s the perfect daily driver, whether you’re pairing it withraw denim jeansor paper-thin chinos. The additional beauty of this brand? No two pieces are exactly alike, so each belt is already unique, though you’ll make it even more so as the patina builds with every wear. With Maximum Henry, you’re getting a piece that’s truly yours—not some cookie-cutter belt from the nearest outlet store. Journeyman Amazon For just under $50, you can snag both black and brown belts from Journeyman. And don’t let the price fool you: Made in the U.S. from full-grain leather at a sturdy 1.5” width, this belt gets all the fundamentals right. It’s an ideal pick if you’re just dipping your toes into the belt game—not only does it keep your wallet happy, but the classic color options and silver single-prong buckle make it as versatile as they come. More good news? The brand backs it with a lifetime warranty, making it a stress-free investment. And here’s the kicker: the buckle is removable, so you can swap it out someday for that vintage one you scored at the flea market. Anderson's Mr. Porter Family-owned Italian accessory brand Anderson’s has been turning out some of the world’s finest belts for nearly 65 years—and they’re still doing it all from a workshop in Parma, Italy. Their secret sauce? A mastery of Italian leather, a playful approach to design, and a commitment to a rigorous 100-step production process that guarantees every belt shipped out meets its high standards. (Yes, that’s 100 steps for a single belt. Quality, my friend, doesn’t come easy.) All of this is also why retailers like Mr. Porter don't just buy two or three Anderson's styles—they buy twenty or thirty. This black suit-ready beauty shows just how Anderson has mastered the classic elements of a dress belt. The premium calf leather is a just-right 3.5cm wide, and fastens with a silver-tone buckle that says \"I don't need your attention.” It’s a showstopper that pairs equally well with an all-black fit or some casual grays and charcoals—because quality typically lends itself to versatility. Corridor Corridor A little bit boho, a little Ivy League, the unique magic of a braided belt is that you’ll never need to hunt for the right hole—just tighten the belt until your pants sit right at your waist, then slot the buckle prong easily into the braid it’s landed on. But where to source one? Well, just as Corridor has quietly come foryour weekend wardrobe, andknit collection, they’re now ready to replace your belt too. This one is made in India from full leather, and 100% leather except for its antique brass buckle. Our Legacy SSENSE Honestly,Our Legacy’s belts are one of the main reasons menswear guys started paying closer attention to belts again. Just as theirCamion seriesmanaged to perfect the kind of shoes every guy wants to wear right now, their semi-braided Western belt has an unmistakable presence at most fashion gatherings and has spawned a series of imitations. But the original remains the strongest. OL’s belt is a neat 2cm wide, with a metal pin, Western buckle closure, metal keeper, and metal hardware tips that all combine for a sort of punk, sort of rodeo vibe. Simply put, this belt takes any outfit in a number of complimentary directions—and don’t worry, it won’t bite. Artemas Quibble Artemas Quibble What do Steven Yeun, Sergio Pérez, and Paul Mescal all have in common? Well, aside from rocking the cover ofGQ, they’ve also each been spotted wearing belts from Artemas Quibble. The masterminds behind the label are husband-and-wife duo Natasha Chekoudjian and Jason Ross, who have also designed belts for some of fashion’s biggest names: Calvin Klein, Helmut Lang, and Rick Owens. Each belt is handmade, and you, the buyer, get to choose the hardware and leather color. The belts feature materials like reclaimed leather, repurposed brass, and antique textiles, combining for a perfect blend of raw materials and avant-garde aesthetics. The belt itself is 1.25” wide, but the buckle? Unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Seriously, if \"presence\" had a dictionary image, this would be it. It’s the kind of belt that could easily work for A-listers today, cowboys of yesteryear, and maybe even a Spartan or two before that. Nicks Boots Nicks Boots Made from Nicks Boots' thickest and finest steer hide, this is the kind of belt actual cowboys would have thoroughly examined before handing over their dollars. With textured details to rival the Appaloosa horse it's named after, the heavy-duty approach is carried over to the hardware also—solid brass, baby. Buck Mason Buck Mason An ‘engine-turned’ belt, with a handsome engraved buckle like the one above, immediately classes up any pair of chinos and jeans. Buck Mason's brings even more to the party—it's made from vegetable-tanned steerhide, with a croc-embossed texture. L.L.Bean L.L.Bean The Bean's recipe for success this season? It’s all about theBBB.Not the Big Baller Brand: We’re talkingbarn coats, boots, and belts. Like this full-grain leather belt with a solid brass buckle, braided so it’ll fit you comfortably no matter that day (or hour’s) fluctuations. Tory Leather Front General Store Brooklyn’s beloved Front General Store has some of the best vintage but also makes excellent private-label beanies, thermals, and now belts. Made in the USA from 1” bridle leather with a unique sewn pattern, this belt is the ultimate choice if you’ve been itching for some stitching. Emily Dawn Long Emily Dawn Long Emily Dawn Long has, ahem, long been beloved by New York City's downtown denizens, but her most recent designs—including this collaboration with Maximum Henry (our best overall belt-maker) are building her hype even further. In this case, shoppers are loving how the stitching takes the typical edge off a black leather piece. Hollywood Trading Company Hollywood Trading Company The belt Jim Morrison would have probably chosen to melt hearts in a smoky club. The mixed, but somehow soft-feeling studs bring a cool blend of old Hollywood glamor and rock 'n' roll grit. And since it's Italian-made, it's built to last—a piece you could pass down to your kids, along with a few stories they might not be ready for. J.Crew J.Crew Chocolate brown or snuff suede—J.Crew chose to produce what some say are the two best belt varieties. We’re all winners for it, especially when the result comes in at sub-$100. Lemaire SSENSE The Lemaire version of anything is often the most special. And while we wouldn’t want to tear down any of the other options on this list, this minimal Western belt somehow manages to be both city and country. A buffed leather beauty with antiqued gunmetal hardware and a detachable buckle, it\u0000\u0000’ll have you ready to slide a lasso into your daily commuter tote. What, exactly, differentiates a so-so belt from a truly superlative one? It’s more than just enough holes (though that’s a good place to start). Homing in on the materials at play is especially key. Are you looking for full-grain leather that’s durable and business-ready? Or maybe a braided suede for a relaxed, just swung-off-the-horse vibe? Once you've got that figured out, it’s time to choose between widths (casual belts usually clock in at around 1.5 inches wide; formal belts 1.25 inches), and buckle types (clean and classic buckles skew formal; rugged, D-ring buckles skew casual). Finally, and perhaps most importantly: figure out your proper waist size. Pros tend to go about 1 or 2 inches up for a fit that’s snug but not restrictive, which also leaves a little room for any winter weight anybody reading this definitely won’t gain. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyestaffordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t.",

    "title": "How Work Style Has Changed in the Return-to-Office Era",
    "article_text": "In April, Google made a startlingannouncementto staff: Come back to the office or lose your job. It echoedsimilar mandatesput forth by Amazon last year,by JP Morganin March, andby Uberlast month. After years of various fits and starts, employers are getting serious—like,reallyserious this time—about calling employees back to the workplace. And while a wide swath of companies have required some version of post-COVID office attendance for some time now, there seems to be real momentum building for a proper “return to office” happening, with deadlines looming in the fall. But the office is a vastly different place today than it was five years ago—as are the workers themselves. People have moved, gotten older, changed careers, become parents, settled into new behaviors. They have discovered the joys of comfortable clothing—or perhaps now feel that their outfits should speak more directly to who they are. For many, the very notion of building a separate, blander wardrobe specifically for the workplace seems somehow antiquated. Take, for instance, Bernardo Teran, a designer and project manager at a Los Angeles architecture firm. The months he spent working from home during the pandemic allowed him to reassess both his wardrobe and his overall approach to getting dressed. In his spare time he started watching classic Hollywood movies and engaging with men’s fashion content on TikTok, both of which he credits with expanding his style horizons and sharpening his eye. Are quarter-zip sweaters ever cool? Is it kosher to wear sneakers to a board meeting?GQanswers all your most pressing workplace style queries. When his office asked employees back full-time in 2023, Teran made subtle but telling adjustments to his workplace uniform. He got into watches during the pandemic, and upgraded his junky sneakers to Pradabrogues. These changes reflected not only his evolving taste but his stage of life and professional status—he went into the pandemic in his late 20s and came out in his early 30s. He got a promotion. He pruned his closet to reflect all that, focusing on simple, versatile items sourced from higher-quality brands. “Before the pandemic, dressing ‘like an architect’ felt important to me,” he said. “Now, I just wear what I like.” When Matt Goulet, an editorial manager for a national retailer, was asked to come back to the office about a year ago, he understood immediately that some ineffable thing had shifted. “I’m completely confounded by it,” he said of dressing for his job now. “It’s almost likeSeverance—I have to wearthisand bethis.Meanwhile, on Mondays and Fridays, we’re on Zoom, and you’ll catch me wearing a baseball cap and a Reese Cooper hoodie.” Before the pandemic, Goulet wore what he refers to as the “millennial man’s first corporate job uniform”: brown dress shoes, dark jeans, and abutton-down Oxford shirt, sometimes with a sweater over top. Staid, respectable. But after years of working from home, he was able to explore a style that felt more like an authentic expression of himself than a costume to appease a corporation. If Goulet had his way, he’d likely be wearing basketball shorts and hoodies most of the time, but he splits the difference for office days; these days, he says, his look is “casualified.” Usually, it’s a knit sweater and somejeansandsneakers—a combination that is comfortable but, in Goulet’s view, lacks any sense of self expression. “There was a moment when we were coming back to the office, and I was like ‘I’m gonna try a few different things,’” Goulet said. “So I did the tucked-in button-up, trying to be a little more polished. But after a few weeks that fell off, and I was back to the knits and jeans. “At that point, my wardrobe had morphed into this casual world,” he continued. “It would've required an investment to go fully in the direction of polished and dressed up.” Clothing has always played a pivotal role in our working lives. “The golden age of uniform is undoubtedly the first half of the 20th century,” says Jane Tynan, a cultural historian at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, who edited the bookUniform: Clothing and Discipline in the Modern World. “Uniforms were adopted by most large organizations to extract loyalty from workers—this standardized dress was an early form of branding.” An all-occasions style guide for the weekly grind with nary a stretchy chino in sight. There’s long been a tension between freedom, autonomy, and self-expression in the way we dress for work. Are workers gaining power when they ditch their suits for athleisure? Or are they merely attempting to flex the small amount of independence they have, in the face of employers clawing them back to a 9-to-5 office experience? The relationship between our personal and professional lives—and how that’s expressed through clothing—has always been a fashion world obsession. The late-aughtsMad Mencraze, for instance,inspireda 2008 Michael Kors collection. Or consider Thom Browne’s2009 Pitti Uomo presentation, in which an army of identically dressed office drones entered a drab workplace en masse and sat clacking their typewriters in unison before leaving. As a culture we’ve long read into the symbolism of Mark Zuckerberg'szip-up hoodieor lionized Steve Jobs for his streamlined Issey Miyaketurtleneck. Dress for the job you want, the old adage goes. “Desk jobs and hospitality uniforms perform a symbolic function to both standardize bodies and project an image of unity and authority,” says Tynan. “Uniforms are part of a symbolic system that gives institutions or companies a lot of power over workers' bodies and a hand in styling the service encounter.” As something of an RTO influencer, Xander Maddox has taken advantage of this fuzzy workplace style moment. OnInstagramandTikTok, he shows off his daily outfits for his job in digital finance. He started posting his office looks around 2023 and, once or twice, his content has gone viral. Maddox subscribes to a new idea of an office uniform, far from the days when suits and ties were standard issue. He describes his style as “elevated but cozy,” and prefers looser, relaxed silhouettes. He loves labels like Fear of God, The Row, Lemaire, and Our Legacy, though he often approximates the look of those brands with more affordable pieces fromCOSorUniqlo. His standard work uniform comprises a loosepleated trouser, anoversized T-shirt—sometimes with ahoodieover it—andloafers. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Maddox notes that he regularly receives compliments from coworkers, including his boss, but the most surreal moments are when people recognize him in public. “I’ve had a few people come up to me in person and tell me they like what I’m doing, which has been strange,” he says. According to data shared by Google Trends, the novelty of reentering the office in earnest may have some unforeseen consequences. “After seasons of casual comfort and minimalism, men are embracing a new era of dressing up, redefining the traditional office wardrobe,” says Sagal Mohammed, the editorial and creative lead at Google Shopping. “Predictability is out, and personal expression is in, which probably explains the trending interest inoffice bagsand the return of classic tailoring-inspired looks.” Take, for instance, the top five results for the “best men’s ____ for the office” over the past year in the USA: “backpack,” “premium denim,” “casual shoes,” “fragrance,” and “polo shirts.” Or the fact that searches for “casual work outfits” and “business casual outfits” are currently at an all-time high since the start of the pandemic. Or the number one search term, related to office-core: “business core aesthetic men.” Indeed,the suitappears primed for a workplace comeback, despite the fact that people have been declaring itdeadfor decades. Where some workers have sought to bring their athleisure-inflected WFH lives with them back to the office, others are finding new purpose and pleasure in dressing in the elegant tailored wear of yore. And expressing one’s personality through clothing doesn’t always have to mean taking big swings; sometimes small nods—a lapel pin here, a bold sock there—can speak the loudest. “With individuality now at the forefront of office fashion,” Mohammed says, “workplace attire is no longer simply functional but also a form of self-expression.” On that front, Goulet, the editorial manager, did mention something that recently piqued his interest in office dressing: Harris Dickinson’s wardrobe in the recent filmBabygirl.Indeed, as an office intern who starts a kinky affair with his company’s CEO, Dickinson’s wardrobe—boxy suits, oversizedbutton-downs,neckties—felt charmingly anachronistic. “I was like, That’s alook,” Goulet said, reflecting on the way that wearing a suit suddenly seems strangely rebellious. “Why don’t I wearthatto the office?”",

    "title": "I Spent a Week Wearing the Summer’s Splashiest Dive Watch",
    "article_text": "In June 1752, Benjamin Franklin was monitoring an afternoon storm. Franklin had gathered a kite with a long string and a key tied near the bottom end to prepare for this very moment. As the rain came down and the thunder crashed in the distance, Franklin walked out into the storm, set his kite loose, and captured a bolt of surging lightning—a shade of yellow that frankly would’ve looked feeble and powerless next to the electrifying hue on Zenith’s new Defy Revival Diver. This latest release is Zenith’s second Defy Revival Diver (DRD from here on out) to push the color spectrum to its breaking point.While last year’s version paired a stainless steel case with screeching orange accents, Zenith managed to go bolder for the sequel. The neon yellow is even louder, especially set against the watch’s matte black case and bracelet—both made from light titanium. The orange in the 2024 edition was inspired by the original DND produced by Zenith in 1969. But there’s no historical precedent for the splashy yellow accents and matte black case used here; the pairing brings the archival model fully into the present. The watch looks like a supercar you’d customize in aNeed for Speedvideo game. Even if there isn’t an exact analog in the archives, the vibrant color is backed by historical utility. If you were heading below the depths for a scuba session in the ’60s, you would have wanted a watch that was as bright and luminescent as possible to ensure its legibility underwater. That’s why, for instance, the diving specialists at Doxa pump out their heavy-duty watches in a rainbow of deliciously fun colors, or why Bulova’s iconic “Devil Diver” comes in traffic-cone orange. Zenith’s new DRD can still dive—to the very precise 600 meters, which in feet just so happens to be 1,969, a nod to the year the Defy line was born. Nice touch. The new DRD continues a searing hot streak for Zenith, which has quietly put together a 2025 I’d stack up with any other watch brand. The brand began the year by launching a spin on its flagship Chronomaster with a gem-set rainbow bezel, and it hasn’t stopped putting out banger pieces since. At Watches and Wonders, I absolutely loved the revival of its elegant G.F.J. model that combined shades of blue and lapis lazuli. The brand has used the gemstone effectively all year: In May, it released a versionof the Chronomaster with a lapis lazuli dial. Now, thanks to this latest DRD, there are officially an abundance of Zeniths I’d love to add to my personal collection. I recently got to spend a solid week and change with the Defy Revival Diver on my wrist—and there was a lot to love about the experience. What I loved Looking down at the yellow bezel, hands, and outer track on the dial feels like walking out of a dark movie theater into the afternoon sun. As someone who just wrote about the importance of keeping a summer watch in the rotation, I have an even greater appreciation for how this DRD could fit into my (or your) life. On sunny days, why not wear a watch brighter than a combustible star? The watch's exhibition caseback What else did I love? With both this reference and last year’s, I appreciate that Zenith remained faithful to many of the details from the original 1969 release. The 37 mm size stays true to the era, and the small size makes the watch feel even lighter on the wrist. The “ladder” bracelet follows the original design by Gay Frères—the most legendary bracelet maker in the industry, so good that Rolex purchased the company in 1998. The last vintage touch I really appreciate: the “automatic” type in twee lowercase cursive on the dial, which makes me scrunch up my face like I’ve just seen an adorable kitten. What I would do differently The matte black titanium is a cool idea, but I don’t think it’s a great match with this high-voltage shade of yellow. Zenith was going for a high contrast between the neon and sheenless case and bracelet, but the chasm between the two doesn’t play right for me. The matte finish makes the case look more like a dull gray than black to me. The vivid yellow only makes it apparent how lifeless the matte elements appear. What’s more painful is that you get a taste of what the watch could’ve looked like with a shiny black exterior. The dial pairs these two elements perfectly and helps me understandwhat compelled Wiz Khalifa to pen an anthem about this color combination. If I had a choice between this new DRD and last year’s orange-and-steel version, I would lean toward the latter. All in all, my enthusiasm for the new DRD was closer to the electric yellow shade than the dim matte black case. Earlier this year,I wrote about how watch brands are trying to maximize the fun in high-end watchmaking. This new diver is right in line with that idea: a super-light watch that can explore 600 meters underwater, featuring a shade of yellow that will be a surefire hit at any summer shindig. When last year’s orange Defy Revival Diver arrived, it never occurred to me it needed a sequel. However, this second version is making me greedy for a whole rainbow of DRDs. The vintage-inspired watch is the perfect template for Zenith to experiment with color, and I hope I’m trying on cotton-candy pink,Bratgreen, and Jolly Rancher blue versions of the model in the coming years. The specs Titanium case and bracelet, 37 millimeters, water resistance to 600 meters, 60-hour power reserve, date function between 4 and 5 o’clock, automatic movement, exhibition caseback, $8,200.Buy it here.",

    "title": "Here Is Everything Timothée Chalamet Has Ever Worn to a Knicks Game",
    "article_text": "As the 2025New York Knickswaded through athrillingly unchartered, if ultimately ill-fated, NBA postseason, the surest bet you could place in advance of any game was that Timothée Chalamet would be there: sitting courtside, hyping up his beloved team, and wearing some sort of charmingly slovenly ensemble. The actor and native Manhattanite, whose childhood apartment in Hell’s Kitchen was approximately a 15-minute walk from Madison Square Garden, went out of his way to attend the team’s playoff games this season, carving out time in his busy Hollywood schedule to jet between various metropolises and small-market arenas. This love is serious: Hewent to Detroitto cheer on the Knicks. Heskipped the Met Galatowatch the game on an iPad. Hell, he even had his“born-and-raised LA baddie”girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, cheering on his home team—in Indianapolis, no less. Timmy Tim and Spike, ’til the very end. And for as long as Timmy’s been famous enough to sit (and be photographed) amongst the VIPs in the Garden’s Celebrity Row, he’s steadily built up his blue-and-orange wardrobe. Though the actor’s beenbing-bongingsince long before he was rubbing elbows with fellow Knicks fanatics like Ben Stiller and Spike Lee, he only recently started really dressing like a high-profile superfan. Luckily for us, the internet has photo documentation of every Knicks game Chalamet has attended in the last seven-ish years. Let’s review, shall we? Nothing gold can stay, but blue and orange are forever. The custom Chrome Hearts continues. Do we think Timmy went thrifting during his sojourn in Indianapolis? I feel like he’d cleanupin a Midwestern Goodwill. A private jet to Indianapolis,a suitcase full of Chrome Hearts, and a dream… If you ever needed a reason to justify owning a pair of orange cargo pants, this Knicks playoff run is it. TC’s customized Chrome Hearts Timberland boots have become his new courtside talisman. Whether or not they will bring good or bad luck remains to be seen. ¡Nueva Yooooork! Sitting alongside Bad Bunny at Game 6, Chalamet wore a customChrome Heartsvelour tracksuit (likely thing for him to do) with a striped polo shirt and matching Chromed-up Timbs. The moment Timmy postedthose filthy Timbson the ’gram, we knew what was going down. While Timmy’s girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, and her sister, Kendall, both opted for the standard courtside-baddie uniform (tank top, leather pants, strappy sandals), Chalamet followed a failsafe mantra of the diehead New York sports fan:Clear eyes, cooked Timbs, can’t lose.That, and he managed to dig up a pretty sickvintage Knicks teefrom the ’95 playoffs. 🎶Ricksout for the Knicks, Ricks out for the Knicks! 🎶 (The vintage Starter jacket is cool, too.) Per my more sports-mindedGQcolleagues, these performance-style hoodiesseem to be a bit divisive. But given that Chalamet went all the way to chilly Detroit to see the Knicks’ round-one matchup against the Pistons, it made sense that he’d bundle up a bit. This is a classic Timmy Tim post-swag mash-up of niche streetwear and wonky luxury wares: a Juun.J hoodie, camo-print jeans,Dior loafers, and a Knicks snapback. And lest we forget,that mustache. Who else is pairing a Raf Simons fall 1997 jacket with some track pants andUggs? Only Timmy Tim, that’s who! When Chalamet was in the depths of dressing for his bonkersA Complete Unknownpress tour—which also happened to coincide with this Knicks-Grizzlies game at MSG—he leaned heavily into 2000s nostalgia. This outfit has several aughts-era relics at play including anAlexander McQueen skull scarf(a grail amongst Kitson-patronizing socialites of yore), heavily whiskeredTrue Religion jeans, and a punchy Knicks leather bomber jacket. A Yankees hat at a Knicks game: What wouldMayor Eric Adamshave to say about this? A self-referential moment from Timmy here: the bookshelf-printed sweater is from the Japanese label Sacai’s fall 2023 collection, which pulled imagery from Christopher Nolan’s 2014 filmInterstellar, in which Chalamet appeared as the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper. (To reference another Nolan movie,Inception, there’s diegetic levels to this!) Also featuring what appears to be a fresh-from-the-box pair of Nike Field General sneakers. A kooky Burberry hoodie, yes, but also an Ivy Park face mask! Does theBeyhiveknow about this? Aside from the Isabel Marant sneakers, the real star of this outfit—aScarfaceparody tee featuring Stewie fromFamily Guy—washiding beneathTimmy’s Prada puffer. Fun fact: Timothée Chalamet’s mom, Nicole Flender, danced at Lincoln Center with the New York City Ballet as a child and later appeared on Broadway inA Chorus Line—hence, perhaps, this hat. Or, asBritishVogueput it at the time, the cap proved that the then-rising star was also “the pin-up for every aspiring actress” and “a heartbreaker for the modern era.” This game took place a little over a week after Chalamet’s first Oscars ceremony, when he was nominated for his breakthrough performance in Luca Guadagnino’sCall Me By Your Name. He was well on his way to becoming a big star at this point, which you can tell because of one extremely Hollywood accessory: a trucker hat from Brentwood Country Mart, LA’s finest purveyor of upmarket goods. Way back in 2017, not long afterCall Me By Your Namehit select theaters, Chalamet watched the Knicks courtside with two former classmates, Ansel Elgort and Violetta Komyshan, from Manhattan’s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, a.k.a. the school fromFame. At the time, Timmy had most recently beena student at NYU, and on this night, in a leather jacket, skinny jeans, and Dr. Martens, he really looked the part. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Reggie Bush, Who’s Still Doing Strength Training to Alleviate the Pain of 11 Years in the NFL",
    "article_text": "Reggie Bush is a superhero to an entire generation offootballfans. During his time at the University of Southern California—where he was one of the best college players ever, winning two national championships, earning All-American honors and aHeisman trophyduring a goated career—it was hard to imagine anyone could run faster than Bush. But now, at 40 years old, nine years removed from his last NFL game, Bush has in fact slowed down. After 11 years in the league, Bush has turned to a different sport to occupy his free time. TheSuper Bowl championis now an avid golfer, and he’s not shy about preaching the physical benefits of the game. And because he also wants everyone to look as fly as possible while they walk the fairway, Bush has collaborated with TravisMathew on the athleisure brand’s “A Legacy Reclaimed” line. As someone who likes to go into the store and buy an outfit straight off the mannequin, eliminating the often painstaking process of trying to put together a stylish golf fit with various pieces from around the retail floor, Bush is extremely hyped about the TravisMathew apparel he helped design, which includes a piece that combines two closet staples. “What's unique about this shirt, which has never been done before, it's agolfshirt with a hoodie on it,” Bush explains. “This is my design that I came up with and I'm very proud of it because I think it came out great.” When he’s not golfing, Bush is still a regular in the gym, but with a different purpose than when he was trying to avoid vicious linebackers. The lightning-quick running back is still running sprints and hitting leg day hard, but his strength training now is done to alleviate the pain of all those hits he used to take. Here Bush reveals the specifics of that workout, as well as the NFL teammate whose athleticism wowed him the most and the only beverage he keeps in his house. Reggie Bush: I'm in the Los Angeles area. Life for me now is a lot of involvement with my three kids. They're involved in every sport known to mankind. We're driving them to practice, going through homework, dinner, and bedtime. That's pretty much a nightly evening routine for us because we're very hands-on with our kids. We don't have nannies. We do everything with our kids, [though] do have really good help though from my in-laws. My wife's parents are amazing. They give us so much help. That's like our nannies if we had them. But a lot of my life is being a dad, being a husband, working on my own personal projects, and one of those is TravisMathew. Dad life and business life. I workout five days a week. Usually my day starts out with a workout. I have a number of injuries from playing that if I don't work out, that they'll catch up to me. It's important for me to keep my body strong, keep my body fit and healthy. Because I'm constantly working onstrengthening, that alleviates some pain for me in some areas. There was a time two, three years into retirement, where I was just in a lot of pain. When you lose that routine from playing in the NFL—when to wake up, when to go do all these different things—now all that is placed on your shoulders. It's a tough place to be for some people, because not everybody is able to keep it going when it's all on you. Thankfully, I've had great support at home with my wife and kids. My wife and I work out together all the time. We're actually about to work out together after this. I'll just run through it real quick. My second year in the NFL, I tore my PCL. That's the posterior cruciate ligament. That basically wraps around the back of your knee, and that is part of a couple different tendons and ligaments that keep the knee stable and strong. I tore that, and doctors advised me not to repair it, because they said I would heal quickly and get back faster on the field. I wish I never did that. But listening to NFL doctors, I didn't do surgery on it, so I actually don't have a PCL anymore in my left knee. Then the next year, my third year in the league, I tore my medial meniscus, which is on the interior portion of your knee. That led to microfracture surgery. Microfracture is very tough. For a lot of people, it is usually career ending. Basically what they do is drill holes in the bone—literally, with a drill! Because of wear and tear in that area, I had no cartilage in between my knees. The interior portion of my left knee was bone-on-bone, and that was year four in the NFL. I ended up playing 11 years. The doctors told me at that time I probably wouldn't play longer than another three years. We talk about it lightly and loosely, butcoming back from injury—especially the injury I came back from—is one of the toughest things that you can possibly do in your career. I still have pain from it. I still get swelling in my left knee from it. It still limits me in certain ways. But again, because I focused on strengthening and staying flexible and all these different things—and I wear orthotics as well—it helps with alleviating the pain, being able to walk, and still continuing some sports. Oh, man. It depends. What time of the year? What time of the day? Is it windy? But no, I work a lot on my golf game. I love the game of golf. It's giving me an opportunity to still be an athlete. When you leave professional sports, especially football, you retire young. I retired at 32 years old, and in pretty much every other form of business, that's impossible. Nobody retires that young. Right? You retire young, and you're still very athletic, and you still have this need to compete. Golf has given me that opportunity to still be an athlete, compete, work out. A lot of my workouts are geared towards golf and strengthening my legs and different things like that. My golf game is…I think it’s in a good place. I love to hit the driver. That's my favorite. Putting can always improve, but I feel like my iron play has improved a lot as well over these last years. I'm down to a four handicap. Actually, what's funny is that I didn't play golf when I was in the NFL. I didn't pick the golf clubs up until about year 10. About two years before I retired, I picked it up, fell in love with it, and a lot of my friends and teammates were playing golf. The camaraderie was there. The ability to still compete and talk trash and bet money and all these things were in the sport. That's why I fell in love with it. Yeah. Oh my god, man. My intro to the NFL was very unique because I was drafted to the New Orleans Saints five months afterHurricane Katrina. I got there at a period where there wasn't much there. The city was a ghost town. There were very few restaurants that were open, [but] a lot of fast food restaurants. I hate admitting this, but there was a Sonic very close to our facility. I was eating Sonic here and there. Then I ended up hiring a chef just because I didn't want to get stuck on fast food. New Orleans is known for its food. If you go visit, you know to leave your diet at the door, because all the food there is amazing, lots of flavors, lots of unhealthy ways it's prepared. We love to eat, and it is really good, but unhealthy long term. Obviously, because of everything they had been through—people hadn't come back yet, businesses hadn't come back yet—I actually became really close with my chef. But there were times where I was leaning on some of these fast food restaurants as well. The nutrition when I got into the NFL is nowhere what it is now. Now they have smoothie bars! They have nutritionists in these facilities now. We didn't have a nutritionist. We didn't have no smoothie bars. I think the knowledge of what nutrition athletes need has also improved significantly. Teams, owners, and GMs have started to see the connectivity between performance and the way we're eating. I'm not complaining at all about what I had, but I just went toNew Orleansat a very unique time. It's something that always sticks out in my mind, because I went down there at a time when the city was depleted, and they were looking for hope anywhere. We were able to step in as a team and help uplift those spirits by winning football games. It wasn't the solution to all the tragedy they had been through, but it was just a step in the right direction. I'm happy I went there because when I look back on my career, New Orleans was my favorite stop. One thing I think they need to getrid ofthat’s still out there and is still an issue is field turf. When we look at the studies and the correlation between field turf and ACLs, PCLs, meniscuses, just about all leg injuries, a lot of it is traced back to the surface that you play on. They're playing on one of the most dangerous surfaces. We don't see soccer being played on field turf! In Europe, they would never allow that. Right? For some reason here—especially the NFL, which is the most dangerous sport—you're playing on the most dangerous surface. The reason why it's dangerous is because athletes are now bigger, stronger, faster. It continues to evolve. When you're that strong and that fast, something's going to give. You plant your foot into that turf and what happens is turf will grab. Grass gives. If I plant my foot going full speed on grass, it's going to tear a little bit and give. If I'm that same athlete and I plant my foot on rubber, fake grass, and I plant my cleat full speed, it's going to grab. I'm going to be able to stop a lot harder, but my joints are going to suffer because of that. You see guys not even get touched [get a] torn ACL.Odell Beckham Jr.in the Super Bowl tore his ACL and pretty much ended his career. He hasn't really recovered since, but it's all from turf. Unfortunately, NFL owners still believe that turf is the cheapest, most cost-efficient way in a league that annualizes billions every year. It's not adding up to me. It's a repetitive cycle, and it's going to continue. It's unfortunate. It will continue until the players decide to stand up and say, “Listen, we don't want to play on turf anymore.” The thing is, all players hate it. Never ever again. No sports should ever be played on turf. I'm coaching my son's flag football team. I complain about the turf that we have to play on. My son was going for a touchdown, he got pushed, he landed and banged his head on the ground. Now he's lying on the ground, hurt. If that's grass, he's landing on something much softer. He’s nine years old and I’m mad about this! Imagine grown men who were 200-300 pounds playing this ultra-violent game on the worst turf. Players are scared at the end of the day. Whatever the players want, they can get. They hold the ultimate power, which is to just sit out. Unfortunately, that is the only way they will be able to have leverage in their negotiations with the Players' Association versus the NFL and their collective bargaining agreements. Two things: We don't have guaranteed contracts in the NFL, and we’re put on the worst surface. You're talking about a league where I can sign you for five years, 100 million. Something happens halfway into year one, and I don't like you? I can cut you. That’s a nightmare for most people. I can speak to the hyperbaric chamber, because we had a chiropractor that a lot of the guys used to go to in New Orleans, and they had [one]. I actually bought one as well. It's funny. I bought one and then never used it. It was just a waste of money. But I honestly don't know if it helped me at all or not. I slept in that thing. I would take naps in it at my chiropractor's house. I don't know, man. It’s just based on if you believe in it or not. Supposedly you're breathing the most pure oxygen, the most pure air, and your body's supposed to heal that much faster … meanwhile, I'm in pain every day. Waking up in pain, going to sleep in pain. I don't know if those hyperbaric chambers actually work, but they started showing up probably three years into my career. In college, we never used anything like that. It’s more of a tool to help you heal. It's not necessarily a performance tool to help you play better or run faster. I think to literally notice the effects you'd have to sleep in that thing seven days a week. I think you can definitely train yourself toget faster. Everybody has their limit. What's your potential? When kids ask me how to get faster I tell them to go run track. Track and field, in my opinion, is the way to learn how to run faster. It focuses on your hip flexors, hip flexibility, explosiveness, your running pattern, your running gait, speed, agility, all that. All three of my kids run track, and I've seen them get faster since they started. I didn't start until I got to high school. I wish I had run track when I was younger because I would've been even faster. If you can even imagine that. Right? When I ran track in high school, I started because I wanted to get faster for football, but then I fell in love with the competition side of it. The me versus you. Even the relays—I ran the 4x100 relay, 4x400 relay, and it's just about competition. I've always been drawn more to dual-sport athletes who can do football, basketball, baseball, track, golf, whatever it is. I think those are some of the most successful athletes. That's why all my kids play at least two to three sports. I think it just gives you a different perspective and different understanding. You learn things in these different sports that you can apply into whatever that final sport is that you end up choosing. There's a lot. That's what football is literally built on, guys like that. Even the guys you don’t know are built like action figures. But I'll give you one guy that I played with in Detroit.Calvin Johnson. 6\"6', runs a 4.3, maybe even 4.2 [40-yard dash], can jump as high as LeBron James probably. He had the speed, the height, the hands. He had it all. I'll never forget one time we were in practice—I would always run extra sprints after practice just to be in great condition—and he and I were running sprints together. I'm usually always first, whoever I'm running with. On this particular day, I'm running as hard as I can. It physically looks like I'm running hard. He looks like he's just jogging, because he has that long stride, and he was still beating me! I couldn't believe it. I was like, this dude is arguably one of the greatest athletes to ever grace this field. Tall, long arms and built like a basketball player, but has the speed of a cheetah. You just don't see a lot of guys like that, especially playing receiver. He’s the only receiver that I can remember teams actually double teaming at the line.You can look up that video. Jerry Rice, some of the greatest receivers ever, nobody else got that treatment. [Matthew] Stafford would still throw the ball, and he would still catch it. I still love to run. I still love to sprint. I run on the treadmill. I'll start with some form of—we call themA skips and B skipsin track—but things to open up my hips. Most of my running is on the treadmill just, again, because I have some injuries to my left knee. I like to run at a slight incline, and that helps alleviate some of the pounding, the full force of my body weight on my knee. I run probably about anywhere from 12 to 15 sprints. They're all around one minute long. I'll go up to about 12 miles an hour, which is pretty fast on the treadmill. Then once I go from there, we'll do a round of core sit-ups. I usually will focus on my legs. I try to not lift heavy upper-body anymore because I just don't need it, and I've had some shoulder injuries. I actually have a tear in this shoulder right now. I just don't want to go get surgery, man. It's been lingering since I played, and I don't want to go back under the knife. Maybe at some point I'm going to have to, because it's just going to get to the point where I'm just not going to be able to take it. But it doesn't affect my golf swing right now! I'll do mostly core, lower body. I don't do back squats anymore. I try to take the pressure off my spine and focus more on elongating my spine. I have a herniated disk in my lower back that I just need to be mindful of. I do a lot of golf-specific turns, twists, stretches, swings. Golf is healthy for you, man, because if you treat it the right way and you treat your body the right way, it helps you to lengthen out, stretch your spine, strengthen your lower body, your core. It's been healthy for me because there’s things that I've been needing to work on to keep my body stable. That's what it's about for me now: stability, lower body strength, and strong-ass core. My wife handles all the cooking. She's a beast in the kitchen. She is amazing. I'm not just talking her up because she's my wife. She could write a cookbook. She could be a chef. A lot of the food that she cooks is amazing, amazing stuff. We really rely on my wife. I don't know where we would be in this house without my wife and her cooking. Exactly, probably still eating Sonic. I try to eat as healthy as possible, but here and there, I might throw in my annual In-N-Out Burger. But for the most part, I try to focus on healthy eating, [things like] avocado, fruits, eggs in the morning. I try to stay away from sugar, but it's a little hard just because a lot of things have sugar in them. One of the things that I'm most proud of is that I take vitamins every day.Every day. Multivitamins, vitamin D and vitamin K—those two go together—and other things that my body needs from a supplement standpoint just to keep me healthy and strong. Idrink a lot of water. We literally only have water in my refrigerator. That's my routine. I think the vitamins are ultra important, especially for me as I'm getting older. I want to make sure everything is functioning properly. I do focus on my health a lot. In-N-Out Burger, and probably ice cream. Those are my two weaknesses right now. InReal-Life Diet,athletes, celebrities, and other high performers talk about their diet, exercise routines, and pursuit of wellness. Keep in mind that what works for them might not necessarily be healthy for you.",

    "article_text": "Two-waysneakers collabsare old hat. Butthree-way collabs like the Supreme x Goodenough xNike Air Force 1? They’re a rarer beast. Dropping as part of the New York skate stalwart’s summer 2025 collection, these sneakers might just be one of the most unexpected grails of the year. Supreme x Goodenough x Nike Air Force 1 If Goodenough doesn’t ring a bell, it’s time to brush up on your streetwear history. Founded in 1990 byHiroshi Fujiwara, the godfather of Japanese streetwear, it’s a punk- and hip-hop-influenced imprint that’s known for its graphic tees and workwear-y menswear. After leaving Goodenough in the late ’90s, Fujiwara launched his Fragment Design project in 2003, going on to work on legendary projects with the likes ofAir Jordan,Moncler,Red Wing, and many more. Now, though, the designer’s OG label is making a long-awaited comeback through this new collab with Supreme. Taking on the classic‘Triple White’ Air Force 1, the sneaker mixes it up by adding leopard print Swooshes to the sidewalls.Supreme’s signature box logo lands on the right heel, while Goodenough's lowercase ‘g’ hits the left. Co-branding is printed on the tongue label and insole, and just in case there was any doubt, the semi-translucent outsole spells out “SUPOODENOUGH” underneath. As well as the Forces, the power duo have also worked on a massive range of apparel and accessories. We’re talking MA-1bombers, patchworkjackets,sweaters, button-downs, tees, and all manner of caps and hats. If you took a L on the last Supreme x Goodenough drop back in 2007, this might just be your lucky day. Supreme x Goodenough x Nike Air Force 1 The Supreme x Goodenough x Nike Air Force 1 is set to release exclusively at Supreme’s website and brick-and-mortar stores on June 5. A retail price has yet to be confirmed, but honestly? It’s theresaleprices that you should be worried about. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "The Ethical Assassin: One Man's Quest for the Perfect Way to Kill a Fish",
    "article_text": "The fish thatwould die from a spike through its brain in the shadow of an oil rig, 45 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and would be served, 22 days later, in the Grand Salon of the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Washington, DC, was about two-and-a-half years old when it made the worst dining decision of its short life. A chunk of barracuda, itself pulled from the water only an hour earlier, proved the fatal temptation. The fish was a yellowfin tuna, 75 pounds, 36 inches long, and pure muscle. Andrew Tsui, the man who caught it, has fished all his life and is in fine shape for a 46-year-old. The tuna nearly pulled his arms off. We had set out from Venice, Louisiana, into the waters that will eventually consume it, toward the fields of rigs that are at least partially to blame. Until nine days earlier, the body of water we were in had spent the previous 475 years uncontroversially called the Gulf of Mexico. Now, who knew? As if by common consent, none of the nine people pressed together on the 37-foot boat mentioned it. We had been assembled by Tsui, a DC lawyer who is also a roving evangelist for seafood in general, and the Japanese fish-slaughtering method known as ike jime in particular. Ike jime involves euthanizing, bleeding, and destroying the spinal column of a fish as quickly as possible. All morning we had drifted beneath the immense, eerie rigs, bombing across the water from one to the other. Each was a little different, as though they had been made from kindergartners’ drawings. One looked like it was built atop a canopy of forest, another like it was made out of Lego, another like a giant bouncy castle. A few were unmanned and emitted mournful siren blasts every 30 seconds, to warn away passing ships. On others we could see tiny men in hard hats, hundreds of feet in the air, going up and down stairways and in and out of steel doors. A few leaned on the rails, smoking and watching us bob below. They ignored it when we waved. Andrew Tsui on the Gulf in early February. Our two-man crew called the rigs by nicknames: Moxie, Who Dat, and so on. They were local boys, chosen by Tsui because they were cool with him performing ike jime on board, a very different practice from the traditional American custom of throwing fish on ice and letting them suffocate to death. “Charter captains can be persnickety,” Tsui said. “These can be million-dollar boats, with all kinds of liability issues. So I understand if they don’t want people fucking around with exotic shit. They want you to just whack it, throw it in the box, and move on.” At our first stop we caught the barracuda and a rainbow runner, a sleek little member of the jack family. But yellowfin was our goal; specifically, a small yellowfin. A few weeks earlier, Tsui had been asked by contacts at the Japanese Embassy to bring back something special for the emperor’s birthday celebration, at the end of February. Anything bigger than about 80 pounds—and yellowfin can get as large as 400—would be impossible to transport back to DC intact. It reminded me of Thanksgiving in Louisiana, when home cooks scour supermarket bins for turkeys small enough to deep-fry. Looking out at the vast waves around us, finding the perfect petite tuna seemed just as improbable. Then, beneath the rig called Tinker, Tsui’s line suddenly took off. The rod bent in half. Tsui grunted as he reeled, fighting for each turn, only to lose all his progress each time the tuna decided to run. We all leaned over the rail, staring into the water. “Color!” somebody finally yelled, as a flash of silver appeared, indicating the fight was close to over. The first mate, Kyle, reached for the gaff, a nasty-looking barbed hook on a pole, designed to take fish the final few feet into the boat. “Careful with that,” Tsui said. On a small and chaotic boat, a gaff is always dangerous, but he meant to be extra careful with this fish. Kyle nailed it, catching the tuna just behind the gills and swinging it onto the deck. The prize tuna that was served at the emperor’s birthday at the Japanese Embassy in February. Tsui took a moment to catch his breath and rest his arms. Then he followed the tuna to the back of the boat. The fish was shaped like a torpedo, sheathed in scales that went from cobalt blue along its head to a silver so shiny that it might have been made of aluminum. Painterly swaths of yellow ran along its sides, up the scimitar-shaped fins, and on the triangular spikes that studded its powerful tail. The oversized eye and open mouth gave it an expression of almost comic surprise. It was extraordinarily beautiful. Among the equipment Tsui had brought aboard was an oblong piece of foam, stained with splotches of dried blood. He called this “the futon.” He lay the futon on the deck and the tuna down upon it. With one hand pressing on the body to keep it still, he grasped a seven-inch spike in the other. He took a moment to locate a spot just above and behind the fish’s eye and plunged the spike into its hindbrain. The fish twisted once, its dorsal fin stiffened, and then it was still. Tsui cut deep slits behind each gill and placed it upside down in a bucket, allowing the residual ghost of the fish’s blood pressure to do much of the work of exsanguinating the body. Then he rummaged through a kit and selected a length of spooled wire; it had a light-blue float on one end, shaped like a Dungeons & Dragons die. There are two ways to perform shinkei jime, the step of ike jime that involves threading a wire into the neural canal in order to cut off further activity of the nervous system: You can go through the head or you can go through the tail. Tsui opted for the latter, making a deep cut beneath the tuna’s caudal fin. The revealed cross section resembled a spider, with the thin bands of the fish’s ribs forming delicate legs. At the center of the spider’s head, Tsui located a tiny hole into which he teased the wire, pushing it the length of the fish’s spine. Though brain dead, its body involuntarily twitched and flapped as Tsui sawed the wire back and forth. “The shimmy-shimmy shake,” one of the fishermen said. “The pickle tickle,” said another. Tsui kneeled at the side of the futon, cradling the fish almost tenderly until it stopped moving. Among other things, ike jime is about the management of energy. In literal terms, this includes rapidly shedding body heat, as the fish is ushered into death, but it inescapably echoes the way we talk about such forces asqi, orsoul.By the time Tsui slipped the tuna into the watery embrace of an ice slurry, perhaps 15 minutes had passed since the moment it left the water. We caught three more tuna that day, each dispatched in the same way. Back in Venice, Tsui found a Styrofoam container that miraculously fit the one he planned on delivering to Washington. He cut a notch in its tail, for ID purposes, and packed it in ice. He and some friends were staying in a house that loomed on stilts, 60 feet above the dock. The walls were covered with fish trophies, fish posters, and fish homilies. The couches were deep, leather, and reclining. Our party was possessed with the tired but giddy bonhomie that follows a day at sea; even if things have been perfectly calm, there’s an unspoken sense that you have together survived some elemental vulnerability. We drank tumblers filled to the top with Maker’s Mark and pebble ice. Tsui stood in the kitchen working on dinner, using the rest of the day’s catch. He travels with a set of Japanese knives and a kit of collapsible toiletry bottles filled with culinary staples: mirin, soy sauce, yuzu, sugar, extra-virgin olive oil, et cetera. From the rainbow runner he cut silky ribbons of sashimi. He reduced one of the other yellowfin to the perfect geometric rectangles of its dark pink loins, which he then cut into cubes for a bowl of poke. The photographer we were with reached over with chopsticks to grab a piece. “So, the idea is that the fish tastes better because of how it died?” she asked, closing her eyes with pleasure as she chewed. “Was killed,” Tsui interrupted. “I’m sorry?” “This fish didn’t die,” he said. “This fish was killed.” The answer tothe photographer’s first question was,Yes—the tuna tasted better. And the distinction that Tsui insisted on goes to the heart of his mission. In an immediate sense, that is to promote ike jime, which has been widely used for centuries in Japan, and for decades in countries that do meaningful business with Japan’s high-end seafood market. The practice has a remarkable effect on the quality of the meat, its shelf life, and, consequently, on its potential applications. The moment our tuna left the water, it experienced gravity for the first time. It saw its first unfiltered sunlight. The fiberglass deck of the boat may have been the first hard surface with which its body had ever made contact. In short, it had found itself in an environment so alien that it might as well have been shot into space. And, of course, it had been hooked through the mouth, endured a long battle, and was quickly running out of oxygen. By killing the fish quickly and then shutting down its nervous system, Tsui had arrested the effects of this massive stress, leaving the fish’s flesh free of blood, adrenaline, and other substances associated with a panicking animal. At the same time, he had drastically slowed the depletion of the energy molecules known as ATP and the rise in lactic acid that mark the onset of rigor mortis. “People think ike jime is some kind of Oriental magic trick,” Tsui says. In fact, its effects are quite quantifiable. Ike jime, says John Stieglitz, a research associate professor and the director of Sustainable Seafood Research and Development at the University of Miami, “results in distinct and significant biological differences compared to conventional harvesting methods.” These differences are quantifiable by such metrics as muscle pH, bacterial load, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (which gauges living or dead tissue’s electrical conductivity). All of these, plus others like shear force (tenderness) and K-factor (potassium content), have been commonly accepted as measures of meat quality for years but have rarely been applied to fish. Stieglitz and his team recently completed a study that measured the shelf life of yellowtail snapper killed conventionally versus via ike jime. The results are pending review and publication, but he says that ike jime extended the shelf life of the fish by as much as a week. For a fishing industry in deep crisis, the economic implications of that week—where the fish could be transported to and what it could be used for when it gets there—are potentially enormous. Likewise for restaurants working with razor-thin margins when it comes to waste. As the founder and head of the Ike Jime Federation, Tsui has been a Johnny Appleseed of brain spikes, traveling the country and preaching the gospel to fishermen, chefs, scientists, policymakers, journalists, and anybody else who will listen. But Tsui’s larger project is to address the entirety of Americans’ relationship to seafood, which can be generously summarized as neurotic. “We tend to eat fish very defensively,” Tsui says. “We’ve had generations of people who were traumatized by one bad experience with seafood and basically said, ‘Yeah, I don’t eat fish. I don’t like fish.’ What the fuck does that even mean?” Ask a food poisoning victim what the culprit was, and 9 times out of 10 they will say the fish, even if facts dictate that it’s just as likely to be the salad. At the heart of the problem, Tsui believes, is a deeper disconnect with the underwater world. The average toddler knows the names, behaviors, and uses of dozens of land animals. Meanwhile, fish and their world remain alien, uncanny, and homogeneous. “Everything in the ocean is either ‘a shark’ or ‘fish,’ ” he says. “We’re teaching our kids lions and giraffes and zebras before they learn anything about the sunfish in their backyards. You have this missing line of sight into the underwater world, and I would argue there are consequences for that.” It doesn’t take a lot to see what these might be. Americans are eating more seafood than they ever have, but despite the almost endless resources of three coasts, 80 percent of it is imported from overseas. What we do use at home is a tiny fraction of the available bounty. The Gulf is one of the most diverse fish habitats in the world and yet we largely use it for only a handful of fish species, such as red snapper, mahi mahi, flounder, tuna. These satisfy our narrow demand that fish perform as a meat stand-in, i.e., a big piece of protein on a plate; Tsui calls it the “prison of fillets.” Nor do we seem aware of the value of our seafood inheritance to others. The Gulf is home to over a dozen species of wild grouper, which—bluefin tuna’s PR notwithstanding—is among the most prized fish for millions across Asia. Yet few if any Gulf fishermen seem to be aware of that market’s existence and lack the infrastructure to supply it if they are. Meanwhile, farmed fish presents an entirely different set of environmental, labor, and health issues. To try to eat seafood can feel like a perfectly distilled version of the modern dilemma of how exactly one is supposed tobe—that is, how a thinking and feeling person might engage with the world while doing as little harm as possible but remaining attuned to such virtues as pleasure. If there’s one object reserved for Tsui’s strongest derision, it’s the tyranny of “fresh,” which, despite a recent fad for “dry-aged” fish, remains the seafood industry’s greatest fetish.Freshis to seafood whatsmoothis to whiskey—subjective, capricious, and ultimately a red herring. After all, we understand that time, if anything, improves many foods: cheese, pickled vegetables, beef, wine. “There are all these very arbitrary cultural designations,” he says. “You smell a piece of cheese and you think, Oh, that’sripe.I’m going to bite it. You get near some oysters that smell a little fucked up and you think, My God, they’re going to kill somebody. Whether it’s true or not doesn’t matter. What matters is cultural memory, imprinting, trauma, mythology.” Tsui grows impatient with those who complain that ike jime matters only to the high-end sushi bars and other rarefied corners of the culinary world. Instead, he says, ike jime should be seen as a “conceptual prism” through which we can view the entire seafood ecosystem: “What if I told you that quality is not the result ofrecency of deathbut rather ofmanner of death?” I first metTsui at a mutual friend’s house in New Orleans. He had just come from a trip to the Gulf where he’d been slow pitch jigging—a highly technical method of fishing that is currently in vogue. Slow pitch involves very light rods and lead lures optimized for specific depths rather than species, the result being that you never know quite what will emerge when you reel them in. That night, an enormous scamp grouper lolled in a coffin-size cooler, its eyes bulging from the pressure change on its journey from the deep. Tsui held court in the kitchen, barefoot, preparing other specimens from up and down the water column: lane snapper, American red snapper, blackfin tuna, and a spinycheek scorpion fish that he said he had never seen before but was 90 percent sure he could turn into sashimi without allowing the venom in its spikes to poison everybody present. (Fifty percent of the group declined those odds.) With thick hair and a square jaw, Tsui resembles an Asian Josh Brolin. In his day job, he is a partner in a major DC law firm, specializing in health care litigation. Before that, he spent over a decade as a lawyer for the Department of Health and Human Services, during which time he lost only two of the cases he took on. He lives in suburban Maryland with his wife and three young children. In addition to fishing, he has an eccentric assortment of obsessions: tennis, piano, raising rare goldfish, home-brewing the fermented Korean drink makgeolli. DC, somebody who lived there once told me, is full of this type: high-achieving strivers, without a bohemian bone in their bodies, who are nevertheless secret renegades and stone-cold weirdos. He grew up in North Carolina, a fisherman’s paradise, from the ocean on one end to mountain streams on the other, and innumerable ponds, lakes, and rivers in between. That’s where he got his first taste of fishing, puttering around University Lake, in Chapel Hill, with his father and his brother on Sunday mornings. Tsui’s parents were both UNC professors: He, a nuclear physicist from Hong Kong; she, a Chinese-American demographer raised in Hawaii. Tsui frequently compares fishing to a drug and he calls himself a junkie, neither in a way that suggests he’s being in any way glib. He remembers his first major dopamine hit, a largemouth bass he had no business catching, at about age five. “That fucked me up. From there it was all aboutHow do I catch that fish again?” He also remembers the first time he unintentionally caused a fish’s death. That was a sunnie that swallowed the hook and was permanently damaged in the process of extraction. That fucked him up too: “You throw that fish back in the water and watch it bob to the top, and it’s just a gut punch,” he says. For an Asian kid growing up in the South, fishing was a method of assimilation, like sports or church. Still, he found himself on the other side of a divide with his neighbors. “There’s a real catch-and-release culture in that community. It was almost taboo to bring fish home,” he says. Tsui’s family, on the other hand, ate what they caught whenever possible, a kind of return-on-investment for the time and energy spent on the lake. “We were not going fishing just for fun,” he says. “So, if the outcome of the fishing trip was a live animal, it was very hard for me to let that animal back in the water.” As an undergrad at Wesleyan University, Tsui founded a student fly-fishing club, not the most popular hobby among his progressive classmates. It forced him for the first time to think philosophically about the thing he loved. “I was challenged all the time: ‘Fucking redneck,’ or ‘You’re torturing fish.’ I needed some rejoinder to what felt like a character attack.” After graduation he moved to Hawaii, to live with his maternal grandmother and teach test-prep courses. For beer money he landed work on a commercial tuna boat. The captain turned out to be an ex-Marine named Lionel who had unusual methods. Whenever the crew caught a tuna, they were instructed to kill it immediately, using a wooden bat, bleed it out, and then perform shinkei jime with a monofilament wire. Lionel told them it was for the Japanese buyers at the tuna auction in Honolulu, who would pay more for fish treated this way. But there was more: He used the Hawaiian wordpono,which means a feeling of balance, harmony, and righteousness. “He said something to the effect of ‘If you don’t kill the fish, you can’t feel pono,’ ”Tsui says. When Lionel would give him fish to bring home, he could see the difference. The flesh was firmer when he cut it. There was no ‘fishy’ smell. It kept longer. He felt good eating it raw. For Tsui, it was a double revelation: Working with huge, warm-bodied fish, he was forced to consider for the first time what it meant to hunt and kill another living being. At the same time, he could see the intimate connection between how he chose to treat that animal and its value. “Before that, the value of fish for me was measured in vanity:Hold the fish out to the camera. Push it toward the camera so it looks bigger,” he says. “My eureka moment was when it came to me that the value of the fish is actually not about vanity, it’s measured indollars.It opened my eyes to the concept that some consideration for the welfare of the animal was a precondition of quality.” By the time Tsui headed back to the mainland, to study law at UNC, he had made an internal decision. No longer was he somebody who fished just for fun or for sport. “I said to myself: I am ameatfisherman.” Having spent time on a boat with Tsui, I can testify that he still speaks fluent sport fisherman; his native language may be Bro. But he is an expert code-switcher. When he is in persuasive mode, he speaks in a lawyer’s cadence—patient, careful, and in full sentences. He also has a poetic streak. To hear him expound on, say, the life cycle of Chesapeake Bay rockfish (known elsewhere as striped bass) is to simultaneously want to eat, catch, and hug that fish: how in summer they stress out in the bay’s warm, oxygen-deprived shallows, growing greenish and wan, but, come autumn, they gorge on peanut bunker until they have the shoulders of high school wrestlers. (“Not college wrestlers; those would be in the open water,” Tsui says.) By November, as he tells it, there is no better distilled expression of the Mid-Atlantic Seaboard. And yet, because it has only a local market and limited ability to travel, November rockfish doesn’t command a high price. “Let’s say a very enterprising chef in Chicago wants to tell the story for the first time of what American seafood is or could be. The opportunity to express fully a seasonal pattern of Maryland rockfish is not available to them, because it can’t get there. Which is strange because somehow, magically, fish from the market in Tokyo get there every day,” Tsui says. “What ike jime allows you do is to say,Fuck local.” Perhaps you’ve noticed the preponderance of ¯Ora King and Faroe Islands salmon on menus in recent years—the first a trademarked brand name for chinook salmon farmed in New Zealand, the second the same Atlantic salmon you find in your local Walmart but farmed on an archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic. They have taken over the world in part because fish farmers in those countries employ “stunner-bleeders” to quickly kill and bleed each fish—in other words, a crude version of automated ike jime. Meanwhile, the start-up company Shinkei Systems is working on refining that process with a machine that uses computer vision (to his credit, its 26-year-old founder, Saif Khawaja, does not use the termAI) to more precisely locate the hindbrain on fish of varying sizes and species. The company has raised some $8 million. Seafood globalism bears its own set of ethical and environmental concerns, but ike jime can benefit local markets too. When chef Junya Yamasaki arrived in Los Angeles to open his restaurant Yess, he was shocked by the inability to source California seafood and by the wretched quality of what little he could get. Before opening he recruited and trained a small fleet of commercial fishermen who now sell him and others their ike jime killed catch for three times the price of other fish. The Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act, recently passed in Tsui’s home state of Maryland, allows certified sport fishermen who perform ike jime to sell directly to restaurants—perhaps incentivizing a whole generation of “meat fishermen.” All of this is part of the story Tsui tells, synthesizing nature, commerce, and policy. His lyricism extends to such thoroughly unsexy topics as the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, the Supreme Court’s decision striking down the longstanding Chevron doctrine, public comment periods, and all the myriad other regulatory mechanics that, he persuasively argues, underpin the entirety of America as we have known it—a kind of qi of the body politic. Regulations, as Tsui describes them, are every bit as much an artistic expression of a society’s values, preoccupations, and prejudices as its poetry. Indeed, you couldn’t ask for a more pithy summation of our problems with seafood than the fact that, while it is monitored by the government forsafety,there is no standardized legal designation for itsquality.There is no seafood equivalent, say, for the USDA’s grading of beef into Prime, Choice, Select, and so on. Nor, outside of certain laboratory contexts, are there rules governing the treatment of fish, as there are for land animals. By certain legal standards, fish are not, in fact, defined asanimalsat all. In the Grand Salonof the Japanese ambassador’s residence, in northwest DC, our tuna sat on a long banquet table, one eye staring blankly in the direction of a Ryūshi Kawabata painting of a woman carrying firewood, titledSpring in the Ancient Capital Kyoto (No. 1).The fish had been curved into a C, as though in mid-fight. Its head and tail, with the telltale notch, were intact; the body between them had been transformed into gleaming pink stacks of sashimi. It had been a turbulent week inthisancient capital, as Elon Musk’s DOGE had swept through various agencies. “This town is on fire,” Tsui told me as we lined up to pass through security. You would not know it from the crowd gathered for the annual celebration of the emperor’s birthday, one of diplomatic Washington’s most coveted invitations. Elaine Chao, the former secretary of labor and Mitch McConnell’s wife, chatted with the ambassador. There were blue-suited EU economist types; cadaverous spooks in bow ties; a selection of medal- and ribbon-wearing military from at least four continents, including one Estonian general who stalked through the room with wild eyes and a braided white beard. I spared a thought for our fish, ending up in this of all possible worlds. Tsui started working informally with the Japanese Embassy after bringing a high-level staffer a grouper several years ago. A few days later, a dinner invite arrived. “You don’t understand what you have here,” the official told him, over five different grouper preparations. “This is fish diplomacy.” We waited in line to try the tuna. It had been 22 days since our foray to the oil rigs, just enough to give it a rich mineral tang. In his welcome speech, the ambassador drew attention to two items among the lavish spread: Wagyu beef and ike jime tuna. “I have to admit, that kind of turned me on,” Tsui whispered. After the reception, we took a car downtown to the Old Ebbitt Grill, the clubby institution located across the street from the White House. The place was packed, the volume loud, the mood rowdy, ruddy, and triumphant. Here, within a short drive of the Chesapeake Bay, home to more than 500 species of fish and shellfish, cradle of 80 percent of the striped bass in the Atlantic Ocean, the only fish on the menu were farmed trout and Faroe Islands salmon. If nothing else, it was a profoundly boring selection. Over the weeks I’d spent talking to Tsui, something had been conspicuously missing. Ike jime is self-evidently a more humane method of killing than suffocation; anybody who has heard the sickening thunk of a fish slowly expiring out of sight in a cooler knows this intuitively. Of all Tsui’s arguments, though, this is one he rarely makes, because the people that he most needs to convince of ike jime’s virtues—what he calls “the hook-and-bullet community”—are not especially receptive to it. Fish welfare is neither quantifiable nor a winning argument. “Value-added” might be. Still, at the heart of ike jime lies death. I asked Tsui how many fish he thought he had killed in his life. He looked momentarily stricken and then mouthed, silently:A lot. He was quiet for a few moments. “I don’t know if I still feel pono when I’m killing a fish,” he said, finally. “There’s something very humiliating about not only killing a fish but exercising that much dominion over it.” Humiliating? “The power I have…it can be soprofane.The ability to exercise so much control over life. To effectively hack a nervous system? It’s obscene,” he said. “Does it just go unchecked? Am I not accountable to anything? Did I need to do it? Was Istarvingon that boat? I was actually quite overweight. So, again, it’s humiliating.” For a moment I entertain the notion that the entire enterprise has been an act of penance for five-year-old Andrew Tsui watching a sunnie, pulled inside out by his hook, bobbing sadly away on University Lake—an elaborate post hoc attempt to reconcile his guilt with the enduring monkey on his back. “This is arguably psychotic and self-aggrandizing, but I feel like the way I kill things is justified because I’m trying to influence the next generation—if I can just give them enough context and enough training,” he said. “I do feel strongly that when you extract a living thing out of the water, you have choices. The first fork in the road is: Do you want to harvest, or do you want to let it go and move on with your day? That first fork in the road gives you an off-ramp, spiritually or morally. If you say,I will keep this fish,you lose that off-ramp. But you can actually create anewoff-ramp by saying,I will try my best to minimize unnecessary stress. I can’t promise there will be no stress. But I will do my damndest.And the really exciting aspect of ike jime is that if you elect for that off-ramp and actively kill—if you exercise a little consideration and energy and thought and care—you create a symmetry in the product. You have actually created a superior product.” He gave a small laugh and asked that I stipulate for the record that he was now a little tipsy. He kept coming back to the legal doctrine of mens rea, he said—the “guilty mind” or evil intention that determines criminal liability. “But that’s like the fox guarding the henhouse,” he said. “It’s extremely subjective. Does the fish think I’ve got mens rea? I think we know the answer to that question.” The waitress came and we ordered hamburgers. Brett Martinis a GQ correspondent.

    "title": "How Haim Quit Caring About All That",
    "article_text": "Walking around California’sSan Fernando Valley with the Haim sisters is like touring Compton withKendrick Lamar, or New Jersey withBruce Springsteen. Danielle, Este, and Alana Haim arethemusicians from “the Valley,” and its yellow-hued streets have been the backdrop of their work for their whole career. (“They’re the San Fernando Valley’s house band,” says the director Paul Thomas Anderson, one of their closest collaborators and a fellow Valley native.) So, they’re kinda big dogs around here. Case in point: mooching around a vintage store that Este used to work at called Wasteland, they run into someone they know. “I’m seeing a bunch of stuff online,” their friend says, referring to the barrage of new-album promo flowing out of their social feeds lately, “and I’m like… the girls are back!” In the Valley with Haim, you’re only ever a brisk walk from a core memory. On this overcast day in March, as we stand outside a kitschy bowling alley where they used to go to birthday parties as kids, Alana gestures both ways down Ventura Boulevard, the “main artery” of the area, as she calls it. There’s the dry cleaners where Anderson shot their new album cover. It’s not too far from their mom’s old office. Oh, and a little further there used to be a diner they would go to after some of their first ever gigs. (It’s now a Sephora. “I don’t like to talk about it,” says Alana of this particular act of gentrification). “Paul is that way,” she says, talking, of course, about the aforementionedPTA, who grew up in the Valley and has spent large swathes of his life in cinema depicting its dusty charm. This is exactly the kind of thing you’d expect Alana Haim to say—she’s made two movies with him in the last four years, on top of everything else—but it feels no less electric to casually name-drop one of the greatest directors of all time, who also happens to be a close personal friend. The Valley, man. From left. On Este: Overalls by Courrèges. On Alana: Coat by Mimchik. On Danielle: Top by DKNY. In the Valley with Haim, nothing can throw you off your— Suddenly, a car pulls out in front of the sisters, who are walking in a line like they do in all their music videos (as Alana had told me earlier, “We’rereallyfucking good at walking”). “Sorry, we’re walking, sorry!” she says now to the driver, aware that she was a whisker away from making the news: “I get killed in the Valley… What a way to go!” We’re on course for the alley where they shot part of the “Summer Girl” video—you know, the one where they gradually shed layers and layers of clothes. “The last shot of the video is us walking right here,” Alana says, stopping outside a Barnes & Noble that sits under a retro cinema marquee. “Haim lore!” Haim is showing me around the Valley not just because they love it—though they doloveit—but because the nostalgia we’re tapping into by roaming these streets inspired parts of their upcoming fourth album,I Quit. For example, the Valley is responsible for this spit-take of a lyric, on a very autobiographical song about their high-school days called “Take Me Back:” “Molly took a shit in the back of the truck, didn’t even notice, she was too coked up.” “That really happened,” Este says. (They did, however, change the name to protect the privacy of this former schoolmate of theirs.) Written and recorded over the last three years,I Quitwas born out of a newfound self-assuredness that set in around the 10th anniversary of their 2013 debutDays Are Gone. “I feel like sometimes you cringe at [old] songs, but with that album I still hold it and I’m so proud of it,” says Alana. “I could look back at every single one of our albums and go, Fuck, so many people were like ‘Don’t do that’, ‘Don’t do that’, and we always stuck to our guns,” Alana says. “Now we’re just like, ‘Fuck off. If you’re not gonna believe in us, we can believe in ourselves. Fuck off!’” Over the course of a day together, it becomes clear that there are a handful of targets for thatfuck off: the rock music old guard that has patronized them for much of their career, the misogynists that question their musical abilities, and, yes, their exes (more on that later). No, it’s not a coincidence that it’s mostly men. But it’s not as angsty as that sounds—I Quitis about a sense of release, or an “exhale,” as Danielle refers to it. It’s the post-quitting high, rather than relitigating the shit that led to the quitting. The greatest indicator of this feeling is a sample of George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90” on the first track “Gone,” which is just about peak Haim—joyous, knowingly corny, weirdly moving all in one. “We never wanted [the title] to be a negative,” Alana says. “When we say ‘I quit’, it’s like, ‘I quit the things that don’t serve me.’ And it’s really amazing, ’cause quitting is a new beginning.” “The exit is also the entrance,” Este says. “I think now, after [making music] for almost 20 years,” says Danielle, “it finally feels like we can be like, ‘You know what, I don’t give a fuck what that person said about us…’” Este nods. “I’m done giving a fuck.” From left.

Skirt by Co. We meet forbreakfast in the kind of Italian restaurant you can imagineTony Sopranodestroying some ziti at, which Alana (33, youngest Haim, guitar, keys and backing vocals) attends so frequently that, when asked what’s good, she basically recites the entire menu. On the journey here, I listened toI Quitin the way God and the band likely intended: riding up Santa Monica Boulevard in an Uber with the windows down, the tang ofLAexhaust fumes filtering into my lungs. In the weeks leading up to our meeting, a question had been haunting me: are Haim the most underestimated rock band in the world? It sounds kind of absurd considering the success they’ve had, but then you sit with their discography: a debut that arrived eerily perfect—maybetoopolished?—complete with five singles that each sounded like number-one records plucked from the 1970s. And four years later their second album,Something to Tell You, quietly built upon that sound, adding in layers of complexity… And then! In 2020, their masterpieceWomen in Music, Pt III, an album that stripped any remaining veneer from their production and their lyricism, revealing their raw core—songs about depression and grief and dealing with life-threatening illnesses, all the while maintaining their essential lightness. Throughout all of this, they’ve remained one of the most exhilarating live acts around. Don’t just take it from me, take it from actual Stevie Nicks: “It starts with Danielle’s voice—it is just stunning,” Nicks tells me. “She’s the first part of the puzzle, but then the percussion that Este and Alana wrap around her turn all of their songs into percussive masterpieces. [They are] something that I have never heard before. But coming from Mick Fleetwood’s great love of their kind of percussion, for me in a way, it’s like coming home. They could certainly all have been in Fleetwood Mac.” (Nicks adds that she’s working on a song with Haim, and that “some day, when you tumble into this song, you will understand everything I have just told you.”) In 2025, when a music festival grasps for a rock headliner that isn’t largely made up of octogenarians, the world offersGreen Daywith a shrug. No one seems to be able to agree on what mainstream rock is any more, which has led to the misappropriation of some great acts—people wantFontaines DCto sand down their punky edges! They wantThe 1975to stop singing about incels and wanking and start singing about something, I don’t know, normal! In Haim’s case, most people seem to want to shove them into the box labeled “pop”—it has been happening their whole career. “If we use one synth or one poppy thing they’re like, ‘They’re a pop band,’” Alana says. “And we’re like, pop isn’t a bad fucking word. Rock isn’t a bad word either.” What seems clear from their new album, however, is that they’re choosing to shake all of that stuff off and move on with their lives. It’s a great album that features more big swings than the kaleidoscopicWomen in Music, Pt III. There are tinges of country rock (on “Blood on the Street”) and dance pop (on “Spinning”, the first Haim songAlanahas been the sole lead on, and Este’s “Cry”). Haim have defied genre before, but onI Quit, they sound even less encumbered by their audience’s expectations. “With this album especially there was a lot of experimentation,” Alana says. “And it felt like we had the stage to actually experiment without feeling pressure about it.” The album came after a period of change for the three band members. Having returned from a euphoric post-pandemic tour, they found themselves all single again at the same time, with Danielle (36, middle Haim, lead vocals, drums, guitar) having split up with the band’s longtime co-producer Ariel Rechtshaid in early 2022 after nine years together. (I Quitis their first album without Rechtshaid, who does however have a co-writing credit on “Relationships,” which the band first started working on in 2017.) “All of our songs are about our collective trauma and going through it,” Alana says. “A lot of our last album was us grappling with going to therapy for the first time and these emotions that had been bottled up for so many years, and I think with this album, we’ve done the work on ourselves, and now it’s time to party.” It’s this stage of their lives that Danielle sings about on “Relationships”, the summery, post-break-up catharsis anthem—time in which they were drifting in and out of flings, though Este (39, eldest Haim, bass guitar, backing vocals) would meet her now-fiancé after not too long. “I’ve been single for the last three years,” Danielle says. “It’s been so fun.” And it does sound fun: after the break-up, Danielle moved into Alana’s house. To give you an insight into the vibe: “I have a beer fridge,” Alana says. “I’m like a frat boy trapped in a girl’s body.” During this time, she says, “My house turned into fuckin’Animal House. Growing up, we were not the cool house. We didn’t have good snacks. My therapist calls it ‘a corrective experience’. So it was like, at my house, it’s gonna beragers…” The weekly house parties were all well and good—until, one weekend, Danielle was ill. “Alana was like, ‘I think I’m gonna have a few people over,’” says Danielle. “I was like, ‘Just shut your room,’” says Alana. “Literally, like smelling the cigarettes…” says Danielle. “Danielle was like, ‘Can you guys stop smoking inside?’” Alana says. “I put an air purifier in her room. I think we partied ’til five in the morning.” “And I was like, ‘What the fuck…’” Danielle says. “Danielle moved out,” says Alana. And that was pretty much the end of that. From left.

Haim lore: itwas the Valley that forged Haim’s bond with Paul Thomas Anderson. PTA has lived in the Valley all his life – his last film,Licorice Pizza, was named after a record shop five minutes further down the road from the bowling alley we’ll head to later, and starred Alana Haim in her first role. “PTA is basically our fourth member,” Alana says. Since 2017, Anderson has made 10 (ten!) music videos with the band, most of which were shot “guerrilla-style” in or around Ventura Boulevard. When it came time to figure out the tracklist forI Quit, they tapped him up for that, too. “He was basically our A&R – ‘Don’t put this song on, put this song track two, put this song track five,’” Alana says. “We trust his taste so much.” They also asked if he’d want to shoot the music videos. There was just one small problem. “He was like, ‘You guys, I have a job!’” Alana says. “‘I’m a director, and I have my own movie. I can’t just drop everything for you.’” (Anderson is currently in post-production onOne Battle After Another, in which Alana once again features.) Nonetheless, PTA found the time to conceptualize and photograph the album cover, which was shot in a dry cleaner’s just a few minutes down the road from where the Haims grew up. “He always finds inspiration in just walking around,” says Alana. “There’s always time [to collaborate with Haim],” Anderson says over email, when asked how being the “fourth Haim” fits in around his actual job. “Mostly it just seems to work until it’s clear we all need to be in the same space together and then someone calls ‘roommate meeting’ and we get together and figure it out. We seem to be in a nice natural cycle of collaboration. It’s not going anywhere, if that makes sense. We’re stuck together.” Alana’s starring role inLicorice Pizzafelt, from an outside perspective, as though it could have been a fracturing point for the band. In classic Haim fashion, they poked fun at the tension in a TikTok during the making ofI Quit, Danielle and Este dragging Alana through a doorway kicking and screaming. The caption reads: “when your sisters are making you get back in the studio but you were born to be anOscaraward winning actress.” But even though it kicked off a healthy side hustle for Alana—she’s shot a couple of indies withRobert Pattinson,Zendaya, andJosh O’Connor—nothing much changed, and acting work has chugged alongside the album creation process. “It’s funny,” she says, “you go through your whole life and you think you’re gonna do one thing, and then you take a left turn and you learn new things. It opens up a new chapter.” Her sisters have other plates spinning, too: Este has been working in film and TV, co-composing the score for the Glen Powell x Sydney Sweeney romcomAnyone But Youand Margaret Qualley’sMaid, and managed to swing two months in Sicily to help with on-camera music scenes inThe White Lotusseason two. “I got to live at the hotel,” Este says, relishing it. Danielle has dabbled in collaborating with other artists, most recently featuring on a beautiful track on Bon Iver’s latest albumSable, Fable. That link-up then led to Justin Vernon writing onI Quit’s “Everybody’s Trying to Figure Me Out”. “He’s so talented,” Danielle says. “A super-genius.” “We all kind of let each other do whatever we want,” is how Alana puts it. Haim is so good at TikTok that they actually have their label asking them to help with social media strategies for other artists. “We’ll get calls being like, ‘We showed your TikTok in the Monday meeting,’” Alana says, “‘because we told all of our people that are helping A&R other bands how to TikTok.’ And I’m like, ‘Don’t…’” “Let people live!” says Este. “I wish the label would fucking do anything,” says Alana. “Like, marketing-wise. No shade to our label. I don’t wanna shade anybody. And then they ask us howwedid it. And I’m like, I don’t fucking know.” Does your label talk to you about algorithms? “I don’t care,” says Este. “I wish people would tell us what to do to get on...” Danielle trails off. “In our experience, no one can tell us how to do anything.” On social media, Haim is a record label’s dream—naturally funny, authentically themselves. “We’ve been performing as a trio and doing shows in our back yard since we were kids,” says Este. “Este would do physical comedy to make me laugh as a baby,” Alana explains. “She would, like, trip and fall and I would laugh, and that was just our whole lives. Being on TikTok is just an extension of that. It comes naturally. And like, why not?” During their childhood they were obsessed withSaturday Night Live, and looked up to cast members like Cheri Oteri, Molly Shannon and Maya Rudolph. “We look at every TikTok as anSNLsketch—how do you make people laugh in 30 seconds?” Alana says. That they’re unafraid to be goofy is a key part of the band’s charm. We talk about a viral clip of them performing the dance from their “I Know Alone” video live on stage. It’s an endearingly unserious—but not simple—dance, with lots of arm-swinging and knee-wiggling. Alana believes that some people miss that they’re taking the piss more often than not. “That’s where it gets lost in the sauce with people,” she says. “Even though we’re a rock band, we love movement,” says Danielle. “Prince danced,” says Este. “I mean, Talking Heads—movement,” says Alana. I sense this is a conversation they’ve had before, or at least it’s something that has bothered them before now. “It’s such an important part for us,” Danielle says, “I don’t know if the rock community…” “Takes that as a weakness,” Alana says. “I don’t know why.” The rock community has loomed as a spectre of disapproval throughout the past decade-and-change of their career. The beef has taken different shapes and sizes—one day it’s Portishead’s Geoff Barrow talking shit about them on Twitter (he only stopped after a 21-year-old Alana, who calls herself “the bulldog” of the family, confronted him about it at a music festival). The next it’s commenters under their live performance videos—“It’s always a guy,” Este says—who say that they’re not playing live because their guitars are not plugged in. “It’s like, my dog, we’re playing withwireless,” says Danielle. “Are you a fucking idiot?” These are the men—and yes, it is largely men—to whom they’re sayingfuck off, we don’t need your approvalonI Quit. And another thing… Did you know that Haim have never had commercial radio success in the United States? It’s a matter that understandably confounds them to this day. “We’re so lucky that we have incredible fans that have always supported us—like, we’ve never needed radio,” says Alana. “Alternative fucking rock fucking radio… You can tell how much I fucking love them.” “For some reason, people that need to put people in boxes don’t get us,” says Danielle. “It goes back to what we said,” says Alana. “We love to dance and we love to make people laugh, and for some reason that’s a no-go.” “I think it’s all quite antiquated,” says Este. “The whole setup is... who gives a shit about that? It’s really old school. We quit caring about that shit.” From left. On Danielle: Jacket by Isabel Marant. Bra by Louis Vuitton. Briefs by Araks. On Alana: Jacket and shoes by Louis Vuitton. Skirt by Dolce & Gabbana. On Este: Jacket by Ludovic de Saint Sernin. Skirt by Louis Vuitton. “Oh– !” “–Oh!” “–Aaaawww.” This is the sound of Danielle, Alana and Este Haim watching me bowl—hopeful encouragement followed by disappointment as the ball veers into the gutter. We’re in Pinz, a bowling alley that Alana still comes to often. Above the lanes is a photoshopped background of LA landmarks: Dodger Stadium, the Hollywood Bowl. There is a black and white photo of a kangaroo holding a bowling ball (his form isn’t great) by the toilets, which are labelled “Menz” and “Womenz”. “I don’t wanna say I’m good,” Danielle says as she picks out her ball. “I think I’m OK.” The pins clatter as she narrowly misses out on a strike. We clink our bottles and get talking about the dating nightmares that Haim have been sharing on TikTok in the weeks around the release of “Relationships”, like the time Alana flew from LA to London to meet a guy for New Year’s Eve, only for him to high-five her at midnight. As it turns out, the reality was way worse than how she originally described it. “I was 20, and I was so in love with this guy in a band,” Alana says. “Everyone thinks it’s about another guy and it’s not him, that theory is wrong.” She believed that they had been seeing each other exclusively for a year. Her sisters told her not to, but she flew out the week before New Year’s anyway to be with him. “And then he ghosted me the whole week,” she says.“And then I found out he was cheating on me with his ex… I was devastated. Devastated!” Este, too, has left some horror stories on the cutting-room floor. “I had a guy break up with me because I said that there was a possibility that our kid would have diabetes,” she tells me. (Este herself has Type 1). “He was like, ‘Then why are we here?’ And I was like, ‘What?!’” Danielle had shared on TikTok that, at 19, a music bro ex had discouraged her from making the kind of music that got Haim signed because he “didn’t get” it. She says that people have been reaching out to her, sharing their own experiences with similarly shady dudes. “I think it’s like a universal experience,” she says. “A lot of girls are being like, ‘Girl, I feel you.’ Just like, boyfriends not being supportive... But I think it’s kind of a popular theme.” Alana knows where she’s coming from. “I had a boyfriend that gave me an ultimatum between doingLicorice Pizzaand staying with him,” she says. “I obviously made the right choice...” By this point it has become clear that Danielle is good at bowling, Este and Alana are OK, and I am terrible. Danielle knocks out a strike and walks back casually. “That does not happen a lot,” she says, right before nailing another one. When Alana and Este bowl well, they do victory dances on the spot. “Uh, uh, body roll, body roll,” Este raps as she does so. Whenever I step up to the lane, they turn into supportive Soccer Dads. “You have to find your ball!” Alana says. “Form is great; itlooksgreat,” Este says. “Go lighter,” Alana says. “There we go! You got one—you got two!” After I dispatch another ball to the gutter gods, Este steps up and completes a spare. “Are we recording this fucking—should we be bowlers?!” says Alana. I’m later informed that a seven-year-old in the lane next to ours racked up much better scores than all four of us. From left. On Este: Top by Stella McCartney. On Alana: Bra, vintage. On Danielle: Bikini top by DKNY. All jeans by Levi's, vintage customised by stylist. The noteworthy changeon the production ofI Quitwas Rechtshaid’s absence. Though the band are not keen to go into the specifics of how those working and personal relationships came to an end, the music speaks volumes. “‘Relationships’ took us a very long time to make for some obvious reasons that we don’t have to get into,” says Alana, “but you can just look at the lyrics and you’ll understand why.” “I’ve always been averse to conflict,” Danielle sings on the verse, “but you really fucked with my confidence.” For the single’s artwork, the band recreated some heavily memed photographs of Nicole Kidman basking in the sunshine on the street like she’s just been told someexcellentnews, which were once reported to have been snapped by paparazzi after her divorce fromTom Cruisewas finalized. “She goes through the seven stages in five seconds, and we each picked our favorite expression that she made,” Alana says. “Our friend Terry [O’Connor] shot it walking down a random street. We were screaming.” “Guttural,” Este says. “All the things we wanted to say to get those emotions, it was the most cathartic experience,” says Alana. What is clear is that before they got to that guttural scream of freedom, Danielle had been through something very difficult. On “Everybody’s Trying to Figure Me Out,” she sings about a panic attack that she experienced after returning from tour to an empty house. “Something about being alone with myself scared the shit out of me,” Danielle wrote in an Instagram post promoting the song. “After a lot of reflecting I realized I’ve let a lot of people try and tell me how I should live my life, but I realized in making everyone else happy, I lost myself.” Elsewhere, on “Down to be Wrong”, she sings: “Boy, I crushed my whole heart trying to fit my soul into your arms.” The sisters’ mortifying dating stories might give you the wrong impression. Este was only single for a little while with the other two. A couple of years ago, she went on a blind date with a friend of a friend of a friend. “He took me to Pioneer Works in Red Hook—it’s like an art gallery that has a good beer selection and a good wine selection,” she says. “And it was great.” The two are now engaged. And Danielle is out of the horror-stories phase of dating, too. “Generally everyone’s just been super nice,” she says. In fact, the way she describes singledom, it sounds kind of… amazing. “I feel like in the last three years I’ve learned a lot about myself, being single and having a lot of solitary time,” she tells me. To encourage herself to be more social and spontaneous, she moved to New York for a period, spending time going on dates and hanging out with friends likeBabygirldirector Halina Reijn. “It was for my soul,” she says. “It was so good for me to be constantly out andmeeting people.” Did you learn anything surprising about yourself? “That I’m OK alone,” she says. “Not only OK, but so happy. Sorry to be that bitch but I’m like, really having a great time being by myself. And now, unless someone’s gonna make me so much more happy, I’m good.” “It’s the happiest she’s ever been, honestly,” Este agrees. “For sure.” “It’s nice to see sparkle and, like, energy come out of Danielle again,” says Alana. “’Cause for a long time it felt like it was kind of lost.” Este has learned some important shit too over the last few years. “I love Zoloft,” she says. “Thank God for SSRIs.” PTA has seen the change, too. “I think I’ve learned that the ecosystem of support in a family and friendships is always changing,” Anderson says. “Suddenly the strong leader is the child who needs care and comfort. Dynamics change and move all the time or sometimes they move in slow motion… But if the love and respect is there, everything usually works out. I’ve seen Alana really grow, obviously, from the baby of the family to one of the possibly great young actresses of her generation. That’s been cool to see.” “I’ve learned that I can throw a really good fucking party,” says Alana. “I’m still the baby sister that throws the ragers.” After bowling, wemake our way down Ventura Boulevard towards the vintage store. “I get a discount still,” Este says. As Danielle combs through the racks trying to find me the perfect pair of jeans, Este pulls out a T-shirt with a giant doodle of the Camel cigarettes camel on the front. “Dude… it has the pocket for the cigarettes,” she says, pointing to the sleeve. She picks up another T-shirt which reads: “I survived the Northridge Earthquake of ’94”. “Wedidsurvive this earthquake,” Este says. “We slept through it.” (Despite this, they assure me it was the mother of all San Fernando Valley earthquakes during their lifetime.) Este buys her earthquake tee; Danielle’s jeans hunt ends unsuccessfully. Before we part, our goodbye hugs are interrupted by a teenage fan, who—and I wasn’t expecting this—says, “My dad loves you so much,” and asks very sweetly if they would take a photo with her. The sisters kindly oblige. “Do you live in the Valley?” Este asks her as they line up for the picture. She does. “Yessss,” says Este. “Tell your dad we say hi.” Shortly afterwards, the Haim sisters are off, walking in tandem in the streets of the Valley once again. Back in the Italian restaurant, as we circled some of the thornier themes of the album, Alana had made clear the energy they’re moving into this new era with. “This is our ‘life is too short’ album,” she said. “I Quit. I quit feeling shitty. It’s time to have a good time.” A version of this story originally appeared in the June/July 2025 issue of British GQ with the title “Party of Three.” Haim will be at GQ Heroes in Oxfordshire, England from 2-4 July 2025.

    "title": "Elon Musk Also Hates the GOP Spending Bill (Unless He Meant “Disgusting Abomination” as a Compliment)",
    "article_text": "Elon Muskleft his jobwreaking havoc on the federal government last week, but he still has thoughts about what his former boss is up to: Namely, he believesDonald Trump’s spending bill is a “disgusting abomination.” And he doesn’t care who knows it! Taking a break fromdenyingusing ketamine, Adderall, psychedelic mushrooms, and other substances during his stint in politics, Musk took to X totellhis 220 million followers: “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Musk’s comments follow remarks he made in an interview withCBS Sunday Morningin which hesaidhe was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing. I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both.” Obviously, his Tuesday afternoon post represents a slight escalation in criticism. Democrats have unsurprisingly taken the opportunity to highlight Musk’s anger with the bill. On X, House Minority LeaderHakeem Jeffrieswrote: “The GOP Tax Scam is a disgusting abomination. Truer words have never been spoken.” Of course, Jeffries and Musk have very different reasons for thinking the legislation is an abomination. Jeffries doesn’t like it because, among other things, it makescuts to Medicaidthat will cause millions of people to lose health insurance and leave many millions hungry as a result ofcuts tothe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—all to give tax breaks to the richest people in the country. Musk doesn’t like it because he thinks the bill doesn’t cutenough(and, perhaps, because itscrapsthe Biden administration’s electric vehicle tax credits.) Asked about Musk’s Tuesday remarks, White House spokespersonKaroline Leavitttold reporters “The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn’t change the president’s opinion. This is one big beautiful bill.” Other lawmakers have also spoken out against the legislation. SenatorRand Paulwarned on Tuesday, “Once this bill votes, and this debt ceiling goes through, the debt is owned by the GOP, and there is no more campaigning and saying ‘this is the Democrats.’ It will be owned by the Republicans, and I think that’s a huge mistake.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Of course, Paul’s warning is probably only partially true: Yes, the debt will be Republicans’ fault but that will in no way stop the GOP from blaming everything that goes wrong in the country on Democrats. Many of them are probably workshopping 2026 stump speeches right now pinning whatever the deficit swells to onJoe Biden.

    "title": "Hollywood Therapists Meet the Moment: “If You’re Not Dispirited Right Now, You’re Dissociative”",
    "article_text": "Welcome to Hollywood–that’s not smog, it’s depression. The entertainment industry currently registers somewhere between slowdown and apocalypse on the disaster scale. For many in the business who are eitherunemployedor terrified that they soon will be, therapists offer support and consolation. That means they serve as a good barometer for the town’s mental health. So what’s the view from the therapist’s chair? “It feels like the end of days,” saysDennis Palumbo,a psychotherapist with patients predominately in the entertainment industry. “I’ve been doing this for 31 years now, and I’ve never seen this level of despair among creative people in the industry,” he says. “There’s a level of depression and anxiety pretty much unparalleled.” Film and television production hasplungedin Los Angeles. A recentreportby the Otis College of Art and Design found that there were 25% fewer entertainment jobs across the board last year compared to post-pandemic 2022, which was not exactly a joyride itself. Palumbo blames it on the triple whammy ofCOVID, two brutalstrikes, and vertical integration, with a handful of large conglomerates gobbling so much up. “The business has always been crazy,” he says. “But it used to be that if you had a track record that meant something, if you came off a show, you were pretty certain you’d get on another show. Those days are over. Now you could come off a hit show and you’re still like Sisyphus: your rock is at the bottom of that hill again. It’s very, very depressing for a lot of patients.” “The new normal is that it’s not all going to bounce back.” Kara Mayer Robinson,a licensed therapist who also works as an on-set mental health consultant, harks back to the phrase “Stay alive til ’25,” a popular mantra last year for insiders hoping that Hollywood production would ramp back up. “The new normal is that it’s not all going to bounce back,” she says. So one of her key questions for patients is: “What’s your mindset?” Robinson aims to help patients manage the anxiety and fear that may be paralyzing them. “You have to recognize and accept what you can’t control,” she says, “and then you figure out what youcando and take action on that.” Along with doing whatever they need to do to survive—driving an Uber or waiting tables, in some cases—Robinson encourages patients to keep creating things, even when hardly anyone is buying them. “There’s definitely been a shift where people don’t necessarily trust the studio system and are thinking, Well, maybe we need to be on YouTube,” she says. “But for a lot of people who’ve been doing this for decades, they’re not about to go to plan B. There’s no plan B. This is what they’ve worked their whole life for.” Ironically, Los Angeles is full of former entertainment people who decided to become…therapists or life coaches. Palumbo, for instance, used to write movies and TV shows (My Favorite Year,Welcome Back, Kotter).Phil Starkwrote forSouth Park,That ’70s Show,and the movieDude, Where’s My Car?But when work started drying up after the 2008 strikes, he struggled to figure out what to do next. He eventually zeroed in on grad school and transitioned into his new life as a therapist, which sees him work with many people languishing in a way he knows well. “The longer you have been doing this career–the longer you’ve been identifying as an editor or a cinematographer or a sitcom writer—the harder it is to imagine yourself changing,” Stark says. “And so it can be a kind of eureka moment when people discover what they previously thought was interesting before they got into the business, like me with psychology.” He sometimes taps his industry expertise to help get to the root of patients’ problems: Why are they feeling crushed by a studio executive’s notes, for instance? “I also might work with somebody who can’t get work and is struggling with depression—sort of sitting with them while that plays out.” Spending all day listening to people vibrate with panic and misery isn’t always easy—especially if you’ve been in the same situation yourself.Jamie Rosewas once a successful actor on network shows likeFalcon Crest.By her mid-30s, as acting jobs thinned out, she started seeingPhil Stutz,shrink to the stars. (He’s the subject ofJonah Hill’s 2022 Netflix documentary,Stutz.) Things grew very dark for Rose after the 1990 market crash and the 1994 earthquake; the bank foreclosed on her quake-damaged house, and she seriously contemplated suicide. An actor since the age of six, she had no other obvious skills. But she eventually transitioned into teaching and then working as a life coach under Stutz’s tutelage, often taking on patients he referred. One of Rose’s current clients is in tremendous debt, and it brought Rose to tears in a recent session. “Having been at the top in the entertainment industry and then to lose it all—I have firsthand experience with this shit. Been there, lost that!” she says wryly. “But because of that, I get to say to him, ‘You stay alive, no matter what. Even if that means you call me every day between sessions, you need to stay alive.’” Stark admits that the industry contraction is grim, even though he no longer lives off screenwriting. “It’s like if you watch a video on TikTok about a writer complaining how there’s no work, you’re going to get a lot more videos about that, and pretty soon it’s all you can think about,” he says. “The zeitgeist right now is very negative.” Or as Palumbo puts it, “If you’re not dispirited right now, you’re dissociative.” It’s especially dire for “below the line” workers (i.e., behind-the-scenes folks), many of whom never had much financial wiggle room even when times were good. “I see people who are at the point where they’re either considering changing careers entirely or they already have, and others who can’t afford to live in Los Angeles anymore,” Robinson tells me. But the panic extends all the way up the ladder. Palumbo says of his agent and manager patients, “They’re pulling their hair out because they’ve never seen it like this. And we tend to be a culture that says, Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Are you living up to your potential?” “It’s really about working through the identity loss that often happens the day that your email shuts down.” Hollywood executives are not exempt from the epidemic of dread. “It’s difficult to process the enormity of the loss that is going on,” saysKaren Jones,who launched her own coaching business after decades in the entertainment business—most recently as EVP and head of communications for HBO and Max. Among her clientele are execs who remain employed but are now doing the work of multiple people in the aftermath of layoffs, as well as those who have been pushed out themselves. For the latter, she says, “It’s really about working through the identity loss that often happens the day that your email shuts down. Those folks—checking emails is the first thing they do when they wake up in the morning, it’s the last thing they do when they go to bed. When that’s gone, there is a tremendous void. Like,who am I now?” The bottom line, Palumbo says, is learning to cope with uncertainty—something that’s a given in Hollywood. “Do you see uncertainty as a referendum on you, or is it just the shifting winds of the environment?” he asks. “It means you feel bad about who you are, or you realize that you’re going to have to make some very difficult choices.” Rose, for one, is not sorry that she swapped acting for life coaching. Laughing with relief, she tells me, “I’m so glad I’m doing this and not still waiting for my friggin’ agent to call!” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "article_text": "Last Thursday,Shiloh Jolieattended the launch dinner for Isabel Marant's capsule collection with Net-A-Porter. The daughter ofAngelina JolieandBrad Pittsurprised more than one guest by playing an essential role in the evening's events. As the private dinner brought together a number of influential personalities, Shiloh choreographed a dance performed byKeoni RoseandTako Suzukito accompany a live performance by 22-year-old singerLuella. To the tune of “Naïve,” the dancers captivated their audience with their dance moves,Varietyreports. The event took place in the backyard of Oliver House, a private residence designed in the 1930s. Following a brief appearance at the cocktail hour, Shiloh spent time away from the crowds with her dancers. For the occasion, Shiloh opted for a pseudonym for her new role as choreographer, calling herself Shi. Although this new appellation is by no means official, it's not the first time the daughter of the star couple has updated her name. Last year, she decided toremove her father's surname from her legal name,becoming Shiloh Jolie in July 2024. Although Angelina Jolie toldJimmy Fallonthat her daughter likes \"privacy above all\" and doesn't like to be photographed, several videos of Shiloh have set social networks alight over the past two years.An avid dancer, Shiloh is a regular at the Millennium Dance Complex in Los Angeles. The latest video shows her dancing with ease to “APT” byRoséandBruno Mars. Guests at the Isabel Marant event includedMilla Jovovich,Madeline Brewer,Rachel Bilson,Alison BrieandCarlacia Grant.

    "title": "Meghan Markle Gets Tips from Tina Knowles on an “Annoying” Business Problem",
    "article_text": "Last week,Meghan Markleendedthe initial runof her Lemonada Media podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder,but on Tuesday, she returned with a bonus episode featuring one of the duchess’s most exciting guests yet.Tina Knowles,mother ofBeyoncéandSolange Knowles,spoke to Meghan abouther bestselling memoir,Matriarch, and how her career as an entrepreneur predated her daughters’ careers in the entertainment industry. During the conversation, Meghan shared new details about her own business, As Ever, and the challenges she faced when she launched her initial slate of products in early April. “You want to share the thing you've worked so hard on,” she said. “For me at that moment with As Ever, it was great. We plan for a year, and then everythingsells out in 45 minutes. Great news, but then what do you do?” Still, the duchess said the initial launch was bittersweet because she was concerned about the customer experience. “You say, okay, we planned as best as we could,” she added. “Are we going to replenish and sell out again in an hour? Or is that annoying as a customer?” After the eighth episode of her podcast premiered on May 27, Meghansaidshe would be taking a longer break before coming back with a new set of As Ever products. Still, a source close to the duchess toldVanity Fairthat the company is still planning for an eventual restock of the initial slate of products, which included honey, raspberry preserves, baking mixes, and herbal teas. Otherwise, the company has not shared any information about its timeline. During her conversation with Knowles, Meghan elaborated on her decision to “pause” after the initial launch. “Let’s wait until we are completely stable and we have everything we need,” she said. “I don't want you to eat that jam once every six months. I want that to be on your shelf all the time.” In response, Knowles said that she and Beyoncé had a similar experience when they launched their haircare brand, Cécred. “We had a lot of setbacks, because it takes a long time with products. You have to test them,” she said. “You just go all the way and start all over again.” Near the end of the conversation, Meghan said that she thinks about what it would be like to run a business with her daughter,Princess Lilibet of Sussex,in the future, asking Knowles if she has any advice for working alongside family. Knowles replied with insight into how she andBeyoncédeal with tensions when they arise. “We have disagreements about things, but it's her business. I'm helping with the business because I just want to leave this earth knowing that she, other than entertainment, is going to be okay,” Knowles said. “Otherwise, we get along really well. If we have a disagreement, it's her business, so she gets to win.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "The Life of Chuck Is a Tearjerker That Left Me Dry-Eyed",
    "article_text": "At last year’sToronto International Film Festival, the top prize—one voted on by the viewing public, rather than some cloistered jury—went to an unexpected outlier. The winner wasn’tEmilia PéreznorAnora(those came in second and third, respectively), but ratherThe Life of Chuck, a film from horror auteurMike Flanaganthat was not on many people’s radar prior to the festival. At the time, the film didn’t even have a distributor—Neon has since picked it up—and was not slated to be released in 2024. This madeThe Life of Chucksomething of an anomaly in recent TIFF history. Usually, the People’s Choice winner takes that win and runs with it to a best picture nomination at the Oscars a few months later; prior toThe Life of Chuck, that’s what had happened every year but one since 2008. The People’s Choice win positionedThe Life of Chuckas a sudden awards contender, a curious outcome for afantastical adaptationof aStephen Kingshort story directed by a guy mostly known as a purveyor ofelevated spookiness. The Life of Chuckfinally opens on June 6, arriving as counterprogramming to the harum-scarum of Ethan Hunt’slast impossible missionand the dino damage of the upcomingJurassic Worldfourquel. Flanagan’s film is big in its own way—it is a decades-spanning metaphysical treatise on time and life and cosmic dread—but it’s decidedly softer, more sweet-hearted and whimsical, than anything else on offer in theaters this month. For that,The Life of Chuckis appreciated. But in most other respects, it is a disappointment. I don’t imagine a best picture nomination is in the offing. Watching the film, which (sort of) tells the story of the titular everyman in reverse chronological order, one yearns for the kind of movie it’s trying to be. Flanagan is aiming at the sweeping, uplifting existentialism ofThe Truman ShoworAmerican Beauty(beloved at the time!) or another King adaptation,The Shawshank Redemption—dark but hopeful examinations of the human condition that offer a hug of comfort and communion. Even lesser films, likeBen Stiller’sThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty, fit cozily into this mostly lost genre: standalone mainstream films meant to elate, inspire, and (hopefully) win awards. We’ve had precious few of those in recent years, unless you countEverything Everywhere All at Once.(That one has a bit too much indie spirit and action-heavy construction to really qualify.) But sadly, Flanagan’s film has its proportions all wrong—in hewing too closely to King’s narrative, it fails to take its own cinematic shape. Things begin on a compelling note of doomsday melancholy. In the first chapter of the story (which is actually the third chapter),Chiwetel Ejioforplays Marty, a lonely teacher trying to do his job as the apocalypse looms. Internet service is spotty and then, one day, gone entirely. Environmental cataclysms of all kinds ravage the globe. People in Marty’s community are up and walking away from their jobs and other responsibilities. What’s the point of obligation when the world’s prognosis is so grim? Many of us can likely empathize with this first section’s sentiment, its conviction—offset by the cheery brightness of the film’s design—that things are finally, truly falling apart as a bitter end quickly approaches. Marty is, contradictorily but relatably, stuck somewhere between resigned acceptance and denial. Maybe even a little good is coming from these dire circumstances: He begins to reconnect with his ex-wife, Felicia (Karen Gillan), a hospital worker prone to fits of anxious despondence. Both are baffled by the sudden ubiquity of signs congratulating a man called Chuck on his 39 years of . . . something. They assume it’s some vainglorious guy celebrating his own retirement; a strange thing to do at the end of the world. This section of the film suggests a grand, meaningful convergence to come. Somehow the small and fleeting lives of Marty and Felicia will be tethered to this mysterious Chuck, and all, including us in the audience, will realize some crucial and beautiful truth about life. The film’svery effective trailersuggests as much. But once this chapter is done and we move back in time,The Life of Chuckstumbles. The entire middle section is centered on animpromptu dancedone by Chuck (Tom Hiddleston) while on a business trip. A busker is playing drums; Chuck conjures up the memory of his dance-happy grandmother (Mia Sara—yes, Mia Sara), then lets himself feel the rhythm. He’s joined by a stranger, Janice (Annalise Basso), and a crowd forms around them as they swing and jive. This is framed as a celebration of spontaneity and joy interrupting the lonesome drudgery of being alive. But it comes off as trite and flimsy instead, an entirely insufficient followup to the first segment’s more holistic survey of existence. The film asks us to cling to this moment as a central thesis; dance in the face of inevitable doom. How veryJojo Rabbit. (Which, by the way, also won the TIFF People’s Choice Awards.) Then we move further back in time to Chuck’s childhood, spent with his kooky grandparents (his grandfather is played as some kind ofDark Crystalpuppet by Flanagan regularMark Hamill) and at dance lessons at school. Most of this segment is the quaint story of a little boy daring to express himself while contending with grief, as some very King-ian supernatural matters creep ominously at the edges. The film introduces a new central idea in the form of Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself,” particularly the concept of a human being containing multitudes within their mind. Which relates to the first (so, third) part of the film, but doesn’t really connect with the one-precious-moment sentiment of the street dancing interlude plopped down in the middle of the film. By the time it has reached its anticlimactic ending,The Life of Chuckhas lost its balance entirely. It’s a lumpy, eclectic film, one grasping for deep meaning but never quite reaching it. Flanagan’s ambition fails him here, as it sometimes doesin his ornately crafted Netflix shows. Part of the problem might be that we don’t actually know Chuck very well; we’re much more attuned to Ejiofor’s character, because we have actually spent time with his interior, quotidian life. Whereas we mostly just see Chuck dancing, without ever really understanding what borders those happy moments of release. Chuck is meant to be a resonant symbol of all of us, but in Flanagan’s execution, he’s as flat as one of his billboards.

    "title": "FEMA Chief Apparently Just Trying to Lighten the Mood When He Said He Didn’t Know the US Had a Hurricane Season",
    "article_text": "David Richardson,the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was totally just joking and not at all serious when he told staffers that he didn’t know the US had a hurricane season, a spokesperson for the agency insisted on Monday. Specifically, according toThe Wall Street Journal, Richardsonsaidduring a briefing: “Yesterday, as everybody knows, [was the] first day of hurricane season. I didn’t realize it was a season.” Those remarksreportedlyleft FEMA employees “baffled” and unsure if he “meant it literally, as a joke, or in some other context.” In response, a spokesperson insisted to the outlet that “Despite mean-spirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy, there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this Hurricane Season. FEMA is laser focused on disaster response, and protecting the American people.” To be fair, it’s not exactly hard to imagine a world in which aDonald Trumpappointee is ill-informed about the agency they’ve been tasking with leading. (See Education secretaryLinda McMahon,whothinksAI is “A1,” as in the steak sauce.) And while Richardson may be aware that there is a hurricane season, but he doesn’thave anydisaster response experience, which seems equally as bad. Arguably more alarming than his supposed joke is the fact Richardson’s predecessor wasfiredfor the crime of saying he didn’t think FEMA should be eliminated, which, asThe Washington Postreported in March, the administration ishoping to doby October 1—yes, before the end of hurricane season. Approximately 2,000 full-time FEMA staffers havereportedlyleft since Trump took office; according toThe Wall StreetJournal,“the agency has been plagued by a wave of high-level departures,” including the acting number two who resigned last month and wrote in his farewell message: “Everyone has a line, and I have reached mine.” In equally fun news, theJournalhas reported that “FEMA employees have said the agency is months behind schedule in its preparations for the hurricane season, which is expected to have above-normal activity.” After Richardson took over last month, hewarnedstaffers not to get in his way carrying out Trump’s agenda. “Obfuscation, delay, undermining. If you’re one of those 20% of people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you,” Richardson reportedly said. “Don’t get in my way…I know all the tricks.” (He also apparently offered a bizarre fruit-centered metaphor for breaking down FEMA’s goals into smaller tasks. “Some of those tasks will be kind of orange-like tasks,” hesaid, according to a video recording of the meeting viewed by theJournal.“And by orange, I mean the fruit orange. But they might be tangerines, they might be blood oranges, it might just be a little bit grapefruity, all those will go in one bin.”) Samantha Montano,who teaches emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy,toldthe Associated Press, “There’s really been a brain drain within FEMA in addition to the loss of overall employees,” adding that many of the people who left were in critical positions.Susan Cutter,the codirector of the Hazards, Vulnerability, and Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina, told the outlet her “nightmare” scenario was “a major catastrophic storm hitting an area that is reeling from the impact of all of this nonsense from the Trump administration and people will die. And that could happen in Florida, that could happen in Texas, that could happen in South Carolina.” Of course, let’s also not forget that the country is currently being run by a guy who reportedly oncesuggestedstopping hurricanes by dropping nuclear bombs on them (he denies this), displayed aSharpie-doctoredhurricane map because he’s incapable of admitting he’s wrong, thinks nothing ofspreadingbaseless conspiracy theories about disaster relief, and apparently tried towithholddisaster aid from places he felt had insufficiently kissed his ring. Maybe Richardson can work on some fresh material about that.

    "title": "Marisa Abela Doesn’t Regret Her Amy Winehouse Biopic: “There’s Nothing Else I Could Have Done”",
    "article_text": "It’s not every day that an actor’s first big job out of drama school leads to them winning a BAFTA Award—especially on a series that’s been flying under the radar for several years. WhileMarisa Abela’s work onHBO’sIndustryhas always stood out, her show wasn’t a breakout hit with viewers from the start. That finally changed in its third season. Now the English actor is getting overdue mainstream attention, as well as sudden awards heat. Her BAFTA TV win for best actress is so recent that it happened after ourLittle Gold Meninterview took place (read or listen to it below). Industrystars Abela and fellow rising starsMyha’laandHarry Lawtey(who just exited the series ahead of its upcoming fourth season) as young employees at the cutthroat London investment bank Pierpoint & Co. whose dynamic social and sexual lives violently collide with their professional ambitions. Abela’s Yasmin has soared and crashed several times at the company, untilthe end of the third season—when, following the death of her abusive father and getting fired from Pierpoint, Yasmin takes charge of her life. She marries a mercurial CEO with ties to the company, played byGame of Thrones’Kit Harington,charting a new path forward. So what’s next for Yasmin—and how does she even fit intoIndustry’s future? Abela is understandably tight-lipped. But the star has experienced her own ups and downs in her swift rise, from the backlash toher Amy Winehouse biopicBack to Blackto the acclaim surrounding her last film, theSteven Soderberghspy dramaBlack Bag. And like Yasmin, she isn’t going anywhere. Vanity Fair:Did you notice more people getting on theIndustrytrain this season? Marisa Abela:I definitely felt a big shift in the way that people felt aboutIndustryand how seriously it was taken as a drama. It’s almost like if you get in a relationship with someone that’s been your friend for a long time. It’s not like a love at first sight; people were friends with this person for two years, and then all of a sudden they realized that maybe there could be more to this friendship. [Laughs] What can you tell me about season four? At the end of season three, there’s a real question as to what Yasmin’s future within the show is. I’ll speak emotionally, because I don’t know what I’m allowed to say in terms of plot. We find her in a place where she has ostensibly everything she thought she wanted. Yasmin’s journey has always been finding a purpose, somewhere she feels like she’s thriving. I think that she is getting warmer and warmer towards that place, finding where she has agency, especially professionally. She’s in a different world now to the first three seasons, and it makes slightly more sense. She looks like she belongs in this world, but she has these base instincts—as everyone inIndustrydoes—that she can’t quite keep at bay. What’s the pace of making the show now? Some series can be quick, and this show is very fast paced to begin with. It is very fast. We shoot a lot on a day—and big scenes. The thing aboutIndustryis you’re either doing quite a technically heavy scene, in terms of the jargon and the specifics of what is going on, or quite emotionally intense scenes, so there’s never a chill moment really on set. You’ve got to hope that maybe you’ve got one scene a day where you’re watching someone else do most of that heavy lifting. But we shoot through maybe four scenes a day, and they’re quite long, heavy, dense scenes. How do you feel with the jargon now? To be honest, Yasmin doesn’t say that much. Even when Yasmin is trying to be a great banker, she’s not—so I’m off the hook with that one. I’ve only ever been a part of a huge trade scene once. Myha’la has to do it quite often.Sagar [Radia]has to do it so often, as doesKen [Leung]. I was withConor MacNeill,who plays Kenny, andMark Dexter,who plays Wyndham. We were on the foreign-exchange desk, and we’d just look over and watch them do these five-page scenes with however many numbers and words and whatever in them. I had to do it once, I think, in season three, and it was so scary and overwhelming. But thankfully Yasmin is as out of her depth as I am. I think I would maybe have lasted about the same amount of time at Pierpoint as Yasmin did. In season three, her relationship with her father comes to the fore. What was it like learning new information about her character, and weaving that into your performance? The amazing thing about Mickey and Konrad is that they’ve really listened to everything from day one of season one. We would have conversations at that time. For me, it was mostly about wrapping my head around a lot of the intimacy scenes and Yasmin’s sexuality, and the way that she used her sensuality to her advantage at work. A lot came out of a conversation about Yasmin’s relationship to her father, that she always saw herself through the male gaze. It meant that she was aware from a young age of her father’s tastes, at least to women—if not to her specifically, but what it feels like for a young woman to grow up with a man who has an insatiable appetite for young women. What were those initial conversations you were having about Yasmin’s sexuality and filming those scenes? Was there anything about doing that that was concerning to you? When I signed onto the show, I’d read the first couple episodes, and I was aware that sex was a big part of the show. To be honest, it made sense to all of us at the time. They were 22. They were in the world of finance. There were all of these new people. I needed to be able to justify why Yasmin was making these choices, and also why in certain moments we needed to see certain things. I didn’t want to stand in the way of that, but as the seasons have gone on, we understand that side to her and that side of her—and therefore less needs to be said now. Back to Black. You went intoIndustryseason three right after finishingBack to Black, in which you played Amy Winehouse. What did it feel like, coming off of that year of work—both as a person and as an actor? I guess the actor thing is easier. Being an actor is kind of being an athlete in a way, and you are just fighting fit when you’re working that much. You need to be looking after yourself, and have the right amount of sleep, and all of that sort of stuff. You are in the best shape of your life when you’re working. So as an actor, fine, I probably could have kept going. As a person? It’s super important to just remind yourself of who you are. I’m not Method, so I don’t think I’m the person that I’m playing—but it is easy to lose parts of yourself when you’re working that much and spending that much time, A, just on set, and B, as another person. It was an intense year, but I’m so glad I did it. How did you experience the release ofBack to Black—being the face of a film that was not without controversy, and not without a lot of discussion? Black to Blackwas a difficult job in so many ways, but I don’t know who I would be as an actor if I turned down that opportunity. And I especially don’t know who I would be as an artist if I didn’t work as hard as I did. I would feel very different about it if we were sitting, having this conversation, and there was a voice in the back of my head that thought, “You could have worked a bit harder, or you could have done a bit more research, or spent a few more hours.” That’s not the case. I entered into that job with so much curiosity, and willing to be explorative, and also technical dedication—there’s just nothing else I could have done. Right now, I feel okay about the whole thing. It’s difficult to be in the spotlight when it’s not all rainbows and sunshine. Did you feel prepared for that level of scrutiny? I just don’t think that there’s anything comparative out there for Amy specifically. I don’t know if that’s especially in the UK, or just generally, but…especially young women stepping up to the bat and saying, “I think I can do this,” I think women backing themselves in this field is a very difficult pill for people to swallow. She is so beloved and singular and talented. Her relationship with the press during her life was so complicated and difficult that I completely understand why people’s relationship to another exploration of her life was what it was. All I could think at the time was, I hope people know that I understand that. And that’s why I am working as hard as I’m working to make this a story that feels like it is full of admiration and respect—a genuine exploration into what it takes for someone to be that kind of an artist. You just worked with Steven Soderbergh onBlack Bag. Any other dream directors on your list? It’s a difficult time for mid-budget cinema, but I feel like it’s having a real resurgence at the same time. The industry is in a really tricky place in terms of what hits and what misses, because it feels like there is no algorithm anymore to be able to understand what’s going to work. But I think that’s the exciting thing. What that means is that you just have to look at the festivals to see really exciting films. It just seems to change all the time. Steven talked about that a little bit withBlack Bag, his nervousness around how a movie like this can perform nowadays—especially given how great the reviews were. Totally. But there’s this whole other thing that’s happening, where it goes on Amazon and people watch it. It has a whole sort of second wave. It’s just difficult to know what it is that people want to see at the cinema, unless it’s a huge event-type movie. I love going to the cinema, and I always get sad when awards season is over. It’s like, “Well, what am I going to do now?” Did you have favorites from this past season? I thoughtSing Singwas amazing. I thoughtAnorawas amazing. I lovedConclave. I lovedWicked. It was a great year. What is it like to be on theBarbieset for—well, I don’t know how long you were there, but you have a cameo-sized part in the film. How was it? I was there for an inordinate amount of time compared to how long I am on screen. [Laughs] That’s part of it, being on something that big. The most amazing lesson was seeing how the set works. IfIndustryis fast,Back to Blackwas breakneck speed. That’s a small budget movie, and we were rushing, running through scenes so fast. I think we did 54 locations in 45 days or something. It was crazy. It’s just really interesting as an actor to see what these different spaces occupy in terms of how you can prepare. Come on set to a $12-million movie versus 40 versus 100 versus whatever, knowing how to be prepared—walking onto that set is a skill set in itself. WithBack to Black, if I hadn’t done the level of preparation I’d done, I would really struggle with working at that speed. Harry Lawtey and Marisa Abela inIndustry. Back toIndustry: how do you feel about Harry Lawtey exiting the show? Personally, I feel very sad. I love him so much, and we all really supported each other through the first three seasons. But I’m also really proud of him. He is doing a movie withRussell Croweright now. I’m proud of him for doing whatever it is that he wants to do next. In terms of this set, I mean, the truth isIndustryis a crazy world. I don’t see Myha’la that often. Storylines take you in directions you would never know. The thrill of the show is it feels like it’s always getting blown up and then put back together again. Now that you’re in season four, is this something you’re in for til the end? Or do you feel like you would have an expiration point? I don’t imagine myself doing this show when I’m like 50, if that’s what you’re asking, but I don’t know—the amazing thing about Yasmin andIndustryis that the writers are hell-bent on shifting it all the time. Season one to season three felt like obviously the same person, but such different circumstances. I was playing such different stakes and worlds. That’s the same again this season. I don’t feel bored artistically. I’m always super excited by other jobs that are out there, but I’ve been pretty able so far to do lots of other things. I feel very blessed that it doesn’t take up too much time. You never know. I guess we’ll see. It’s also on Mickey and Konrad, what they want to do. I’ve been very lucky as an actor to have hogged them for a while, but I know that there are lots of actors that want to do whatever with them. We’ll see how long they want to do it for.

    "title": "What Is Going On With Patti LuPone and the Tony Awards 2025? A Guide",
    "article_text": "There’s drama, and then there’sPatti LuPone. The 76-year-old Broadway, film, and TV actor has taken center stage in a production of her own making just days before theTony Awards 2025, with controversy stemming from comments she made in a recentNew Yorkerprofile. LuPone is known for her devil-may-care actions over the years (like when shesnatched a cell phone from an audience memberat Lincoln Center in 2015 mid-performance, or when she yelled at another theatergoer from the stage for taking pictures in 2009, or when she said in 2017 that she’d never perform forDonald Trumpbecause “I hate the motherfucker”), but in this instance,more than 600 of her Broadway colleaguessaid in no uncertain terms that they did care. LuPone, who starred opposite the nowTony-nominatedMia Farrowin the Broadway playThe Roommate,was asked during the interview about an incident during the play’s 2024 run, when she asked that neighboring musicalHell’s Kitchenfix the issue of noise bleeding through the theater’s walls. Sound cues were adjusted to fix the issue and LuPone sent flowers as a thank-you, but the story wasn’t over:Kecia Lewis,a star ofHell’s Kitchen,posted on Instagram a videoof herself reading an “open letter” to LuPone, saying: “These actions, in my opinion, are bullying; they’re offensive; they’re racially microaggressive; they’re rude; they’re rooted in privilege.” LuPone had also called the show, which has a predominantly Black cast, “too loud.”Audra McDonald,the winningest actor in the history of the Tonys, who is again nominated this year forGypsy,showed her support with an emoji comment on Lewis’s post. Months after the incident, LuPone was still irritated. “Here’s the problem. She calls herself a veteran?” she said of Lewis. “Let’s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn’t know what the fuck she’s talking about. She’s done seven. I’ve done 31. Don’t call yourself a vet, bitch.” (Her count was off, by the way:The New Yorkerclarified the record as 10 shows for Lewis, 28 for LuPone.) LuPone had fewer words for McDonald, but quite enough to make her feelings clear: “I thought, You should know better,” LuPone said of her fellow Broadway longtimer’s support of Lewis. “That’s typical of Audra. She’s not a friend.” Instead of saying anything—nice or otherwise—about McDonald’s Tony-nominated performance in the current revival ofGypsy,LuPone commented on the weather. McDonald was recently asked whether she was surprised by LuPone’s claim that she is “not a friend.” In aclip from aCBS Morningsinterviewbetween McDonald and journalistGayle King,McDonald said, “If there’s a rift between us, I don’t know what it is. That’s something that you’d have to ask Patti about. You know, I haven’t seen her in about 11 years, just because we’ve been busy, just with life and stuff,” she said. “So I don’t know what rift she’s talking about, but you’d have to ask her.” By last Friday, just four days after theNew Yorkerpiece was published, hundreds of Broadway professionalshad signed an open letterto the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, which coproduce the Tonys, urging them to ban LuPone from attending the ceremony. LuPone has had a long career, but Saturday saw a first from her:a public apology. Inan Instagram post, LuPone apologized for her “demeaning and disrespectful” comments about Lewis. “I regret my flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate,” she wrote. She did not apologize specifically to McDonald, or for anything she’d said about her, but LuPone did add: “I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies.” A representative for LuPone did not respond toVanity Fairwhen asked if she would attend this Sunday’s Tony Awards. Representatives for The Broadway League and the American Theatre Wing also did not respond to requests for comment. In theNew Yorkerinterview, LuPone boasted about “what I’m worth to a production.” “I know that I’m box office,” she said. “Don’t nickel-and-dime me before you put me onstage. Don’t treat me like a piece of shit. Because, at this point, if you don’t value me, why am I there?” Come Sunday, we’ll see whether she feels the same way.

    "title": "The 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Watch in June 2025",
    "article_text": "It can be hard to find the best movies on Netflix. We all understand the struggle of scrolling time—hours lost to wading through all of the Netflix movie options that could instead have been spent, you know, watching something. Or maybe something has been sitting patiently on your queue, waiting for someone to give you a nudge to finally press play. So, like a beacon in the night, here’s a guide to 25 of the best films within Netflix’s huge selection—including everything from landmark films to cult classics to Netflix-original hidden gems—updated monthly as films appear on and leave the platform. Take that, decision fatigue. (And if you want a list of the best shows on Netflix,we’ve got one of thosetoo.) Director:Martin ScorseseGenre:RomanceNotable cast:Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Winona RyderMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:88%Metacritic:90 Though it was initially overshadowed by other entries in his filmography, Scorsese’s adaptation of Edith Wharton’s tragic romance has been rising in favor in recent years. And no wonder, because its sumptuousness is undeniable. There’s unsparing 19th-century period design byDante FerrettiandRobert J. Franco,a lush Elmer Bernstein score, and a dazzling barn burner performance from Pfeiffer at the top of her game. The film’s heartbreaking emotional blows are as brutal as anything in the entire Scorsese canon, even though they come in corsets and coaches. The maestro may have madeThe Irishmanfor Netflix (and that movie ranks among the best options on the platform too), but the rest of his filmography is more than worth a watch as well. Director:Mati DiopGenre:DramaNotable cast:Mame Bineta Sane, Amadou Mbow, Ibrahima TraoréMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:85 Achingly romantic and fiercely original,Atlanticsis a shape-shifting ghost story of sorts thatdefies simple categorization. Diop’s first feature follows a young woman set to marry a man she does not love, while her lover flees their native Senegal by sea in search of work. Overnight, spirits begin to possess the townsfolk, seeking revenge against an exploitative corporation. Never less than captivating, the film features unforgettable visuals and an arresting blending of themes that make for one of the most daring Netflix originals—and signal Diop as one of the major breakthrough directors of the past decade. Director:Kirsten JohnsonGenre:DocumentaryMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:99%Metacritic:89 Johnson is always breaking the boundaries of what we think a documentary can be—never more so than in her deeply moving yet not-depressing tribute to her father on the eve of his death. Between candid interviews with her father, Dick, Johnson stages his death in various, surreally funny scenarios, such as a fall down the stairs or being struck by a rogue air conditioner. The directortoldVanity Fairthat making the film was an act of coping with her beloved parent’s dementia: “How can my father and I together confront the fact that he, who is irreplaceable, will disappear?” The effect is whimsical, profound, and restorative, making for the wildest study of love and loss in Netflix’s vast stable. Director:Spike LeeGenre:DramaNotable cast:Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Rosie Perez, Danny Aiello, John TurturroMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:93 A landmark of American filmmaking, Lee’s classic presents a day in the life of a Brooklyn neighborhood as tensions escalate between its citizens and a local racist pizzeria. The film and its place in the culture are always ripe for reexamination, from that dazzling cast to its “Fight the Power” pop maximalism to its still frustrating total blanking at the1990 Oscars. Lee’s vision of Black American community remains more potent and influentialwith each passing year, only bolstering its prominent place in our moviegoing consciousness. Even in the choppy, vast waters of Netflix originals (or Prime Video movies, since it’savailable theretoo!), the platform still has some of history’s biggest movies hiding in plain sight. Director:David DobkinGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams, Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan, Demi LovatoMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:64%Metacritic:50 Both a lampoon of silly, earnest musicalsanda straightforward silly, earnest musical in its own right, the film casts Ferrell and McAdams as Icelandic underdogs in the eponymous global competition. It’sa wholly satisfying mixof typically goofy Ferrell-isms and hilarious musical performances, all building up toward the film’s soaring, Oscar-nominated ballad “Husavik.” And for fans of the annualrealsong contest, you’ll find plenty of Easter eggs and cameos from beloved past contestants, including a delightful mashup sing-along sequence. More than anything, the film cements McAdams as one of our great stars. She delivers a heartfelt performance that elevates a goofy comedy into something more touching. Play “Jaja Ding Dong”! Director:Alice RohrwacherGenre:DramaNotable cast:Adriano Tardiolo, Sergi López, Alba RohrwacherMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:87 Director Rohrwacher earned a new legion of new fans from 2023’sJosh O’Conner–ledLa Chimera—but prior tothat masterpiece, she made another withthis idiosyncratic fable. Another foray into symbolic magical realism, Rohrwacher uses the story of frozen-in-time sweetheart farmhand Lazzaro to weave a magical examination of class and exploitation. Around its midpoint, the film takes a daring leap that recontextualizes everything we have seen as more than meets the eye, setting the tender Lazzaro on a course for tragedy to come. It’s another of Rohrwacher’s bespoke visual wonders that seem to commune with some kind of cinematic deity, casting a spell that lingers long after viewing. Director:Michael MannGenre:CrimeNotable cast:[deep breath]Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Dennis Haysbert, Mykelti Williamson, Jon Voight, Wes Studi, and at least two dozen moreMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:84%Metacritic:76 At the time of its mid-90s release,Heatpromiseda fireworks showdownfor acting titans Pacino and De Niro. Audiences were ever so disappointed to find that the film itself was much more contemplative. Though it carries thrills in the form of the central heist and a classic pursuit between cops and robbers (not to mention some of the best performers of their generation),Heatis something of an existential epic.In the years since, Mann’s masterwork has developed a devoted cult following obsessed with its masculine profundity and staggering beauty. Thirty years on, this crime thriller is finally appreciated for being more than an action film—a true feast for the eyes, ears, and mind. Director:Azazel JacobsGenre:DramaNotable cast:Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne, Elizabeth Olsen, Jovan Adepo, Jay O. SandersMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:98%Metacritic:83 Coon, Lyonne, and Olsen givethree revelatory performancesas diametrically opposed estranged siblings—the dictator, the hippie, and the burnout, respectively. They cram together in a tiny New York City apartment as they await the death of their father. They battle over groceries, monologue about the Grateful Dead, and try (and fail) to keep their many past resentments at bay. Sure,His Three Daughtersis at times a painful watch, brimming with claustrophobic tension and biting wit. But writer-director Jacobs gives this chamber piece on death and family a light touch that lifts off into something unexpected in its emotional depth, making forone of 2024’s best films. Director:David FincherGenre:CrimeNotable cast:Michael Fassbender, Arliss Howard, Tilda SwintonMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:73 This one arrived quietly, despite typically feverish anticipation for anything from Fincher—and it really deserved more attention. For viewers who were disappointed by Hollywood taleMank(another of Fincher’s Netflix original films), this is a return to form for the director, who brings a pitch-black sense of humor and violence back to the forefront. Fassbender stars as a contract assassin on the trail of vengeance after one of his assignments goes wrong, resulting in a sparse but jet-setting good time. Folks who catch up to its brittle thrills will find typical Fincher meticulousness and gallows comedy, a showstopping midpoint fight sequence that left me breathless, and Swinton telling elaborate anal sex jokes while downing whiskey. Director:Guy RitchieGenre:ActionNotable cast:Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki, Hugh GrantMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:68%Metacritic:56 Based on the classic television show but infused with a fresh verve, this secret agent adaptation is nowhere near as musty as it might sound. It may look like forgotten, cobwebbed IP but, asVanity Fairwrote in our review, “it manages, through the pluck of its cast and its director…to entertain in a fizzy, offbeat kind of a way.” It’s less a rote actioner for your dad to fall asleep watching, more of a thrill ride that will satisfy all the grownups in the house. IfThe Crowndidn’t turn you into a Debicki superfan, her cooing villain turn here surely will. Director:Todd HaynesGenre:DramaNotable cast:Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, Charles MeltonMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:86 Haynes’s darkly comedic, sleazy satire starsNatalie Portmanas an actress who becomes obsessed with the real-life figure she is about to play: a former teacher (Julianne Moore) who became a tabloid fixture for her sexual relationship with a teenage student (Charles Melton). As much as the film skewers tabloid culture (it’s loosely inspired by Mary Kay Letourneau), it’s also a darkly comedic look at performance and the lies we tell ourselves. In calling it one ofthe best films of 2023,Vanity Fairwrote, “May Decembercould probably be endlessly unpacked, so varied are its tones and textures and piercing insights.” Director:Noah BaumbachGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Elizabeth MarvelMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:80 Probably the most underrated and underseen of Baumbach’s films,The Meyerowitz Storiesfollows the disappointing adult children of an egotistical and self-aggrandizing sculptor (Hoffman). IfMeyerowitzsounds like a greatest hits of Baumbach’s frequent tropes—the lingering wounds left by parents on their children, unpleasant artists, New York City in-jokes—the result is nevertheless his most emotionally resonant film. Ashe toldVanity Fair,the writer-director also draws from his own personal story to tell this family saga—as he did with the Oscar-winningMarriage Story,another Netflix production. Sandler (no stranger to Netflix movies) offers up his career-best performance, as does Stiller. Director:Steven SoderberghGenre:CrimeNotable cast:George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl ReinerMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:83%Metacritic:74 Soderbergh’s caper remake remains an unmatched benchmark for fun times had through sheer glitzy star wattage. When it feels like bona fide movie stars are in short supply these days, we will always have theOcean’smovies, still fresh and zippy but also timeless. It’s guaranteed that when you watch it again, you’ll see at least one great performance that you’d forgotten about since you last saw it. (My money is always onElliot Gouldor Bernie Mac.) Even Vegas doesn’t look this glamorous anymore! Am I starting to sound like a ranting old codger? Anyway, watch this movie with your dad. Director:Lawrence LamontGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Keke Palmer, SZA, Lil Rel HoweryMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:71 Alreadyone ofVanity Fair’sfavorite films of 2025,One of Them Dayspairs multihyphenateKeke Palmerand music superstarSZAas two friends trying to escape eviction during a single, hijinx-filled day. Maybe it’s a cliché to say that we used to get comedies like this all the time, but this film still feels like an anomaly: an original comedy fueled by the charisma of its two stars, giving classic chemistry. With a slew of hilarious cameos,One of Them Daysfeels like the newest friendship comedy destined to be a comfort rewatch. Of new movies on Netflix, it’s the most can’t-miss. Director:Bong Joon-hoGenre:DramaNotable cast:Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-damMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:99%Metacritic:97 If you haven’t already seen the international sensation andfirst non-English-language winner of the best-picture Academy Award,what’s wrong with you? If you have, revisiting the film only confirms how right we all were to makesuch a big dealabout it in 2019. Director Bong’s tragicomic class satire isa modern-day classic, with a socially conscious point of view that has proven to be immediately influential. After Netflix made hits out of non-English-language fan favorites in both film (likeThe Platform) and television (heard ofSquid Game?), the “one-inch-tall barrier” of subtitles that Bong spoke about at the Oscars now findsParasiteright at home on the streamer. It’s always going to be a good time to rewatchParasite. Director:Jane CampionGenre:DramaNotable cast:Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Thomasin McKenzie, Keith Carradine, Frances ConroyMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:89 Campion’sbig-screen returnearned high praise for its psychologically intense study of masculinity in the American West. It’s never quite the movie you expect: In calling it one of 2021’s best films,Vanity FaircriticRichard Lawsonsaidthis “stately and mysterious film isn’t quite a character-study drama, not quite a thriller, and not really a Western. It is an elusive and mesmerizing thing unto itself.”An all-consuming visual experience,The Power of the Dogfeatures top-to-bottom outstanding performances from its cast, including Cumberbatch as one of the most terrifying movie villains of recent memory. It’s not just one of the best movies on Netflix right now: It’s one of the best movies ever. Director:Tamara JenkinsGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Paul Giamatti, Kathryn Hahn, Molly Shannon, John Carroll Lynch, Kayli Carter, Denis O’HareMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:83 In one of Netflix’s best movies and most overlooked masterworks, Hahn and Giamatti star as an infertile New York City couple, who, after several unsuccessful attempts at fertility treatment, consider surrogacy with their wayward niece (Carter). It’s only the third entry of writer-director Jenkins’s (flawless) filmography, but it’s maybe the best showcase ofher bittersweet comic pathosyet: There’s nude ranting, people shoving their feet in their mouths, and bits about overly specific lox portions. If the film’s final shot doesn’t heal whatever ails you, please consult your doctor. All that, plusa powder-keg, career-best performancefrom Hahn—before she would become a household name with her MCU debut as Agatha inWandaVision—makes this essential viewing. Director:Alfred HitchcockGenre:ThrillerNotable cast:Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera MilesMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:97 Cue the sharp violin strings! Netflix recently added a slew of Alfred Hitchcock films, includingVertigo,Rear Window, and this notorious game-changer thriller that made an entire generation afraid to go into the shower. You could take your pick among the offerings and be happy (but not if you watch theAnthony Hopkins–led biopic on the director!). However,Psychostill reigns supreme for its narrative nerve and ability to shock. It remains Hitchcock’s most iconic movie for a reason. It practically invented the plot twist, and there are even two of them! Netflix doesn’t often offer films from as far back asPsycho, so for folks looking more for film history, seize the opportunity while it lasts! Director:Sandi TanGenre:DocumentaryMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:99%Metacritic:88 When filmmaker Tan was a young adult, she participated in a production that would have been Singapore’s first road movie. But after filming, the footage and Tan’s eccentric producer disappeared. The resulting documentary charts Tan’s quest for the footage, bringing the footage back from the dead to make something entirely fascinating and deeply personal. This thoughtfully crafted production considers what was lost through the theft of the original film, both for Tan and for Singaporean film culture at large.Shirkersdelights both as a personal investigative documentary and as a uniquely film-obsessed story for movie lovers. Director:John CarneyGenre:MusicalNotable cast:Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor, Aidan GillenMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:79 Fans may remember Carney’s “Falling Slowly” heartbreaker,Once, and this follow-up stands up to that new-generation classic. His uplifting 1980s throwback is possibly the best new musical you haven’t seen yet, somewhat overlooked on its first release–trying to release a musical inthe same year asLa La Landis kind of a tough break. Following a teenage Dublin outcast with big music dreams, it has all the awkward teen drama trappings you expect but becomes something special purely from the buoyancy of its music. The songs ofSing Streetare so good—“Drive It Like You Stole It” is its earworm peak—that you won’t believe they are original, fitting in seamlessly with the film’s synth new-wave era. Director:Yance FordGenre:DocumentaryMPA rating:UnratedRotten Tomatoes:100%Metacritic:86 Ford tackles his own family history and the injustice of the legal system with this nonfiction stunner, a recounting of his brother’s 1992 murder and how the killer went free. Where other documentaries navel-gaze at the details of a murder,Strong Islandis more interested in the aftermath of the crime—how his brother’s killer going free shaped both his identity and his family’s. Ford approaches such personal subject matter with a sober and unflinching formal rigor, including some audacious moments where he directly addresses the camera. The result is a film that’s something of an antidote to the rise of the exploitativetrue crime documentary,a deeply intimate and searingly introspective portrait of a still-grieving family denied justice. Director:Yeon Sang-hoGenre:HorrorNotable cast:Gong Yoo, Jung Yu-mi, Ma Dong-seokMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:73 If you think you’ve seen it all from zombie movies, then you probably haven’t seen this South Korean cult favorite. The film is set in a Seoul train, where a zombie virus rapidly breaks out mid-ride and infects the passengers—to gory and skin-crawling results. But the movie isn’t just for gore-hounds; it’s pretty smart and emotionally affecting too. Even if some of the tropes seem familiar,Train to Busangets major audacity points in the full-throttle force of its thrills and its melodrama. Its ability to make you jump out of your skin even on rewatch more than earns the film’s impressive reputation: Rotten Tomatoesranksthe film as the third-best zombie movie of all time, right behindNight of the Living Dead. Director:John HughesGenre:ComedyNotable cast:John Candy, Amy Madigan, Jean Louisa Kelly, Macaulay Culkin, Gaby HoffmannMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:59%Metacritic:51 Comfort watching, you ask? There was never a better vehicle forthe charms of comedy legend John Candythan this John Hughes classic about a bachelor who watches over his brother’s kids. The last film of Hughes’s directorial 1980s hot streak,Uncle Buckwas unfairly critically dismissed in its day. But it stays a heartwarming favorite for how it set the template for family-friendly comedies about cute kids facing off with a guy who doesn’t have his shit together. Plus, Candy makes really, really big pancakes, which is and always has been the coolest. Director:Jordan PeeleGenre:HorrorNotable cast:Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, Tim HeideckerMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:81 In the unfortunate task of following up the cultural lightning rod ofGet Out, Peele was probably destined to producesomething divisive.But count me as firmly pro on this thriller about underground doppelgängers violently overthrowing the America above. It’s utterly terrifying in its visceral violence and the staggering dexterity of Nyong’o’s performance.Usis a heady exercise, but it thrillingly mires itself in themes perhaps even more timely than they were on release–as Peeletoldits first audience: “We are in a time where we fear the other... Maybe the evil is us. Maybe the monster that we’re looking at has our face.” Director:Alfonso CuarónGenre:DramaNotable cast:Maribel Verdú, Gael García Bernal, Diego LunaMPA rating:UnratedRotten Tomatoes:90%Metacritic:89 After a few financial misfires, directorAlfonso Cuaróncatapulted to global acclaim with this Mexican drama about two teenage friends (Bernal and Luna) who take a sexually charged road trip with an older woman (Verdú). Cuarón would be even more lauded for later flashier films, including Oscar-winning Netflix originalRoma, but perhaps none of them match the fiery spark of this breathtaking erotic drama. Blending explicit sex scenes with swoon-worthy visual beauty and evocative social commentary, the film hasn’t lost its ability to surprise in the more than 20 years since it arrived.",

    "title": "'King of the Hill' Actor Jonathan Joss Killed in Texas Shooting",
    "article_text": "Jonathan Joss, an actor of Apache and Comanche descent best known for voicing John Redcorn on the long-running animated television seriesKing of the Hill,died in a shooting in San Antonio, Texas on Sunday. He was 59. According toa statement posted on Joss’s Facebook pageby his husband,Tristan Kern de Gonzales,Joss’s death was the result of a homophobic hate crime. In the post, which now has over 17,000 reactions, Gonzales writes that he and Joss were “involved in a shooting while checking the mail at the site of our former home,” a house he alleges was burned down over two years ago by “individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship” via continued threats and harassment. Gonzales says that he and Joss reported those to law enforcement to no avail. When Gonzales and Joss arrived at the site of their former home, they allegedly “discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view,” wrote Gonzales. Per Gonzales, this caused both parties “severe emotional distress,” and they both began yelling and crying as a result. At this time, Gonzales alleges that a man approached them and began yelling “violent homophobic insults” at himself and Joss, before raising his gun and taking fire. According to Gonzales, neither of them had weapons, and Joss pushed him out of the way when the gunfire began. “He saved my life,” wrote Gonzalez. “He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.” Authorities in San Antonio, meanwhile, have released a statement saying that they’ve found no evidence that Joss’s death was the result of a homophobic hate crime. “Despite online claims of this being a hate crime, currently the investigation has found no evidence to indicate that the Mr Joss’s murder was related to his sexual orientation,” they wrote. PerVariety,San Antonio police officers arrived at the scene of the crime on Sunday evening at 7 p.m. after receiving a report of a shooting in progress. There, they reportedly found Joss near the road after he was shot multiple times. Joss was pronounced dead at the scene. According toTMZ, which first broke the story, the shooter was reportedly a neighbor of Joss’s, and fled the scene in a vehicle only to be detained by officers a block away. A suspect,Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, has been arrested and charged with murder. According toTMZ,he was held in custody on a $200,000 bond. Joss voiced John Redcorn from 1997 to 2009 on the animated sitcomKing of the Hill.He took over the guest role from original actor Victor Aaron after Aaron died in a car accident in 1996. Joss had already recorded dialogue for the forthcomingKing of the Hillrevival series, which is set to premiere on Hulu on August 4. His last public appearance was on Friday, attending aKing of the Hillpanel at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas. Joss was there as an audience member; he apparently was not invited to participate on the panel, which disappointed him, according to a post he wroteon Facebook. “This show was a part of my life for many years,” Joss wrote on April 21. “That character, that voice, that story…they were my home, my pride, my connection to something bigger than myself. To not be invited felt like being shut out of a place I helped build.” On April 29,Joss wrote another Facebook postthat said Disney had eventually reached out to him, explaining that the panel would be focused on series regulars. “I truly appreciate them taking the time to reach out to me personally,” he wrote. “It means a lot.”PerVariety,Joss approached an audience microphone at the panel, where he expressed disappointment about not being invited to participate; he also shared that he had lost his San Antonio home to a fire. King of the HillcreatorsMike Judge,Greg Daniels,andSaladin Pattersonreleased the following statement after Joss’s death: “Jonathan Joss broughtKing of the Hill’s John Redcorn to life for over a dozen seasons, including in the upcoming revival. His voice will be missed atKing of the Hill,and we extend our deepest condolences to Jonathan’s friends and family.” Joss could be seen in many well-loved TV shows and films, including the NBC sitcomParks and Recreation,in which he played the recurring character Chief Ken Hotate.Parks and RecreationstarNick Offermanpaid tribute to Joss in a statement toPeople: “The cast has been texting together about it all day and we’re just heartbroken,” said Offerman. “Jonathan was such a sweet guy and we loved having him as our Chief Ken Hotate. A terrible tragedy.” Some of Joss’s other credits includeTulsa King,Ray Donovan,True Grit,andThe Magnificent Seven. Joss is survived by his husband, Tristan de Kern Gonzales, whom he married on Valentine’s Day 2025. “Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built,” wrote Gonzales on Joss’s Facebook. “We had so many beautiful plans for the future.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Parker Posey Thanks White Lotus Creator Mike White for “Believing In a Legend”—Herself—at Gotham TV Awards",
    "article_text": "Just as the energy in the room began to dip,Parker Posey’s distinctive Southern drawl woke up the Gotham TV Awards. HerWhite Lotusseason threecastmatesLeslie BibbandSam Rockwell—a real-life couple—were there Monday night to present Posey with the Legend Tribute, introducing a supercut of her character’s most quotable line readings, including “Piper, no!” and “tsunami.” Then Posey, wearing pink-tinted sunglasses and lace gloves, took the stage. “You know what this award says to me, which makes me so happy?” she began. “To those out there in the internet world who made things on YouTube, who put things on social media, who imitated me, who had fun in the backyard, who made art—whether it was good or bad, they entertained each other and themselves.” Posey then riffed on the name of the award itself while honoringWhite Lotus’s creative engine. “Thank you,Mike White,for writing this character for me. For believing in a middle-aged woman and believing in a legend,” she said to laughter from the audience. “Thank you, HBO, for believing in a legend!” Vanity Fair,an official partner of the Gotham Awards, was on the scene at Cipriani Wall Street to watch as buzzy new shows likeThe PittandThe Studiopicked up their first major wins for breakthrough drama and comedy series, respectively.The Pitt’sNoah Wyle—a hot commodity in the Gotham ballroom—called his series a “love letter to our first responders,” whileThe StudiococreatorEvan Goldbergmade sure tothank Apple TV+’s executivesright away. But a Netflix limited series from the UK owned the evening (at last year’s inaugural ceremony, a series of a similar pedigree,Baby Reindeer,began its pathtoward Emmy glory). That would beAdolescence,the breakout crime drama about a 13-year-old boy who gets charged with murder. The show won breakthrough limited series, as well as lead performance in a limited series forStephen Grahamand supporting performance for15-year-oldOwen Cooper. Cooper tied in his category withDying for Sex’sJenny Slate,who was visibly emotional as she received her first major awards recognition. After thanking the real-lifeNikki Boyer,whom she plays in the series aboutMolly Kochan’s cancer journey, Slate spoke about her own trajectory. “I’ve always wanted to be a performer. And I’m so glad for this chance because, at 43, and especially after having a baby, feeling like I hadn’t even really started what I wished I could be doing—these people gave me a huge chance,” she said. Some of their fellow winners, likeMatlock’sKathy BatesandBlack Doves’Ben Whishaw,were not in attendance—leading presenterMartine Gutierrezto make a joke that really landed in the room: “A lot of people are out of town.” But the Gotham Film & Media Institute also presented multiple career achievement awards to people actually in the building.Gilmore GirlsalumKelly Bishopcycled through multiple pairs of reading glasses to deliver the Gotham TV Awards Creator Tribute toÉtoile’sAmy Sherman-PalladinoandDaniel Palladino,who joked that they can’t split up either professionally or personally because of “gambling debts.” Elisabeth Mossand her fellow actors fromThe Handmaid’s Taleaccepted the inaugural Gotham TV Awards Ensemble Tribute, with the series having recently wrapped its six-season run on Hulu. TV mogulDavid E. Kelley,ofBig Little LiesandAlly McBealfame, received the Visionary Tribute, whileDope Thief’sBrian Tyree Henry,honored with the Performer Tribute, made a convincing bid for himself as a future awards show host. “I want to apologize to the sign interpreter right now, ’cause I’m gonna to say a lot of things that I just want to see you sign,” he said, eyeing the side of the stage. “Like ‘pussybow,’ ‘Skims,’ and ‘circumcision.’” Abbott Elementary’sSheryl Lee Ralphbrought the house down with the night’s lone standing ovation. While accepting the Sidney Poitier Icon Tribute from the Oscar winner’s daughterPamela,Ralph recalled being directed by Poitier himself in her first film, 1977’sA Piece of the Action.“Mr. Poitier looked at me and he said, ‘Sheryl Lee Ralph, I expect great things from you,’” she began. “And when we finished shooting the film, he looked at me again and he said, ‘I am sorry this industry has nothing more to offer you, because you deserve it.’ But even in his apology, he gave me something powerful. Mr. Poitier gave me a mirror of what greatness looked like. He gave me the blueprint, and he gave me permission to rise anyway.” Ralph later added, “I have worked. I have endured. I have overcome. And I never gave up. I kept going because Sidney Poitier believed in me.” But perhaps the most resonant moment of the evening came fromSquid GamecreatorHwang Dong-hyuk,who also received the Creator Tribute and began his speech by thanking everyone who had once rejected the now beloved show—arguing that it could have only been made here and now by Netflix. “This trophy is not quite fancy or shiny compared to other trophies, like the Emmys or Oscars,” Hwang said, gesturing to the Gothams’ modest slate gray monolith. Lest anyone think him ungrateful, he then turned that critique into a moving sentiment: “I think they’re trying to tell people not to be blinded by the glamour of your successful achievements, but to carry the weight of the responsibilities that come with this trophy as you move on to the next. And I’ll keep that in mind.” Here’s the full list of winners at the second annual Gotham TV Awards: Breakthrough Comedy Series:The Studio Breakthrough Drama Series:The Pitt Breakthrough Limited Series:Adolescence Breakthrough Nonfiction Series:Social Studies Outstanding Lead Performance in a Comedy Series:Julio Torres,Fantasmas Outstanding Lead Performance in a Drama Series:Kathy Bates,Matlock Outstanding Lead Performance in a Limited Series:Stephen Graham,Adolescence Outstanding Supporting Performance in a Comedy Series:Poorna Jagannathan,Deli Boys Outstanding Supporting Performance in a Drama Series:Ben Whishaw,Black Doves Outstanding Supporting Performance in a Limited Series:Owen Cooper,Adolescence,and Jenny Slate,Dying for Sex Outstanding Original Film, Broadcast or Streaming:Pee-wee as Himself Outstanding Performance in an Original Film:Aaron Pierre,Rebel Ridge The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Tribeca Goes All In With Docs On Gloria Steinem, Barbara Walters, and Andy Kaufman",
    "article_text": "Since the pandemic, film festivals have struggled in a landscape where fewer films receive theatrical distribution and streamers have scaled back their spending on acquisitions. In 2021, Tribeca chose to move its festival from April to June—helping distance the event from both Sundance, where so many independent films premiere, and Cannes, the industry’s preeminent auteur-driven festival. This year, Tribeca differentiates itself by offering one of the most robust documentary slates of any festival. With 59 feature documentaries premiering at the festival, including six HBO documentary premieres alone, Tribeca is proving to be a critical home for the genre. The timing feels particularly significant given A24’srecent announcementthat it would be closing its documentary division. “The documentary community is so heavily represented in New York,” says festival director and SVP of programmingCara Cusumano.“It helps to be the hometown festival for a lot of these great filmmakers.” The festival received over 13,000 submissions this year, with attendance estimated at around 150,000, making it “the largest film festival in North America,” according to Cusumano. Many of the docs premiering at the festival center on stories of identity and resilience.Just Kids,a documentary about the bans on gender-affirming care for children in states such as South Carolina and Texas, follows three families with trans children struggling to live their authentic lives in a hyper-political climate, while the government issues increasingly restrictive measures for their healthcare. “These kids are being used as political pawns,” says directorGianna Toboni.“I wanted to remind people from the very beginning that these are just kids. These kids deserve to have a childhood and deserve their innocence for as long as any other kid. And that’s not what’s happening.” The children in the documentary are notably apolitical—something Toboni intentionally sought out when choosing her subjects. “None of these characters are activists. None of them are coastal elites with an agenda,” she says. “These are just real Americans trying to live their lives.” The documentary is seeking distribution, which could prove challenging given the current administration’s polarizing stance on this issue. Feminist icons get a focus at this year’s festival, with documentaries centered onGloria Steinem,Barbara Walters, andAllyson Felix.HBO'sDear Ms.: A Revolution in Print,which will air this summer, chronicles the creation of Steinem’sMs.magazine, launched in 1972. The documentary takes a hard look at the topics the magazine covered, from abortion to pornography, and questions how the publication dealt with race in the feminist movement. It interviews almost all the former editors ofMs.,who are candid about what they got right and wrong. After watching the doc, Steinem “learned that the influence of our small group atMs.magazine would be far greater than we knew at the time,” she says. Tell Me Everythingchronicles the career of Barbara Walters. From the moment she started at NBC News at age 24, Walters was a force to be reckoned with. The documentary covers considerable ground in an hour and a half and even manages to have Walters narrate it posthumously by splicing together audio from old interviews. “She is this feminist icon,” says directorJackie Jesko.“But at the same time, she’s not Gloria Steinem, right? She says it herself: She wasn’t doing this for all women. I appreciate that honesty. She wasn’t doing it for all women, but that doesn’t negate the fact that she did shatter every possible glass ceiling.” The documentary illustrates just how hard Walters fought to be taken seriously, despite being wildly successful and tenacious. The film premieres on Hulu on June 23. Emmy-winning duoPerri PeltzandMatthew O'Neillare coming to the festival with their documentaryShe Runs The World,centered on the most decorated track and field athlete of all time, Allyson Felix. Felix made headlines when she revealed that Nike was trying to cut her endorsement deal by 70%, shortly after she announced her pregnancy. Felix was able to get Nike to walk back those cuts—but only for her. Instead of taking the deal, she decided to go public, revealing the unequal way male and female athletes are treated when they become parents. Herop-edinTheNew York Timesexposed a major issue within the sports industry regarding maternal protections. Felix’s story resonates with many working women, including director Peltz. “Back when I was getting pregnant, I was constantly trying to keep it a secret because you don’t want people to penalize you. In my case, I was in the news business, and you didn’t want to be cut out of doing certain stories or being sidelined in some way,” says Peltz. The documentary countsTory BurchandTonya Lewis Leeas producers. Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore,which opens in theaters June 20, screens at the festival after a successful premiere at Sundance. The film covers all aspects ofMarlee Matlin’s life, including her relationship with William Hurt, in which Matlin alleges she was the victim of domestic abuse. Hurt, who died in 2022, responded to these allegations in 2009 when Matlin released her autobiography: “My own recollection is that we both apologized and both did a great deal to heal our lives.” In the documentary, we learn that the term “domestic violence” was not something Matlin knew existed until she entered the Betty Ford Clinic. “I had to be told what I experienced had a name and that I wasn’t the only one who experienced it,” Matlin says. “While hearing people have the benefit of hearing conversations and learning about things like domestic violence, I have to make an extra effort and actively seek out what I am missing by not being able to overhear conversations.” Clay Tweel’sAndy Kaufman Is Meshowcases unreleased audio recordings of Kaufman speaking with his colleagues and girlfriend on the phone and in meetings. These recordings, released by Kaufman’s siblings, aim to reveal a more authentic side of the comedian and offer insight into how he developed some of his most famous characters and bits. Tweel revealed he sifted through 84 hours of recordings—meaning nearly that much was left on the cutting room floor for the 90-minute documentary. “I think the narrative around Andy is that he got so lost in these characters that there was no center to him,” Tweel says. “I think that there was a real, grounded person in there. And these tapes allow you to hear that person.” The film is produced byDwayne Johnson’s production company andDavid Letterman,which should help propel the documentary to a sale once it premieres at the festival. Mariska Hargitay’s documentary about her mother, Jayne Mansfield, recently premiered at Cannes and will also screen at Tribeca ahead of its June 27 premiere on HBO and HBO Max. The documentary includes asignificant revelationabout Hargitay’s biological father, while examining her relationship to her mother’s place in American iconography. “I don’t care about fame. I care about being good,” says Hargitay. “When I look at my mother now, and I think of what she accomplished in the 1950s—different than any other woman with five children. She was the breadwinner. She was a movie star, sexy, gorgeous. I do have this icon of a person, that’s my mom. And somehow that’s normal.” What all these filmmakers can agree on is the importance of having a festival like Tribeca showcase their work to an audience of movie-lovers and industry professionals. “I love watching the audience burst out in laughter or applause in unison after reading captions rather than hearing the spoken words, the way that deaf people do when they watch a sound-based film,” saysShoshannah Stern,director of the Matlin documentary. “I’ve been making documentaries for 20 years now, and I’m somebody who loves film festivals,” says Tweel. “For artists to be able to come together and see each other’s work, and as a marketplace for buyers to feel the energy of sitting down in a theater and watching these movies—it’s still incredibly important.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Owen Thiele Is TV’s No. 1 “Nepo Friend”",
    "article_text": "“I famously don’t sleep. I sleep two hours a night,” saysOwen Thiele.The 28-year-old scene-stealer is being serious. Sort of. “It sounds like I’m a vampire,” he says, starting to riff. “I actually can’t be out in the day. I need to be invited into a home.” Yet somehow, Thiele is wide awake when I greet him at the Plaza Hotel one afternoon in late April, ready to sip tea while spilling tea about his breakout year. But first, Thiele has another confession: “Can I be honest? I can’t read,” he jokes after receiving an overwhelmingly long menu. We settle on the Palm Court restaurant’s signature sandwich and savory tower, which comes with specific instructions that it is designed to be eaten frombottom to top.“Eloise must have been scared,” Thiele says. “I didn’t know it was a horror movie.” He seems to be living in his very own cringe comedy. But Thiele’s also making waves in a fictional series, ascending from bit parts inTim Robinson’sI Think You Should Leaveand HBO Max’sHacksto a supporting turn in Prime Video’sOvercompensatingand a starring role in theNick Kroll–produced FX ensemble comedyAdults.“I’m so lucky that some of my friends are making movies now,” he says. “I’m like, ‘Is there a role for me? There’s going to be a role for me. You’re writing me in. That straight white man is now going to be a Black gay guy.’” Owen Thiele inOvercompensating. “I got so spoiled that my first movie was with an ensemble of my dreams and all of my friends too,” says Thiele. That movie, the critically acclaimed 2023 mockumentaryTheater Camp,was codirected by and starred his best friend,The Bear’sMolly Gordon;and included her old pal, Tony-winnerBen Platt; Platt’s now husband,Noah Galvin; and Gordon’sThe BearcostarAyo Edebiri,among others. Thiele made the most of his miniscule screen time as a theater camp costume department head named Gigi Charbonier who, according toVulture, got“most of the best lines”in the film. “Theater Campwas home for me,” he says. “We were just making bad theater with your friends, which I was very used to doing.” Thiele grew up in Los Angeles, and he knows Gordon from Crossroads, the prestigious private school they both attended. (Other notable alumni includeGwyneth Paltrow, Jonah Hill,andMaude Apatow.) “We had this class called ‘life skills,’ where you would go around in a semicircle and just talk about your day. It was therapy class,” he says. “Sometimes people would choose to confront other people in the class. It got messy.” He was also in the actual drama club—which was called “conservatory” and lasted all day in Thiele’s telling. “Conservatory was a small group who would put on plays from lunchtime until 8:00 p.m.” I point out that his experience makes Crossroads sound like the West Coast version of New York’s famous LaGuardia High School for the performing arts. “Yes, and it worked better forTimmy Chalamet,” he replies. Born in Houston, Texas, Thiele was adopted as a baby by his parents, music producerBob Thiele Jr. andAmy Kanter.“I was adopted into a white Jewish family, and then I went to a school called Center for Early Education, and then Crossroads. Very white spaces,” he says. As a child, it took Thiele a long time to realize his situation was out of the ordinary. “It was just my childhood,” he says. “Because my parents were white, I was like,‘Oh, this is normal.’” That changed as time went on. “You grow up and you start reading things. You meet other people who look like you. And you’re like, ‘Wait, you don’t look like any of my family,’” he says. Coming to terms with being the only Black person in his family was strange, but also not always uncomfortable, Thiele says. “I was like, ‘Oh, in this white space, I’ve actually never felt different,’ which is so rare,” he adds. “Most people would hear that and be like, ‘What the actual hell is going on?’” But for Thiele, the answer is quite simple: He loves his parents. “I am their kid, and we’re family,” he says. “I never felt different in my family, which is a beautiful thing.” Thiele doesn’t currently have a relationship with his birth parents, but he knows he could reach out to them if he wanted to. “I just haven’t chosen to yet,” he says. “I have birth siblings that I don’t know, and I’m too afraid to reach out.” Which may not have stopped his siblings from contacting him. “The other day I got a DM saying, ‘I’m your brother,’” he shares. “Can you imagine?” The DM rocked Thiele so much he dropped his phone on the floor. But rather than engaging, Thiele left the DM alone. “I didn’t answer because it’s like, Is this a prank?,” he says. “IfCynthia Erivocame out and said she was adopted, her DMs would be flooded with, ‘I am your brother.’ But for me, nobody knows me like that. So I’m like, ‘It actually might be.’” Thiele will be exploring his idiosyncratic family dynamic in a semi-autobiographical television series calledOff-Color,currently being developed for Amazon. “Once I have something out about my adoption, I do feel like it’s probably right, for both parties, for me to reach out” to his birth relatives, he says. Until then, his mother already has a few ideas about who should play her on the series. “She, of course, picks the most beautiful women on earth to play her,” Thiele says. “Julianne Moore, Anne Hathaway, Margot Robbie.I’m like ‘Mom, you’re 65.’” He did, however, find someone that pleases all parties involved:Curb Your EnthusiasmstarSusie Essman.Broad CitystarIlana Glazeris also on board as an executive producer and to play Thiele’s cousin. “The saying is, “Don’t meet your heroes. Except for Ilana Glazer,” he says. “I’m actually not kidding.” Thiele’s dad has proved trickiest to cast. “My dad is very specific,” he said. “He’s a musician with long hair. He wears hats and goes to Coachella at age 65.” For good reason: Bob Thiele Jr. is a three-time Emmy nominated music producer who’s worked for TV series likeThe OfficeandSons of Anarchyand has collaborated with music icons likeBette Midlerand Ray Charles. He’s also the son of Bob Thiele, a prolific American record producer who cowrote “What A Wonderful World” for Louis Armstrong. Given those bona fides, the phrase “nepo baby” has been lobbed in Thiele’s direction. He politely disagrees with the categorization. “I love my father so much, and he is so talented and has done so much in his life,” he says. “I would be honored to be called a ‘nepo baby,’ because it would mean that my dad is that successful. But I don’t know if I am that.” Nevertheless, Thiele’s well aware of the benefits that come with his privileged upbringing. “I do think I was very lucky to grow up in LA and go to these schools where we met a lot of connected people and people in the business.” Thiele’s got another term for it. “I joke and I say that I’m a nepo friend,” he says. Anyone familiar with Thiele’s podcast—In Your Dreams,hosted onAlex Cooper’s Unwell Network—has heard him use this phrase before. Here, he makes another case for its legitimacy. “My friends all have projects or parents who are in the business. I’m very lucky.” In fact, he argues, being a nepo friend may be more fraught than being an actual nepo baby. “It’s scarier to text your friend to be like, ‘Put me in this.’ Your dad is your father, and he owes you that. Your friends don’t owe you shit.” It’s a risk that Thiele has been willing to take. That’s how he was cast inTheater Camp,for starters. “I think they would say that they already had me in mind,” he says. “But I think they had me in mind because I said, ‘You should have me in mind.’” Thiele and Amrita Rao inAdults. Thiele actually didn’t know anyone involved inAdultswhen he was cast on the series as Anton, who’s so effortlessly charming that he befriends literal subway stabbers. He and costarsMalik Elassal, Lucy Freyer, Jack Innanen,andAmita Raohad to form bonds strong enough to believably carry the premise of the show, a Gen Z riff on hangout sitcoms likeFriends.And they did. “I hate to say this because it’s so cheesy, and I was just making fun of people who say this in the press, and I’m going to say it now,” he says. “We are actually family.” He interrupts my eye roll. “ I’m not kidding. You watch some people say that during press and you’re like, You guys hate each other. That is not this at all. We could not be closer.” He credits that closeness to FX, which gave the group three weeks to simply get to know each other before production began in Toronto. While team bonding was crucial, Thiele also went out of his way to get one-on-one time with each ensemble member. “I was like, ‘I need to know you individually. I’m stealing you for a chat,’” he recalls. “I was onThe Bachelor.I choose them all. I give them all fucking roses. I’m having an orgy.” The college–coming out comedyOvercompensatingwas coincidentally also shot in Toronto. In it, Thiele plays George, a member of the GSA who sniffs out that closeted Benny (Benito Skinner)might not be who he says he is. “We went to frats, real frats that smelled so bad,” says Thiele. “They reeked of BO and cheers and beer. It was disgusting.” In truth, college was never for Thiele. He spent two weeks at NYU before dropping out and moving back in with his parents, while trying to book acting roles and get writing projects off the ground. “It was really stressful. I was so lucky that I had them, because I could live at home,” he says. “But it was so embarrassing to drop out. Your friends had different stakes: They needed to make sure they aced this test. And I was in the real world, so I was like, ‘I need a job.’” Now that he’s gainfully employed, playing the sort of queer Black characters that simply didn’t exist in the industry when he was growing up. “I think the only person who sort of looked like me—and she wasn’t gay yet or queer yet—isRaven-SymonéinThat's So Raven.She did a lot for the gays, the Blacks. And honestly the psychics,” he jokes. “Other than that, I didn’t really have anybody to look up to. Now of course, thank God, you haveColman Domingo...Pose…You have other people who really do represent us.” It’s this visibility that allowed him to show up to theAdultsset and simply be himself. “It didn’t feel scary to do, because it felt like I was playing a version of myself. I could just tap into what I know best,” he says. “That was also on the creatorsBen [Kronengold]andRebecca [Shaw]to be like, “No, we want you to bringyouto the role.” As his career blossoms, there’s no role Thiele isn’t willing to take. “I said to my friends, I was like, ‘Typecast me. Do whatever you need to do. I will do anything,’” he says. But he’s also happy that his roles inOvercompensatingandAdultsdon’t feel reductive or stereotypical. “InOvercompensating, I’m not in it that much, but the moments I am in really do mean something to Benny’s character. I’m actually seeing him in a beautiful way, whereas a lot of the other people in the show aren’t,” he says. “InAdults,it’s a role that I could really sink my teeth into, and it doesn’t feel like a best friend.” And while he isn’t much of a sleeper, Thiele’s got big dreams. “I just want to act in great things with my friends, and write great material for my friends. That’s what I want today.” But, like Eloise at the Plaza, Thiele’s also got an unpredictable streak—so that’s all subject to change. “Tomorrow, I could want to be an astronaut,” he says with a smirk. “And probably that will happen.” The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

    "title": "Amal Clooney Thinks George Clooney’s Dyed Hair Is Hilarious",
    "article_text": "Brown is notGeorge Clooney’s color. And his wife, British Lebanese lawyerAmal Clooney,doesn’t disagree. The actor, who’s currently playing the legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow in the Broadway playGood Night, and Good Luck,had to darken his hair to match the character. As a result, the 63-year-old Oscar winner is now sporting pronounced brown locks, far from his natural gray hair color—though the look is temporary, as the show will close right before the Tony Awards this weekend. During his appearance onLate Night With Seth Meyerson Monday, Clooney revealed that Amal is already looking forward to the dye fading. “She thinks it’s funny. She’ll be glad when it’s gone,” he told Meyers. At least the couple approached his new look with a great deal of humor. “I’m not used to it. You never get used to it,” he confided in an interview withCBS Morningsin April. “Listen, I started getting gray when I was 25, so I’ve been gray most of my life. So it’s not my favorite look, and my wife, she thinks it’s funny.” The couple aren’t the only ones laughing about Clooney’sGood Night, and Good Lucklook. Their twins,AlexanderandElla,also reacted to the dye job by bursting into laughter. “They laugh at it because, honestly, nothing makes you look older than being 63 and dying your hair,” he toldGayle King.Parisian hairstylistBrice Goliardconfirms that: “From a certain age, especially when the first white hairs appear, men should avoid dying their hair. If the aim is to look younger, the opposite is often the case. It’s not very elegant, and not very natural.” Amal’s husband may not be a unanimous favorite at home with his darker hair, but he has been widely praised for his performances onstage. The Broadway production, which premiered at New York’s Winter Garden Theatre on April 3, earned five Tony nominations, including a best-actor nod for Clooney. Original story inVFFrance.",

And keep scrolling right here for the eclectic favorites we’ve recently read and loved, includingStephen King’s latest, and an essay collection that takes on the quagmire of writing and AI. Happy reading. —Keziah Weir, Senior Editor ‘Never Flinch’ by Stephen King Amazon Bookshop King fires off two disparate storylines in this thriller that soar to ever higher levels of tension before weaving together and detonating in a real narrative fireworks show. The central figure is his new favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who first appeared in his 2014 bookMr. Mercedes. Meek, obsessive, and something of a lonelyheart, she has toughened up considerably since her introduction a decade ago, but remains forever underestimated by those perpetrating the malfeasance around her. Most detectives in these kinds of tales have a bulletproof ego, but Holly’s vulnerability endures even when she shifts intoKolchak, The Night Stalkermode to tackle a case with supernatural edges, like 2018’sThe Outsideror 2020’sIf It Bleeds.Never Flinch, like 2023’sHolly, features villains drawn more from reality than fantasy. One narrative thread follows Holly as she takes on a security job for a feminist offer who is targeted by violent opponents. The other concerns a serial killer named Trig who finds fame and meaning as an avenging angel, killing random strangers as a vendetta against society for a wrongly convicted man who died in prison. He’s being hunted by Det. Izzy Jaynes, a longtime rival of Holly’s, although the relationship is thawing now.Never Flinchis more than just a stop-the-madman page-turner, it’s an exploration of how some people attempt to rationalize their own harm and anti-social behavior by masking it as “justice.” (2025, Scribner) —Anthony Breznican, Hollywood Correspondent ‘The Loves of My Life: A Sex Memoir’ by Edmund White Amazon Bookshop Edmund White has never shied from writing about sex—thank God. InThe Loves of My Life, the 85-year-old writer and recipient of the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters returns with a greatest-hits package of former flings and late-night assignations, largely between the Stonewall riots and the early days of the HIV crisis. White’s New York was of cheap rent and poppers—and falling in love, he tells us, was his natural bent. I picture him walking out to greet the mailman and dropping to his knees. Thus endless, delicious bed-hopping. But the memoir-in-essays isn’t just a wild romp; White lived through both the ecstatic highs and inhumane denial of queer desire across half a century, and his exhaustion seeps through the prose in his constant obsession with bodies he pines for. Oh how they amuse, betray, delight, and deprive. Passion never becomes familial to White—he isn’t a master of sex but a captive to it—which elevates the droll, randy volume to a narrative of a life spent longing. I read it on the subway, blushing and delighted, reminded that lust can be archival. I looked up to notice the way skin sagged off the forearm of the woman next to me, and how a man’s mouth hung agape as he scrolled. I felt like I’d never had sex before, like I didn’t even know its nature. And I was ravenous. I missed my stop. (2025, Bloomsbury Publishing) —Logan Davis, Fact Checker ‘Melting Point’ by Rachel Cockerell Amazon Bookshop Prior to the Holocaust, the collective memory of Jewish immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe was permeated with deadly scenes of anti-semitic programs. Like the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, 400 years earlier, it sent a diasporic wave of Jews outward; this time heading west rather than east. The movement to establish a Jewish homeland, was born in the wake of this persecution. In its early years, it was not at all a settled question that this homeland would be in Palestine.Melting Point, Rachel Cockerell’s extraordinary family memoir tells the story of the Galveston Movement, a long-forgotten plan to establish a Jewish state in Texas. Two men persuading people to head to the middle of America, rather than New York, were the author’s great-grandfather, David Jochjelmann and his friend Israel Zangwill. Constructed in a highly inventive style, Cockerell has created a montage of archival fragments, some just a sentence of two, some a few pages. The resulting polyphony of voices–newspaper articles, letters, diaries, interviews–allows the reader to watch events unfold in real time, from the ground up, rather than as recollection. In doing so, it asks us to consider how historical forces-migration, persecution, war-shape our sense of identity and belonging, and what we retrain from the past as we move forward into the future. (2025, Farrar, Straus and Giroux) —Eric Miles, Visuals Editor ‘Physique’ by Vince Aletti Amazon MACK The first time Vince Aletti, photography critic forThe New Yorker, encountered a ‘physique’ photograph, at the age of eight or nine, he remembers being both excited and upset by the sight. Two mostly nude teenage boys were posed together for a photograph titled “Victor and Vanquished.” It was the 1950s, a time when the criminalization of homosexuality made any encounter with its evidence hypercharged with shame and piquant desire. Aletti recalls, “Both boys were smiling, exhilarated, but I was fixated on their points of contact, especially where the naked groin of the Vanquished touched the Victor’s bare shoulder. What did that feel like? What could that feel like?” Questions like those, along witha lifetime dedication to collecting numerous forms of visual ephemera, have driven Aletti’s fascination with physique photos. These images appeared in pocket-sized magazines with titles likeAdonis,Body Beautiful, andTomorrow’s Manbetween the 1930s and 1970s. On the surface, they were aimed at a heterosexual audience focused on fitness and a hypermasculine ideal. In reality, Greek god-like men posing as robust outdoorsmen or valiant sailors drew a significant gay male readership by balancing “discretion and seduction, subtlety and audacity,” says Aletti. Now, in the format of an art book, he casts an historical eye on a remarkable era of image making, highlighting a time when legal and societal restrictions resulted in thousands of heavily coded, well-appreciated photographs. It’s this push and pull, the paradox of hiding homoerotic images in plain sight, that makes an archive of physique photographs and Aletti’s attention to it so compelling. (MACK, June 2025) —Madison Reid, Associate Visuals Editor ‘Searches: Selfhood in the Digital Age’ by Vauhini Vara Amazon Bookshop While I was reporting on theclass action lawsuit against Meta AI, the authorCarmen Maria Machadorecommended I take a look atVauhini Vara’s new book,Searches. It’s a mesmerizing memoir-in-essays that charts Vara’s relationship with the digital world, from meeting a chatroom stranger in eighth grade, to an endearing near-miss of a connection with the man who would become her husband thanks to the then-new and confusing technology of cell phone text messages, to an investigation of her reliance on Amazon in the form of Amazon reviews, to what she describes as her illicit attraction to crafting a short story in collaboration with an early version of ChatGPT, called GPT-3. Included in the book—and, in many ways, its beating heart—isan essay that Vara published inThe Believerin 2021, which she co-authored with GPT-3, about her sister’s death from cancer when Vara was in her late teens and her sister in her early twenties. In each section, Vara fed her own writing about her sister into the bot, and the bot spit out a continuation, full of make-believe. The essay was a “provocation,” she writes later in the book, intended to “bring attention to a promise I imagined AI companies might make in the future—that they could help us tell our own stories—and then demonstrate that promise getting uncannily close to coming true while ultimately being broken. At the same time, I wanted to demonstrate my own complicity in taking the bait in the first place.” (2025, Pantheon) —KW ‘Versailles’ by Kathryn Davis Amazon Bookshop I read this in Paris late last year while on creative leave fromVF. I’d planned to visit Versailles for the first time (I never got inside the palace: “It is a strike, this is France,” I overheard agardien de la paixtelling one disappointed tourist) and had teed up some cultural preparation, includingSofia Coppola’sMarie Antoinette, obviously, andKathryn Davis’ novel, which turned out to be so much more bizarre and excellent than I could have imagined. I was thinking about it again recently, after speaking with the art historianRobert Wellingtonabout the gold interiors ofDonald Trump’s oval office makeover. Originally published in 2002, the novel is narrated by the fourteen year old future queen of France—which awakened a sense memory, decades old, of readingKathryn Lasky’s Scholastic classicThe Royal Diaries: Marie Antoinette(2000)—as she (along with her immortal soul) makes her way to court, meets her husband the Dauphin, and becomes subsumed in Versailles. “Boring boring boring,” she thinks of courtly drama. “Could it be any more boring, aside from the people themselves, or the way I felt myself slipping between events like a goldfish between lily roots?” For readers, Davis makes it anything but. We all know that the story leads to the guillotine, but the road there is a lapidary meandering through surrealist sets, diamonds and love affairs, pearls of wisdom rolling like the eyes in Antoinette’s little pug’s head.

    "title": "First Look: Colin Farrell Falls for Margot Robbie in 'A Big Bold Beautiful Journey'",
    "article_text": "Colin FarrellandMargot Robbiewere both looking for some magic. Each of them had recently made the biggest projects of their careers.Robbie’s wasBarbie,the $1.4 billion blockbuster hit that earned eight Oscar nominations. Farrell’s wasThe Penguin,the gritty HBO series in which he transformed (with about three hours a day of prosthetics and makeup) into Gotham City’s infamous villain. They followed up those two iconic characters withA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,an original romance about two strangers taken on an unexpected journey. “Going fromThe Penguinto this was quite simply stepping from the darkness into the light,” Farrell tellsVanity Fair.“As amazing as it was to work onThe Penguin,that story was all about trauma and its various articulations and calcifications. This film is all about letting go of trauma—moving past it.” Though Robbie had produced other projects in the interim, she hadn’t stepped in front of a camera since makingBarbiein 2022. “I think that’s the longest break I’ve ever had between jobs. I thought it would be more scary to be walking onto theBig Boldset on day one, but it wasn’t,” she says. “Everything about this film was immediately comfortable.” That comfort came from the story—and from directorKogonada,who was also looking to go on a big journey with his next movie. After two critically acclaimed projects—2017’sColumbusand 2021’sAfter Yang—and a few years of TV work, he was ready to take on a different sort of project. “I was looking for something a little bit larger and lighter,” he says. “I’m a big fan of comedy and romance, but I wanted it in a kind of original context.” ThenSeth Reiss’s script forA Big Bold Beautiful Journeylanded on his desk. It was a sweeping and emotional tale following Sarah and David, who, after connecting at a wedding, are cosmicly brought together and shown doorways to their memories. (Watch the trailer below). “This film is really about reckoning with your past in order to find the possibility of love in the present,” says Kogonada. “What do you have to reckon with in order to truly connect with other people? And I think as you get older, you realize your past has everything to do with how you understand love in the present.” Sony will releaseA Big Bold Beautiful Journeyin theaters on September 19. With a supporting cast that includesLily Rabe, Kevin Kline,andPhoebe Waller-Bridge,the film aims to take audiences on an emotional ride—just as it did its two lead actors. “If audiences feel even a tiny slice of how magical it felt making this movie, then they’ll have the most incredible experience in the theater,” says Robbie. “Making this movie was truly one of the most magical experiences of my life.” Farrell, Robbie, and Kogonada on the set. Reiss’s script reminded Kogonada of romantic dramedies from the likes of Billy Wilder (Sunset Boulevard, The Apartment) and Ernst Lubitsch (Heaven Can Wait). “We’re always longing for connection and understanding,” he says. “It’s always something as human beings that we are searching for.” His earlier films had centered on that longing for connection in different ways. In his meditative directorial debut, 2017’sColumbus,two strangers(John ChoandHaley Lu Richardson) wander around that city’s architectural marvels while sharing truths about their lives and their relationships to their parents. His follow-up, the 2021 filmAfter Yang,starred Farell and Jodie Turner-Smith as parents whose android son malfunctions. While futuristic in nature, the film grapples with complex ideas about family, grief, and loss. It was another critical hit and won an award at the Sundance Film Festival. He’s a soulful filmmaker who is known for his visual style, capturing a world that feels both familiar and completely unique. And whileA Big Bold Beautiful Journeyis a more expansive canvas than his first films, it’s centered on the same deeply relatable desire for connection. A Big Bold Beautiful Journeyfeatures a magical realism that Kogonada says was partly inspired by his love ofHayao Miyazaki’s animated films. “That sort of magical lightness really connects you to our everyday experiences and all the challenges of being human, and is able to do both things at once,” he says.The Truman Showwas another reference. “I think about a movie like that: exploring so many levels, but really inviting and enjoyable. The dream, if you’re going to make a film like this, is to thread the needle—to do something that has artistic integrity but invites everyone to the table.” Because David’s past is such a large part of the story, Kogonada needed a leading man who could carry that sort of history with him. He thought of Farrell early on. “Colin is always carrying it in his eyes. You just feel like, Oh, he has endured pain, he’s endured victories in his life,” the director says. And Farrell also has the requisite soulfulness and charm. “There’s something inherently romantic about him as well. He’s a poet by nature. There’s just something about him that I think makes everyone sort of fall in love with him a bit.” For Farrell, it felt likeA Big Bold Beautiful Journeypicked up a conversation that he and Kogonada had begun while working together onAfter Yang.“Much of the same issues of loneliness and the confounding feelings around the absence of love and companionship in a person’s life are approached here too, but in a wholly different context,” says Farrell. Kogonada had never worked with Robbie, and didn’t personally know her. Still, when he met with her to discuss the project, he was immediately struck by her prowess and passion. “She’s truly a generational talent. I say that not just as an actor. This is what makes her really special: I genuinely think if she was just a producer, she would be one of the best producers to ever produce in Hollywood,” says Kogonada. “I think she’s that smart, that savvy.” The trio spent two weeks rehearsing before filming began, a process that hadn’t traditionally been a part of Kogonada’s process before this film. “We spoke about everything; the script, life, films we love, people we know, experiences we’ve had and how they changed us,” says Robbie. She and Farrell also bonded on drives in Farrell’s car, mirroring what happens inA Big Bold Beautiful Journey:David’s GPS instructs him to pick up Sarah and drive them together to places where they discover the doorways that lead them to their past. “It really created a vibe that bled into the film once we started shooting.” Filming in spring 2024 in Los Angeles,A Big Bold Beautiful Journeyallows audiences to step into one unexpected world after the other. Kogonada reunited withAfter YangcinematographerBenjamin Loebto create the film’s beautiful visuals, and brought on Japanese composerJoe Hisaishi,who is known for his work on Miyazaki’s films, for the score. “It felt important to lean into the fantastic, but to also ground it in these landscapes,” he says. “Our desire was to create a world that was both inviting and surprising, so it wasn’t just picturesque for the sake of it.” He references Miyazaki’s visuals once again as inspiration. “You could just look at any of those images—sometimes they’re just clouds and they feel like there’s magic underneath it,” he says. “We were talking quite a bit about where do we point the camera and how do we point it so we always have those elements that are both grounded and capture what about our world is inherently magical.” It had been several years since Kogonada had been on a film set of his own. He had purposefully spent time directing TV series—Apple TV+’sPachinkoandStar WarsseriesThe Acolyte—as a way to explore filmmaking techniques and equipment on bigger budget productions. That helped him prepare forA Big Bold Beautiful Journey.But even with all that preparation, he admits it was still a steep learning curve. “I really genuinely could spend a whole day telling you why I’ve learned. It’s been humbling in a great way, in the way that you realize there’s so much more that I need to understand and know about the medium,” he says. “And it is exciting too, because it did expand my own palette for this kind of filmmaking.” Robbie and Farrell say that the experience changed them as well. Says Farrell, “We all arrived with open hearts. It was just easy. Just sharing our lives and our experiences, hopes and fears, joys and sorrows. Not to make it sound like a therapy session, but it was just an amazing experience that changed me for the better.” Watch the new trailer below: The Dizzying Rise of MAHA WarriorCalley Means, RFK Jr.’s Right-Hand Man The UnsinkableKathy Bates From RFK Jr. to Patrick Schwarzenegger, a Brief Guide tothe Kennedy Family Why Is Trump Pardoning  thisReality TV CoupleConvicted of Fraud?

What do you dislike most about your appearance?My nose looks like a two-car garage. What or who is the greatest love of your life?She’s in the next room. What is your most marked characteristic?I guess the two-car garage. Let’s put it this way: If I’m walking through a crowd and want to avoid being recognized, I just cover my nose. No doubt your caricature will be featuring it. Which historical figure do you most identify with?I truly don’t think about historical figures that much. Maybe it’s no accident that I’ve rarely played one. If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?Probably our first dog. Her name was Jane. Pretty great life. Free spirit. Although she was accident-prone. What is your greatest fear?Food in a sink drain. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself ?I can’t stand the way my voice will crack if I’m making a speech. I hate public speaking and the emotion it dredges up. What is the trait you most deplore in others?Lying. Let’s not call it “untruthful.” Or “factually inaccurate.” I don’t even call it bullshit, because I like bulls. And bulls need to shit. So you can’t hold that against them. Let’s call it what it is: lying. What do you consider the most overrated virtue?Physical appearance. On what occasion do you lie?Sometimes it’s necessary backstage, after a screening, or when someone just played a song for you. Which living person do you most despise?It’s a growing list, but I wouldn’t write it here as we live in an age of weaponized retribution.

I hate to take decades of partnership and distill it into a sound bite. What do you consider your greatest achievement?My family. If you could choose what to come back as, what would it be?I’m going to take this opportunity to say I don’t want to come back! I don’t believe I will. I want to do my best while I’m here because I believe that when I’m gone, I’m gone. What is your most treasured possession?I guess an old guitar? But I’m not too attached to possessions. What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?Whenever I see a parent who has lost a child to war or shootings or disease, that seems like unimaginable misery. What do you most value in your friends?They want nothing but friendship. Who are your favorite writers?Cormac McCarthy, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King. How would you like to die?Without pain.

    "article_text": "Caritas Medical Centre tested blood samples of 406 patients with reagent that could produce false positive results, Hospital Authority says The Hospital Authority said on Tuesday that it was following up with the supplier of a testing product after being notified by the firm last week about complaints elsewhere related to quality issues. The product, supplied by Abbott Laboratories, is a reagent kit that detects the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood. An elevated level may be a sign of prostate cancer. The product’s quality issues could “potentially lead to a misdiagnosis of prostate cancer, causing doctors to erroneously consider unnecessary treatments”, the authority said. Two batches of the affected products were sent to Caritas Medical Centre in Sham Shui Po and Tuen Mun Hospital. While Tuen Mun Hospital had not started to use the product, Caritas Medical Centre had already tested blood samples of 406 patients with the PSA kit since April 28. It has reviewed the test results and will contact about 70 patients this week, and rearrange blood tests based on their clinical needs.",
