    "article_text": "Department of Homeland Security secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses President Donald Trump's ongoing legal battles over the use of the Alien Enemies Act in his illegal immigration fight. President Donald Trump is calling for the notorious prison and now historical landmark, Alcatraz, inSan Francisco, California, to be rebuilt larger and reopened to house the country’s most ruthless and violent criminals. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post on Sunday evening. \"REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!\" the president said. \"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. \"When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm,\" Trump continued, adding that it's supposed to be this way. \"No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets.\" ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 11, 1934, AMERICA'S MOST NOTORIOUS PRISONERS ARRIVE AT ALCATRAZ President Donald Trump is ordering the reopening of a \"substantially enlarged and rebuilt\" Alcatraz Island to house \"America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"(Credit: iStock | Getty Images) Trump saidhe is directing the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, FBI and Department of Homeland Security to reopen a \"substantially enlarged and rebuilt\" Alcatraz, \"to house America’s most ruthless and violent offenders.\" \"We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally,\" he said in the post. \"The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Alcatraz opened in 1934, but the prison, located on a 22-acre spit of rock, was shuttered after 29 years. THE ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ: WHAT HAPPENED, BIGGEST CONSPIRACY THEORIES SURROUNDING THE INFAMOUS PRISON BREAK Alcatraz Island opened as a prison in 1934.(Brandon Sloter/Getty Images) Considering its 1.25-mile distance to shore, the Bay Area island was considered practically escape-proof, although there were 14 documented attempted escapes. The most notorious one was the June 11, 1962, escape by John and Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris, which inspired\"Escape from Alcatraz.\" It remains a mystery whether the three reached the shore and survived. The FBI concluded the escapees drowned due to harsh conditions. BUILDING ALCATRAZ: AMERICA'S INESCAPABLE, ISLAND-RIDDEN PRISON The escape of three convicts - John Anglin, Clarence Anglin, and Frank Morris - from Alcatraz, including a suspected mystery boat seen on the San Francisco Bay the night of their disappearance, is detailed in the June 17, 1962, edition of the Oakland Tribune newspaper.(Photo by MediaNews Group/Oakland Tribune via Getty Images) The three prisoners chiseled an escape route from their own jail cells and built makeshift, papier-mâché heads. The final attempted escape from the prison, almost six months later, inspired what has become the swimming route of the \"Escape from Alcatraz\" triathlon. Its mostnotorious inmates included gangstersJames \"Whitey\" Bulger, Al Capone and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, plus infamous \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" Robert Stroud and \"Public Enemy No. 1\" Alvin Karpis. Alcatraz ultimately closed in 1963 after its island operations proved far more costly than mainland-based prisons.

    "article_text": "Charles McBee stops by Fox News Saturday Night With Jimmy Failla to give his take on actor John Boyega calling out the \"Star Wars\" franchise for its overwhelming whiteness. The White House slammed the \"radical left\" in a social media post Sunday, showing an AI-generated image of PresidentDonald Trumpwielding a lightsaber in celebration of May the Fourth, or \"Star Wars Day.\" May 4 has long been regarded as a day to celebrate the iconic movie franchise as fans post on social media \"May the Fourth be with you,\" an offshoot of the memorable Star Wars quote \"May the force be with you.\" On Sunday,the White Housetook an opportunity to celebrate the popular day with a post on X, while also taking digs at the Trump administration’s biggest critics. \"Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. You’re not the Rebellion—you’re the Empire,\" the White House wrote. \"May the 4th be with you.\" ‘STAR WARS’ CREATOR SLAMS CRITICS WHO COMPLAIN SAGA ISN'T DIVERSE ENOUGH: ‘MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE ALIENS’ The post included an AI-generated image of Trump, who not only donned a Jedi robe and set of ripped arms but also held a red lightsaber. Behind him in the image were two bald eagles and two American flags. The post received mixed reactions. \"Our efforts to FOIA info about a reported ‘Death Star’ have been stonewalled. And we pulled The Honorable Darth Vader as a judge when we sued so THAT will go nowhere,\" a user wrote.

Those who follow the science fiction franchise will remember Darth Vader, Kylo Ren and others associated with the dark side or Sith powers used a red lightsaber of some sort.

    "article_text": "NPR CEO Katherine Maher was pressed on Sunday on whether NPR was biased in their news coverage as implied in President Trump's executive order slashing taxpayer funds to NPR and PBS. NPR CEOKatherine Maherwas asked to respond to the implication that NPR's news coverage was biased, as alleged in President Donald Trump's executive order slashing taxpayer funding, during an interview on CBS on Sunday. \"The language in there says government funding of news media and this environment is outdated and unnecessary, corrosive to the appearance of independence, and Americans have the right to expect if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting, that it’s fair, accurate, unbiased and nonpartisan. How do you respond to the implication that your news coverage is not?\" CBS \"Face the Nation\" host Margaret Brennan asked. Trump signedan executive order to slash taxpayer funds to PBS and NPR on Thursday, two media outlets the White House accused of spreading \"radical woke propaganda.\" \"Well, first of all, I think it’s important to note that I’m the CEO, and we have an independent editor-in-chief who oversees the newsroom, and so I don’t make editorial decisions, and that I think is just always an important point to make, but I think our newsroom would really take issue with that. We have been on air for more than 50 years. We've been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas, we have an extraordinary Washington desk and our people report straight down the line,\" Maher responded. NPR CHIEF ADMITS DISMISSING HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS A MISTAKE NPR CEO Katherine Maher joined CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday after President Trump signed an executive order slashing taxpayer funds to NPR and PBS.(Screenshot/CBS) Maher argued that NPR reporters report straight down the line with a requirement to serve the entire public. \"That is the point of public broadcasting, as we bring people together in those conversations and, so, we have had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late. We’ve been making requests of the Trump Administration to have their officials on air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It’s hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won’t join us,\" she added. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. NPR notably dismissedthe Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020, calling the story a \"distraction\" and a waste of time. Maher acknowledged during a grilling on Capitol Hill that NPR should have covered the story more aggressively. Brennan also asked Maher how she would interpret specific editorial criticisms about NPR from the White House. Brennan said, \"The White House faults your editors for avoiding the term biological sex when discussing transgender issues. They apparently want you to use the term pro-life and faulted your use of the term ‘anti-abortion rights’ to refer to activists.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I interpret it as trying to create a narrative around our editorial independence,\" Maher responded. \"I think that is an affront to theFirst Amendment. We have an independent newsroom, and we will always have an independent newsroom.\" Brennan pressed Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger on whether they were pursuing lawsuits in response to Trump's executive order. \"We’re looking at whatever options are available to us. I think it’s a little preliminary for us to speak to the specific strategies that we might take,\" Maher said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kerger responded, \"We’re obviously looking, and I would just say, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a funding mechanism, but they don’t oversee PBS or NPR. We’re independent organizations.\" The order instructs theCorporation for Public Broadcastingand other federal agencies \"to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS.\" It further requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations.

Among the most consequential events marking the week was a major staff shakeup where he announced thatNational Security Advisor Mike Waltzwould depart his post at the White House. Hours later, Trump unveiled plans to tap Waltz to represent the U.S. at the United Nations. \"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump posted to Truth Social Thursday.

I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Here’s what also happened this week: On Monday, Trump signed an executive order demanding the Justice Department and Homeland Security establish a list of all sanctuary cities failing to follow federal immigration laws. Per the executive order, cities will receive notification and have the opportunity to drop the sanctuary status. Failure to do so could cause them to risk losing federal funding, according to the executive order. Sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities, including refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests. \"It's quite simple: obey the law, respect the law, and don't obstruct federal immigration officials and law enforcement officials when they are simply trying to remove public safety threats from our nation's communities,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"The American public don't want illegal alien criminals in their communities. They made that quite clear on Nov. 5, and this administration is determined to enforce our nation's immigration laws.\" Trump also revealed new plans Tuesday to swap out the retiring A-10 Warthog aircraft based out of Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan with 21 brand-new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets. Trump shared details of the new fighter jet mission during a speech to National Guard members at the Michigan base for an event commemorating his 100th day in office.

(Alex Brandon/The Associated Press) \"Fresh off the line. That means they are brand new,\" Trump said. \"They've never been anywhere. This is where they're going to be for a long time. And I saw one of them, flew over my head, and I said, ‘What the hell is that?’ That plane has serious power. So, this is the best there is anywhere in the world, the F-15EX Eagle II. This will keep Selfridge at the cutting edge of Northern American air power.\" The fighter jet is an updated version of the F-15C Eagle aircraft the Air Force introduced in 1989 and features bolstered fuel efficiency, radar and avionics, according to the Air National Guard. The jet is designed to work alongside other Air Force aircraft, including the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a presidential commission on religious liberty. Trump disclosed plans for the new commission during a National Day of Prayer event at the White House, revealing that Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will serve as the chairman of the commission. \"The last administration attacked people of faith for four years,\" Patrick said Thursday. \"There's a saying that no one should get between a doctor and a patient.

Shedeur Sanders’draft slide remained the topic of conversation a week after the Cleveland Browns selected the quarterback in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The aftermath has had every current and former player and pundit trying to figure out why a player like Sanders, who had been projected to be one of the first players off the board, had managed to fall all the way down to No. 144. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) jogs onto the field during the game against the Kansas Jayhawks at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.(Nick Tre. Smith-Imagn Images) ESPN NFL Draft analyst Matt Miller shed some light on the formerColorado Buffaloesstar’s fall. He pointed to how Sanders and his camp had handled the entire draft process. \"I didn’t think that they handled the process well,\" he toldAwful Announcing. \"And that’s not just hindsight. I took a lot of heat for saying on ‘NFL Live,’ right before the NFL Scouting Combine, that he was making a mistake. \"He should be throwing at the NFL Scouting Combine. He should have worked out at the East-West Shrine Game that he accepted an invite to. The NFL has this new rule that if you accept an invite to an All-Star Game, you have to participate.

    "article_text": "Trump defended his tariff policy and vowed that it would make America rich on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. PresidentDonald Trumpand \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker sparred over tariffs and the economy Sunday, with the president blasting the \"dishonest interview\" to the host's face. \"This is such a dishonest interview already. Prices are down on groceries. Prices are down for oil prices are down for oil. Energy prices are down at tremendous numbers for gasoline,\" Trump said when pressed on histariff policies. When pressed by Welker about rising costs on items such as tires and strollers, he dismissed price increases on such goods as \"peanuts compared to energy,\" which the president claimed his policies have made cheaper. Gas prices hit their peak during Biden’s sole term in office at an average of $5.06 per gallon in June 2022, the highest on record. The price of gas has steadily dropped since then, and the average national price of gas today is roughly $3.16 a gallon, according to AAA. VANCE BREAKS KEY TIE AFTER SENATE FAILS TO REJECT TRUMP'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON TARIFFS President Trump defended his tariff policies during a combative interview on \"Meet the Press.\"(Scott Olson/Getty Images) \"Strollers are going up. What kind of a thing? I'm saying that gasoline is going down. Gasoline is thousands of times more important than a stroller or something,\" Trump said. Trump made headlinesduring his cabinet meeting on Wednesday when he remarked that \"maybe children will have two dolls instead of thirty dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more\" as a result of his tariff policies. He denied the tariffs would result in empty store shelves, but did acknowledge that some Americans may need to cut down on their purchases. \"The don’t need to have 250 pencils, they can have five… I'm basically saying we don't have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don't need, for junk that we don't need.\" LIBERATION DAY AND TRUMP TARIFFS ARE NOT THE END OF TRADE. IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING Trump refuted that Wall Street insiders were saying his policies would result in a recession.(Michael Nagle) Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs on virtually every country America does business with on April 2, on what he refers to as\"Liberation Day,\"in addition to a 10% global tariff. The levies applied to friend and foe alike, with Vietnam being slapped with a 46% tariff and Israel receiving 17% tariffs on goods exported to the United States. Trump swiftly reversed course a few days later in the face of a stock market nosedive and bond market worries, pausing the reciprocal tariffs. He maintained the 10% global tariff as well as a145% tariff on Chinese goods, however. Mexico and Canada are facing separate 25% tariffs related to the fentanyl crisis. Trump maintained that his tariffs would \"make us rich\" and that the country was already profiting from them. He said that Americans were already feeling economic relief due to declining mortgage rates and energy prices.

We're doing great. Again, we're losing more than $5 billion a day, $5 billion a day. You don't talk about that. And right now we're going to be at a point very soon where we're making money every day,\" Trump said. Trump shot down Welker's claim, saying that Wall Street insiders were worried about a recession, and said he has spoken to many on Wall Street who are saying that his tariffs will be a boon for the economy.

    "article_text": "Ze'ev Orenstein, the Director of International Affairs at the City of David Foundation in Jerusalem, discusses some of the most significant finds from the Holy Land. (Credit: Eliyahu Yanai/City of David Archive.) TEL AVIV - A leading archaeologyjournal has effectively barred submissions by Israelis on Judea and Samaria unless they \"have cooperated with the relevant Palestinian authorities,\" in what analysts say is a microcosm of the harm caused by a global campaign to whitewash the Jewish people’s history in the Land of Israel. According to a report recently published byThe Press Service of Israel(TPS-IL), the Palestine Exploration Quarterly (PEQ)—a peer-reviewed journal of the London-based Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF)—is refusing to accept submissions from researchers affiliated with institutions operating in what it refers to as \"occupied territory,\" citing concerns over alleged Israeli violations of international law. \"Publication inPEQis guided by the PEF’s ethical policy. The main aspect of this is international law, by which many academic institutions and publications, includingPEQ, are bound,\" Charlotte Whiting, the journal’s editor-in-chief, told TPS-IL. The journal’s website states that it \"does not collaborate with institutions founded by an occupying power based in any occupied territory, and will not support, encourage, fund, or publish research by any academic associated with such institutions.\" LEADING EVANGELICALS IN PUSH TO HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP RECOGNIZE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER ‘BIBLICAL HEARTLAND’ Excavations at Tel Shiloh, best known as the location where the Tabernacle stood before King Solomon built the First Temple.(Shlomo Matityahu/TPS-IL) Israeli archaeologists told TPS-IL that any cooperation with Palestinian authorities or colleagues was practically impossible, because they \"would be treated as traitors for this.\" They also said that their work is in many instances shunned by the broader academic world and, as such, researchers are forgoing focus on the biblically significant areas of Judea and Samaria (West Bank) to protect their careers. \"What we’re seeing is a deliberate attempt to undermine Jewish historical ties to the land,\"Yishai Fleisher, international spokesman for Hebron, the cradle of Jewish civilization located in Judea, told Fox News Digital. \"There are three strategies at play: the Palestinians either acknowledge Jews were once here but argue they no longer belong, deny any Jewish connection at all, or destroy the evidence outright.\" Fleisher noted ongoing efforts byPalestinian authoritiesand others to rename historical Jewish sites. \"They call Hebron ‘Al-Khalil,’ and the Cave of the Patriarchs becomes the ‘Ibrahimi Mosque.’ The Temple Mount is now the ‘Al-Aqsa complex,’ and Rachel’s Tomb has been rebranded as the ‘Bilal Bin Rabah Mosque,’\" he said. To counter this, he says Israeli advocates are working to mark and preserve ancient Jewish landmarks. \"We added an Israeli flag and a menorah to a building originally constructed by King Herod 2,000 years ago—which itself stands atop a tomb dating back 3,500 years—to make it unmistakably clear it’s a Jewish site, despite the later addition of three minarets by Muslim conquerors.\" The Palestinian Authority, which gained non-member observer state status at the United Nations in 2012, has been spearheading the campaign to rewrite history in global forums that contain automatic anti-Israel majorities. Visitors arrive at Sebastia National Park in Samaria. Sebastia was the Israelite kingdom during the reigns of Omri and Ahab.(Hillel Maeir/TPS-IL) Among them is theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO), which in 2016 registered the Cave of the Patriarchs—the resting place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah located in Hebron—in the name of the \"State of Palestine\" on its \"List of World Heritage in Danger.\" More recently, UNESCO, in September 2023, named the Tell es-Sultan site near Jericho, which contains ruins dating back to the ninth millennium BCE, including evidence of one of humanity’s first-known villages, as a \"World Heritage Site in Palestine.\" In December 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution referring to the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site—located in Jerusalem but beyond the 1967 borders—only by its Muslim name, \"Haram al-Sharif.\" In September 2024, P.A. leader Mahmoud Abbas called the Temple Mount the \"exclusive property of Muslims.\" Last week, Abbas said in a rare televised speech that the Koran describes the Jewish Temple as being in Yemen. GOP LAWMAKERS PUSH TRUMP TO RECOGNIZE WEST BANK AS ISRAELI TERRITORY Naomi Kahn, director of the international division at Regavim, a think tank focused on Israeli sovereignty, said the P.A. is actively building over key archaeological sites as part of this initiative. \"In Solomon’s Pools, which is under P.A. jurisdiction in accordance with the Oslo Accords, they’re constructing condominiums directly on top of ancient Jewish infrastructure,\" Kahn told Fox News Digital. \"These are internationally recognized heritage sites, but the agreements are being violated. She cited the Hasmonean fortresses near Jericho as a major example. \"The burial grounds of Hasmonean kings—the largest necropolis in the Middle East from the Second Temple period—have been plowed and used for farming and construction. In one case, we found human bones scattered in the fields. The Israeli Civil Administration had to collect and rebury them.\" Khan also referenced Sebastia, the Greco-Roman name for the ancient city of Samaria. Originally founded by King Omri in the 9th century BC, Samaria became the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel, as noted in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:24). It served as the kingdom’s capital until it fell to the Assyrians in 722 BCE. Centuries later, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and renamed it Sebaste—Sebastia in later usage—in honor of the Roman Emperor Augustus, whose name in Greek, \"Sebastos,\" carried the same imperial meaning. In March of last year, Palestinian construction workers built an illegal road through Sebastia, which is located near the city of Nablus, also known by its biblical name, Shechem. Antiquities of the Jewish community in Hebron.(Hillel Maeir/TPS-IL) Khan said other sites facing encroachment include Joshua’s Altar, where a new Palestinian neighborhood is being developed nearby, and Joseph’s Tomb, which is largely inaccessible to Jewish Israelis \"I’m disgusted, but not concerned,\" Sandra Hagee Parker, Chairwoman of the Christians United for Israel Action Fund, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Where are the Romans, Ottomans, and Crusaders? The enemies of Israel are remembered only for their ultimate defeat by the God of Abraham and His children. \"Moreover, the grotesque effort to deny the Jewish connection to the Land is a rejection of God Himself,\" she continued. \"It is both antisemitic and anti-Christian—and it will never succeed. My only concern is that America continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel and her people,\" she added. Ze'ev Orenstein, Director of International Affairs at the Jerusalem-based City of David Foundation, stressed that \"from its inception in 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization—the forerunner of today’s Palestinian Authority—was founded on the denial of thousands of years of Jewish history and heritage rooted in the Land of Israel in general, and in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria—the Biblical heartland—in particular. \"This denial,\" Orenstein told Fox News Digital, \"aimed to delegitimize and undermine the Jewish people's legal, moral and historical right to sovereignty in the Land of Israel, portraying a people with some of the deepest archaeological ties to the land as occupiers and colonizers. \"For that reason, the Islamic Waqf carried out a campaign of systematic destruction of antiquities atop the Temple Mount in the late 1990s, and Palestinian leadership continues to deny, damage, and destroy Jewish heritage sites throughout Judea and Samaria,\" he said. Following the destruction and severe damage by Palestinian rioters at the 'Joshua Altar' archeological site located on the spur of Mt. Ebal, dozens of Jewish worshipers arrived for morning prayers at the site.(TPS) In response,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuin July 2023 announced a $33 million program to safeguard and rehabilitate archaeological sites in the biblical heartland. \"In every corner of Judea and Samaria, one need only to put spade to ground in order to uncover archaeological finds that attest to our deep roots in the Land of Israel,\" Netanyahu said at the time. \"This plan will encourage tourism, education and [present] information for these important sites that tell the story of our people in Judea and Samaria.\" Rev. Dr. Petra Heldt, professor at the Jerusalem University College and director of the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel, cited biblical texts and ongoing excavations as proof of longstanding Jewish presence in the region. \"There are hundreds of biblical place names showing Jews lived in Judea and Samaria since the time of Abraham,\" Heldt told Fox News Digital. \"The Palestinian Authority has tried to erase this evidence, but it’s nearly impossible to eliminate.\" Heldt pointed to Shiloh as a thriving example, with an active kibbutz and archaeological site where new discoveries are regularly unearthed. \"Jewish communities are not only living in their ancestral homeland—they’re documenting it. You can see the impact of various layers of occupation over the last hundred years.\" A carved installation identified as an altar, with a channel for liquid drainage.(Credit: Kobi Harati, City of David) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to Heldt, whose organization hosts global lectures and educational programs on archaeological findings in Judea and Samaria, more international support is needed to protect these sites. \"We must involve the media, universities, artists, filmmakers and writers to tell these stories and make these places matter globally,\" she said. The struggle to preserve Jewish historical sites in Judea and Samaria is not just about stones or ruins—it’s a battle over narrative, legitimacy and identity, according to the experts. \"The way to fight this is to build, to educate and to assert our sovereignty,\" Hebron’s Fleisher said. \"That’s how we strengthen our connection to the land and protect the truth of our history.\" Amelie Botbol is a freelance journalist based in Tel Aviv.

    "article_text": "Drone footage shows extensive damage from the explosion in Iran's port city of Bandar Abbas April 26, 2025. (Credit: Reuters, Pool via WANA) FIRST ON FOX:The massive explosion that rockedIran’s Shahid Rajaee portin the southern coastal town of Bandar Abbas has exposed the \"deep vulnerabilities\" of the Islamic Republic’s vital sectors as its concerns over internal unrest mount. Iranian authorities this week have faced mounting accusations of negligence and an attempt to \"cover up\" death toll figures and the strong suspicion it was using a civilian port to importexplosive materials for the military. But what remains largely unknown is the extent of the damage, the economic impact and how it will directly affect Iranians already discontent with theIranian regime. IRAN ACCUSED OF 'COVERING UP' DEATH TOLL IN PORT EXPLOSION AMID CONCERNS OF UPRISING A charred shoe on scorched ground during an emergency activity at Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, April 29, 2025. The blast, believed to have originated from hazardous chemicals, killed at least 70 people and injured over 1,200, according to local sources.(Rahim/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) \"Rajaee Port is Iran's primary hub for maritime exports and imports, particularly for oil-based products,\" Saeed Ghasseminejad, a senior advisor on Iran and an expert on its economy with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. Ghasseminejad explained that the southern port accounted for 52% ofTehran’s oil tradein terms of volume, 77% of its industrial metals and 85% of all container shipments, though he pointed out it is not Iran's only major port. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION AT AN IRANIAN PORT LINKED TO MISSILE FUEL SHIPMENT KILLS 5, INJURES OVER 700 \"At this stage, there is no credible damage assessment,\" Ghasseminejad added, noting all guesses at this point about the extent of the damage were speculation based on images of the damage to the containers and the administrative buildings in the port. But he noted that \"if the damage proves to be extensive and severe, it could place the regime under significant economic and logistical pressure.\" Just two days after the explosion, Tehran claimed port operations had returned to normal. Iran says the explosion killed 70, but some sources estimate the toll could be closer to 250.

It also took steps to limit access to information for not only local residents but media outlets, and it downplayed the severity of the incident.

    "title": "Will the next pope be from Asia?",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris reports from Rome ahead of next week's papal conclave. KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan — There may only be a few days before the College of Cardinals gathers inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next leader of the Catholic Church, and, for the first time in history, an Asian pope is a real possibility. Of the 23 cardinals from Asia eligible to vote, one name comes up again and again, that ofCardinal Luis Antonio Tagleof the Philippines, sometimes called the \"Philippine Francis.\" The 67-year-old had a close relationship with Pope Francis and served as his envoy to Asia during the 2015-16 special Jubilee Year, during which he made a brief stop in Taipei, Taiwan. Tagle also accompanied Francis on his first international trip to Asia in 2014, when the pontiff visited South Korea.

Another Asian candidate is Burma's Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, 76, from a country where Catholics represent just about 1% of the population. Meanwhile, over the last several days, reports from South Korean newspapers are suggesting South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, 74, is among the leading candidates to succeed Pope Francis. Pope Francis greets the people of China as he concludes Mass in the Hun Theatre Sept. 3, 2023, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Catholicism is growing rapidly in South Korea, according to Taipei-based Tu, who told Fox News Digital both Buddhists and Protestants have been converting at surprising rates. \"Unlike in Brazil, where Catholics are losing members to Evangelicals, Korea’s Catholic Church is attracting new followers,\" Tu said. Then-Bishop Lazarus You Heung-sik is widely credited with helping persuade Pope Francis to make South Korea the first stop on his Asian travels in 2014. Heung-sik was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022. Pope Francis, right, walks with the Bishop of Daejon, Lazarus You Heung-sik, as he arrives at the Shrine of Solmoe, birthplace of Saint Andrew Kim Taegon, in Dangjin Aug. 15, 2014.(Vincenzo Pinto/AFP via Getty Images) Francis may one day be rated as among the most influential popes of all time. Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor. The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority. However, some experts warn against assuming the next pope will be \"Francis the Second,\" as many of these new cardinals are considered more conservative. CONCLAVE TO PICK NEXT POPE TO BEGIN MAY 7, VATICAN SAYS This picture taken Aug. 10, 2018, shows a motorcyclist riding past the Holy Spirit Church in Yanshui, about an hour's drive from the southern city of Tainan.(Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images) The home nation of Asian cardinals doesn’t necessarily reflect the number of Catholics there. In Japan, Catholics make up fewer than 0.5% of the population, but there is a Japanese cardinal who is reasonably active on social media. The largest Asian block of cardinals hails frommajority-Hindu India, which has six to the predominately Catholic Philippines’ five. Still, many Vatican watchers believe Cardinal Tagle remains the most likely Asian candidate, although his progressive stances may prove divisive. Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using \"harsh words\" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis’ 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to \"avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.\" Cardinal Charles Maung Bo poses with relatives during a courtesy visit Feb. 14, 2015, at the Vatican.(Tiziana Fabi/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Should Tagle beat the odds and become the next pope, his election would energize the church’s progressive wing, as he would likely continue the liberal-leaning direction charted by Francis. His emphasis on serving the poor has won him admiration across Asia and beyond, as has his relatable style. Tagle reportedly prefers being called by his nickname \"Chito,\" rather than by his formal title. Pope Francis officiating the General Audience in Saint Peter's square. Pope Francis together with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.(Photo by Grzegorz Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images) Thomas Tu shared a personal story about Tagle’s compassion, recalling an incident before the cardinal received his red hat. After a young seminarian died suddenly, Tagle chose to join the group of senior seminary members and personally visit the grieving family, later giving a moving sermon in which he \"compared the church to a mother, similar to the one who had lost her son,\" Tu said. \"Tagle just has a way of reaching people that is special.\" Few dispute that the election of the next pope will be among the most consequential moments forthe Catholic Churchin decades. And, for the first time, candidates from Asia are now part of serious conversations about the future direction of the faith.

Zeldin announced that he is on a mission to save taxpayers an estimated $300 million annually by next year through an office overhaul that he said will maintain the EPA's focus on protectinghuman health and the environmentwhile \"recommitting\" the agency to \"common sense policies.\" The EPA employs roughly 15,000 full-time workers, which Zeldin said he is working to bring down to levels \"near those seen when President Ronald Reagan occupied the White House,\" according to a video announcement of the office overhauls.

    "title": "Dem immigration talking points fizzle as dark picture of Abrego Garcia emerges",
    "article_text": "National Border Patrol Council President Paul Perez joins ‘America Reports’ to discuss new details about deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, including audio alleging abuse toward his wife, and Democratic lawmakers’ continued support of his case. Democrats rallying aroundillegal immigrant KIlmar Abrego Garcia are facing a narrative reckoning as allegations of violent and criminal behavior mount against the man they made a poster child in the fight against President Trump's mass deportations. In recent weeks, evidence has emerged that Abrego Garcia beat his wife and was caught trafficking migrants during his time living illegally in Maryland. He has since been deported to El Salvador, where several Democrats, including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, have rushed to meet with him and decry what they say was a lack of due process extended to him. \"The fact that they went to the mat for this guy just shows exactly who they are,\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" on Saturday. \"That they are people who don't put America first. They don't care about our citizens and protecting our communities. So, I'm glad that the onion's been peeled back and that their true motivations have been revealed, and this is just one of the cases that we're getting off the streets.\" Van Hollen has led the surge of Democrats traveling to El Salvador since April, after Abrego Garcia was deported to the country in March and sent to its notoriously high-security prison equipped to handle violent gang members, known as CECOT.The Trump administrationhas repeatedly cited court and police documents showing that the El Salvadoran man was not only in the U.S. illegally, but also connected to the MS-13 gang and that his wife had sounded the alarm to police about his violence. ABREGO GARCIA'S WIFE BEGGED JUDGE FOR PROTECTION ORDER, SAYING 'HE SLAPPED ME': AUDIO President Donald Trump in the Oval Office holding a photo of the tattoos on Abrego Garcia's knuckles that the White House says are affiliated with the MS-13 terrorist group.(Donald Trump TRUTH Social) Democrats and the media had characterized Abrego Garcia as a \"family man\" and a \"Maryland man\" who was wrongly deported back in March and the following weeks. Van Hollen met last month with Abrego Garcia and advocated for his release, declaring that the deportation risks \"the constitutional rights of everyone who resides in the United States of America.\" Van Hollen's trip sparked other left-wing lawmakers to also make the trip south, including Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, Maxine Dexter of Oregon, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Robert Garcia of California last month. At one point, Dexter pledged to remain in El Salvador until Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. But Democrats have gone largely silent amid a flood of newly unearthed evidence against Abrego Garcia. 'I AM AFRAID': ANOTHER PROTECTIVE ORDER FILING AGAINST DEPORTED ‘MARYLAND MAN’ CHAMPIONED BY DEMS SURFACES In this handout provided by Sen. Van Hollen's Office, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) meets with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (L) at an undisclosed location on April 17, 2025, in San Salvador, El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, was illegally deported by the Trump administration and has been held in prison in El Salvador since March 15.(Sen. Van Hollen's Office via Getty Images) Fox News Digital exclusively reported on Thursday that new court records show Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order against her husband in August of 2020. The order said their shared son and stepchildren needed protection from Abrego Garcia, accusing him of verbal and physical abuse against her and mental abuse against her children. The protection form described an incident in November 2019 when Abrego Garcia allegedly grabbed Vasquez Sura \"by the hair in the car,\" \"dragged\" her \"out of car and left [her] in the street.\" She wrote that he also \"broke\" her son’s tablet, \"broke doors\" in the house, pushed her against a wall, broke a phone and a television and damaged the walls that spring. TENNESSEE BODYCAM OF 'MARYLAND MAN' TRAFFIC STOP SHOWS TROOPERS' HANDS TIED DESPITE SMUGGLING CLUES Audio recordings allegedly of Vasquez Sura asking for the protection order in 2020 have also surfaced. \"On Wednesday, he hit me, like around like, three in the morning, he would just wake up and like, hit me,\" Vasquez Sura told the court in the recordings, Fox Digital previously reported. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia traffic stop(Tennessee Highway Patrol) Vasquez Sura said that while she was trying to escape Abrego Garcia, she saw a neighbor walking their dog and screamed \"help.\" Vasquez Sura said Abrego Garcia then \"grabbed me from my hair, and then he slapped me.\" Vasquez Sura asked for the petition to be rescinded, however, saying her family wanted to take part in their son's birthday, and Abrego Garcia \"also agreed to continue counseling and if not [he's] willing to sign divorce papers.\" The 2020 protective order is the second publicly-known order filed against Abrego Garcia. Vasquez Sura filed a separate protective request against her husband in 2021, accusing him of repeatedly hitting her. \"At this point, I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he [has] left me,\" she told aPrince George’s County, Maryland,court, Fox Digital previously reported. \"In November 2020, he hit me with his work boot,\" she added of the alleged attacks. \"In August 2020, he hit me in the eye leaving a purple eye.\" DEM SENATOR SAYS ABREGO GARCIA SITUATION 'NOT GOING TO END WELL' FOR TRUMP, ARGUES HE'S 'UNDERMINING' FREEDOM His wife, however, has since publicly defended him and addressed the domestic violence allegations following the revelation of the first protective order request. Department of Justice attorneys on Friday said they are unaware of Maryland immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia's whereabouts after he was deported to a Salvadoran prison last month.(Fox news) \"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution following a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order, in case things escalated. Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through the situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling,\" she said in a statement last month. The Trump administration and conservatives have come out in full force condemning Democrats for supporting anillegal immigrant accusedof gang ties, human trafficking and domestic violence. Trump designated violent gangs such as MS-13 and Tre de Aragua as terrorist organizations in his second administration. \"I think it’s bizarre that you see these Democrat politicians making a pilgrimage down there … to sit there with this guy, because I never have seen those Democrat politicians meet with angel moms who’ve lost kids because of illegal alien crime,\" Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Fox News last week. MARYLAND GOVERNOR SAYS HE WON'T TRAVEL TO EL SALVADOR FOR ABREGO GARCIA \"This is a person that was a clear and present danger to the safety of the American people. And it is … a sad reflection on the state of our media and many of the outlets represented in this room that you obsessively try to shill for this MS-13 terrorist. Well, no coverage occurred in your papers about any of the Americans that were raped and tortured and murdered by the illegals that Biden was importing into our country,\" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said during a White House press briefing on Thursday. Democrats have amplified the argument that the Trump administration has thwarted Abrego Garcia's right to due process amid the mounting evidence that theso-called \"Maryland Man\"was wrongfully deported. California Sen. Alex Padilla told CNN last week that Democrats are more focused on Abrego Garcia's due process and ensuring he receives a fair court battle, and not on the individual. \"I think our advocacy here has a little bit less to do with him individually and more the process,\" Padilla said. \"The lack of due process that this administration continues to act with. The laws are clear in this country, even if you are undocumented, you have the right to due process.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries allegedly called on Democrats last week to slow their visits to and comments regarding El Salvador, though his office vehemently denied he made such a request to colleagues, saying \"House Democrats will never stop fighting for the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Jeffries' and Padilla's offices for comment on Sunday regarding the ongoing condemnation from conservatives and the Trump administration over Democrats advocating on behalf of Abrego Garcia and Padilla's comments outlining how the party is working to protect due process, but did not immediately receive replies. DEPORTED ‘MARYLAND MAN’ CHAMPIONED BY DEMS WAS PULLED OVER DRIVING CAR BELONGING TO HUMAN SMUGGLER While Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar told a Daily Caller reporter last week, \"I think you should f--- off\" when asked whether she believed that more Democrats should travel to El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally from his home country of El Salvador in 2011 and was issued a deportation order in 2019, Fox News Digital previously reported. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters at the White House.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Abrego Garcia was suspected of partaking in labor/human trafficking, according to a 2022 Homeland Security Investigations report previously obtained by Fox News. The report also stated that \"official law enforcement investigations\" revealed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the notorious gang MS-13, which Trump has designatedas a terror organization. Abrego Garcia was pulled over by a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper on Dec. 1, 2022, after he spotted the car speeding and not remaining in its lane, according to the Homeland Security Investigations report. The trooper noticed eight individuals in the car with Abrego Garcia, who said he had begun driving three days prior from Houston to Temple Hills, Maryland, via St. Louis to \"perform construction work,\" Fox Digital previously reported. The report states that the trooper suspected the group was involved with a human trafficking incident, as there was no luggage in the vehicle. Documents further revealed that Abrego Garcia was driving a black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban that he said belonged to his \"boss.\" The Suburban was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as belonging to Hernandez Reyes, who pleaded guilty to human smuggling after being caught in Mississippi in a car with passengers from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras, Fox Digital previously reported. DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN AND SUSPECTED MS-13 GANG MEMBER TRANSFERRED FROM NOTORIOUS EL SALVADORAN MEGA-PRISON Body camera video, obtained by Fox News Digital through a public records request last week, showed the Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers pulling over Abrego Garcia, who had eight other individuals in his car. \"How many rows have you got in here? Four seats? Four rows of seats?\" a state trooper can be heard saying in the video. \"Did y'all put an extra one in? Huh? Did yall put another one in no? They come like this I've never seen one with that many seats in it.\" Abrego Garcia's legal team responded to the new bodycam footage in a comment to Fox Digital on Sunday, saying it did not constitute evidence of a crime. \"I have represented Kilmar Abrego Garcia for more than a month, and this bodycam video is the first time I’ve heard his voice. He has been denied the most basic protections of due process—no phone call to his lawyer, no call to his wife or child, and no opportunity to be heard,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the lead attorney for the case. \"As an attorney, I see no evidence of a crime in this footage. But the point is not the traffic stop—it’s that Mr. Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court. Bring him back to the United States, return him before the same immigration judge who heard his case in 2019, and let him speak for himself,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg continued.

The Homeland Security Investigations report also notes that in October 2019, the Prince Georges County Police Gang Unit identified Abrego Garcia as a member of MS-13. NEW AUDIO REVEALS ABREGO GARCIA’S ALLEGED ABUSE OF HIS WIFE The deportation has been wrapped up in court proceedings since March, with a Maryland federal judge ordering the Department of Justice to \"take all available steps to facilitate\" his return to the U.S., which was a ruling upheld by an appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court. The Trump administration, however, contends that it \"cannot guarantee success in sensitive international negotiations\" with El Salvador to secure the release. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge’s bidding,\" Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in the Trump administration’s Supreme Court petition last month, the New York Post reported.

With the final REAL ID deadline looming this week, one House Republican lawmaker told Fox News Digital he believes it's an \"unnecessary\" burden on Americans. \"I personally don't support the REAL ID. I think that it's unnecessary in keeping us safe,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told Fox News Digital in an interview.

U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. stated that he would not prevent the administration from deportingindividuals in the U.S. illegallybut that the Alien Enemies Act could not be used as a basis to expel alleged gang members from the country. Rodriguez is the first judge to rule against the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members. \"The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the President can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of [Tren de Aragua]. As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms,\" Rodriguez — who was appointed by Trump in 2018 —wrote in his order. ICE agents and President Donald Trump(Trump-Vance Transition Team, ICE) FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING Trump expressed his anger about the decision in a pointedTruth Social post, questioning how judges could block the deportation of \"criminals, including murderers.\" \"Can it be so that judges aren’t allowing the USA to deport criminals, including murderers, out of our country and back to where they came from? If this is so, our country, as we know it, is finished,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday. \"Americans will have to get used to a very different, crime-filled, LIFE. This is not what our founders had in mind!!!\" While it is not clear whether the post was a direct response to Rodriguez's order, the judge's decision is the most recent regarding illegal immigration and deportation. ICE arrests 81 illegal aliens as part of joint federal law enforcement operation in Kentucky, of which 25 are also charged with felony criminal offenses.(U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) NOEM RIPS DEMOCRATS OVER SUPPORT FOR DEPORTED MIGRANT Just ahead of Trump’s 100th day in office, theWhite House claimedthere had been 139,000 deportations since the president took office. During his campaign, Trump promised a swift and harsh crackdown on illegal immigration, which had become a focus under theBiden administration. In March, the administration took a controversial Biden-era app and added a \"self-deport\" feature, allowing illegal immigrants to voluntarily leave the country rather than facing ICE. ICE agents arrested seven illegal immigrants during a workforce operation raid.(U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Department of Homeland Security (DHS) SecretaryKristi Noemsaid in a cabinet meeting on Trump’s 100th day in office that the president had \"completely reversed\" the situation at the border.

Since then, however, Moriarty has faced fierce backlash, even among some former supporters, as critics questioned decisions to seek lighter sentences for violent crimes in some cases and to divert more people to programs rather than jail. Police officers, local officials and some progressive activists condemned Moriarty after she charged a White state trooper with the killing of a Black man last summer, only to laterreverse course and drop the charges.Leaders of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association had waged a high-profile campaign urging Tim Walz, the state’s governor and former Democratic vice presidential nominee, to reassign the prosecution away from Moriarty.

In a significant legal victoryfor the Trump administration, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has granted a stay on a lower court's order that had mandated the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VOA) employees and the resumption of full broadcasting operations.\"This is a huge victory for President Trump and his Article II powers granted in the United States Constitution. It's also a victory for US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and VOA,\"Kari Lake, a USAGM senior advisor to the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital following the court's decision Saturday.

Texas Gov.Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed a school choice bill into law on Saturday that will allocate $1 billion for a voucher program that allows parents to use public funds to pay for their child's private school tuition. The program's implementation caps off a yearslong effort by Republicans who have been advocating for school choice. Voucher supporters have long focused on Texas, where previous efforts failed amid resistance from Democrats and rural Republicans. Last month, President Donald Trump called on state lawmakers ahead of a key vote on the bill to finally send the measure to Abbott’s desk. The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 2 by a party-line 19-12 vote on April 24 after the state House approved the bill by an 86-63 vote the week before. \"When I ran for reelection in 2022, I promised school choice for the families of Texas,\" Abbott said before signing the bill at the governor's mansion. \"Today, we deliver on that promise.\" LIBERAL SUPREME COURT JUSTICES GRILL RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION IN LANDMARK SCHOOL CHOICE CASE Texas Gov.

Dan Patrick, state House Speaker Dustin Burrows, bill author and state Sen. Brandon Creighton, U.S. Senator John Cornyn, school choice advocates and students and their families. \"From here forward, [Texas students] will have unlimited potential and unlimited options in education to pursue for the rest of their path and education and what their families do best, and that in of itself was worth the journey,\" Creighton said. Texas joins more than 30 other states that already have similar programs. The Lone Star State will have the largest voucher program in the country. School vouchers have been Abbott’s main focus this year, following last year's election cycle in which he called for Republican primary voters to remove from office GOP lawmakers who voted against a similar bill in the last legislative session that the governor had supported. 'BAD FOR PARENTS': SCHOOL CHOICE SUPPORTERS PROTEST EXCLUSION OF RELIGIOUS CHARTER IN SUPREME COURT CASE The Lone Star State will have the largest voucher program in the country.(Montinique Monroe/Getty Images) Supporters of the bill say it will give parents more options by allowing them to take their children out ofpoor-performing public schoolsin favor of alternative public or private school choices. \"Gone are the days that families are limited to only the schools assigned by government,\" Abbott said. \"The day has arrived that empowers parents to choose the school that is best for their child.\" Democrats and Republicans in rural districts who have criticized the program argue that it will pull financial resources fromTexas' public school studentsand subsidize the private education of wealthy families. \"Let’s be clear: this bill is only best for the richest people in the state, and rural Texas especially will get the shaft,\" Texas Democratic Party chairman Kendall Scudder said in a statement. \"To top it all off, Abbott’s school shut-downs are in full-swing with no end in sight.\" Texas joins more than 30 other states that already have similar programs.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Starting next school year, families can receive $10,000 per year to help pay for their child's private school tuition or costs for home-schooling and virtual learning programs.

    "article_text": "Jackie Dorman, founder of the \"Last Year Single\" program, talks to Fox News Digital about the whirlwind romance between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson. Just when you thought he was out, Bill Belichick andJordon Hudsonpulled him back in. Retired NFL writer Peter King announced his retirement in 2024 after decades as a columnist for Sports Illustrated and Pro Football Talk as well as a reporter on \"Football Night in America\" on NBC. ButBelichick’s book tour, which dominated the national conversation over the last week, brought him back into the media spotlight. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Feb. 6, 2025; New Orleans, LA: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson on the red carpet before Super Bowl LIX NFL Honors at Saenger Theatre.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) King sounded off on Belichick’s disastrous public relations campaign in a podcast interview. \"This is a guy who owned every room he ever walked into, and now he’s got a 24-year-old muse telling him what to do or trying to control situations that, quite frankly, she has nothing to do with or should have nothing to do with,\" he said on\"Sports Media with Richard Deitsch.\"\"Bill’s got to get a hold of himself here. He’s got to get a hold of this situation. This is embarrassing. It’s totally embarrassing for a guy who’s as great at his job as he is.\" King added that for Belichick to do an interview, like he did for CBS, he had to be a bit more interesting and the opposite of the kind of media personality he was when he coached the New England Patrots. \"Bill Belichick, to promote a book, goes on Sunday morning television for however long it was, say 10 minutes, but goes on Sunday morning television with a sweatshirt on with a hole in it. Look at the video of it,\" King continued. \"He’s got a Navy sweatshirt on that has a hole in it. . . . Why does TMZ have him walking out of the Ritz-Carlton hotel, I think, in New York in a perfectly tailored blue suit? Why? Where’s he going? And why is he on a national TV show looking like he’s going to a press conference in Foxboro on no sleep, and then he walks out of a hotel going wherever he’s going. . . .

You just shouldn’t do it then. Why do it?\" King said that anyone who saw the CBS interview may not be so keen to buy the book he promoted in the first place. Belichick broke his silenceon the debacle Wednesday, defending his girlfriend and accusing CBS of creating a \"false narrative\" with \"selectively edited\" clips. \"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the coach said. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help focus the discussion. She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021.

    "title": "Maine rocked by trans athlete dominance at girls' track meet amid ongoing legal conflict with Trump",
    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court, and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. A girls' track meet in Maine became the subject of widespread controversy after a trans athlete dominated multiple running events. The incident took place as the state faces internal and federal pressure to keep trans athletes out of girls' sports, and a lawsuit over the issue from PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration. A trans-identifying athlete who competed for North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine, won the girls' 800-meter and 1600-meter events. In October 2023, Fox News Digitalreportedthat this athlete was transgender. Fox News Digital has reached out to North Yarmouth Academy for comment. The athlete has been making national headlines in Maine dating back to that month after jumping to 4th place in the 5k division in the girls' category after previously finishing 172nd among boys. The athlete again made national headlines for competing in Nordic skiing and taking a podium spot in Maine's High School State Nordic Skiing Championships this past February. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM On Friday at the POLAND-NYA-YARMOUTH-SEACOAST meet, the athlete won the 1600-meter with a time of 5:57.27, blowing away the second-place runner who finished with a time of 6:16.32. In the 800m, the trans athlete etched out a closer first-place finish with a time of 2:43.31, just around a second better than the second-place finisher with a time of 2:44.87. Local high school sports photographer David Young, owner of Maine Running Photography, was there to shoot the meet. \"He blew away all the girls in that particular race [the 1600m], there wasn't anybody near him, easily won it.\" Young told Fox News Digital. \"In the 800m, it was a one-second difference, the girl tried very hard to catch him.\" Young added that there had been multiple spectators at the meet to cheer the trans athlete on, but no audible protests. \"There were a few people there who yelled out his name, he's pretty well known,\" Young said. Young said his 2023 photos of the athlete went so viral on Facebook, and prompted so much backlash, that he ended up removing those photos because of the overwhelming response. \"It was getting too nasty,\" Young said. \"Not only was I getting it from the people who were for transgenders, I was getting it from people who were anti-transgenders. And I didn't know what to do, and somebody finally said, ‘Well, if you just remove the photo, the debate will go away.’ So, I removed the photo, and the debate went away.\" However, Young said he plans to post his most recent photos of the athlete on his Facebook page anyway, even after what happened last time. Many of Young's past photos of the athlete have gone viral on social media in the aftermath of the athlete's latest victory. Maine residents, politicians and even national pundits have posted media including the athlete and prompted national debate and awareness for the meet as Maine faces an ongoing internal and federal conflict over the issue. \"Today a biological male won the 800 & 1600 in the girls division at a Maine track meet. Every girl who placed 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and further in those races was pushed aside so a boy could ‘win.’ This is NOT fair. Our girls deserve a fair, safe, and level playing field,\" State representative Laurel Libby wrote on X. Libby previously made a Facebook post that identified a different trans athlete who won a girls' pole-vaulting competition. Libby was censured for the post by the legislature's Democrat majority and is currently involved in a lawsuit over the issue. California conservative activist Beth Bourne drew widespread national attention to the issue by posting footage of the competition on X. The women's activist athletics wear brand XX-XY Athletics even turned footage of the competition into an ad. One of the Maine female athletes who had to compete against the trans athlete in Nordic skiing previously told Fox News Digital about the sense of defeat that came with losing to the athlete. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER \"The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,\" Carlisle said. \"I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. . . . I didn't think it was happening to me.\" The U.S. Department of Justice announced a lawsuit against the state of Maine for its continued defiance of Trump’s executive order to keep biological males out of girls and women’s sports and alleged violations of Title IX. Attorney GeneralPam Bondiannounced the lawsuit at a press conference April 16. Bondi said she was seeking an injunction and to have titles returned to the girls who \"rightfully\" won competitions in which trans athletes participated. The Department of Justice accused the state of \"openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News. Meanwhile, Governor Janet Mills, the Maine Department of Education and the Maine Principal's Association has held firmly in support of continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls' sports across the state, citing the Maine Human Rights Act as the precedent for determining gender eligibility. \"I’m happy to go to court and litigate the issues that are being raised in this court complaint,\" Mills told reporters in April. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls' sports tobiological females.

    "article_text": "Keyshawn Johnson shares what he believes would be a successful rookie season for Shedeur Sanders and the Cleveland Browns. Sheduer Sanders' unexpected drop from a projected first-round pick to a fifth-round selection was the most polarizing topic from last week's NFL Draft. Longtime ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. was among the staunch defenders of Sanders, and the former Colorado star'sfall to the Cleveland Brownsappeared to leave the broadcaster in a state of disbelief. Shortly after Sanders' name came off the board, Kiper unleashed on NFL franchises, which led to a clash between him and colleague Rece Davis. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM ESPN \"College GameDay\" host Rece Davis during the Rose Bowl between the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Utah Utes Jan. 2, 2023, in Pasadena, Calif.(Ric Tapia/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Kiper said the NFL had been \"clueless\" for five decades evaluating quarterbacks. Kiper appeared further perplexed due to his belief Sanders is \"one of the toughest quarterbacks you’ve ever seen.\" NFL analyst Louis Riddick then explained to Kiper that the question wasn’t about whether Sanders could play quarterback but, from a team perspective, whether a team wanted him. Davis agreed with Riddick, who added, \"The draft has spoken.\" The on-air spat sparked questions about whether some level of animosity existed between Davis and Kiper. But during a recent appearance onOutKick's \"Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich,\"the ESPN \"College GameDay\" host made it clear he doesn't have a problem with his colleague. SHEDEUR SANDERS REVEALS BOLD GOAL AS MEMBER OF BROWNS Davis acknowledged the job Kiper is tasked with as a draft analyst. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. during the 2011 NFL Draft at Radio City Music Hall in New York City April 28, 2011.(Howard Smith/USA Today Sports) \"First of all, and I'm not doing that thing that Pete Thamel accuses me of, where I say two things nice about somebody and then offer a critique or something,\"Davis told Dakich.\"But the reason there were … whatever the number (of fans) was in Detroit the previous year is largely due to what Mel's done for the draft. \"And Mel’s job is to make his rankings of the players and defend them. And I didn’t mind him disagreeing, and I don’t mind him saying anything he wanted to say when we're there. But I thought that, as a group, the part we were overlooking was the old Occam's razor philosophy — the most likely explanation for something is probably correct. We don’t know for sure.\" A screen shows Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders after he was chosen by the Cleveland Browns with the 144th overall pick during the third day of the NFL Draft April 26, 2025, in Green Bay, Wis.(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Davis then pointed to Sanders' widely scrutinized handling of thepre-draft process, arguing it could have played a role in the quarterback's fall. \"But it was almost certain that, at that point in the draft, that something had happened in the pre-draft process involving Shedeur Sanders that was keeping teams from taking him,\" Davis added. \"Now, I think it’s a reasonable debate if you say he's not a top 5 quarterback on tape at this time. \"I'm not sure that it's reasonable that he's not a first or second-round type guy. That seems a little unreasonable to me. So, if you go beyond that, then something else probably happened. And my only point was I didn't think we were giving that the proper credence.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Davis said his relationship with Kiper was in a good place, and he enjoys working with him. \"It’s fine. I didn’t even know there was an issue until I started getting texts like you were saying,\" he said. \"It’s sort of part and parcel of what we do. Sometimes, for the analyst’s own good and for the good of the show, you challenge their position. Mel’s great. I love working with Mel. And he’s the reason the draft is what it is, in my opinion.\" Shortly after the Browns selected Sanders on the final day of the draft, he took to social media to share a short but emotional message: \"Thank you GOD.\" Sanders finished the 2024 season at Colorado with 4,134 passing yards. He will join acrowded quarterback roomin Cleveland with Deshaun Watson, Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel. Fox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.

With the deadline for REAL ID approaching in less than a week, some states — and some people — may be more prepared than others. Americans have been speaking out about their experiences as they try to obtain a REAL ID. In some cases, people have chosen not to get the new form of identification. The REAL ID requirement takes effect May 7, when Americans must have the new identification in order tofly domestically. MARRIED WOMEN FACE REAL ID DOCUMENTATION HURDLES: 'I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS' DMVs across the country are reportedly working to meet demand, with some implementing Saturday REAL ID events and extended appointment hours during the week. The New JerseyDepartment of Motor Vehicles(NJDMV) website has shown \"0 appointments available\" on various days during the past weeks for REAL ID services on its site. As the REAL ID deadline approaches on May 7, states are showing varying levels of preparedness.(Fox News Digital) In a last-minute push, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and the NJMVC announced the launch of \"REAL ID Tuesdays\" recently. The initiative will add 5,200 bi-weekly appointments before federal enforcement begins on May 7. REAL ID REJECTION BY AMERICANS MAY COME DOWN TO ONE SURPRISING FACTOR New Jersey does have one of the highest numbers of residents who are passport holders, a TSA spokesperson shared. TSA Acting AdministratorAdam Stahl told Fox News Digital in an interview, \"We are extremely prepared.\"(See the video at the top of this article.) \"Every single state is in a different area of progress for REAL ID compliance.\"(Fox News Digital) \"Every single state is in a different kind of area of progress for REAL ID compliance, but we are working aggressively with states, directly outreaching and connecting with them to ensure that they're prepared for this,\" said Stahl.

    "article_text": "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity. Data breacheshave become alarmingly common and costly, putting sensitive information at risk. In fact, the number of data breaches in the United States jumped from 447 in 2012 to over 3,200 in 2023. Even firms entrusted with managing personal information are not immune. The latest example is VeriSource Services, a Texas-based employee benefits and HR administration provider that experienced a major data breach. The personal information of about 4 million people was exposed in this incident, and it took the company over a year to fully assess its impact, a critical failure for an organization specializing in data management, employee enrollment and HR support services that clients rely on to safeguard their mostsensitive information. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! An illustration of a hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) VeriSource discoveredthe breachFeb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date. Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed. According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In asample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (viaBleepingComputer). A person working on their laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH For individuals whose data was exposed, this breach poses real risks. Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as openingfraudulent accountsor filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams. What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised. We reached out to VeriSource for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A person working on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION If you think you were affected by the VeriSource data breach or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the data breach: 1. Consider a personal data removal service:VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you. The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 3. Set up fraud alerts:Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They’ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit. 4. Monitor your credit reports:Check your credit reports regularly throughAnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you’re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage. 5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software:Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn’t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren’t just compliance failures. They’re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn’t just good PR. It’s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn’t the only vulnerability worth addressing.

From there, passengers would be whisked away tomajor airportslike JFK, LaGuardia and Newark, as well as regional airports like Westchester County, Teterboro and Republic. The idea is that passengers would book these air taxi trips as an \"add-on\" to their existing flights, creating a seamless travel experience. While the exact pricing hasn't been revealed yet, it's worth noting that a one-way helicopter ride from Manhattan to JFK on Blade typically costs around $265 per seat.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: The Americans I talk to will sacrifice for real change",
    "article_text": "OMB Director Russ Vought discusses President Donald Trump's tariff standoff with China on 'America's Newsroom.' For the past month, sincePresident Donald Trumpannounced Liberation Day with a flurry of tariffs and then paused to negotiate trade deals, the Democrats and even some Republicans have cited polls that show Americans think this policy will hurt them economically, and so surely they must be souring on Trump. The past few days I have traveled aroundWest Virginia,IndianaandKentucky, and I could not find a single Trump voter who regretted their choice over tariffs. Not one. FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM I met Terry and his wife Cassandra, both in their late 60s, in Jeffersonville, Indiana. They live in Arizona and run a small business in which Terry flies horse trainers to events, in this case the Kentucky Derby. \"We need change, and that can hurt at first,\" Terry told me. \"Trump needs time to make that change.\" I pressed the couple a bit, asking if part of the deal was that it has to be a meaningful and lasting change, not just words. They both nodded emphatically. \"That’s what I voted for,\" Cassandra told me. Columnist David Marcus (r.), with Doug (l.) and Danny, (c.), two steel cleaners at Voss Clark in Jeffersonville, Indiana.(Fox News Digital) As simple and clear as my new friends made it to me, this logical position, that might be summed up as \"no pain, no gain,\" seems to have left all the experts in New York City and Washington, D.C. completely baffled. Last week, pollster Frank Luntz expressed his surprise this way: \"I've never seen this before,\" he said. \"Because usually, when you're hurt economically, that changes your perspective and your politics. Not with these people. They're staying firm.\" Luntz is good at his job, and he’s accurate here. But it shouldn’t come as a surprise. It is a quite predictable result of just how fed up Trump’s voters are with the status quo. Those in power or with loud voices in DC and Gotham still haven’t fully come to terms with the Trump phenomenon. Look at it this way: The American people elected Donald Trump president of the United States. DONALD TRUMP! Twice! There is no rational way to look at that and conclude that voters wanted a steady hand to fix things on the margins but not break anything. Trump’s supporters are not going to run to the hills because the stock market gets bouncy or Barbie dolls get a few bucks pricier, because they clearly see Trump’s upside. Trump’s supporters are not going to run to the hills because the stock market gets bouncy or Barbie dolls get a few bucks pricier, because they clearly see Trump’s upside. Doug and Danny are both in their fifties, Doug is Danny’s boss, and Danny runs the steel cleaning crew at the Voss Clark plant in Indiana. Chatting with them, I was talking to both management and labor, and also two good friends. Both guys are still all in on Trump. \"In a heartbeat,\" Danny told me when asked if he would still vote for Trump. And it wasn’t tariffs they wanted to talk about, it was the president’s promise to end taxes on overtime. Doug told me that this policy would \"encourage [younger workers] to give up their time, away from loved ones and produce for customers that we have, that need steel, that they want that we did not produce Monday through Friday and get it done.\" I got to see some of this in action at the steel cleaning facility just down the road, and even though it was 10 p.m., the workers were cleaning their giant rolls of steel, and would be overnight. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These guys like what they do more than anyone I’ve ever met who works in a cubicle, and they’d like it even more if their sacrifice of overtime was rewarded with a tax break. Over half of the employees at Voss Clark make more than $100,000 a year. In southern Indiana, where the cost of living is low, that's buy-a-house-and-raise-a-family kinda money. Don’t tell me these are jobs native-born Americans don’t want. It may be remarkable that despite the entirety of the liberal media and even a decent chunk of the conservative media railing against tariffs, Trump’s voters still trust him on the issue. But it should not come as a surprise. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For the first time in decades in places like Jeffersonville, the working man and woman feel they have a president who is on their side, who will put their needs before those of the stock market and the intelligentsia. Do these working Americans know that Trump’s policies might fail? Sure, they aren’t stupid. They get the risk. But they didn’t vote to spruce up the status quo, they voted to destroy it, and that is why some economic discomfort will not scare them away from Donald Trump.

    "title": "Trump's $5,000 baby bonus: Here's how it will do the most good",
    "article_text": "Foundation for Economic Education's Maggie Anders joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her take on the 'baby bonus' and why she believes the check wouldn't 'cut it' and ultimately worsen the already-declining birth rate. Thebaby bustand its potentially catastrophic consequences garnered both worldwide and national attention. Elon Musk recently warned again that America’sdeclining birth rateposes a greater threat to civilization than climate change or war. \"If we don’t have kids, there’s no civilization,\" he wrote on X. New research from the Institute for Family Studies shows his techno-polygamous solution and lifestyle is neither a good approach for society nor is it a particularly good approach for his children. Married people continue to enjoy above replacement levels of fertility.(iStock) It’s important to recognize that in the United States, our flight from marriage –and the mindset that has driven it – is causing our fertility collapse. Married people continue to enjoy above replacement levels of fertility. The challenge is there are far too few married people today. AMERICA, LET'S MAKE FAMILIES GREAT AGAIN To provide policy incentive, reports have emerged that PresidentDonald Trump's administration is considering a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" for new moms. The administration should focus that incentive on married fertility. The American left has long understood that the law is a moral teacher, and they have gleefully used it increasingly to teach their own, continuously changing brand of morality. The recent Supreme Court case, Mahmoud vs. Taylor, where progressives have shoved radical sexual ideology onto 5-year-olds, is only one small vivid example of this trend. So, the law ought not to be agnostic on what kind of fertility is beneficial to the thriving of the state and its citizens. A mountain of research has shown that children born to married homes, on average, flourish more on nearly every level. WE REPLACED FAMILIES WITH UNCLE SAM. DOGE MUST MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES WHEN CUTTING These children cost the state far less. They are many times less likely to require massive state and charitable investment to mitigate the long-term consequences born out of their homelife. We should coolly remind the \"trust the science\" crowd that kids, adults and society disproportionately benefit frommarried families. And, historically, the married, two-parent family is what made the West become the most advanced civilization in world history. We’ve known this for decades. Carl Zimmerman, a Harvard sociologist writing in the 1940s, identified the three family structures that have shaped civilizations: the trustee family, the domestic family and the atomized family. In a trustee family, the extended family is sacred, and the individual is subordinate to the good of the group. This model appears in times when state power is weak – like among early American settlers who relied on tight-knit clans to survive. THE CHILDREN WE LEFT BEHIND: A RECKONING WITH AMERICA’S GROWING FATHERLESSNESS As societies matured, they often evolve into the domestic family model, which strikes a balance between personal freedom and family obligation. This structure fosters the trust, stability and cohesion that enable markets, institutions and democratic norms to flourish. Zimmerman traced therise of this family modelto periods of cultural and civilizational growth – such as in medieval Europe, when Christian teaching helped reweave the social fabric after Rome’s collapse. History also shows what happens next. The atomized family has once again become dominant, and we’re witnessing the consequences in real-time. THIS WAR OF WORDS IS FRIGHTENING YOUNG PEOPLE INTO NOT HAVING CHILDREN In this model, the individual is supreme, and familial obligations dissolve. Marriage becomes a contract of convenience, easily entered and easily exited. Children are often viewed as optional or even burdensome. Zimmerman warned that when this model dominates, societies become increasingly self-absorbed, unstable and violent. That’s precisely where we find ourselves today. Mental health crises, youth suicides and mass loneliness are rampant. Birth rates are declining not only in the U.S. but across the developed world. Communities are disintegrating as social trust erodes and isolation increases. Can government policy reverse this trend?  There is lots of evidence we need arevival of Christian faith. But we also know from the Civil Rights Movement that the law can serve a critical role as a moral teacher. The proposed \"baby bonus\" – if tied to married fertility – could provide powerful moral voice that would have the effect of amplifying private action and stirring revival. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The church can lead here. Despite all this brokenness, two-thirds of Gen Z still say they’re excited about marriage. The hunger for family hasn’t disappeared – it’s just been starved of vision, guidance and hope. All the dating apps on earth have only cheapened human connections at a time when 85% of churches spend nothing on relationship and marriage ministry. There is such an opportunity for churches to provide \"in real life\" community that can lead to the relationship revolution that will produce the next baby boom. Throughout history, theChristian faithhas been the dominant force for civilizational renewal. After the fall of Rome, church leaders like Augustine and Basil the Great promoted the domestic family as a stabilizing force. Their vision helped usher in the High Middle Ages – a time of increased social trust, the birth of universities, and the rise of modern markets and law. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Today, we need a similar renewal. Washington and Wall Street can play some role. But the bigger role is to be played in the home and thelocal church. If every believer committed to nurturing healthy, faith-filled relationships – and every church committed to equipping them – we could spark a cultural shift more powerful than any policy proposal. This is not naive optimism. It’s historically grounded hope. The fall of past civilizations was not inevitable – and neither is ours. The family can be rebuilt. Marriage can be restored. Communities can be renewed. But it requires vision, courage and commitment. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM J.P. DE GANCE J.P.

    "title": "What the F---? Democrats turn to profanity instead of policy",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Sean Hannity gives his take on the state of the Democratic Party on 'Hannity.' You must be F----ing kidding me. The Democrat Party has embraced profanityas a means of demonstrating its authenticity, according to multiple news reports. They’re dropping F-bombs. They’re slinging the \"S\" word. And they sound like F----ing idiots. CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED OUT ON 17% FAVORABILITY RATING AFTER SLAMMING TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS The Democrats have two problems.They have no message,and they have no legitimate messengers. Texas Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett was criticized in March for two separate instances of dropping the F-bomb.(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn) So, their pollsters, or advisers, or other pointy-headed people, suggested that the way to win America’s respect is by turning into a party of potty mouths. Or to paraphrase former First Lady Michelle Obama, \"When they go low, we go straight into the toilet.\" What a crock of you-know-what. The Democrats have never been famous for respecting the intelligence of the American people. Former President Barack Obama saw us clinging to our guns and our religion. (He was right, by the way.) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saw us as a basket of deplorables. And former President Joe Biden saw us as ... well, you’d have to wake him up to find out what he thought, and then he probably still wouldn’t remember. So now they think that expletives will make them seem more ... what exactly? More street? More legit? More like you and me? Well, Democrats, you F’d up again. Because here in the real world, we don’t use expletives in our workplaces, in our public statements, or wherever grownups might be listening. I’m not talking about goofy chatter among besties at Starbucks. I’m talking about when we have adult conversations about important things. Our religious leaders don’t drop F-bombs from the altar. Former President Barack Obama criticized ordinary Americans for clinging to their guns and their religion.(REUTERS/Alyssa Pointer) Our parents don’t use bad words at our children’s birthday parties. Our businesspeople don’t mix in salty language when making sales calls or visiting customers. In other words, there’s nothing authentically American about profanity. Only the Democrats somehow think that if they use obscenities, they’ll connect with voters. Of course, the Democrats are pointing to President Donald Trump and saying, \"He started it.\" And it’s not a state secret that the president’s use of language sometimes varies from the King’s English. The problem is that when Democrats play the, \"He started it\" game, they sound even less like statesmen and women and more like middle schoolers. For years, the Democrat Party has been a hostage to its radical wing, embodied by its faux populists like Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Now Sanders seems intent on passing along the mantle of party leadership to New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who, to her credit,keeps bad words off her X feed.Maybe AOC will develop a potty mouth so she can fit in with the rest of her party. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Democrats would be better advised to stop trying to sound authentic and start trying to figure out why they should remain in business. They should take a lesson from our friends across the pond. In Great Britain, voters are about to switch to the Reform Party and consign the Conservatives to the dustbin of history – because they stand for nothing and have no real leaders to stand up for them. Sounds familiar, eh, Democrats? Only the Democrats somehow think that if they use obscenities, they’ll connect with voters. Just because a political party has existed for two centuries doesn’t mean it will keep on keepin’ on indefinitely. Right now, it’s hard to tell exactly what the Democrats are for. Government bloat? Open borders? Reverse racism? Antisemitism? Kneeling to Teheran? Four-letter words aren’t a substitute for actual policies. It makes me long for the days of Joe Biden’s angry outbursts – who can forget when he called a New Hampshire primary voter a \"lying dog-faced pony soldier\"? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At least the only four-letter word in that unique statement was \"pony.\" The point is that the Democrats claim that they’re trying to woo America with a clean slate. What they really need is somebody’s Mom to come wash out their mouths with soap.

    "title": "This is how Donald Trump can terminate tariff turmoil",
    "article_text": "Economist Steve Moore discusses President Donald Trump’s economic policy and the April jobs report on ‘Fox Report.’ This past April has been one of the most volatile months in stock market history, thanks to the Trump administration’s botched rollout of its so-called reciprocal tariff rates. However, this tariff threat has at least succeeded in bringing other nations to the negotiating table – and now, the best way to restore calm is by letting Trump do what he does best: negotiate. That’s a difficult pill to swallow for businesses likeAmazon, which is addicted to artificially cheap imports from nations like China. Instead of pressuring Chinese vendors to cut costs or force the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the negotiating table, Amazon has been flirting with pressuring the Trump administration to drop the whole tariff fight altogether. Recently, for example, officials in the company were debating whether to display a so-called \"tariff cost\" along with the price of items for sale. Amazon called this transparency – but nothing could be further from the truth. AMAZON DENIES TARIFF PRICING PLAN THAT WHITE HOUSE CALLED 'HOSTILE AND POLITICAL' For one thing, where was this \"transparency\" when former presidentJoe Biden’sfour-decade-high inflation caused consumer prices to explode? Anecdotally, some products that I used to buy on the site doubled in price during Biden’s tenure. Yet Amazon never dared tell consumers what portion of these price increases was caused by Biden’s overspending. Similarly, when Biden exploded regulatory compliance costs (which also directly impacted consumer prices), Amazon never told consumers how much of their bill at checkout was from overregulation. Folks never saw an \"inflation cost\" or \"regulation cost\" while Biden was president. TREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SIGNALS US ADVANTAGE IN TARIFF BATTLE AS CHINA'S ECONOMY CRUMBLES Not only that, but where would Amazon even get the data needed to display the effect of tariffs on the cost of individual items? This information certainly can’t come from Chinese vendors. Anyone attached to the CCP is consistently pressured to lie and publish falsified data. Ironically, it’s more important that we make these trade deals with China’s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China’s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees. Instead, finding information about (for example) the amount China exports requires finding how much every other nation is importing fromChinaand adding those figures. Only then can one gain a better sense of whether the \"official\" CCP data is accurate. Unfortunately, even such a painstaking method is imperfect because the CCP can pressure other totalitarian states to either falsify or neglect to publish relevant data. China itself simply stopped publishing unemployment data when the figures got too ugly for the CCP’s liking. BUFFETT CRITICIZES TRUMP'S TARIFFS ROLLOUT, SAYS US SHOULDN’T USE 'TRADE AS A WEAPON' Amazon has since backed away from the idea of displaying estimated \"tariff costs\" on its site. But even the discussion of such an idea speaks to how spooked markets are about potential tariffs. If PresidentDonald Trumpis not able to make any deals before the end of the 90-day pause, the ensuing tariffs will amount to a massive tax increase on American consumers and foreign producers alike, grinding economic growth to a halt. But Trump failing to negotiate isn’t at all a foregone conclusion. In fact, we’ve recently seen extremely positive developments with key trading partners like India and Japan. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: COMPANIES THAT WILL INVEST $1B OR MORE IN THE US In other words, there’s plenty of economic runway left (as Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentput it recently), and Trump can still safely land this plane. What exactly does that look like? In short, it means signing bilateral trade deals with key trading partners to both guarantee American consumers can still access a wide variety of affordable products from abroad and ensure that American exporters can finally access to foreign consumer markets. Ironically, it’s more important that we make these trade deals with China’s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China’s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees. Despite what China’s government reports may say, the country’s economy is already vulnerable and hurting – it cannot afford a drawn-out trade war. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Trump and Bessent still have economic runway to get this done and alleviate all the tariff turmoil in the coming weeks and months. If they succeed in doing so – at the same time as they seek to shepherd a massive tax cut through Congress and deregulate at breakneck speed – America will be headed to the promised Golden Age, meaning more American jobs and a lower cost of living.

In both cases, contractors (first translators, then writers) were replaced with AI. Merchant also noted reporting in The Atlantic aroundthe unusually high unemployment rate for recent college graduates. One explanation? Companies might be replacing entry-level white collar jobs with AI, or their spending on AI might simply be “crowding out” the spending for new hires. This crisis, Merchant wrote, is really “a series of management decisions being made by executives seeking to cut labor costs and consolidate control in their organizations,” and it’s manifesting as “attrition in creative industries, the declining income of freelance artists, writers, and illustrators, and in corporations’ inclination to simply hire fewer human workers.” “The AI jobs crisis is not any sort of SkyNet-esque robot jobs apocalypse — it’sDOGE firing tens of thousands of federal employeeswhile waving the banner of‘an AI-first strategy,’” he added.

Residents of an area around SpaceX’s Starbase launch site in southern Texas voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to incorporate as a city — also named Starbase. According toresults posted onlineby the Cameron County Elections Department, there were 212 votes in favor and only six against. In a post on his social media site X,Musk wrotethat Starbase, Texas “Is now a real city!” The new city’s residents are believed to mostly be SpaceX employees. On Saturday, they also voted to electthree current and former SpaceX employees— Bobby Peden, Jordan Buss, and Jenna Petrzelka — who ran unopposed to serve, respectively, as Starbase’s mayor and two commissioners. The Associated Press reports thatSpaceX hasn’t shared many specificsabout why it wanted to incorporate the area. The company said it already manages the roads, utilities, and “the provisions of schooling and medical care,” and it’s also looking to shift authority from the county to the new city government to close the nearby Boca Chica beach and state park for launches. Musk — who recently said he would bereducing his rolewith the Trump administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency to a “day or two” per week — announced last year that he wasmoving SpaceX’s headquartersfrom El Segundo, California to the Starbase facility in Texas. At the time, Musk said he’d “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building” and that the “final straw” wasa California billthat prohibits schools from disclosing students’ sexuality or gender identity without consent. After last night’s election, a new X account representing the townposted, “Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity’s place in space.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "title": "Revelo’s LatAm talent network sees strong demand from US companies, thanks to AI",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us While many tech companies are mandating that their employees return to their offices, and putting an emphasis on building in-person teams, they are also turning in droves to Latin America to find developer talent — especially for post-training AI models. Revelo, a full-stack platform of vetted developers in Latin America, is seeing a new surge in demand for engineers that can help with LLM training, Revelo co-founder and CEO Lucas Mendes, told TechCrunch. Revelo has more than 400,000 developers on its platform and facilitates the hiring and payment process for its U.S. customers. Mendes said this recent surge of demand for Revelo’s talent is driven by the next phase of the AI revolution: post-training LLMs. “There’s a race for data, and especially expert human data, that can actually help LLMs be better at very specific high-value tasks,” Mendes said. “Coding is one of those tasks. And what happened last year is that we saw a surge in demand from [companies] building foundational models that are looking for engineers that can be effective experts and that can provide that human data to help their LLM code better.” LLM training hires accounted for 22% of Revelo’s revenue in 2024. Mendes added that often this demand looks like companies coming to them to find experts in specific coding languages to help fill gaps in the post-training they are already doing. Revelo is supplying workers to U.S. enterprises Intuit, Oracle, and Dell, among others, including “nearly every major hyperscale AI provider.” Revelo is not the only company looking to connect U.S. companies to programmers in Latin America; other companies like Terminal, Tecla and Near are just a few with the same goal. This demand for developers skilled in post-training is just the latest hiring trend that Revelo has been able to ride since it was founded in late 2014. Mendes said he launched Revelo alongside co-founder Lachlan de Crespigny because the war for talent was tight at the time, and they thought if they created a network of vetted talent in Brazil, companies would be able to find the talent they needed. The demand was there and Revelo went on to raise more than$48 millionin venture funding from firms including Social Capital, FJ Labs and Valor Capital Group. The company also expanded out of Brazil and into broader LatAm. The Covid-19 pandemic expanded Revelo’s potential reach “massively,” Mendes added. “All of a sudden we started getting inbound from U.S. companies who suddenly realized that you can actually have really high-quality distributed teams and have some of those engineers are in Latin America,” Mendes said. “So what would happen usually is that they would hire one or two and really like the quality and especially the quality cost tradeoff and say, ‘Hey, I want more of these, where do I find them?’” While the rise of distributed and remote work has largely started to fade as companies return to in-person work, Revelo has still managed to keep growing. Mendes joked that he hates to be the guy that goes against the buzz, but the demand for their LatAm talent has not diminished despite tech’s movement back to the office. Mendes said he thinks that the demand from U.S. companies for these developers in Latin America has remained because these developers fall more into the “nearshoring” category of workers outside the U.S. as opposed to “offshoring.” He believes the fact that Revelo’s talent is located in the same time zones as their client companies makes these hires a lot more attractive. Revelo is seeing enough demand that it has acquired five other competitors focused on LatAm talent in the last 30 months includingAltoandParetisa, which were announced in March. “We’re building that global talent backbone for the age of AI and there will be more acquisitions in the future,” he said.

    "title": "Backstage access: Spotify’s dev tools side-hustle is growing legs",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Spotify generates the vast bulk of its income from ads and subscriptions, but for the past few years the music-streaming giant has also been quietlybuilding outa developer tooling business.Backstage, a project it open-sourced in 2020, has been adopted by more than 2 million developers across 3,400 organizations, including Airbnb, LinkedIn, Twilio, and American Airlines. Backstage helps companies build customized “internal developer portals” (IDPs), bringing order to their infrastructure chaos by combining all their tooling, apps, data, services, APIs, and documents in a single interface. Want to monitor Kubernetes, view cloud costs, or check your CI/CD status? Enter Backstage. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which accepted Backstage as an incubating projectin 2022, reports that Backstage was one of itstop 5 projects last yearin terms of velocity and activity. And it’s this momentum that is leading Spotify to double down, with various premium tools and services on the horizon. Companies can already use the core Backstage product for free, including an array ofopen source pluginsthat extend its functionality. But Spotify started selling premium plugins in 2022, such asBackstage Insights, which displays data related to active Backstage usage within an organization. And last year, Spotifygot serious about its dev tools business play, announcingSpotify Portal for Backstagein beta: a premium, oven-baked incarnation for those lacking the resources (or inclination) to set everything up themselves. “Backstage in a box,” is the general idea. The fully managed SaaS product is now edging toward general availability in the coming months, with design partners and customers including the Linux Foundation and Pager Duty already on board. “We discovered that there were a lot of different customer profiles,”Tyson Singer(pictured above), Spotify’s head of technology and platforms, explained to TechCrunch in an interview at KubeCon last month. “Our original theory was that Backstage was going to be bigger for mid-size to large enterprises dealing with a lot of complexity, but we found that small companies also see these same problems. And so having a hosted version makes everything so much easier.” Spotify also teased a couple of new premium Portal plugins at KubeCon, including AiKA (“AI knowledge assistant”), which is basically a chatbot initially developed internally for its own employees. The result of a 2023 hackathon, Spotify says that AiKA is now used by 25% of its workforce weekly to query the company’s collective knowledge base. So rather than bombarding support channels in Slack, employees can just ask AiKA, which is trained on its own internal documents and data. Singer also says that AiKA’s utility — providing instant answers to questions — motivates employees to make sure all their documents are up-to-date because it makes AiKA smarter. If someone doesn’t get a good response to a question, they can see what source was used in the response, and provide feedback to ensure the source document is improved. “It [AiKA] kind of sounds simple, but it’s powerful, and we got super-high adoption very quickly internally,” Singer said. “[I think why is because] it’s not just developers that are using it — everybody in the R&D organization has gotten into it, which also brings more people into the Backstage ecosystem. But also it creates this very positive fly-wheel between quality and discovery.” Spotify has confirmed that an alpha version of AiKA is set to launch for third parties imminently. And while it won’t be at feature parity with its own internal version initially, it should go some way toward bolstering Backstage’s stickiness as a premium product in the long run. Backstage isn’t the only home-grown developer product Spotify is looking to monetize. Some20 months agothe company announcedConfidence, an A/B experimentation platform that has remained in stealth ever since. “We have a few customers who are paying [for Confidence], but we are really focused on Portal right now,” Singer said. “We’re being very selective about the customers that we let in the door.” According to Singer, Spotify will have more to say about Confidence later this year, though he did hint at potential synergies between Confidence and Portal in the form of a plugin that brings some simplefeature-flagging functionalityinto Portal. When all is said and done, creating a developer tooling side-hustle on top of its day job as an online music emporium has surely been a major undertaking. But there has been good reason for all of this. More than a decade ago, Spotify created its owncontainerorchestration platform calledHeliosto support its transition to amicroservicesarchitecture. While Spotify eventually open sourced Helios to spur wider uptake, it ultimately lost out toGoogle’s Kubernetes, which went on toconquer the world. Spotify ditched Helios and joined the throngs on Kubernetes — a “painful” decision at the time. And what we’re seeing now with Backstage is a response to that: an effort to ensure that Backstageis the industry standard IDP, and that its own developers aren’t forced to transition to something else that comes along. “When you have a product that gets replaced by an external product, particularly an open source one, that migration cost is just tremendous,” Singer said. “And so we decided that we don’t want that to happen to a product that is literally the foundation of how we do development at Spotify.” While Spotify went some way toward heading off that problem when it open-sourced Backstage in 2020, the premium stuff that’s now following is really to ensure that it sticks. “We’re a business — and we also want to build a healthy business on top of all this,” Singer said. “We’re not just trying to cover costs. At the end of the day, we have a lot of value trapped inside Spotify right now.” Topics Senior Reporter Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

    "title": "Syrian security forces 'oversaw' armed civilians who killed Alawites, accused man says",
    "article_text": "One of the men accused of taking part in a wave of sectarian violence against Syria's Alawite minority two months ago has told the BBC that he and other armed civilians who travelled to the area were advised and monitored by government forces there. Abu Khalid said he had travelled as a civilian fighter to the Mediterranean coastal village of Sanobar on 7 March, to help battle former regime insurgents. \"The General Security department told us not to harm civilians, but only to shoot at insurgents who shot at us,\" he told me. \"There were eight men with me, but it was a large group, and the General Security department was overseeing things so that no-one would vandalise the village or harm the residents.\" He later filmed himself shooting dead a 64-year-old village resident, Mahmoud Yusef Mohammed, at the entrance to his house. Abu Khalid, who has now been arrested, insisted Mahmoud was an armed insurgent - but video he filmed of the incident does not support his account. Military police told the BBC there had been no coordination between security forces and Abu Khalid. Human rights groups estimate that almost 900 civilians, mainly Alawites, were killed by pro-government forces across Syria's coastal region in early March. The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and its followers make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Syria's coastal area - a stronghold of the former regime - has been largely sealed off, but a BBC team gained access, speaking to witnesses and security officials about what happened in Sanobar. The violence came a day after fighters loyal to the country's overthrown former President Bashar al-Assad, who is an Alawite, led deadly raids on government security forces. The new Sunni Islamist-led government had called for support from various military units and militia groups to respond to those raids – but that escalated into a wave of sectarian anger aimed at Alawite civilians. Witnesses told the BBC that several different armed groups had targeted Alawites for summary executions. Some also said that government security forces had battled violent and extremist factions to protect Alawite villagers from attack. When the violence along this coast erupted, the village of Sanobar was right in its path. Some 200 people were wiped out from this small Alawite village, over the course of a few days in early March. Almost two months after the killings, there have been no funerals in Sanobar. A mass grave now squats beside the winding village road. Hurried burials have cleared the remaining corpses. This is now a village of women and secrets. Most survivors are still too scared to speak openly but their stories, shared with us privately, are often strikingly similar. The body of Mahmoud Yousef Mohammed lay outside his simple breeze-block house in Sanobar for three days after he was shot dead. His wife, daughter and grandchildren, sheltering in a neighbour's house, were too afraid to emerge from hiding and bury him, as armed groups roamed the village. His family said Mahmoud was a polite man, known and respected in the village; a farmer with a military background, who sometimes worked as a minibus driver. His house, on a quiet street at the edge of the village, stands less than 300m (985ft) from the main highway where, on 6 March, army officers from Syria's former regime led co-ordinated attacks on the country's new security forces. For two days, government forces battled former regime fighters, known locally as \"filoul\" (\"remnants\"), in the villages along this coastal highway, calling for support from allied militia groups who helped push Bashar al-Assad from power last year. An array of armed supporters responded to the call, including foreign jihadist fighters, civilians and armed units now nominally part of the new Syrian army, but still not fully under government control. All are groups now accused by survivors of civilian executions. All day on 7 March, Sanobar residents listened to the sounds of intense fighting around the village, as families hid in their houses. Then the targeting of civilians began. \"All day, many groups entered our house,\" one survivor from Sanobar told me. \"They weren't from the [military] groups based here, but from Idlib, Aleppo and elsewhere. Some wore camouflage uniforms. But the ones who killed us were wearing green uniforms with a mask.\" \"They stole everything, insulted us, threatened the children,\" she continued. \"The last group came around 6pm. They asked, 'Where are the men?' and took my father and my brother Ali. We begged them not to kill them. They said, 'You're Alawite, pigs,' and shot them in front of our eyes.\" Some time that day, Mahmoud stepped outside the building he was sheltering in with his family. One of his relatives said he could smell toxic fumes from a fire nearby, and wanted to check on his own house. He never reappeared. \"We found the next morning that he had been killed,\" the relative told us. The story of what happened to Mahmoud began to emerge when a video of his killing surfaced on social media, filmed by the man who shot him. In the video, Abu Khalid is seen grinning and taunting Mahmoud from the back of a motorbike before shooting him six times. To meet Abu Khalid, we travelled to Idlib, the heartland of transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which swept Syria's old regime from power last December. Now in military police custody pending an investigation, Abu Khalid shuffled into the room, blinking and stretching as his blindfold and handcuffs were removed. A young man in camouflage pants, he seemed keen to talk, explaining that Mahmoud was not a civilian, but an insurgent who was fighting in the village that day, and had been carrying an 8.5mm-calibre rifle when he shot him. \"I turned the camera on him and told him to sit down,\" Abu Khalid told me. \"He was running away and he wanted to kill me, so I shot him in the shoulder and the leg. When I got closer, I saw him moving his hand as if he had a bomb or a gun. I was afraid, so I killed him.\" But the video Abu Khalid filmed of the shooting - its location and timing verified by the BBC - does not support his account. A former member of the British special forces confirmed that there was no weapon visible on or near Mahmoud at any point in the video. And at no point does Abu Khalid ask the 64-year-old to stop or sit down - nor does he appear scared or under threat. Instead, he is shown whooping and grinning on the back of the motorbike, before calling out to Mahmoud, \"I've caught you, I've caught you! Look at the camera!\" He then shoots him three times in quick succession. Mahmoud falls to his knees inside the doorway of his house. \"You didn't die?!\" Abu Khalid calls out, as he follows him to the building. Mahmoud can be heard begging for his life, before Abu Khalid shoots him three more times at close range. International law forbids the killing of civilians, the injured, or disarmed fighters. Khaled Moussa, from the military police unit now holding Abu Khalid, said he had gone to fight in Sanobar without coordination with the security forces. \"Civilians are not supposed to be there during military operations,\" Mr Moussa said. \"He made a mistake. He could have captured the person, but instead he killed him.\" But Abu Khalid has little regret for what he did. When he cries during our interview, it's not for Mahmoud - or even for himself. It's for his little brother, killed in a bomb attack by President Assad's former army in 2018 as his family sat down at home to break their Ramadan fast. \"He was eight years old, and I held him while his soul left his body,\" he told me, before tears start flowing down his face. \"I was raised during the revolution, and saw nothing but injustice, blood, killing and terror. They ignore everything that happened in Syria before the liberation, and focus on the video I filmed.\" He tells me his family's latest casualty was his 17-year-old cousin, killed while fighting insurgents near Sanobar. \"He was completely burned,\" he said. \"We took him away in a plastic bag.\" \"If I was going for revenge for what they did to us, I wouldn't have left any of them.\" The insurgent attacks on 6 March ripped open sectarian fault-lines that Syria's new Islamist government had tried to paper over with promises of tolerance and inclusion. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), an independent monitoring group, says former regime loyalists killed at least 446 civilians, including 30 children and women, and more than 170 government security forces, most of them on 6 March. Those attacks resurrected deep-seated anger over the repressive dictatorship of former President Assad, with Alawite civilians seen by some as complicit in the crimes of his regime - and as part of the insurgency that followed his fall. The SNHR says the government's crackdown on insurgents on the coast \"escalated into widespread and severe violations\", most of which were \"retaliatory and sectarian\". The group says that pro-government forces and supporters killed at least 889civilians, including 114 children and women, in the days following the insurgent attacks. Amnesty International has investigated dozens of attacks it says were \"deliberate\", \"unlawful\" and targeted at Alawite civilians. One video from Sanobar shows a pro-government fighter marching through the village chanting, \"ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing\". Lists of victims from the village, compiled by local activists, include the names of more than a dozen women and children, including an 11-year-old, a pregnant woman and a disabled man. The survivor who watched gunmen kill her father and brother said the family showed their killers the men's civilian ID cards to prove they hadn't been part of Assad's army. But it made no difference; their only accusation, she said, was that the family were \"Alawite pigs\". Separating civilians from insurgents is key to the new government's plan to secure the country, and its promise to protect minorities. But that will require prosecuting those responsible - and proving it can control its own military forces and armed allies. Sharaa's HTS group - once the local affiliate of al-Qaeda and still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK - formed the backbone of his new army. There has been rapid recruitment to fill the ranks of a new civilian police and the General Security Forces. Training has reportedly been shortened and many units say they are under-equipped. One commander looked wistfully at my body-armour and radio when we joined them on a patrol. \"We don't have those,\" he said. Turkish-backed militia and jihadist fighters who once fought alongside HTS to remove Bashar al-Assad are among those named by witnesses and human rights groups as carrying out summary executions. In the streets of Sanobar, the names of Turkish-backed units, now supposedly under government control, have been graffitied on the walls, and the BBC heard several reports that their men were still present in the village. Some videos of alleged violations also appear to show the presence of vehicles and uniforms from the official General Security Forces - prompting Amnesty International to call for investigation. The head of the General Security Forces for the Latakia region, Mustafa Kunaifati, told me that civilians with friends or relatives in the army were responsible for most of the crimes, but admitted that members of armed groups had also been involved - including what he called \"individual cases\" from his own General Security units. \"It happened,\" he said, \"and those members were also arrested. We can't accept something like that.\" After the former regime fighters were expelled and the situation brought under control, he said his men \"began removing all the rioters from the area and arresting anyone who had harmed civilians\". Several witnesses have confirmed to the BBC that Mr Kunaifati's forces intervened to protect them from other armed groups. One of Mahmoud's neighbours in Sanobar told us they evacuated him and his family 30 minutes before Mahmoud was killed. And the witness who described the killing of her father and brother said the General Security Forces had helped them escape the village, and later to return and bury their relatives. Sharaa has vowed that \"no-one will be above the law\" when it comes to prosecuting the killings on the coast. A special committee is currently investigating both the initial 6 March attack by insurgents, and the violence by pro-government forces that followed. The BBC understands some 30 people have been arrested. But in a country still waiting to see justice for the crimes of the past, this is a delicate moment. Some have argued that the government's decision to issue a general call for support after the insurgent attacks made violence predictable, even inevitable. Many Alawite villagers say they want the government's General Security Forces to police their villages, and for other factions, now positioned at some checkpoints and bases, to leave. Two months after the violence here, government security forces are acting as the shield against their own hard-line allies. The future of Sanobar is a test for the future of Syria, and the country's other minorities - Druze, Christians, Kurds - are watching. To see how far Syria's Islamist government can hold this wounded country together without resorting to the repression of the past. Israel's PM says it will \"not allow any threat\" to the minority in Syria after sectarian clashes in which dozens were killed. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Restrictions are also being eased on the financial services and energy sectors to help investment.",

    "title": "Iranians among eight arrested in two separate anti-terror operations",
    "article_text": "Seven Iranian nationals are among eight men arrested in two major counter-terrorism investigations that took place separately on Saturday. Five of the arrests were part of a \"pre-planned\" investigation into an alleged plot to \"target a specific premises\", the Metropolitan Police said. Dramatic footage taken in Rochdale showed one man removed from a house by armed officers - while another was filmed being dragged through the street in Swindon with plastic bags placed over his arms. As part of a separate investigation led by the Met's Counter Terrorism Command (CTC) - responsible for leading counter-terror and espionage investigations - three other Iranian men were arrested in London on Saturday. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the operations, worked on by hundreds of police officers and staff, were among \"the biggest counter state threat and counter terrorism operations\" in recent years. Cdr Dominic Murphy, the CTC's head, stressed that they were not treating the two investigations into \"separate incidents\" as linked. He said the operations were \"certainly significant and it is unusual for us to conduct this scale of activity\". Four of the five men arrested at locations across England - two aged 29, one aged 40 and another aged 46 - are Iranian nationals. Police said the nationality and age of the fifth were still being established. The men were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester, and remain in police custody. In a video captured by a resident, officers can be seen using an explosive to gain entry to a property. In another, officers carrying firearms and wearing helmets can be seen leading the suspect around the side of a house. Video captured by a member of the public in Swindon shows officers wearing balaclavas and plain clothes, who can be seen dragging a suspect, with clear plastic bags over his arms, through a pedestrianised area. One eyewitness told the BBC that six men entered a cafe the suspect was in and sat opposite him, before ordering coffee and donuts. When the man left, they followed him out and \"jumped on\" him in the street \"just near a Costa coffee\", they said. Police said the investigation that led to the England-wide arrests related to a suspected plot to target a \"specific premises\", which it did not name. The \"affected site\" had been made aware and is being supported by police, the Met added. Cdr Murphy said he was unable to discuss specifics of the alleged plot to target the site. Four of the men were detained under the Terrorism Act. The fifth man was arrested under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Pace) Act. All five were also arrested on suspicion of preparation of an act of terrorism. It is understood that military personnel assisted in the Rochdale raid. The investigation into the five men is being led by the Met's CTC, supported by officers from Greater Manchester Police and Wiltshire Police, as well as counter-terrorism officers from across the country. Cdr Murphy said: \"The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of enquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter.\" Investigators would \"continue to work tirelessly\", he said, adding that there were \"several hundred officers and staff working on this\". In the separate operation, the Met said three men - aged 39, 44 and 55 - were arrested under section 27 the National Security Act at separate addresses in north-west and west London, and had been taken into custody while searches continued. The act covers offences deemed a threat to national security. Section 27 grants police the power to arrest someone without a warrant if they are reasonably suspected of being involved in \"foreign power threat activity\". Cooper said the number and nature of the arrests \"reflects the complexity of the kinds of challenges to our national security that we continue to face\". She thanked police and security services \"for the action they have taken to keep our country safe\". Last year, the head of MI5, Ken McCallum, saidthat since 2022, it had responded to 20 plots backed by Iran, which presented \"potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents\". Additional reporting by Vinnie O'Dowd The Metropolitan Police say there are 'grounds for further investigation' into the videos. The body of the man, aged in his 30s, was found on Wednesday morning near Partridge Chase. Counter-terror police say they are keeping an \"open mind\" as they investigate the attack at HMP Frankland. A 38-year-old man was arrested as he flew in to Stanstead Airport. Turkish national Hakan Barac posted videos celebrating terrorists such as Osama bin Laden.",

    "title": "Royal Family hopes nothing distracts from VE Day commemorations",
    "article_text": "The Royal Family is hoping \"nothing will detract or distract\" from VE Day commemorations this week, which fall days after Prince Harry's interview. The King and Queen are looking forward to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe and the end to World War Two, Buckingham Palace said. Events begin on Monday with a military procession through central London after which members of the Royal Family will appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony. On Friday the Duke of Sussex spoke candidly with the BBC about his estrangement from his father and desire for reconciliation, after losing a court battle over his UK security. It is understood that, out of respect for surviving veterans, Buckingham Palace hopes \"nothing will detract or distract from celebrating with full cheer and proud hearts that precious victory and those brave souls, on this most special and poignant of anniversaries\". King Charles and Queen Camilla will lead the nation in \"celebrating, commemorating and giving thanks to the wartime generation whose selfless devotion duty and service should stand as an enduring example to us all - and must never be forgotten\", a Palace aide said. This year's VE Day commemorations are the first to take place without any of the royals who were present 80 years ago. In 1945, large crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace to catch a glimpse of King George VI, the Queen Mother, a young Queen Elizabeth II, and Princess Margaret. Those present on the balcony this year will watch the traditional Red Arrows flyover. Later in the afternoon, the Royals will also host a tea party for war veterans, their families and other members of the wartime generation in the palace gardens. Then, on 8 May, the King, Queen and other royals will attend a thanksgiving service with veterans at Westminster Abbey before the royal couple attends Horse Guards Parade for a celebratory concert. None of the Royal Family has publicly commented on the interview from Prince Harry. On Friday, he revealed that his father refuses to speak to him and, given King Charles's cancer diagnosis, he does not know how much longer the King has left. The comments came after the duke lost a legal challenge against the British government over his security while in the UK - a decision which he says has left him vulnerable to threats on his life and would prevent his return. Buckingham Palace responded to the interview - which included the prince's claim that his court defeat was an \"establishment stitch-up\" - by saying the issues had been repeatedly examined by the courts which had reached the same conclusion each time. The Home Office, meanwhile, said it was \"pleased\" the judgement was in the government's favour, adding the UK's security system is \"rigorous and proportionate\". I sat down with Prince Harry moments after a UK court ruled he could not have his security reinstated. Caroline Jones is fundraising for Cancer Research UK by only wearing charity shop clothes every day. The Duke of Sussex spoke about his failed legal bid, relationship with King Charles and prospects of returning to the UK. The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family. The prime minister also laid out how he will approach forthcoming talks with President Donald Trump.",

    "title": "Nationalist Simion ahead in Romanian election rerun",
    "article_text": "The nationalist candidate George Simion has won a resounding victory in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. Simion came first with 40% of the vote, and will go into the runoff on 18 May as the clear favourite. Nicusor Dan, the liberal mayor of Bucharest, and Crin Antonescu, candidate of the governing coalition, are tied in second place, with around 21% each. Six months ago, the presidential election in Romania ended in scandal and confusion. It was won by a radical outsider with mystical leanings, Calin Georgescu, but that result was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference. After the polls closed on Sunday Simion thanked those who voted for him. \"It was an act of courage, trust and solidarity,\" he said in a recorded message. \"This election is not about one candidate or another, but about every Romanian who has been lied to, ignored, humiliated, and still has the strength to believe and defend our identity and rights,\" Simion posted on X on Friday. Simion is an admirer of US President Donald Trump. He told the BBC that he believes in a strong Nato, and is in favour of keeping Nato bases and US troops in Romania, if he becomes president. In February, US Vice-President JD Vance sharply criticised Romania for the annulment of the poll, sending shockwaves through a Romanian political establishment that leans heavily on its special relationship with the US.  Georgescu was nevertheless barred from taking part in the rerun. The result is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. The country has a US missile defence shield at Deveselu, and three major airbases from which Nato flies air policing missions up to the border of Ukraine and Moldova, and out over the Black Sea. Ukraine exports 70% of its grain down the Black Sea coast, through Romanian territorial waters, towards Istanbul. The Romanian navy demines those waters, and the Romanian air force trains Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. A visa-waiver agreement was abruptly cancelled on the eve of the election. \"Forget about any more help to Ukraine if Simion becomes president,\" says George Scutaru, a security expert at the New Strategy Center in Bucharest. As head of the National Security Council, the president can veto any decision, and has a strong influence on security policy. But Scutaru expresses \"prudent optimism\" that one of the centrists will win the run-off. But in an interview with the BBC, Simion made it clear he thinks \"Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland and the Baltic states, the problem is this war is not going anywhere.\" He said he hoped the peace talks organised by the Trump administration would result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations. Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian. On a baking May afternoon, crowds of sightseers throng the gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence in the west of Bucharest. The decision by interim President Ilie Bolojan to open the buildings and gardens to the public is very popular among the visitors. White and purple irises line the paths beneath ancient horse chestnuts in full flower. A military band marches among flowerbeds of pansies and violets. The palace is a former monastery, converted in the 17th century, which became home to the Romanian royal family in the 19th century. \"I can't really imagine Simion in here…\" Ionut, a satirical writer, tells me beside an ornate waterfall, looking up at the palace walls. He voted for Simion in the first round of the election last November, out of anger at the constant delays to Romania's full membership of the Schengen free-travel zone. And frustration with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. But Romania finally joined the Schengen land-borders on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. \"Romanians are less angry now,\" he believes. He told his daughter he will vote for Nicusor Dan in this election, but hasn't quite made up his mind. Ana, a management consultant, walking with her family through the palace gardens, also supports Nicusor Dan. \"I want to vote for both continuity and change,\" she says. \"Continuity in Romania's relationship with Europe, but change as far as corruption is concerned. We young people don't relate to the old parties any more,\" - something Nicusor Dan has in common with Simion. Many in Romania's large diaspora  - a million are registered to vote - have already cast their ballots, especially in Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK. They are invisible in opinion polls, and could easily sway the final result.",

    "title": "Bank of mum and dad 'helps half of first-time buyers'",
    "article_text": "More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills. An average of £55,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers, it said. Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase. More recently, changes to stamp duty led to a rush of new buyers before the end of March, but greater costs for anyone who missed that deadline. The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family. This was a slightly lower proportion than the 57% of the previous year, but higher than every other year since 2013. Family assistance peaked in 2009 during the fallout from the financial crisis, when 70% of first-time buyers received help, the estate agency's figures suggest. It estimated 173,500 first-time buyers received assistance last year, receiving a total of £9.6bn. The findings are based on first-time buyer and average loan-to-value data, as well as how this relates to responses from various surveys about family support. The average rate for all new two and five-year fixed mortgages last year was between 5% and 6%, figures from financial information service Moneyfacts show. That rate would be higher for many first-time buyers unable to offer a large deposit, and much higher than a few years earlier. Buyers facing that scenario \"took advantage of greater family support to try and secure a deal at a lower mortgage rate\", according to Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills. \"First-time buyers are still feeling the impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria,\" he said. Many potential first-time buyers have also faced financial strain from the rising cost of living, and particularly from the greater expense of renting, although the latter may have encouraged more to get on to the ladder more quickly. The annual increase in rent paid to private landlords breached 9% last year, forcing manyto live with their parents in their 20s and 30s. Financial assistance varies across the country, as do house prices and average incomes. And stamp duty, which was primarily levied on buyers in the south of England, changed in April. First-time buyers of homes bought for more than £300,000 in England and Northern Ireland must now pay stamp duty, compared with the previous threshold of £425,000. Data suggests that led toa surge in first-time buyer purchasesahead of the deadline. Analysis by the Yorkshire Building Society suggests the first three months of this year saw the highest number of first-time buyer applications since the 2022 post-Covid peak. Mr Cook, from Savills, added that the likelihood of regulators allowing lenders toloosen some of their lending criteriacould also benefit first-time buyers and their families. \"[This means] lowering the barrier for entry and allowing first-time buyers to qualify for larger mortgages,\" he said. \"So, although more first-time buyer activity may mean more bank of mum and dad assistance, this is likely to be at a lower average cost per first-time buyer.\" Government called to take action as over half of London's short-term lets are rented out unlawfully. Statistics Jersey says the turnover of properties is 90% higher in comparison with the 2024. The Honesty Jar helps those struggling financially by offering items for free or at a low cost. There is no data on how widely cash is accepted which puts the UK at risk of becoming cashless, a report warns. The slowdown in the market was expected due to the lowering of thresholds at which buyers need to start paying stamp duty.",

    "title": "Molly-Mae is back, and I Kissed a Boy returns: What's coming up this week",
    "article_text": "This week,Molly-Maereturns to our screens, with the second part of her TV series promising \"exclusive access\" to her life. But that's not all the week has in store. BBC Three'sI Kissed A Boyis back for series two,Sir David Attenborough'sfilm Ocean is released on his 99th birthday, andPinkPantheressisdropping a new album. Read on for what's coming up this week... Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague broke her silence after being photographed apparently kissing her ex, Tommy Fury, at a party. I was at the press event whereshe made the comments, ahead of her new TV series,Molly-Mae: Behind It All. She told me, and the other reporters, that she and Tommy - who announced their split last year - were \"figuring it out as adults, as parents\", adding that the situation was \"really complicated\". So what can we expect from part two of her documentary series, which launches on Prime Video on Friday? We're told that, after the \"media frenzy\" that surrounded the photograph, we will see the former Love Islander \"living her dreams\" at Paris Fashion Week. But the series will also reveal how hard she's finding life on her own at home. Cameras will show her making “life-changing decisions” and taking a trip to give rebuilding her family one last chance. On Sunday, the UK's first ever gay dating show,I Kissed a Boy, returns to BBC Three. Dannii Minogue is heading back to the Masseria in her role as Cupid, while the series is voiced by Layton Williams. The format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry. From then on, you can expect love triangles, budding romance, wandering eyes - and plenty of drama. Pop star Minogue has said she's excited to tell more \"diverse and important stories\", adding: \"I'll have the party started for a wonderful summer of love.\" The first series was praised by critics for its inclusive and positive treatment of gay love, and it was followed swiftly by I Kissed a Girl which aired last year. By Mark Savage, music correspondent Last August, PinkPantheress cancelled all her remaining tour dates – including lucrative support slots with Coldplay and Olivia Rodrigo – to concentrate on her health. \"I've reached a wall which I am struggling to penetrate through,\" she said in a statement to fans. But she's put the downtime to good use. The 23-year-old's new mixtape, Fancy That, is accessible, hypnotic and seductive alt-pop. She's been teasing the project since January, when she posted photos from her home studio, captioned: \"oh we are soooo back #2025.\" Speaking to Mixmag, she said listening to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada had inspired \"the size of the music\". But it's another dance band whose DNA is sprinkled all over the EP. Basement Jaxx get writing credits on four of the five tracks, with PinkPantheress sampling classic 2000s dance hits like Romeo and Good Luck. Elsewhere, she chops in samples of the music she was raised on, from Sugababes to Underworld. In a recent Reddit thread, PinkPantheress said the mixtape represented a \"more fun\" side to her personality than the introspective, \"emo asf\" lyrics of her debut album Heaven Knows. She certainly seems to be having a blast on party-centric club cuts Tonight and Illegal (sample lyric: \"Is this illegal? It feels illegal\"); while Stateside giddily documents a transatlantic love affair. It's all over in about 20 minutes – but what a rush. On Thursday, Sir David Attenborough turns 99 - and the same day sees the release of his new landmark film,Ocean, in cinemas. The documentary promises to take viewers on a \"breath-taking journey\" around the world's seas and oceans, showcasing their vital importance for our survival. Using underwater footage, it will explore the major threats to our oceans, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching. But it also carries a deeply personal message, with Sir David highlighting the opportunity we have to enable marine life to recover. \"After living for nearly 100 years on this planet, I now understand that the most important place on this planet is not on land, but on sea,\" he tells viewers. Correction 4 May 2025: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the release date for the game Sonic Rumble as 8 May. However, on 30 April, Segaannouncedthe release had been postponed indefinitely. The rap mogul denies sex trafficking and racketeering charges, plus dozens of other lawsuits alleging abuse. Joel Oates could not believe his luck when his mum told him she had met McFly at a service station. The film starring Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan also scores well with audiences online.

    "title": "Long-distance romance and closure from husband's death - your memories of Skype",
    "article_text": "From blossoming long-distance love to helping families stay connected, for years Skype held a unique place in people's hearts. In the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites. It allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world. In recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain. Here are just some of the many people whose lives were touched by Skype since it launched in 2003. Weng and Owen Williams have a lot to thank Skype for - it is one of the main reasons they are married. In 2012, Weng left Macau, China to start a six-month internship at a National Trust site in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Feeling a bit homesick, she would speak to friends and family on Skype. She then met Owen, who was also working for the National Trust. At first they were friends, but after Weng returned to Macau, romance blossomed over months of Skype chats and visits to see one another. \"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said. When they decided to embark on a long-distance relationship, Skype was the glue that held it together. They video called every day - including when Weng sent Owen a birthday cake and he cut it in front of her during their chat. \"That was quite sweet,\" she said. \"Skype just kept us going.\" The pair ultimately got engaged, and Weng moved back to Wales in 2015. Now, they are happily married. Like many over the years, Erica from New Zealand used Skype to communicate with a loved one while they were in another part of the world. In her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip. Following his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously. \"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News. \"I had the opportunity to review these messages we had exchanged and realised how they inadvertently documented a period of distress and heartache in our relationship.\" What Erica did next tried to bring some closure to this difficult period in her life. \"I sent a posthumous message to his Skype address to which, I - or he - replied from his computer,\" she said. Erica said she then began a brief conversation back and forth \"over a period of weeks\" - where she would send a message to his Skype address, then reply to herself from his account. \"In this exchange, we responded to each other's messages and questions with all the apologies and regret that we needed to hear from each other,\" she said. \"It helped me to move on. I believed it.\" Since 2003, Susan Bertotti has lived in Chile. Skype has been her way of keeping in touch with her mum Vera, who lives in in Milton Keynes. For the past 15 years, they have spoken to each other every day they are apart on Skype. From sharing Christmas memories to showing each other their gardens in Chile and England, the video call app has been a constant. \"Skype has given my mother and I the most wonderful close connection all these years,\" Susan said. When she became her mum's carer, Susan used the app to deal with all her life admin back in the UK. As the years went on, the family starting using WhatsApp, but they still use Skype to set up their chats. Vera is now 99. \"It is going to be a huge loss to me,\" Susan said. \"I'll be back to making lost-distance calls now on her behalf, and that will be horrible, or I'll have to email. \"I'm so disappointed about losing Skype.\" Being able to call internationally without big fees are an important part of Stan Calderwood's business. On the day it was announced the service would close, he had used it eight times to call estate agents, accountants and lawyers in Canada about the sale of a property there. \"You can't call everyone on WhatsApp, Zoom or Teams,\" he said. \"You do have to call people on their mobiles and their landlines, particularly businesses.\" Stan is now looking for a new low-cost alternative for cheap international calls. While Skype fell away in recent years, it still had millions of users - with the websiteStatista stating it had almost 28 million as of March last year. So what will happen now? Microsoft says Skype's free services will be retired, and users have a choice - move over to Teams, or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history. \"The timing of this shift is driven by the significant advancements and adoption of Microsoft Teams,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson. \"Teams free offers many of the same core features as Skype.\" Meanwhile, the firm says its Skype for Business users areunaffected by the changeand the service will continue. One of those customers is the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Its spokesperson told the BBC the MoD is retiring most of its Skype service as it moves to Teams, but a \"small group of users\" will continue using the business version of Skype. For Skype customers who pay a subscription or have credits to make calls to landlines and mobiles, they will be able to use Skype Dial Pad on Teams. When their credit or subscription ends, there will be no way to continue using it. Skype as we know it is going - and with it, one of the the most recognisable tech products of this century.

    "title": "Colombia's wind farms bring promise and pain for indigenous group",
    "article_text": "When José Luis Iguarán steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea. The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguarán belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing. With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature. \"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguarán says. His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more. \"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguarán adds. The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family. Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguarán says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones. Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions. Mr Iguarán believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. \"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela. His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption. \"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds. These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits. \"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu. \"In Colombia… there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\" In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renováveis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable. One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113. EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023. Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard. And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms. \"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney. For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies. \"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says. This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects. \"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\" By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs. While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix. For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect. One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms. The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits. But it says good community relations are not enough. \"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarría, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\" On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state. Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water. Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jagüeys – reservoirs filled with rainwater. His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit. Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments. The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term. While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark. The president blamed foreign-made movies for the American film industry's \"very fast death\". The online marketplace says it will move to a \"local fulfillment model\" in the US, with sales handled by locally based sellers. Weather influencers can provide useful local information but are also accused of exaggerating conditions.

    "title": "Trump says he won't seek a third term",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has denied that he is considering a third presidential term, a move which experts agree is banned under the US Constitution. \"I'll be an eight-year president, I'll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,\" Trump told NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday. Trump, 78, has previously said that he was \"not joking\" about wanting to serve a third, or even fourth, term as US president. He later said his statements were meant to troll the \"fake news media\". His company, The Trump Organization, has been selling \"Trump 2028\" hats, fuelling armchair speculation that he may seek to remain in office after his second term ends in January 2029. In the interview, recorded from his residence in Florida on Friday, Trump said that he has had many \"requests\" from people asking that he consider seeking to remain in office. \"So many people want me to do it,\" Trump said, just days after celebrating his first 100 days of his second term. \"It's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything else,\" Trump said. He added that \"there are many people selling the 2028 hat\". \"But this is not something I'm looking to do,\" he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Constitution's 22nd Amendment says that \"no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice\". Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country's state-level governments. However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court. Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that \"in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things\". During the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy. \"Look, yeah. Everything's OK,\" he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading theUS economy to shrink for the first time since 2022. \"I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically,\" he added. Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: \"Anything can happen. But I think we're going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.\" He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: \"If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?\" Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues. \"No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. They can have three,\" he said. \"They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.\" Trump was asked about the Fifth Amendment right to due process under the law, which guarantees certain rights to people accused of committing of a crime. Critics have said his deportation plan has violated this process, and that his administration has removed people who have not yet been charged with any crime, and therefore have not had any opportunity to present a legal defence. \"Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?\" asked Welker, suggesting that he could be disregarding the presidential oath of office, which requires him to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\". Trump responded: \"I don't know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.\" Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House must work to \"facilitate\" the return of a migrant who was accidentally deported to jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration has argued that they lack the authority to force the Central American country to return him to the US. Trump said that he could not \"rule out\" using military force to annex Greenland, but suggested that he is not considering a military attack on Canada in order to force the US northern neighbour to become the 51st US state. \"I don't see it with Canada,\" Trump said, days afterCanadian voters chose Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as their prime minister, in a stunning rejection of the Conservative Party. \"They think we are going to protect them, and really we are,\" Trump continued. \"But the truth is, they don't carry their full share, and it's unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.\" Carney is scheduled to visit Trump at the White House on Tuesday. Trump was also asked about his decision to declare an immigration state of emergency on his first day in office, and whether the border is now \"secure\". \"We have the most secure border we've ever had,\" he said, leading Welker to question why the emergency declaration remains in place, after immigration figures showed that illegal crossings have plummeted to the lowest levels in decades. He claimed that the emergency is in the court system, not at the border. \"The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out, and we have some judges that want everybody to go to court,\" he said. \"It's an overall emergency on immigration,\" Trump told NBC, adding that he has no plans to lift the order in the near future.

    "title": "Brazil police thwart bomb attack on Lady Gaga concert",
    "article_text": "Brazilian police said they thwarted a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday. The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, in co-ordination with the justice ministry, said suspects had recruited participants to carry out attacks using improvised explosives and the plan was aimed at gaining notoriety on social media. The person responsible for the plan and a teenager were arrested, the police said. Lady Gaga's team said they learned about the bomb threat only from media reports the morning after the gig. A crowd of more than two million people gathered for the concert, which was free to attend. Police said the group that planned the attack had been spreading hate speech, mainly against children, adolescents and the LGBTQ+ community. The alleged mastermind was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, while the teenager was detained for storing child pornography in Rio. Those responsible were also promoting the radicalisation of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content \"as a form of belonging and challenge among young people\". A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told The Hollywood Reporter: \"We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning. \"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.\" The justice ministry said the suspects had identified themselves as Lady Gaga fans, known widely as \"Little Monsters\". Police issued search warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo, and electronic devices and other materials were seized. \"Operation Fake Monster\" was launched following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered online groups encouraging violence among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism. The concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy, with expectations it could bring in $100m (£75m). In a massive security operation, 5,000 officers were deployed and attendees had to pass through metal detectors. Drones and facial recognition cameras were also used to police the event. Lady Gaga, who last performed in Brazil in 2012, took the stage as part of a tour to promote her eighth album, Mayhem. The singer wore Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. \"You waited for more than 10 years for me,\" an emotional Lady Gaga told the huge crowd, holding out a Brazilian flag. The festival returns for a second weekend in the Californian desert. Here's how to watch at home. Headliners at the California music festival this year include Megan Thee Stallion, Post Malone and Green Day. The Giver singer speaks about her fearlessness and being inspired by Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter. As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame. This week also sees the release of Split Fiction, R-Patz's new film Mickey-17 and Meghan's delayed TV show.",

    "title": "Reform considers legal challenges against asylum hotels",
    "article_text": "Reform UK could take the government to court to prevent migrants being housed in areas where it now controls the local council, party chairman Zia Yusuf told the BBC. Yusuf said his party had pledged to \"resist\" housing asylum seekers in Reform-controlled areas and it would use \"every instrument of power available\", including judicial reviews, to fulfil its pledge. The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers and while councils can object, they have little power to stop it. Reform gained more than 600 seats and took control of 10 local authorities in Thursday's local elections. Asked how Reform could fulfil its pledge to voters, given that contracts to house asylum seekers in hotels were drawn up between the Home Office and accommodation providers, Yusuf said the party was \"realistic\" about the challenge. \"The levers of power at a local level pale in comparison to the levers of power at Westminster,\" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. But he said \"those levers of power will be pulled with all our might by Reform councillors,\" adding: \"There are things you can do, there are judicial reviews, there are injunctions... things around planning, budget allocation.\" He told Laura Kuenssberg:  \"A lot of these hotels... you suddenly turn them into something else which is essentially a hostel that falls foul of any number of regulations - that's what our teams of lawyers are exploring at the moment.\" Asked if Reform UK's policy was to house migrants in tents, as the party's newly elected Greater Lincolnshire mayor Dame Andrea Jenkyns suggested, Yusuf said: \"That's what France does.\" He added: \"We will be publishing a plan to deport everybody who is currently in this country illegally in our first term of government. \"We will publish that plan in the coming weeks and you'll see the full detail.\" In 2021, Labour-controlled Coventry City Council and six other local authorities in the West Midlands took legal action against the Home Office over its asylum-seeker dispersal policy. The policy involves moving asylum seekers to different council areas across the country to help spread the cost of supporting them. But the legal action, known as a judicial review,was withdrawn after the Home Office promised\"a new, fairer asylum dispersal system\". The government says it is determined to end the use of asylum hotels over time and cut the \"unacceptably high\" costs of accommodation. But figures from March showalmost 40,000 migrants are still housed in hotels. In his Laura Kuenssberg interview, Zia Yusuf also said that Reform councillors \"will cut waste\", and will target spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives. Challenged on how much money this would save, he said places like Lincolnshire County Council, whichReform won control of from the Conservatives, \"do spend considerable money on DEI initiatives\". He said Reform UK will \"send teams in, task forces\" and that \"we're now going to have access to the contracts and we're going to make these changes.\" Conservative  leader Kemi Badenoch said Reform had done well in Thursday's polls because Nigel Farage was \"expressing the feeling of frustration that a lot of people around the country are feeling\". But she said he does not have a record in government and \"now he is going to be running some councils - we'll see how that goes\". Asked if Farage could be the next prime minister, she said \"anything is feasible\", noting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had won re-election this week after trailing in the polls. But she added: \"My job is to make sure that he [Farage] does not become prime minister because he does not have the answers to the problems the country is facing.\" Labour Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he now treats Reform UK as a \"serious opposition force\". He told Sky News: \"It's not yet clear whether at the next general election it will be Reform or the Conservatives that are Labour's main challengers, but we've got to take that threat seriously. \"In that spirit, I think Reform does deserve more air time and scrutiny of their policies.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond. The York MP Rachael Maskell says government policies have led to voters looking elsewhere. The new mayor for Greater Lincolnshire says she will be meeting with a fracking company. Reform UK's Thomas Kerr says the Reform leader is excited by the opportunity for his party in Scotland. Reform UK pledges to end diversity roles after taking control of Durham County Council. Reform are being forecast in several polls to do well in next year's Holyrood elections.",

    "title": "Woman missing since 1962 found 'alive and well'",
    "article_text": "A woman missing for nearly 63 years has been found alive and well after the case into her disappearance was reviewed, police in the US state of Wisconsin said. Audrey Backeberg was 20 years old when she disappeared from her home in the small city of Reedsburg on 7 July 1962. In a statement, Sauk County Sheriff Chip Meister said Ms Backeberg's disappearance \"was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play\". The sheriff said she was living outside Wisconsin, but did not provide any further details. According to Wisconsin Missing Persons Advocacy, a non-profit group, Ms Backeberg was married and had two children when she went missing. The group said that days before she went missing, Ms Backeberg, now 82, had filed a criminal complaint against her husband, whom she had married at the age of 15, alleging he had beaten her and threatened to kill her. On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked. The couple's 14-year-old babysitter told police she and Ms Backeberg then hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin's state capital, and from there caught a bus to Indianapolis, Indiana, about 300 miles (480km) away. The babysitter then became nervous and wanted to return home, but Ms Backeberg refused and was last seen walking away from the bus stop. The Sauk County Sheriff's Office said investigators pursued numerous leads in the case but it had gone cold before a comprehensive review of old case files was carried out earlier this year. The detective who solved the case, Isaac Hanson,told local news station WISNthat an online ancestry account belonging to Ms Backeberg's sister was crucial in helping locate the missing woman. Det Hanson said he contacted local sheriffs where Ms Backeberg now lives, and spoke to her on the phone for 45 minutes. \"I think she just was removed and, you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and led her life,\" he told WISN. \"She sounded happy. Confident in her decision. No regrets.\" President Trump says the famous island prison off San Francisco is to be reopened to house \"ruthless and violent\" offenders.

    "article_text": "Fans of Ed Sheeran have been treated to a \"surprise\" gig at a pub in his home county that he is taking over for a fortnight. The Thomas Wolsey in Ipswich town centre has been re-branded as The Old Phone - named after one of Sheeran's latest songs. The pub will be known by that name for two weeks, before it reverts to its actual name again. Music-lovers have been speaking of their delight at seeing the global star perform on their doorstep. Rachel Clements, 28, from Stowmarket, said she was \"very excited that he's doing something this small, in our home town\". Ms Clements said she was hoping to hear his latest track and new material from his Play album, which includes a song called Old Phone. \"We had one of his songs as our wedding song last year, so in a way I'm hoping he'll do that,\" she added. Ms Clements was among the many fans who responded to an Ed Sheeran WhatsApp message to get tickets. People were also waiting to see if they might be let in if there was space. It is the latest instalment of Sheeran's pop-up pub concept. He has previously opened versions of The Old Phone inIpswich, Massachusetts, US,for one night, and another one at theCoachella festival in California. Alyssa Ali, 20, from Florida in the US, had been in London where she has been studying for a month. She fortuitously decided to come to Ipswich this weekend, as part of her travels around the UK. Sheeran grew up in Framlingham, about 15 miles north of Ipswich, but he is known for being an avid Ipswich Town fan and has sponsored their shirts, and heplayed gigs at other pubs in the townbefore  he became famous. \"I love Ed and have been a fan for a decade,\" said Ms Ali. \"So I had to come to his hometown and go around Ipswich, and I was here yesterday, and then he decided to pop-up here in this pub, and my hotel's eight minutes walk from there, so we ran over here as soon as I found out, hoping to get in. \"I'm so nervous because I don't know if I'll be able to get in. I'm just so excited to be in his presence again.\" She said she was very much looking forward to hearing his new songs. Michael Marron, 38, from Ipswich, was also hoping to see Sheeran perform. \"Delighted, we saw him do this show in America and we were wondering if he would do something like this in Ipswich. \"It's great that he's come back to Ipswich and he's entertaining the people of Suffolk.\" Sheeran is known for playing impromptu gigs in Suffolk's county town, includingone on the Town Hall steps in 2022. \"It's a buzz, and he always goes the extra mile for the people of Suffolk,\" said Mr Marron. \"I remember he was here not so long ago and hegifted a guitarto a primary school child. It's great to see celebrities do that.\" It is understood music bloggers, influencers and selected fans were invited or picked at random toattend the gig. Last week, the musician announced aa run of three gigsat Ipswich Town's Portman Road in July. He is also aminority stakeholderin the club, which has just been relegated from the Premier League.

    "title": "Marvel's Thunderbolts* proves a hit at box office",
    "article_text": "Marvel and Disney's newest release Thunderbolts* has proved a hit at the box office, after taking an estimated $162m (£122m) internationally. The film, which both production houses hope will kickstart a new franchise, is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles. It stars Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan in two of the main roles, alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Harbour. Whilst not all critic reviews have been favourable, the movie has been a hit with superhero fans - drawing in an impressive 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. It means the film receives the third highest audience score for a Marvel title, tying with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shangi-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Not all critics have not treated the film as favourably, withEmpire's John Nugentnoting that the film is \"missing a bit of colour - literally, in the washed-out palette and CG shadow-threat that dominates the latter half of the film — and figuratively, in its subject matter\". He adds that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are \"not always sensitively handled\". Radheyan Simonpillai at The Guardiangives the film three stars, citing that although the film is \"the best thing to come from the brand [Marvel] since WandaVision\", \"Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface\". Simonpillai is full of praise for Pugh though, \"who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little\". However,Clarisse Loughrey from The Independentlooks on the film a little more favourably, giving it four stars and calling it \"the best Marvel movie in years\". \"Thunderbolts does feel different to what's come before. \"It's the first of its kind to seem genuinely self-aware - Thunderbolts might actually then be the ultimate Marvel film for now,\" she adds. Audience fatigue when it comes to Marvel films is a genuine concern for the studio, which has been trying to pivot away from the characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe since the release of Avengers: Endgame in 2019. It is perhaps whyDeadpool & Wolverine was a big hitfor Marvel last summer, as it featured characters that have been less front and centre for them, with Thunderbolts* potentially following a similar path. Sir David Attenborough's new film and PinkPantheress's new album are also out this week.

    "article_text": "Zhao Xintong could become the first amateur player to triumph at the Crucible Zhao Xintong holds an 11-6 overnight lead after three-time winner Mark Williams steadied the ship on day one of the World Championship final at the Crucible Theatre. The 28-year-old dominated the opening session to open up a 7-1 advantage but Williams, who is the oldest Crucible finalist, took five of the nine frames on offer in Sunday's second session, including a tense 17th frame. It gives the Welshman, 50, a glimmer of hope when play resumes on Monday, although no player has previously overturned a deficit of more than four frames going into the second day of a World final. While Zhao can be confident of becoming the first Chinese player to be crowned world champion and only the third player from outside the UK to win the title since 1997, Williams will rue what might have been despite his mini recovery. Having looked out-of-sorts early in the day, Williams also crucially lost the sixth and 16th frames when his opponent cleared the table after he had crafted half-century breaks, only to then miss the frame-deciding ball. While Zhao was unable to maintain the dominance he exhibited in the early part of the match, he was still able to add four more half-centuries to the breaks of 77, 100, 57, 104 and 83 that he compiled in the opening session. Zhao, who won the UK Championship in 2021 but then served a 20-month ban for his involvement ina match-fixing scandalwhich rocked the sport, is hoping to join Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy as the only qualifiers to land snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to South Yorkshire. He would also become the first amateur to win in Sheffield, while the Â£500,000 top prize would lift him to 11th in the world rankings when he returns to the main professional tour next season. The best-of-35 final continues on Monday at 13:00 BST and will be shown live on BBC Two. All the updates from day one of the World Snooker Championship final Match-fixing scandal to Crucible final - fall and rise of Zhao World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage This video can not be played Zhao Xintong 'outplays the master tactician' in the third frame With Zhao having swept seven-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan aside in the semi-finals, his meeting with Williams - another ofsnooker's famed 'Class of 92'- has been billed as having the potential to be a changing-of-the-guard moment for the sport. The age gap of 22 years is the biggest ever between two Crucible finalists and Zhao was just three years old when Williams won his first World Championship in 2000. Williams jokingly made reference to playing Zhao in an exhibition when he was only a schoolboy after defeating Judd Trump on Saturday. However, he was unable to replicate the performance he produced against the world number one, when at times he barely looked like missing a pot. Instead he spent Sunday evening on a salvage operation after an error-strewn opening session left him in trouble against an opponent who settled into his first world final with consummate ease. While Zhao had 24 hours off after defeating O'Sullivan with a session to spare, Williams will hope not to go the way of the previous two finalists to finish their semi-finals on Saturday evenings. Both Jak Jones (7-1) and Mark Selby (6-2) suffered in the first session of the 2023 and 2024 finals and were ultimately unable to turn those contests around against eventual champions Kyren Wilson and Luca Brecel. And Williams will have to break new ground if he is to triumph and eclipse the 10-6 deficit that he (2000 v Matthew Stevens), Stephen Hendry (1992 v Jimmy White) and Shaun Murphy (2005 v Stevens) have previously reversed in Crucible finals.

    "title": "Bayern's 'James Bond' - how Kane clinched his first trophy",
    "article_text": "Bayern's 'James Bond' - how Kane clinched his first trophy For all the goals and individual accolades, Harry Kane has long been hit with criticism - that he had never won a trophy with club or country. \"There are many people who, throughout my career, only talk about the fact I haven't won a title yet,\" the England captain said recently, as Bayern Munich's Bundesliga crown began to look more inevitable. \"It would be nice to silence a few of them.\" Kane even saw the irony in the fact his 14-year wait for a senior trophy might end while he watched on from the stands as Bayern faced RB Leipzig on Saturday, having been handed a one-game suspension following his fifth yellow card of the season last week. \"It's kind of my story that I'll miss the Leipzig game,\" said the 31-year-old. \"But no worries, I'll celebrate more than anyone else.\" Kane even made his way to the touchline ready to join the party until a stoppage-time Leipzig leveller meant the wait was delayed by a day when second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg on Sunday. That saw Vincent Kompany's side secure the German title, and means Kane has finally put to rest the notion that a glittering individual career may finish without any silverware. The striker had been following the Leverkusen game with fellow England international Eric Dier and the rest of their Bayern team-mates, and posted a video on social media of them singing \"we are the champions\" after the title was confirmed. \"I'm thrilled for him because he deserves it so much,\" former Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jurgen Klinsmann told BBC Sport. \"He has proven it throughout the last 10 years. His numbers are absolutely insane and he will do that for another couple of years because he's in top shape still, he's fit, he's hungry. \"I'm really happy for him. I just love to watch him.\" Harry Kane's debut ended in defeat by RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup Kane's career has not followed the trajectory one might expect for England's all-time record goalscorer. As an under-14s player at Tottenham, according to former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe, he \"wasn't even on the podium\" when it came to the age-group's top talents. He was still a youth player the last time Spurs won a trophy, the League Cup in 2008, but earned his breakthrough with the first-team squad and signed his first professional deal in July 2010. Then there were hard-grafting loan spells with Leyton Orient in League One and in the Championship with Millwall and Leicester, as well as with Norwich in the Premier League. Once Kane established himself at White Hart Lane, he blossomed into Spurs' best homegrown player of a generation, becoming the club's all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 games and climbing to second in the Premier League ranks with 213, behind only Alan Shearer's 260. Yet for all the goals, and three Premier League Golden Boots, a decade in lilywhite yielded only a series of near-misses - a Champions League final defeat by Liverpool, twice runners-up in the League Cup and beaten to the title in successive seasons by Leicester and Chelsea. That story repeated itself with England, as they were runners-up at the past two European Championships and beaten in the 2018 World Cup semi-final by Croatia, despite Kane winning the Golden Boot in Russia seven years ago and finishing as joint top-scorer at last summer's Euros. \"I always said that if Harry leaves Spurs, he will get the opportunity to win titles,\" added Klinsmann, who also won his only championship after leaving Tottenham for Bayern in 1995. Indeed, trophies seemed like a foregone conclusion when Kane joined Bayern for an initial 100m euros (Â£86.4m) in August 2023 - a club who had won 11 successive Bundesliga titles before his arrival. Kane even had a shot at silverware on his debut, but Bayern lost 3-0 to RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup at Allianz Arena with the England captain coming off the bench for the final half hour. Was he cursed? When Bayern were then knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken, some may have believed so. Leverkusen ran away with the league as Bayern finished third, their lowest position since 2011, while Thomas Tuchel's side were beaten by eventual winners Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals. \"People made bad jokes about him,\" explained Taufig Khalil, commentator for ARD Radio. \"Bayern Munich won the German championship 11 years in a row, Harry Kane came for 100m-plus and the next season Bayern Munich did not win a single trophy! \"It was tough for him. He came to Munich because he knew this is the club where you can win trophies, where you will be on top. And then he came and it was a very bad season last year.\" Harry Kane enjoys Munich's Oktoberfest Kane never wavered in his desire to keep improving after becoming the Bundesliga's record signing. He spoke recently about studying the game's greats and having the drive to consistently be one of the world's best. He has dealt with the pressure of essentially replacing Robert Lewandowski, who left in 2022 as Bayern's second all-time scorer behind Gerd Muller. \"Bayern Munich has a huge tradition of number nines,\" explained Klinsmann. \"There is always a special eye on them. To fill that spot is just an honour. It's something very special. He knows that he is followed closely by everyone.\" And not just in Munich - Khalil said rival fans see it as a privilege to have Kane in Germany: \"When the captain of the Three Lions is playing in the Bundesliga - wow, that's big!\" Yet there is no superstar ego on boy from east London. He is regarded as incredibly professional and a leader among the squad - a player a lot of his younger team-mates look up to and someone who is very respectful, whether that be in training or completing the many media and partner obligations that come with representing a European giant like Bayern. \"He has a royal approach,\" added Khalil. \"When he enters the stadium, he greets everybody, he is very friendly. If there is a moment he doesn't want to talk in the mixed zone, then he excuses himself. A lot of other players walk through with headphones on or use the telephone and try not to look in the eyes of the media. \"Normally he stops, he is always ready to talk. He is an absolutely leading person in that club. He gives a lot of that James Bond gratitude - he is the striker with the licence to score!\" Kane has thrown himself into life in Munich, embracing the culture, trips to Oktoberfest, visiting supporters' clubs and taking German lessons, even if he has previously joked his kids will learn the language before him. \"What he's done extremely well is adapt to Bavaria with so much ease,\" said Klinsmann. \"He became part of the lifestyle, the city and his family just fit into the way of life there. \"It's an international place, Munich, so it's not too problematic but still, you've got to go to another country and keep your work-rate at the highest level while figuring out that your family are comfortable and having a good time.\" He is popular, too. Kane quickly struck up a friendship with Bayern's all-time leading appearance-maker Thomas Muller, who will leave at the end of the season, and is known to play golf with the Germany forward and midfielder Konrad Laimer, among others. Naturally, he is also good friends with former Spurs team-mate Eric Dier, another player well-liked throughout the squad, with both England internationals regarded as being important to team chemistry at Bayern. \"The people love him,\" added Klinsmann. \"He is just himself. He is humble and down to earth. He focuses on what is important and for him, that is scoring goals.\" Eric Dier joined England team-mate Harry Kane at Bayern in January 2024 After six final defeats - three with Spurs, two with England and one with Bayern - the humble yet ruthless goal-getter's perseverance has paid off. Kane's first German title is Bayern Munich's 34th, but there can be no doubting the Englishman's importance to Kompany's side. \"It helps when you have a top player who wants to run and fight for the team like a youth player,\" said the former Manchester City and Belgium captain. \"I played against him as an opponent and he has become better with age.\" Kane is the division's top scorer with 24 goals and has 36 in all competitions this season, having scored 11 in the Champions League. That was a competition in which Bayern were desperate to reach the final at their home stadium in Munich, but Kane missed a big chance in the quarter-final first leg against Inter and, despite scoring in the return in Milan, they were knocked out. \"At the end, we talked with him and he said, 'yeah, everybody is right to expect me to make that goal, I didn't do it, that's fate,'\" said Khalil, shrugging off critics who suggest Kane does not score in \"big games\". \"Whenever there are bad moments, after the match, in the mixed zone, Harry walks through and he stops, he is talking, he accepts the situation.\" Bayern were also knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen, but in the Bundesliga - bar a brief wobble in March when they lost at home to lowly Bochum - Kompany's side, with Kane at its heart, have led from the front. His form during this title run is a continuation of what began in his debut season, where he netted 36 times - only Gerd Muller and Lewandowski have scored more in a single Bundesliga campaign. \"The team clicks well with the players around him,\" said Klinsmann. \"He plays in a system that he's getting fed by attacking midfielders. \"He's extremely important to the Bayern side and he's done a fantastic job from day one.\" In April, he became the fastest player to hit 60 goals in the competition, doing so in 60 appearances to break Erling Haaland's record by five games. He also registered 15 assists in that time to average a goal involvement every 72 minutes. \"He fights, he works, he scores an incredible number of goals,\" added Bayern's honorary president Uli Hoeness. \"No-one deserves it more than him.\" Harry Kane reached 60 Bundesliga goals in as many games, the fastest player to do so Khalil believes more trophies will follow for Kane, and Bayern's focus will soon switch to winning the Fifa Club World Cup in the United States this summer. \"The moment Bayern Munich went out of the Champions League, they started to talk about the Club World Cup,\" he said. \"It's another big trophy, an international trophy, and they would make a lot of money.\" That could play a role in Kane's future and whether Bayern can afford to add widely linked, but expensive, target Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen. \"Everybody wants him to stay,\" said Khalil, with Kane's contract running until 2027. \"The question is, would Florian Wirtz together with Jamal Musiala, the two German youngsters playing side by side, work with a central box striker and how much money do you want to spend on Harry Kane for next season? \"For me, that's stupid, I definitely see him next year in the Bundesliga. They have to find another way to finance Florian Wirtz. \"I think we will see Harry Kane for at least another year.\" Additional reporting by Charlotte Coates.

    "title": "Palmer's brilliance could be key moment in Chelsea's Champions League quest",
    "article_text": "Cole Palmer celebrates after ending a run of 1,162 minutes without a goal in Chelsea's win against Liverpool Cole Palmer's talent is worthy of the highest Champions League stage, so it was fitting he was back to his brilliant best to push Chelsea closer to a return to Europe's elite tournament. The stunning form that inspired the Blues early in the season, making them title dark horses at one point, deserted him as he went 18 games in all competitions without a goal, leaving them with a fight on their hands to reach the top five. But when Chelsea and head coach Enzo Maresca needed him, Palmer was the inspiration behind their 3-1 win against newly crowned Premier League champions Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. The visitors, understandably, carried an air of lethargy following the emotional high of securing their 20th title in front of an ecstatic Anfield last weekend, but Chelsea still needed to take advantage and their lavishly gifted 22-year-old was the catalyst. This was Palmer at his best, a hive of industry and creation that illustrated exactly why he is central to all of his side's hopes for success. His dip in form has become a widespread topic of conversation, but he insists his own feelings and attitude have never changed â along with his refusal to study any social media opinions. Palmer was involved in all three goals, with a run through the centre before sending a sweeping pass out to Pedro Neto to set up Enzo Fernandez's third-minute opener. Palmer then produced a brilliant run to beat Kostas Tsimikas in the 56th minute, his low cross a source of such chaos in Liverpool's defence that captain Virgil van Dijk lashed his a clearance against team-mate Jarell Quansah and into his own net. He was unfortunate not to end his goal drought earlier than he did, when another superb incursion into the area ended with a shot from a tight angle that beat Liverpool keeper Alisson but hit the post. Palmer's dry spell ended with almost the last kick of the game, a penalty in the sixth minute of added time, and dispatched with confidence to end that worrying sequence stretching back to a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth on 14 January. The wait for a goal was over after 1,162 minutes. Chelsea beat champions Liverpool to bolster top-five hopes Chelsea win 'important' in Champions League race - but who will prevail? This video can not be played How 'absolutely outstanding' Palmer 'destroyed' Liverpool These were Palmer's big moments but he had an overall impact on a game that was so crucial to Chelsea, who are now only behind fourth-placed Newcastle United on goals scored â 62 against 66 â with the same goal difference of plus-21. It perfectly sets up their visit to Tyneside on Sunday, 11 May, for their next Premier League game. This was a complete performance from Palmer, who had the most shots (five), created the most chances (four), made the joint-most passes ending in the final third (13), and had the joint-most touches in the opposition box (eight) of any Chelsea player. His worth is further underlined by the fact that, even factoring in his lean spell, he now has 37 goals in 67 league games for Chelsea - putting him 10th on the club's all-time league top scorers list. \"I just felt normal,\" said Palmer. \"Obviously it happens, I went three months without scoring but it just gives me more fight and motivation to do more for myself and for the team. \"Getting chances and not scoring, it feels like you're letting your team down. I feel like I am mentally strong anyway. I feel pride in helping the team and if I'm not doing that, I'm not happy. \"Social media nowadays is full of idiots, the trolls and whatever. I don't pay any attention to that. I've scored and I'm happy, but it's only one and I've got to keep improving and try to reach new levels.\" Head coach Maresca never doubted his key man as he added: \"We see him day to day on the training ground and he is always the same, working hard and seeming happy. \"He is unhappy when he is not scoring because he is someone who only wants to help the team and the club.\" Palmer's team-mate Moises Caicedo, who was brought down by Quansah for Chelsea's late penalty, joined the chorus of praise as he said:  \"He deserves it. He is working hard to get goals. Now was his opportunity and he scored. \"Cole is an amazing guy. He always train hard, we are so happy for him. He helps us a lot even when he didn't score. He's a great guy and deserves everything.\" The scale of the celebrations at Stamford Bridge among fans and players showed how much this victory meant, and also what Palmer means to Chelsea. Goalkeeper Robert Sanchez ran the length of the pitch to join in the scenes of elation as the forward disappeared under a collection of blue shirts. If this does prove to be the day when Palmer finally rediscovered his golden touch, it came with perfect timing for the Londoners. A place in the Champions League will make life a lot easier for Maresca and everyone at Chelsea as they contemplate defining fixtures against those fighting with them for those precious places to end their season. Aside from the trip to Newcastle, they will visit Nottingham Forest - currently three points behind in sixth place - on 25 May, the final day of the campaign. These days will shape Chelsea's destiny for next season. And with Palmer in the sort of form that tormented Liverpool, his side will feel they are approaching the final fences in good shape.

    "title": "Trump says he ‘doesn’t rule out’ using military force to control Greenland",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpwould not rule out using military force to gain control ofGreenland, the world’s largest island and an autonomous territory withinDenmark, a fellow Nato member with the US. Since taking office, the US president hasrepeatedly expressed the ideaof US expansion into Greenland, triggering widespread condemnation and unease both on the island itself and in the global diplomatic community. Greenland is seen as strategically important both for defense and as a future source of mineral wealth. In an interview on NBC’s Meet The Press on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he would rule out using force against the territory. “I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We needGreenlandvery badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,” Trump said. The exchange came as part of wide-ranging interview following Trump’s first100-days in officelast week and he was also asked about the idea of using military force againstCanada– an idea once unthinkable but now a subject of speculation amid Trump’s repeated assertion he would like to make Canada the US’s 51st state. “It’s highly unlikely. I don’t see it withCanada. I just don’t see it, I have to be honest with you,” Trump said. Trump said he had spoke with Canada’s new prime minister,Mark Carney, and confirmed that the pair had not spoken about making his country part of the US. But he said they could discuss the topic when Carney visits Washington DC “this week or next week”. Carney, along with around 90% of Canadians, oppose the idea of folding Canada into the US. But Trump said he was open to a discussion. “I’ll always talk about that. You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200bn a year,” Trump said. “We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy. We have more than they do. We don’t want their lumber. We have great lumber. All I have to do is free it up from the environmental lunatics.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Trump said that if “Canada was part of the US it wouldn’t cost us. It would be great … it would be a cherished state. And, if you look at our map, if you look at the geography – I’m a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago – was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize.” “What a beautiful country it would be,” he added. A poll published last month found that 68% of Americans believe Trump is serious about the US trying to take over Greenland, and 53% think Trump is serious when he talks about the US trying to take control of Canada. But the survey,commissioned by ABC Newsfound that respondents didn’t think either annexation would be a good idea. About 86% said they opposed the US trying to take control of Canada, and 76% opposed trying to take control of Greenland.",

    "title": "US jury’s $30m verdict brings hope for Cuban exiles over confiscated land",
    "article_text": "Long before it became one of Cuba’s most popular tourist destinations in the 1990s, the small island of Cayo Coco, with itspristine beaches and powdery white sands, attracted a different kind of clientele. Inspired by its unspoiled beauty, and his observations of shack-dwelling fishermen scratching out a meager living, Ernest Hemingway set scenes from two of his most famous books there, including the 1952 classic The Old Man and the Sea. Then came the giant all-inclusive mega-resort hotels that have proliferated in recent decades along the island’s northern coast, and brought in millions of desperately needed dollars for alargely destitute Cuban government. Now, there’s a bitterly contestedmultimillion-dollar lawsuitthat has implications for the descendants of dozens of Cuban exiles in the US who have beenfighting for decadesfor compensation for land and property seized following Fidel Castro’s 1959 communist revolution. Mario Echeverría, head of a Cuban American family in Miami that says it owned Cayo Coco, and saw it stolen from them in Castro’saggressive land reforms,won a $30m verdictthis month from the travel giant Expedia after a two-week trial. The jury said Expedia, and subsidiaries Orbitz and hotels.com, illegally profited from promoting and selling vacation packages at hotels there. The rare lawsuit was one of the first brought under Title III of the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as theHelms-Burton Act. The act was designed to finally open a legal pathway for such compensation claims, but was suspended by successive presidents until Donald Trump made the decision to activate it in 2019. The intention was to deter US and international companies from investing inCubaby exposing them to potentially huge financial penalties for conducting business there. For Echeverría, who reminisced about his grandmother tending the beachfront at Cayo Coco in a moving Spanish-languageinterview with UniVista TVearlier this year, the verdict is not the end of the story. He and his family may never see a penny after Federico Moreno, the district court judge overseeing the case, paused the award and set a further hearing for August seeking “specific evidence” that the family itself legally acquired the land on Cuba’s independence from Spain in 1898. The only other previously adjudicated Helms-Burton penalty, a $439m illegal tourism ruling in 2022 against four major cruise lines operating from Havana, wasoverturned last year. An appeals court said a claim by descendants of the original dock owners was essentially out of time. A handful of other cases, meanwhile, have stalled – including one by the oil giant Exxon Mobil that claims various Cuban state corporations areprofiting from its confiscated land. But those at the forefront of the fight for justice say the Expedia case in particular brings hope to scores of others pursuing compensation for property they insist was illegally seized. “There are 45 other suits that are making their way through the courts, there may be more new ones after this verdict also,” said Nicolás Gutiérrez, president of the National Association of Sugar Mill Owners of Cuba. Gutiérrez is a Miami-based consultant who has worked with hundreds of dispossessed exiles and their families, in addition to pursuing amends for his own family’s lost houses, farmland and mills. “We are hopeful that this is just the beginning. We waited 23 years, from 1996 to 2019, to have the key provisions of Title III be put into effect by President Trump, and now there’s new generations of families in these cases I’m working with,” he said, adding: “The old guys back then are gone, but in many cases their kids have continued with their crusade. Some have given up, some have been sort of reactivated along the way, and it’s not only justice for the families, it’s like a historic and moral commitment. We sacrificed and built up prosperity in Cuba that was taken for no good reason.” Gutiérrez also believes that desperate conditions on the island could hasten the fight. “They never recovered from the pandemic with tourism. The sugar, nickel and rum industries, and tobacco to a lesser extent, have been run into the ground. Remittances and trips are going to be further cut by the Trump administration, and that’s really what they’re relying on now,” he said. “They don’t even have electricity for more than a couple hours a day. “Someday, relatively soon, there will be a big change, and if a future Cuba wants to attract the serious level of investment it will need to dig itself out of the hole that this totalitarian nightmare has dug over the last 66 years, what better way to inspire confidence than to recognize the victims of the illegal confiscations?” Analysts of Cuban politics say the government is taking notice of the Helms-Burton actions. These analysts are also looking into the ramifications of Trump’sexistingandplanned crackdownsdesigned to increase financial pressure on the communist regime. “There are people looking at the impact it’s having overall in the investment scenario in the island, and apparently it’s having some chilling effect,” saidSebastian Arcos, director of Florida International University’s Cuban Research Institute. “The most important chilling effect is the fact that the Cuban economy is going nowhere, and everybody knows it. “The government stole properties from many thousands of Cubans, and what we’re seeing now is a systematic attempt of many of the people who inherited these claims from their families not to try to recover, because it’s impossible to recover anything as long as the Cuban regime is there, but at least to punish the regime financially for doing what they did.” It’s unclear if Echeverría’s family will become the first to actually receive compensation, but with stretches of Cayo Coco’s northern coastline now consumed by the concrete of almost a dozen super-resorts offering more than 5,000 hotel rooms, they accept the land will not be returned. Their attorney, Andrés Rivero, saidin a statement: “This is a major victory not only for our client, but also for the broader community of Cuban Americans whose property was wrongfully taken and has been exploited by US companies in partnership with the Cuban communist dictatorship. “We are proud to have played a role in securing justice under a law that had never before been tested before a jury.” Expedia did not reply to specific questions. A spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, which we do not believe was supported by the law or evidence. We believe the court was correct to decline immediate entry of judgment and look forward to the court’s consideration of the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury.”",

    "title": "Victorian Labor was bracing for a federal backlash – now Jacinta Allan sees vindication",
    "article_text": "If anyone is as happy asAnthony Albaneseright now, it’s Jacinta Allan. As the federal election results rolled in on Saturday night, one of the biggest surprises came in Victoria – where Labor defied months of grim predictions tostrengthen its grip on the state. Despiterelentless commentaryabout Allan’s unpopularity and thesupposed drag she posed on the Labor vote– not just from the Liberals but by her own federal colleagues – the state swung even harder to the party than it did in 2022. According to Poll Bludger, Labor’s two-party-preferred vote in the state sits at 54.8 to 45.2. Labor not only held Aston – a seat in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs it won at a 2023 byelection but had written off this campaign, pulling out resources weeks ago – but also won nearby Deakin and Menzies off the Liberals. Neither were on Labor’s target list. In Menzies, there wasn’t even a field organiser on the ground. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Other suburban seats targeted by the Liberals such as Chisholm, Dunkley and McEwen also swung further to Labor, while talk about strongholds such as Bruce, Hawke and Gorton being under threat proved to be rubbish. It’s a devastating result for the Coalition in a state they desperately needed to turn around. At best, the Liberal party could emerge with just seven out of 38 acrossVictoria– as many seats as their Nationals partners. The Liberals didn’t see this coming – and neither did Labor. “We were expecting the Luftwaffe to come in and completely decimate us – instead, we got Dutton on a lame pony,” one senior Victorian Labor source said. “Their campaign was an absolute joke.” State Labor figures had braced for a swing away from the party – expecting a drop of between 1.5% to 2.5% while members of state caucus were questioning whether Allan’s leadership could survive a loss of more than three federal seats. A challenge was seen as inevitable if key seats fell. Such was the fear internally that Albanese appeared with Allan just once during the campaign. In the final fortnight, she held only two metropolitan press conferences, well away from the campaign trail – one at a Lego Star Wars exhibition, where she posed with Darth Vader, raising a few eyebrows. But Allan has emerged unscathed. A Victorian Labor MP from her socialist left faction said the result should “put any leadership speculation to bed”. “The hysteria around Jacinta’s leadership has been ridiculous,” another Labor MP said. “It was unfair to tie her to the result of a federal poll, but if that’s the barometer for success, then this result should shut her detractors up.” Others, however, expressed caution, noting Victorians were able to differentiate between the state and federal government. One MP said federal Labor’s funding commitments for suburban roads and Melbourne airport would have resonated with voters. Another said the election was won on federal issues – tax cuts, Medicare and the response to a second Trump presidency. But Allan wasn’t having it. On Sunday, she went as far as crediting the result to “Victorian initiatives” such as investment in women’s health and free Tafe that have now been adopted federally. “It demonstrates very clearly that federal and state Labor share the same values,” she told reporters. To Allan and many of her MPs, the result was also a vindication of theSuburban Rail Loop– the state government’s flagship 90km underground line linking Cheltenham to Werribee. “Four elections now – it has been backed time and time again by the Victorian community,” Allan said, pointing to the results in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Others within Labor credited the result to strong support from Chinese Australian voters in the eastern suburbs – many of whom saw Peter Dutton as hostile to China. “It had nothing to do with the SRL but it’s very politically advantageous for the premier to say that,” one federal Labor source said. Allan’s critics, meanwhile, pointed to Bendigo – the premier’s home town, where Labor MP Lisa Chesters suffered a swing of about 10% – as evidence not all is well. But those close to the premier argue if she can navigate a difficult state budget later this month, she will get to preside over the long-awaited openings of two major infrastructure projects – the Metro Tunnel and the West Gate Tunnel – giving her a real chance to build lasting momentum. The real crisis now lies with the Liberal party. Speaking to Victorian Liberal MPs, the same issues that plagued previous elections keep resurfacing: poor candidate selection, lack of policy depth, little engagement with women and an obsession with culture wars and fringe issues. “Victoria is not a conservative state,” one Liberal MP said. “When are they going to get that into their heads?” Another said the Liberals had failed to attract young voters: “My daughter said she woke up on Sunday to the promise of 20% less Hecs debt. That tells you everything.” Liberal strategist turned pollster Tony Barry laid the blame squarely at the feet of the Victorian division, calling it a “broken institution” that sabotaged its own campaign. The party’s internal turmoil stretches back to 2023, when then leader John Pesutto led the push to expel Moira Deeming from the party room – a move that triggered a defamation suit Deeming later won, costing him the leadership. The party’s new leader, Brad Battin, may haveattempted to distance himself from Dutton during the campaignbut he reignited party’s internal war by promoting Deeming as his “representative to the western suburbs” just days before pre-polling began. Unlike their federal counterparts, a handful of moderates remain in the Victorian Liberal party room. But they fear if Pesutto is bankrupted due to the legal costs of the defamation case, the party could be forced into a byelection in Hawthorn – a seat he only narrowly won back in 2022 after campaigning on his plans to restore small-l liberal values. Battin, just months into the job, has shown little sign of unifying a fractured base, reconnecting with inner-city voters or winning back women. He also failed to front up to media on Sunday to explain the federal result – a silence that left his MPs frustrated. His team insists new policy is coming this week – well ahead of the November 2026 state election. But that can’t be the only lesson the state Liberals take from the federal poll.",

    "title": "Cost of emissions from five major Australian resource companies more than $900bn, study finds",
    "article_text": "Five of Australia’s biggest fossil fuel producers could be on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars in damages after a US research team developed a method to link individual companies to specific climate harms and put a dollar figure to the impact. This is the result of a new peer-review studypublished in the journal Naturethat sought to establish a method that would allow courts to quantify the economic loss caused by fossil fuel producers for one kind of climate impact – extreme heat. Looking at the period 1991 to 2020, the researchers, Christopher Callahan at Stanford University in California and Justin Mankin at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, used historical emissions data for the world’s five biggest oil producers: BP, Gazprom, Saudi Aramco,ExxonMobiland Chevron. They then sought to understand how the emissions from these companies contributed to extreme heat. This was defined as the temperature of the hottest five days in a year. The team developed a replicable method to quantify the damage linked to a single company, with the figure running into the trillions for the world’s largest fossil fuel producers. It suggested state-owned oil companies Saudi Aramco and Gazprom were responsible for US$2.05tr and $2tr in damages respectively. Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP were each found to be responsible for $1.98tr, $1.91tr and $1.45tr in losses respectively. In a separate analysis of emissions data for five major Australian resource companies – BHP,Rio Tinto, Santos, Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Energy – Callahan assessed the total damages from their collective emissions at more than US$600bn, or A$929.47bn. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “Our analysis is very explicitly thinking about emissions that are already occurred and the sort of historical changes in extreme heat, and attributing those to emissions that have been already detected and attributed to specific actors,” Callahan said. “Even just from that we get numbers in the trillions, when you aggregate globally over the last 30 years in terms of the losses associated with any individual company, but GDP growth losses from extreme heat are a very small fraction of the total cost of climate change.” The difficulty in establishing causation and calculating a single company’s contribution to climate harms has made courts in many jurisdictions, particularly in Australia, reluctant to hold individual fossil fuel producers to account for the climate impact of their projects. When seeking approval to build and operate its $5.6bn Barossa gasfield in a remote area off the far north Australian coast, Australian oil companySantoswas asked by the Australian Conservation Foundation whether it had considered potential climate harms.

Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “Santos invited ACF to provide further information regarding how it is able to undertake an analysis that links climate change impacts from the activity to specific environments or ecosystems,” the company said. Callahan said the work provides a foundation for future research to link the activities of specific oil, gas and coal producers to additional climate harms such as drought, flooding and sea level rise, though he added there was still “a long way to go” before a tobacco or asbestos-style lawsuit succeeds. “Until two weeks ago, it was unclear whether it was scientifically supported to say an individual emitter can be linked to the impact that you’re suing over or that you are trying to recoup costs for. That scientific connection can absolutely be made,” he said. “It is no longer scientifically supported for actors to argue that there is plausible deniability, that it is impossible to link any of an individual actor to any impact of climate change. “That statement, that there is a sort of uncrossable gap between where you emit and some other impact down the road, we’ve shown that to be fallacious.” Several significant lawsuits have been brought against major US oil companies, includingMunicipalities of Puerto Rico v Exxon Mobil Corpand other cases brought by individual US state governments.

    "title": "Sweden’s Great Moose Migration live stream ends after 478 hours’ viewing",
    "article_text": "For thousands of years, moose have crossed rivers, navigated thawing forests and quietly followed ancient trails toward their summer pastures in northernSweden. A 24-hour live stream gave millions of viewersfront-row seats to watch every unhurried step of the journey. But on Sunday night, the seventh season of Den stora älgvandringen (The Great Moose Migration, also translated as The Great Elk Trek) ended, after nearly three weeks of uninterrupted footage streamed via SVT Play, the platform of Sweden’s national broadcaster. Since its debut in 2019, the series has grown from a niche public broadcasting experiment into a cultural phenomenon, attracting close to 9 million viewers in 2024. “We are very satisfied,” said Johan Erhag, SVT’s project manager for the series. He confirmed the team has captured 478 hours of footage, with 26 remote cameras, seven night-vision ones and a drone streaming uninterrupted footage since its launch on 15 April. The last showing of the season concluded at 10pm local time on Sunday, with cameras capturing 70 moose (also known as European elk) making the spring crossing through Sweden’s Ångerman River – about 180 miles north of Stockholm. The Great Moose Migration is part of a growing fascination with “slow TV” – a genre that took off in 2009 when Norway’s NRK aired a real-time, seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo. The concept has since found cult status across Europe, with broadcasts featuring 12-hour knitting marathons, a 134-hour sea voyage, and even a crackling fireplace stream that topped Netflix’s UK charts on Boxing Day. Cashing in on its popularity, SVT has even been sending out push notifications when the first moose appears, while a dedicated Facebook group with more than 76,000 members now shares sightings, screenshots and speculation about the next appearance. Though official viewing figures for this year’s season have yet to be released, SVT has already confirmed the moose will return next spring for an eighth edition.",

    "article_text": "A 26-year-old fan of Serie A sideAtalantawas stabbed to death during clashes between Atalanta and Inter supporters in the northern city of Bergamo, Italy’s police said. The groups of supporters clashed in a pub in Bergamo on Saturday night after one of the Inter supporters chanted provocatively, the head of thecarabinierioffice in Bergamo, Carmelo Beringheli, said. The confrontation continued in a street near the Atalanta stadium and escalated into violence when a man identified as an Inter supporter stabbed the Atalanta fan, Beringheli said, adding that emergency services arrived swiftly but were unable to save his life. The Atalanta fan who died has been identified as Riccardo Claris. A male in his late teens has been arrested and said he acted to protect his brother, Beringheli added. Atalanta fans unfurled a banner at the start of their 4-0Serie Awin at Monza on Sunday in memory of the murdered fan, which read: “Claris Ovunque con noi” (“Claris everywhere with us”). “What happened to our fan must never happen again,” Atalanta manager Gian Piero Gasperini said in a press conference after the match.",

    "title": "Shell reportedly weighing up merits of making move to buy BP",
    "article_text": "Shell is talking to advisers about the potential for a takeover of the rival oil producer BP, according to reports. The oil company has been discussing the feasibility and merits of a takeover ofBPwith its advisers in recent weeks, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. If this were to happen, it would mark one of the biggest deals ever in the oil and gas industry. Speculation about a possible takeover comes as BP’s shares have suffered this year. They have fallen by more than 30% in the past 12 months as a turnaround plan under the chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, has failed to inspire investors and oil prices have fallen. Shell may also wait for BP to reach out for another possible suitor to make the first move, those familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Deliberations are allegedly still in the early stages, and Shell could decide to focus on share buybacks and smaller acquisitions rather than such a big merger, according to the report. The combination of Britain’s biggest oil companies would be one of the largest deals ever in the sector. Shell’s market value of £145.6bn is more than double that of BP, at £55.9bn. A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian: “As we have said many times before, we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.” A spokesperson for BP declined to comment. In February, Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy, with the changes expected to include a watering down of its climate commitments and the pursuit of new fossil fuel projects in an attempt to bolster its market value. The company’s profitsdropped by almost 50%in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1bn), down from $2.7bn in the same period last year. Its flagging share price has also made the company a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management. The shares have lagged behind other oil and gas firms in recent years after its former chief executive Bernard Looney set BP on course to become a net zero energy company. He left BP abruptly in September 2023 after admitting he failed to fully disclose his relationships with female colleagues to the board. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion On Friday, Shell reported adjusted profits of $5.6bn in its first quarter, down 28% compared with the same period last year but ahead of what City analysts had been expecting. Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, told the Financial Times that he would rather buy back more of the company’s own shares than launch a takeover bid for BP. “We will always look at these things, but you are also looking to see what is the alternative,” he said. “Right now, buying back Shell for us continues to be absolutely the right alternative to go for.”",

    "title": "France and EU to incentivise US-based scientists to come to Europe",
    "article_text": "France and the EU are to step up their efforts to attract US-based scientists hit by Donald Trump’s crackdown on academia, as they prepare announcements on incentives for researchers to settle inEurope. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, alongside the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will make speeches on Monday morning at Sorbonne University in Paris, flanked by European university leaders and researchers, in which they are expected to announce potential incentives and protections for researchersseeking to relocate to Europe. The event, bringing together European academics and European commissioners, is the latest push to open Europe’s doors to US-based academics and researchers who fear their work is threatened by federal spendingcutsfor universities and research bodies, as well as the targeting of US higher education institutions over diversity policies. Macron’s office said the move comes “at a time when academic freedoms face a number … of threats” and when Europe “is an attractive continent”. An Élysée official said: “We are a space where there is freedom of research and no taboo topics.” The official said the event was about “affirmingFranceand Europe as stable spaces that can guarantee freedoms and academic research”. France is thought to be particularly keen to attract scientists working on health – particularly infectious diseases – as well as climate research and artificial intelligence. Monday’s event, titled Choose Europe for science, comes after 13 European countries, including France, Germany and Spain, wrote to the European Commission urging it to move fast to attract academic talent. France launched its ownChoose France for scienceinitiative in April with a dedicated platform for applications to host international researchers. The French research ministry told Agence France-Presse: “Some foreign researchers have already arrived in France to familiarise themselves with the infrastructure, waiting for the funds and platform to be set up.” In recent days, France’s flagship scientific research centre CNRS launched a new initiative to attract foreign workers whose research is threatened, as well as French researchers working abroad, some of whom “don’t want to live and raise their children in Trump’s United States”, its president, Antoine Petit, told AFP. In France, Aix-Marseille University launched its “Safe place for science” programme in March. It will receive its first foreign researchers in June. In a letter to French universities in March, Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister for higher education and research, wrote: “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the United States. We would naturally wish to welcome a certain number of them.” Challenges remain because research investment in the US – including private-public partnerships – has for many years been greater than in Europe. For decades, Europe has lagged behind the US on investment in universities and research centres. French researchers have regularly raised the issue of the comparatively low salaries and precarious contracts for many researchers in France. On average, an academic researcher in the US is paid more than their French equivalent. Trade unions in France have called for better contracts, better salary provisions and better funding across the board at research institutions. Some in France hoped the pay gap between scientists in France and the US would narrow, once the lower cost of education and health, and more generous social benefits in France were taken into account. Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said last month: “The American government is currently using brute force against the universities in the US, so that researchers from America are now contacting Europe. This is a huge opportunity for us.”",

    "title": "French police investigate spate of cryptocurrency millionaire kidnappings",
    "article_text": "French police are investigating a series of kidnappings of investors linked to cryptocurrency after a 60-year-old man had a finger chopped off by attackers who demanded his crypto-millionaire son pay a ransom. In the latest of several kidnappings of cryptocurrency figures in France and westernEurope, the man, who owned a cryptocurrency marketing company with his son, was freed from a house south of Paris on Saturday night. He had been held for more than two days. One of the man’s fingers had been chopped off and investigators feared further mutilations could have happened if he had not been rescued. The man, who has not been publicly identified, was abducted in broad daylight at 10.30am on Thursday morning as he walked down a street in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four men in ski masks forced him into a delivery van. He was freed by armed police in a raid at 9pm on Saturday night from a house 20km (12 miles) south of Paris, in the Essonne area. Five suspects in their 20s were arrested at the house. The state prosecutor said in a statement: “The victim appears to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, with the crime involving a ransom demand.” The victim’s wife told investigators that her husband and wealthy son, who both owned a crypto marketing firm in Malta, had received threats in the past, a police source said. Le Parisienreported that the attackers had demanded a ransom of €5-7m (£4-6m), which was not paid. The five kidnapping suspects, aged between 20 and 27, were still being questioned by police on Sunday. The kidnapping is the latest in a series of abductions of cryptocurrency figures inFranceand neighbouring countries. David Balland, the co-founder of the crypto firm Ledger, which is valued at more than $1bn , was abducted with his partner on 21 January at their home in Méreau, near Bourges in central France. He also had a finger cut off. The attackers arrived at Balland’s house in the early hours of the morning, taking him and his partner and separating them. Balland was taken to a house in the town of Châteauroux, where one of his fingers was cut off. Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day. Nine suspects are under criminal investigation in that case, including the alleged ringleader, 26, who has a police record for a previous kidnapping. In December 2024, the 56-year-old father of a French cryptocurrency influencer based in Dubai, was the target of an alleged kidnapping in eastern France, local media reported. Attackers arrived at the man’s home, tied up his wife and daughter and forced him into a car. The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol. Other abductions of cryptocurrency figures or their partners were reported in Spain andBelgiumin the past five months.",

    "title": "Netanyahu vows to act against Houthis after attack on Israel’s main airport",
    "article_text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Israel will strike back against Yemen’s Houthis and “their Iranian terror masters” after a missile launched by the militia movement hit the perimeter of Israel’s main airport. On X, the Israeli prime ministersaidon Sunday that Israel would respond to the Houthi attack “at a time and place of our choosing”. On Telegram, Netanyahu said Israel had acted against the Houthis in the past and would act again in the future. “It will not happen in one bang, but there will be many bangs,” he said. TheHouthis, who are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack on Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport, and Israeli military confirmed that the missile was launched from Yemen. Local mediareportedthat Israeli and US defence systems had failed to down the missile, which left a deep crater in an open field on the perimeter of the airport, and that an investigation was under way. Most attacks from Yemen during the conflict in Gaza have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence systems, apart froma drone strike that hit Tel Avivlast July. Sunday’s missile strike sent a plume of smoke into the air, caused panic among passengers in the terminal building and led to air traffic being suspended for an hour. European and US carriers have cancelled flights for the next few days. Many had only recently begun to resume services toIsraelafter the Gaza ceasefire, which temporarily paused hostilities between mid-January and mid-March. This followed their suspension of flights for much of the last year and a half. The missile attack came hours before Israel’s security cabinet was due to vote on plans to expand the fighting in Gaza with a new offensive. Military officials confirmed on Sunday that tens of thousands of reservists had been called up, though it was unclear when any new operations would be launched. The aim of the offensive would be to put pressure on Hamas to release hostages it continues to hold in Gaza; to further degrade the militant Islamist group’s military capabilities; and to “seize ground” that would be used as leverage in future negotiations, officials said. Hardliners in the Israeli cabinet have been pushing for a broad offensive in Gaza for many months.Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister, told Israeli Army Radio he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail.“We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. Ben-Gvir demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza.Two months ago, Israel imposed a tight blockade of Gaza, stopping all food, medicine, fuel and other items entering the devastated territory. Israel’s military is making preparations for new orders to allow aid in, but only under strict conditions. Israeli officials accuse Hamas of diverting humanitarian assistance to fund its military operations. Hamas denies the charge. Israeli airstrikes have continued daily across Gaza. At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, two and four, were killed in southern and central Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian medics said.Israel’s military said on Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in the territory, bringing the number of Israeli troops killed since fighting resumed in March to six.The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 hostages remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 of them are said to be dead.The Israeli offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians. The fighting has displaced more than 90% of its population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting. The attacks by the Houthis, who control swathes ofYemen, underline the regional dimension of the conflict in Gaza. The Iran-backed militia began targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping in late 2023, claiming it was acting out of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel deployed warplanes on three big air raids last year after Houthi missile attacks. The strikes targeted power stations, port facilities, the airport in Sana’a and “military infrastructure”. The US president, Donald Trump, in March ordered large-scale strikes against the Houthis to reduce their capabilities and deter them from targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis’ military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said on Sunday that the missile strike meant Israel’s main airport was “no longer safe for air travel”. The Israel Airports Authority (IAA) said the attack marked the first time a missile had fallen so close to Ben Gurion airport’s terminal and the runways. Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries. Lufthansa Group, which includes the airlines Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian, said it had halted flights to and from Tel Aviv through to Tuesday because of the situation. ITA Airways said it had cancelled flights from Italy to Israel through to Wednesday, while Air France cancelled flights on Sunday, saying customers were being transferred to flights on Monday. Ryanair suspended flights on Sunday but flights were still scheduled for Monday, according to the IAA.",

    "title": "MPs warn social care needs substantial investment to fix ‘broken’ system",
    "article_text": "A cross-party group of MPs has warned attempts to reform adult social care are doomed to fail unless ministers accept major investment is needed to overhaul a “broken” system that was failing millions of people. Reform of social care was typically seen by governments as a “burden” on the taxpayer, and a “drain on resources” rather than a positive boost to people’s lives, the NHS and the economy, said the health and social care select committee. “Time and again, governments have stepped back from reform when faced with the cost. Too much emphasis is put on the cost of change and not enough consideration is given to the human and financial cost of no or incremental change,” it added. While the costs of reforming the system were substantial – up to £17bn according to some estimates cited in the committee’s report – this had to be set against the £32bn currently spent every year on a system that was failing. The report said the costs of inaction included 2 million people aged 65 and over and 1.5 million people of working-age not getting get the care they need, millions more getting poor care and huge avoidable financial pressures placed on the NHS and local authorities. Social care was propped up by an army of over 1.5m unpaid carers – “equivalent to a second NHS” – who provided more than 50 hours of care weekly, often quitting jobs to care for loved ones and who bore the brunt of the system’s failures, the report said. It comes just days after the formal launch of a three-yearindependent commission into adult social careled by Louise Casey aimed at developing plans for a new national care service. Although the commission has been broadly welcomed, there are concerns it will merely rehearse already well-trodden debates and effectively put off for years changes that some expertshave arguedcould happen in a matter of months. The Casey review’s terms of reference state its conclusions must be “affordable” and stay within government spending limits for the remainder of the parliament, triggering fears among reformers any changes will be underpowered. Adult social care reform has been on and off the English policy agenda for more than two decades. Attempts by governments to fix the system have been repeatedlyderailed by lack of political consensus, worry over costs and political timidity. The MPs report concludes: “The moral case for reform has never been stronger, but this must be accompanied by a robust financial case. Without this we fear that the reforms that come out of the Casey commission will be doomed to failure, leaving everyone continuing to suffer under the current unsustainable system.” The chair of the health and social care committee, Layla Moran, said: “Successive governments have shied away from implementing meaningful reforms to the social care system. But this is an active choice that is no longer tenable.We are living with a broken social care system.” She added: “It might seem that reforms will be costly and difficult, but continuing with inaction will cost us all more.” The care minister, Stephen Kinnock, said that far from doing nothing the government had “hit the ground running on social care” having inherited a system in crisis, and had taken a series of measuresincluding a £3.7bn funding boost. He said: “A lot has been done, but we know there is so much more to do and deep reform is needed. That’s why we appointed Baroness Louise Casey to lead the independent commission working to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of adult social care, with her first report out next year.”",

    "article_text": "Keir Starmer has praised the “selfless dedication” of those who have served in the military before the anniversary of VE Day as the government unveiled a new £50m support system for veterans. In an open letter to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war in Europe, the prime minister said the sacrifice made by members of the armed forces was a debt that could “never fully be repaid”. He said the country would show how thankful it was during events to commemorateVE Day, which signalled the end of fighting on 8 May 1945. “It was also a victory for good against the assembled forces of hatred, tyranny and evil,” Starmer wrote. “VE Day is a chance to acknowledge, again, that our debt to those who achieved it can never fully be repaid.” A procession of 1,300 military personnel and civilians through London will take place on Monday, accompanied by Nato, Ukraine and Commonwealth armed forces representatives, and a flypast by the Red Arrows and Voyager transport aircraft. There will also be a two-minute silence at noon on Thursday followed by a service in Westminster Abbey attended by King Charles. Street parties will be held in towns and cities across the UK as part of the special events – including community tea parties, 1940s dress-up events, and gatherings onboard second world war warships. In addition, a display of almost 30,000 ceramic poppies will go on show at the Tower of London. On Monday, the government will announce a £50m pot of funding for services to support veterans with housing, employment, health and welfare. The new Valour service is to help fulfil Labour’s manifesto pledge to implement the armed forces covenant and fund initiatives for veterans, some of whom face struggles to integrate back into civilian life after serving in the military. John Healey, the defence secretary, said: “The nation owes a duty to those who’ve served to defend our country, and it is only right that the government steps up our support to them. “The armed forces set most people up for success in life but when veterans need help, then support is too often a postcode patchwork. Our plan to develop a UK-wide veterans support service will work with enterprising health, employment and housing charities and it is backed by the one of the largest ever government funding commitments to veterans.” Starmer said his thoughts would turn both to those who served in the second world war and those who carried “the torch of their legacy” today. “Alongside our history and our values, service is the other great force that binds a nation together,” he said. “So this week, I want you to know: the whole nation is inspired by the selfless dedication of your example.”",

    "article_text": "A 14-year-old boy whose body was found after a large fire in Gateshead was “valued and much loved”, his headteacher has said. Fourteen children have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the death of Layton Carr, from South Tyneside. Layton’s body was found after emergency services were called to a fire in a building near Fairfield industrial park on Friday night. The death of the teenager, who was a year 9 pupil at Hebburn comprehensive school in Hebburn, had devastated the school community, said its headteacher, David Thompson. “It is with deep sadness that we acknowledge the tragic loss of one of our pupils, Layton Carr, following an accident on Friday night, as reported in the news,” Thompson said. “Our school community is heartbroken. Layton was a valued and much-loved member of year 9, and he will be greatly missed by everyone. We extend our sincere condolences to Layton’s family and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time. “As a school, we will rally together to support one another through this tragedy. Anyone who wishes to pay their respects is invited to lay flowers at the fence in front of the bungalow in memory of Layton.” Fourteen children aged between 11 and 14 – of whom 11 were boys and three were girls – were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the death of the teenager, Northumbria police said on Saturday. On Sunday evening a police spokesperson said the children had all been “released on police bail pending further inquiries”. At the entrance to the industrial park close to where Layton was found wellwishers left bouquets of flowers, card and tributes, reported Chronicle Live. One message read: “You were a sensitive soul with a kind heart. You will be deeply missed.” Another said: “Layton, thanks for brightening up our lives. You will be missed beyond words.” A GoFundMe crowdfunder set up by the best friend of the teenager’s mother has raised more than £8,000 towards the costs of his funeral. Police said they received reports of the fire shortly after 8pm on Friday at the industrial site on the southern banks of the River Tyne. A police spokesperson said: “Sadly, following searches carried out by Northumbria police and partners at Tyne and Wear fire and rescue service, a body believed to be that of 14-year-old Layton Carr was located deceased inside the building. “His next of kin have been informed and are currently being supported by specialist officers.” The spokesperson added: “Inquiries are at an early stage and members of the public are asked not to speculate online or in the community.” DCI Louise Jenkins of Northumbria police said: “This is an extremely tragic incident where a boy has sadly lost his life. Our thoughts are with Layton’s family as they begin to attempt to process the loss of their loved one. “Our specialist officers will continue to support them in whatever way they can. We ask that their privacy be respected at this time.” Jenkins said a cordon was in place while police carried out inquiries to establish “the full circumstances surrounding the incident”. She added that officers would be in the area to “offer reassurance to the public”. Anyone who has information that could help the investigation has been urged to contact Northumbria police by sending a direct message on social media or by using the “live chat” or “report” functions on theforce’s website.",

    "title": "Eight men including seven Iranians arrested in two England anti-terrorism operations",
    "article_text": "Police have thwarted an alleged imminent terror plot in England with a number of Iranian nationalsarrested amid concern about the growing level of Tehran-backed hostile activity in the UK. Five suspects, including four Iranians, were arrested as part of a suspected plan to target “specific premises”, the Metropolitan police said. Of those arrested, the nationality of the fifth was still being established. In a separate investigation, three Iranian nationals were detained in London on suspicion of being involved in threat activity on behalf of Iran, though police said the two sets of high-profile arrests were not linked. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, described the arrests as “two major operations” that reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years” – and while she did not comment directly on whether the incidents were linked to the Iranian state, she noted “it involves Iranian nationals in both investigations”. Investigators from counter-terrorism police and the domestic security service, MI5, feared any planned attack might have taken place soon. Scotland Yard did not reveal the alleged target but it was understood to be in the UK. Three of those arrested were held in the Manchester area, with another arrested in west London and a fifth in Swindon. Hundreds of officers across the country were involved in the operation. Police on Sunday said they were still not sure any risk had been wholly contained, with detectives investigating whether the plot had overseas involvement. Scotland Yard said the five men in the first operation, including four Iranians, were being questioned under section 5 of the Terrorism Act on suspicion of planning an attack. Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “The investigation is still in its early stages and we are exploring various lines of inquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter.” Murphy urged the public to “remain vigilant” and alert the police if they saw anything suspicious. The nature of the plot was not publicly known but security services have warned about the growing threat from Iran-backed criminals. In the second operation, two Iranian nationals were arrested in north-west London and a third in west London on Saturday. They were arrested and detained under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023, which criminalises anybody involved in “foreign power threat activity”, in this case from Iran. Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October that Tehran was behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that it had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, taking the total since January 2022 to 20. Officers were giving their fullest attention to any increase in “Iranian state aggression in the UK”, he added. Footage verified by the Guardian showed armed military personnel storming a terraced property alongside specialist firearms officers in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, as they arrested a 40-year-old man. Marksmen carrying semi-automatic rifles and wearing helmets and body armour could be seen in the footage removing a partly clothed man from the building in handcuffs before ordering him to the ground. Another man, also an Iranian, was arrested by armed officers near a busy children’s play area in an affluent suburb of Stockport, leaving residents shaken. “It’s terrifying,” said Sarah Cash, 49, who was told by police she could not collect her son from the play area in Cheadle Heath where the arrest was conducted on Saturday evening. Cash said she was concerned about the alleged target of the attack – which police have not disclosed for operational reasons – and whether there was still any risk: “Where is that premises? There’s so many big things around here – there’s Manchester airport, the Co-op Arena.” Images from the scene showed a number of masked officers along the tree-lined street where the suspect was detained outside a £12,000-a-year preparatory school. In Rochdale, neighbours of the 40-year-old Iranian man who was arrested said they were “really terrified” as heavily armed officers swooped on the quiet terraced street shortly before 6pm on Saturday. Amy Openshaw, 36, said her five-year-old daughter was playing in their garden with her six- and nine-year-old nieces when they ran inside saying “masked men” had told them to get in the house. She said: “As a mum you think: what do you mean masked men in my garden? We heard a big bang. It sounded like a bomb had gone off – it was well loud. It ricocheted through the house.” Another neighbour, who lives three doors down, said she did not know the Iranian man but believed he lived in the house with three or four others. “It was really terrifying,” she said. “It’s a house that homes vulnerable people. You just see them coming and going all the time.” Of the moment police raided the property, she added: “I heard the bang but I felt the bang at the same time. I ran upstairs. I just saw a flood of people run past my window. There were people with guns pointing towards the end house.”",

    "title": "Woman dies and three more pedestrians injured after being hit by car in Rochdale",
    "article_text": "A woman has died after she was one of four people injured by a car in two separate collisions in Rochdale on Saturday. The pedestrian was airlifted to hospital after the incident on Whitworth Road but died from her injuries, Greater Manchester police said. Two miles away, on Woodgate Avenue, three pedestrians, including a child, were also hit by the car. All three suffered minor injuries and have been discharged from hospital. A 49-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Police said the collisions, which took place at about 2.30pm on Saturday, were not being treated as terrorism-related. John Webster, an assistant chief constable for GMP, said: “Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the victim who has sadly lost their life in this tragic case. The actions of a single person have caused significant damage to the people of Rochdale.” Addressing online speculation about the driver’s identity and ethnicity, Webster said: “The suspect is a white male currently in custody and no further details can be released at this time.” He also stressed the collisions were unrelated to counter-terrorism activity in the area, after separate arrests were made in Rochdale on Saturday as part of a planned operation. Webster added. “This incident caused significant disruption yesterday and I thank the public for their cooperation and understanding while our officers conducted their inquiries. We are committed to this investigation and have significant resources dedicated to it. “To all those people affected by yesterday’s tragic events, community solidarity and unity is vital in times like these and especially for the families and friends of those impacted by this incident.”",

    "title": "Reform UK to resist housing asylum seekers in its council areas, chair says",
    "article_text": "Reform UK has vowed to use “every instrument of power” to resist housing people seeking asylum in areas where it now controls councils, its chair has confirmed. Zia Yusuf, the party chair and a major donor, acknowledged Reform may not be able to stop people seeking asylum being put up in hotels where the Home Office has contracts with accommodation providers. However, he said the party would use “judicial reviews, injunctions, planning laws” in an effort to prevent them being accommodated. “You know, a lot of these hotels – there has been litigation around this already – a lot of these hotels, when you suddenly turn them into something else, which is essentially a hostel that falls foul of any number of regulations, and that’s what our teams of lawyers are exploring at the moment,” Yusuf told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. Yusuf’s comments were made after Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, said he would “resist” those seeking asylum being housed in the10 council areas where his party had taken controlafter winning more than670 seats overall in Thursday’s local elections. Since then, Reform has come under scrutiny over some of its promises to slash spending at councils and prevent the housing of asylum seekers. The party has said it wants to cut diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) officers and work at the councils it controls, despite this being a very small part of their budgets, with most money spent on social care and education. Yusuf said Reform would introduce taskforces to audit spending in the councils where it had won control and suggested the party would be digging into what local authority job roles involved in order to cut costs. “If you take Lincolnshire county council, yes, they do not currently have somebody with the job title ‘DEI officer’, [but] they do spend considerable money on DEI initiatives,” he said. Yusuf said the party was “realistic” about the fact the levers of change at a local level “pale in comparison” to the powers of Westminster. “That’s why this is part of a journey to making Nigel the prime minister with a Reform majority,” he said. Andrea Jenkyns, Reform’s new Greater Lincolnshire mayor and a former Conservative MP, also confirmed her suggestion that immigrants could be housed in tents, saying the UK was “acting like bees to honey by putting people in hotels”. “This is taxpayers’ money and it should actually be tents, not rent,” the former Tory minister told LBC. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Jenkyns also said she wanted to cut up to 10% of Lincolnshire county council’s staff and “root out the waste” at the local authority. “I think, personally, [we] ought to look at maybe cutting the workforce by up to 10%. We’ve got to have a lean, mean local government. That’s what I personally like to see, but again there’s variables there, because we haven’t elected a Reform county council leader yet, so there’s got to be discussions.” Jenkyns also said she was “up for a fight” with the unions, after the head of Unison urged staff at Reform-run councils to join them and secure union protection.",

    "title": "Trump announces 100% tariffs on movies ‘produced in foreign lands’",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpon Sunday announced on his Truth Social platform a 100%tariffon all movies “produced in Foreign Lands”, saying the US film industry was dying a “very fast death” due to the incentives that other countries were offering to draw American film-makers. In his post, he claimed to have authorised the commerce department and the US trade representative to immediately begin instituting such a tariff. “This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump said inthe Truth Social post. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Trump added. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick posting on X said: “We’re on it.” Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on the implementation. It was not immediately clear whether the move would target production companies, foreign or American, producing films overseas. Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production. At the same time, governments around the world have offered more generous tax credits and cash rebates to lure productions, and capture a greater share of the $248bn that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content. The announcement from Trump comes after he triggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession. The film industry has already been feeling the effects of the tariffs, as China in April responded to the announcements byreducing the quotaof American movies allowed into that country. China is the world’s second largest film market after the US, although in recent years domestic offerings have outshone Hollywood imports. Former senior commerce department official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump’s foreign movies tariffs would be devastating. “The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,” he said, adding that it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.",

    "title": "Marvel’s Thunderbolts* tops US box office with $76m opening",
    "article_text": "Marvel Studios’Thunderbolts* opened with $76m in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates on Sunday, kicking off the summer box office with a solid No 1 debut that fell shy of Marvel’s more spectacular launches. All eyes had been on whether Thunderbolts* – a team-up of antihero rejects similar to Avengers – could restore theWalt Disney Companysuperhero factory to the kind of box office performance the studio once enjoyed so regularly. The results – similar to the debuts of Eternals ($71m) and Ant-Man and the Wasp ($75m) – suggested Marvel’s malaise won’t be so easy to snap out of. Some had expected a bigger opening for Thunderbolts* because of the film’s good word of mouth. Unlike most recent MCU entries, reviews (88% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been excellent for Thunderbolts*, directed by Jake Schreier and starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Sebastian Stan. Audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore. That kind of response should power the movie to strong business in the coming weeks. Though bigger MCU films – including 2024’sDeadpool & Wolverine(with a $211m opening on the way to $1.34bn worldwide) – have monopolized movie screens immediately, Thunderbolts* could gather steam more steadily – or it could go down as another example of Marvel struggling to rekindle its golden touch. Marvel spent about $180m to produced the movie, which added $86.1m in overseas sales. The film also teases the next MCU chapter,The Fantastic Four: First Steps, due out 25 July. “Marvel set the bar so high for so many years that a $76m opening may seem to some like it should have done $100m or something like that,” said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore. “This is a great reset. They’re hitting the reset with Thunderbolts*. The great reviews and the word-of-mouth should hold it [in] good stead.” The Walt Disney Co also might not have expected such stout competition fromRyan Coogler’s Sinners. The Warner Bros release, which had led the box office the last two weeks, continued to hold remarkably well. In its third week, it grossed $33m, a dip of only 28%. Sinners, a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Michael B Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown, has proven a spring sensation in theaters. It has collected $179.7m domestically and $236.7m globally thus far. Warner Bros also nabbed third place withA Minecraft Movie, thesmash-hitvideo game adaptation. In its fifth weekend, it rung up another $13.7m to bring its North American gross to nearly $400m. Worldwide, it has totaled $873.4m. Warner Bros added Block Party Edition screenings over the weekend for a sing-along and “meme-along” experience. The film has seen somerowdy screenings from TikTok-inspired moviegoers. More than three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set, the Alec Baldwin westernRustarrived in theaters. Its release brought some closure to one ofHollywood’s greatest tragedies. Distributor Falling Forward Films didn’t report box office, but estimates suggested Rust grossed approximately $25,000 in 115 theaters. Following Hutchins’ death, the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, wassentenced to prisonfor involuntary manslaughter. First assistant director David Halls wassentenced to probationafter pleading no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon. Involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, a co-producer on the film, were twice dismissed,in 2023and againin 2024. As part of a wrongful death settlement, Matt Hutchins, Hutchins’ husband, was made an executive producer on the film. Also opening over the weekend wasThe Surfer, starring Nicolas Cage as a man trying to surf a “locals-only” Australian beach. The Madman Films release collected a modest $674,560 from 884 theaters.",

    "article_text": "A small plane crashed into a neighborhood in Simi Valley on Saturday afternoon, killing two people and a dog aboard the aircraft and damaging two homes, authorities said. Fire crews responded, and police cordoned off the streets, warning people to stay clear of the area. Smoke could be seen billowing from the roof of one home in the Wood Ranch section of the community, which lies nearly 50 miles (80km) north-west ofLos Angeles. Wreckage could be seen between the two homes. The Ventura county fire department confirmed that residents were inside at the time but said they evacuated with no reported injuries. Both homes sustained structural damage and were impacted by the fire, authorities said. About 40 firefighters were on scene. With the flames out, they began working on salvage. Officials initially reported one death. Later on Saturday, the Simi Valley police department said the pilot, a passenger and a dog in the airplane died. As of Sunday, authorities had not released any information about the occupants of the single-engine Van’s RV-10, which is a popular homebuilt plane sold in kit form. They also did not say what might have caused the crash. The plane crashed into the backyard and dining room of Arman Hovakemian’s home. Hovakemian told the Los Angeles Times that he was doing yard work when he noticed the plane above, circling lower and lower in the hillside neighborhood. He ran inside to get his wife, Armineh, and their Pomeranian dog, Koko, and they fled the property. A loud bang followed and the fuselage landed where he had been standing in the yard just moments before, he said. “I’m numb. It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Hovakemian said on Saturday as dozens of firefighters and police officers surrounded his home. “We’re fortunate we were able to get out.” In security video recorded by a neighbor that was viewed by the Times, the plane can be heard circling the neighborhood for nearly three minutes and flying close to homes at points. In another video, the plane can be seen shooting straight up into the clouds then dropping down again. In January, another Van’s RV-10 crashed into a warehouse in Fullerton, which is south-east of Los Angeles, while trying to make an emergency landing, killing the pilot and his teenage daughter and injuring 19 people in the building. A preliminary report issued by the NTSB said that plane appeared to have had a door ajar during flight. It will likely be weeks before the NTSB releases preliminary findings on the Simi Valley crash. A final report comes months later.",

    "title": "NPR and PBS push back against Trump’s order to cut funding: ‘This could be devastating’",
    "article_text": "The heads of embattled US public broadcasters,National Public Radio(NPR) and thePublic Broadcasting Service(PBS), defended themselves against efforts by theTrump administrationto cut off taxpayer funding, with both telling a Sunday political talk show they were looking at legal options. PBS’s chief executive, Paula Kerger, told CBS News’s Face the Nation that Republican-led threats to withdraw federal funding from public broadcasters had been around for decades but are “different this time”. Kerger said: “They’re coming after us on many different ways … we have never seen a circumstance like this, and obviously we’re going to be pushing back very hard, because what’s at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations across the country.” Donald Trumplast weekissued an executive orderblocking NPR and PBS from receiving taxpayer funds through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The White House said that unlike in 1967, when the corporation was established, the media landscape is now filled with news options and the concept of government funded news media was “not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence”. The order added: “Which viewpointsNPRand PBS promote does not matter. What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.” On Sunday, Kerger warned that some stations in smaller communities across the US could lose 40 to 50% of their funding. “And for them, it’s existential, and that’s what’s at risk if this funding goes away,” she said. NPR’s chief executive, Katherine Maher, who like Kruger was grilled by Republicans on Capital Hill last month over claims that programing at both operations was politically biased, said her organization is “looking at whatever options are available to us”. But she added: “I think it’s a little preliminary for us to speak to the specific strategies that we might take.” Maher warned that the impact to local radio stations was immediate, “especially in a time where we’re seeing an advance of news deserts across the nation, 20% of Americans don’t have access to another local source of news. The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities.” But the NPR boss also sought to resist the US president’s claims that her operation is left-leaning and pointed to reluctance byTrump administrationofficials to come on NPR shows. The point of public broadcasting, Maher said, is to “bring people together in those conversations and so, we have had a whole host of conservative voices on air of late”. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Maher added: “We’ve been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials air. We would like to see more people accept those invitations. It’s hard for us to be able to say we can speak for everyone when folks won’t join us.” In a university commencementaddress in Alabamalast week, Trump told journalism majors that he’s not sure he likes the press, but acknowledged a free press is important even though he hasrepeatedlycalledAmerican journalists “enemies of the people”. “We need a brilliant press. They’re like a watch-keeper. They’re very important. And you can go out and take it down a new track. Help save the country. The people of this country, they know the truth when they hear it. That’s why the ratings, the approval numbers of the media, are so low.” However, ongoing arguments over media bias and threats to defund public broadcasters put children’s programming is at risk, including those that are not enrolled in formal pre-K schooling, Kerger warned on CBS. “That was the idea of Sesame Street and Mister Rogers, and everything that has followed since, is to make sure that children that do not have an access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn … That’s what’s at risk.” she said.",

    "article_text": "AWisconsinwoman missing for more than 60 years has been found “alive and well”, according to authorities. In apress statement, Wisconsin’s Sauk county sheriff’s office said that 82-year old Audrey Backeberg, who initially disappeared in July 1962 at the age of 20, had been found living out of the state. The sheriff’s office did not disclose which state Backeberg was found in. “Further investigation has revealed that Ms Backeberg’s disappearance was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play,” the sheriff’s office said. According tothe Wisconsin justice department, Backeberg left her family home on 7 July in 1962. Backeberg’s babysitter claimed that she and Backeberg hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, and then took a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana. The babysitter last saw Backeberg – a mother of two – walking around the corner away from the bus stop. The Charley Project, which profiles missing persons,saidin a sinceupdated postthat Backeberg married her husband, Ronald Backeberg, when she was “about fifteen years old” and that that their “marriage was troubled and there were allegations of abuse”. Around the time of her disappearance, Backeberg had filed a criminal complaint against her husband, alleging that he had beat her and threatened to kill her, the BBCreports, citing the Wisconsin Missing Persons Advocacy non-profit group. It added that on the day Backeberg disappeared, she left home to collect her pay cheque from a woollen mill where she had worked. Backeberg was ultimately found 60 years later after her case was assigned to a detective for a “comprehensive review as part of an ongoing examination of cold case files”, the Sauk county sheriff’s office said. It added that part of the review involved “a thorough re-evaluation of all case files and evidence, combined with re-interviewing witnesses and uncovering new insights”. Speaking toWISN, detective Isaac Hanson, who found Backeberg, said he was able to locate her through her sister’s Ancestry.com account. “That was pretty key in locating death records, census reports, all kinds of data,” Hanson told the news station, adding: “Ultimately, we came up with an address … so I called the local sheriff’s department, said: ‘Hey, there’s this lady living at this address. Do you guys have somebody, you can just go pop in?’ … Ten minutes later, she called me, and we talked for 45 minutes.” “I think she just was removed and, you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and lead her life … She sounded happy. Confident in her decision, no regrets,” Hanson added.",

    "title": "Major delays at Newark airport as FAA cites air traffic control staffing issues",
    "article_text": "Flight delays continued on Sunday as a major crisis gripped one of the US’s biggest airports amid aviation safety fears. As of Sunday morning, there were 210 delays and 88 cancellations at Newark Liberty international airport (EWR) inNew Jersey,according toFlightAware. The large airport is one of the major hubs for New York city and its surrounding area. The weekend slowdown in operations came afterUnited Airlinesannounced on Friday that it was cancelling 35 daily roundtrip flights from Newark due to poor technology and staffing issues surrounding the Federal Aviation Administration. In astatementon Friday, United Airlines’ CEO, Scott Kirby, said: “For many years, United has been very clear and vocal about the need to fix the Air Traffic Control system in EWR. While we enthusiastically support the efforts underway to permanently and structurally fix the FAA, the long-simmering FAA challenges boiled over this week.” “In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed – resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and canceled flights and worst of all, thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans,” he said. Kirby went on to say that technology issues at the airport were compounded after more than 20% of the FAA controllers for EWR reportedly walked off the job. “Keep in mind, this particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it’s now clear – and the FAA tells us – that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” he added. Explaining the cuts which come at an “already reduced schedule at Newark”, Kirby said the airline had no choice but to cancel the flights, as there is “no way to resolve the near-term structural FAA staffing issues”. He also said that United Airlines has been urging the government for years to limit the number of flights “to what the airport can realistically handle”. Meanwhile, speaking to MSNBC correspondent Tom Costello, an air traffic controller said that it is not safe to fly out of Newark. “He said: ‘It is not safe. It is not a safe situation right now for the flying public,’” Costellotold the Daily Beast, adding: “He just said that to me, and separately: ‘Don’t fly into Newark. Avoid Newark at all costs.’” According to the FAA, the delays are caused by a shortage of air traffic controllers. AsDonald Trump’s administration continues its mass federal firingsincluding FAA safety workersdespite a slew ofdeadly crashessince inauguration day, transportation secretary Sean Duffy is urging more people to become air traffic controllers. On Thursday, Duffy said at a press conference that the transportation department is seeking to increase employment at the FAA, aiming to hire at least 2,000 controllers this year. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion “We’re hoping in three to four years we can get to full staffing, not 20 years,” Duffysaid, adding: “How do you make up the gap? We can’t snap our fingers to make up the numbers.” The transportation department isofferinga slew of incentives, including a 30% salary increase for new hires as well as a $5,000 bonus upon completion of the flight academy. The department is also offering a $10,000 award for academy graduates who are assigned to one of 13 hard-to-staff air traffic facilities. The new campaign to hire more air traffic controllers comes just months after the US presidentbaselessly claimedthat Democrats and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies were responsible for falling aviation standards and the fatalWashington DC plane crashin January that killed 67 people. Following a string of deadly flight accidents, a February pollrevealedthat Americans’ confidence in aviation has slipped, with 64% of Americans said they believe air travel is very or somewhat safe – a decrease from 71% of Americans who indicated so last year.",

    "article_text": "Brazilian police have arrested two people in connection with an alleged plot to detonate explosives at a Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro that drew more than two million people. The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro said on social media on Sunday that it had thwarted a bomb attack that had been planned by the suspects for the free concert, held on the famous Copacabana Beach on Saturday. The police added that an adult “responsible for the plan” had been arrested along with a teenager in an operation codenamed “Fake Monster” – a reference to “Little Monsters”, the star’s pet name for her fans. The suspects, it said, had recruited people online to “carry out attacks using improvised explosives” in the aim of “gaining notoriety on social media”. Police working in coordination with the Justice Ministry carried out raids across Rio de Janeiro state as well as in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, and Mato Grosso. Felipe Cury, secretary of the Rio Police, said on Sunday that authorities believed the suspects sought to target Brazil’s LGBTQ community as they had “clearly” stated they were planning an attack “motivated by sexual orientation”. Rio Police Chief Luiz Lima said the group behind the plot disseminated hate speech and violent content online “in order to attract more viewers, more participants – most of them teenagers, many of them children”. The show, which Rio City Hall said attracted 2.1 million people, went ahead without disruption even though Brazilian authorities said they had arrested suspects in the hours preceding the event. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said in a statement that the star and her team had not been aware of safety concerns “prior to and during the show”, only learning about the threat the next morning. The statement added: “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.” Security was tight at Saturday’s concert, with 5,200 military and police officers deployed to the beach where fans revelled in the pop singer’s classic hits like the song Born This Way, which became an LGBTQ anthem after its 2011 release. The free beach concert stood out at a time of exorbitant ticket prices for live music around the world.",

Putin said his country had enough “strength and means” to bring the three-year war, sparked by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to a “logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires”. His comments were part of a documentary marking his quarter century in power by state television channel Rossiya 1 that was released on Sunday. Responding to a question from journalist Pavel Zarubin about the Russian response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, Putin said: “There has been no need to use those [nuclear] weapons … and I hope they will not be required.” His comments came ahead of his unilaterally declaredthree-day ceasefireover May 8-10 to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies over Nazi Germany in World War II, an initiative that he claimed would test Kyiv’s readiness for long-term peace. Moscow earlier rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by Kyiv and Washington in March. Speaking during a visit to the Czech Republic, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that he did “not believe” Russia would adhere to its truce. “This is not the first challenge, nor are these the first promises made by Russia to cease fire,” he said. “Today and all these days they are talking about wanting some kind of partial ceasefire, but you should know, for example, that the number of assaults today is the highest in recent months,” Zelenskyy said, citing a military report showing Russia had carried out more than 200 attacks on Saturday. “So there is no faith [in them],” he said, calling on Kyiv’s allies to increase pressure on Russia at a joint press conference with Czech President Petr Pavel on day one of his two-day visit to the country. Pavel, a former NATO general, said Putin could end the war with “a single decision”, but he had not shown any “willingness” to do so. With the two countries still at odds over competing ceasefire proposals, hostilities persist. Russia fired two ballistic missiles and a total of 165 exploding drones and decoys overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. Of those, 69 were intercepted and a further 80 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Two people were killed by Russian guided bombs Sunday, one each in the  and Sumy regions, Ukrainian officials said. A Russian drone attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, wounded 11 people, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said Sunday. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down 13 Ukrainian drones overnight. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region said Ukrainian forces struck an electrical equipment factory close to the border with Ukraine, destroying much of the plant but causing no casualties.",

    "title": "UK police arrest seven Iranians over alleged threats to national security",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom has arrested eight men, including seven Iranian nationals, as part of two investigations regarding alleged threats to national security. London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrests on Sunday, saying five men, including four of the Iranian nationals, were detained on suspicion of “preparation of a terrorist act” while the other three are being held undernational securitylegislation introduced in 2023 to counter the actions of hostile states. In the first operation, which took place on Saturday, counterterrorism police arrested four Iranians along with the other individual, whose nationality was still being established, in London, Swindon and the Greater Manchester area in relation to “a suspected plot to target a specific premises”. The five men were aged 29 to 46. The four Iranians were arrested under the Terrorism Act while the fifth man was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. “This is a fast-moving investigation,” Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Dominic Murphy said, adding that police were exploring “various lines of enquiry to establish any potential motivation as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public linked to this matter”. In the second operation, which took place on the same day, counterterrorism police arrested three Iranian nationals aged 39, 44 and 55 in London under the National Security Act, which gives law enforcement greater powers to disrupt “state threats”, including foreign interference and espionage. The Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that the three London arrests were “not connected to the arrest of five people yesterday”. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the threats as “serious”, saying the government was working with police and intelligence agencies to “keep the country safe”. The arrests were made amid heightenedconcernsabout Iranian operations on UK soil after the head of Britain’s MI5 domestic intelligence service said last year that the UK had uncovered 20 Iran-backed plots posing “potentially lethal threats” since 2022. In 2023, an Austrian national was convicted of carrying out “hostile reconnaissance” against the London headquarters of Iran International, a broadcaster that is critical of Iran’s government. The following year, a British journalist of Iranian origin who worked for Iran International was stabbed in London. In February a former British soldier was sentenced to14 years in prisonafter being found guilty of spying for Iran. Iran has repeatedly rejected suggestions that it has been behind plots to attack the UK. In March, Tehran summoned the British ambassador in response to the accusations and conveyed a formal protest. And in October, Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei accused the UK of hosting “terrorist” groups that promote violence.",

    "title": "NGO in talks with Malta to repair Gaza-bound aid ship ‘attacked by Israel’",
    "article_text": "An international NGO that intends to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza by sea has said it was in talks with Malta’s government about allowing a vessel to enter Maltese waters to repair damage caused by a drone attack. The ship named Conscience, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), suffered damage to its front section including a loss of power when it was hit by two drones just outside Maltese territorial waters in the central Mediterranean early on Friday, the NGO said on Sunday. The coalition, an international non-governmental group, said Israel, which has blockaded and bombarded Gaza, was to blame for the incident. #FreedomFlotillaPress statement 04-05-2025 : \"we received a very welcome update from the government of Malta@MaltaGov, with a stated intent to provide logistical supports and potential repairs to our ship, the ‘Conscience’….' (read more…)https://t.co/PVk6qjJsM3 — Freedom Flotilla Coalition (@GazaFFlotilla)May 4, 2025 The Conscience, which set off from Tunisia, had been waiting to take on board some 30 peace activists from around the world before trying to sail to Gaza in the eastern Mediterranean. The ship had been seeking to deliver aid including food and medicines to the besieged enclave, where aid groups warn people are struggling to survive following a two-month total blockade by Israel. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg said she was in Malta and had been planning to board the ship as part of the flotilla. Prime Minister Robert Abela said on Sunday that Malta was prepared to assist the ship with necessary repairs so that it could continue on its journey, once it was satisfied that the vessel held only humanitarian aid. Coalition officials said on Sunday that the ship was in no danger of sinking, but that they wanted to be sure it would be safe from further attacks while undergoing repairs, and able to sail out again. Earlier on Sunday, the coalition had accused Malta of impeding access to its ship. Malta denied the claim, saying the crew had refused assistance and even refused to allow a surveyor on board to assess the damage. “The FFC would like to clarify our commitment to engagement with [Maltese] authorities to expedite the temporary docking of our ship for repairs and surveyors, so we can continue on the urgent humanitarian mission to Gaza,” the coalition said in a statement later in the day. A Malta government spokesman said its offer was to assist in repairs out at sea once the boat’s cargo was verified to be aid. Coalition officials said the surveyor was welcome to board as part of a deal being negotiated with Malta. Israel halted humanitarian aid to Gaza two months ago, shortly before it broke a ceasefire and restarted its war against Hamas, which has devastated the Palestinian enclave and killed more than 51,000 people. Another NGO ship on a similar mission to Gaza in 2010 was stopped and boarded by Israeli troops, and nine activists were killed. Other such ships have similarly been stopped and boarded, with activists arrested. Hamas issued a statement about the incident off Malta, accusing Israel of “piracy” and “state terrorism”.",

    "title": "Israel calling up tens of thousands of reservists to expand war on Gaza",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military will call up tens of thousands of reservists to expand the country’s assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, army chief Eyal Zamir says. He made the announcement on Sunday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to continue the war despite growing calls from inside Israel for a deal that would bring home Israeli captives held in Gaza and end the war, which has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians. “This week, we are sending tens of thousands of draft orders to our reserve personnel to intensify and expand our action in Gaza. We are increasing the pressure to return our people [held captive in Gaza] and defeat Hamas,” Zamir said, adding that the Israeli military would “operate in additional areas and destroy all of [Hamas’s] infrastructure above and below ground”. The military chief made the announcement during a visit to the Atlit naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast. The announcement came before a Netanyahu-chaired security cabinet meeting to discuss an expansion of the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 and has decimated the Palestinian enclave. A growing movement within Israel has called for an end to the war, and an increasing number of reservists are ignoring call-ups. Two government officials told the Reuters news agency that the cabinet would also discuss the possible resumption of aid to Gaza as humanitarian groups warn of increased starvation in the territory since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2. Israel continues to face widespread global outrage over the conduct of its war in Gaza, which has shattered the territory’s infrastructure as well as its healthcare system and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents at least once since the war began. Far-right Israeli National Security MinisterItamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war but did not disclose details as to what new plans might entail. “We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. He demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza. Leading humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, have warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza is on the verge of “total collapse” and Palestinians face a “daily struggle to survive” amid bombardment and the crippling blockade. United Nations agencies have said truck convoys carrying aid are building up at the border and have not been allowed into the enclave, where a famine is looming. Israeli officials claim an expanded military offensive would pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Israel ending the fragile ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives, on March 18 has not led to any more releases. The reserve call-ups are going out as Netanyahupromised to respondto Yemen’s Houthis after the rebels fired a missile that struck a road at Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport, wounding six people and prompting several major airlines to suspend flights. Netanyahu said the response will take place “at a time and place of our choosing”. The Houthis have said their fighters carried out the assault “in support of the oppressed Palestinian people” and to counter Israel’s “crime of genocide” in Gaza.",

    "title": "Trump says ‘I don’t know’ when asked if he backs US due process rights",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has said he is unsure whether people in the United States are entitled to due process rights guaranteed by the US Constitution as his administration pushes aggressively to deport immigrants who entered the country illegally and other non-citizens, including some detained for pro-Palestinian activism and other political speech. Trump made his comments during an interview taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday on the NBC News programme Meet the Press with Kristen Welker. Welker asked Trump whether he agreed with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said last month that “of course” all people in the US are entitled to due process, which generally requires the government to provide notice and a hearing before taking certain adverse legal actions. “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know,” Trump said, adding that such a requirement would mean “we’d have to have a million or two million or three million trials”. The Constitution’s Fifth Amendment provides “due process of law”, meaning a person has certain rights when it comes to being prosecuted for a crime. Also, the 14th Amendment says no state can “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”. Trump added that his lawyers “are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said”. He said he was pushing to deport “some of the worst, most dangerous people on Earth”, but that courts are getting in his way. “I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it,” Trump said. On April 19, the Supreme Court justices temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. Trump’s administration, which has invoked a rarely used, 18th-century wartime law, has urged the justices to lift or narrow their order. US Solicitor General Dean John Sauer said in a filing to the Supreme Court that detainees are receiving advance notice of their removals and have had “adequate time” to file claims for judicial review. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of men without providing evidence of gang membership. In one prominent case, that of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, authorities ignored a court order that was supposed to protect him from deportation to El Salvador. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers later acknowledged that his removal was an “administrative error”. Separately, Trump said during the NBC interview that pursuing a third presidential term “is not something I’m looking to do”. “It’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do,” said Trump, who has occasionally hinted he would like to run for a third term. The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment states in part: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Separately, Trump said the US economy is in a “transition period” but he expects it to do “fantastically” despite the economic turmoil sparked by his tariffs. He offered sharp pushback when Welker noted that some Wall Street analysts now say the chances of a recession are increasing. “Well, you know, you say, some people on Wall Street say,” Trump said. “Well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history.” He also deflected blame for the 0.3 percent decline in the US economy in the first quarter, saying he was not responsible for it. “I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he’s done a terrible job,” referring to his Democratic predecessor, former US President Joe Biden. Trump also said he won’t remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who the president has repeatedly criticised for not moving faster to lower interest rates, before his term as Fed chair ends in 2026. Trump has in recent weeks repeatedly threatened to fire Powell. His attacks came after Powell signalled that the Federal Reserve – which is responsible for conducting US monetary policy – would keep its key interest rate unchanged, while it seeks “greater clarity” on the effect of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation and tariffs. During the interview, Trump also said he would extend the June 19 deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok, the short video app used by 170 million Americans, if no deal had been reached by then. “I would … I’d like to see it done,” Trump said. Trump said he had a “sweet spot” for the app after it helped him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election, adding, “TikTok is – it’s very interesting, but it will be protected”.",

    "article_text": "Brazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro has been discharged after spending three weeks in hospital recovering frommajor abdominal surgery. The right-wing politician, who led the South American country between 2019 and 2022 before losing his re-election bid, was being treated for an intestinal obstruction before his release on Sunday. He has had several medical complications, including six surgeries, since a 2018 stabbing that left him with lasting injuries. The 70-year-old Bolsonaro had earlier on Sunday said on social media that he was set to be discharged, and even suggested that he would try to attend a rally on Wednesday being planned by supporters. “I’m going home renewed. My next challenge: joining the Peaceful March for Humanitarian Amnesty on Wednesday, May 7,” Bolsonaro wrote. The rally is being held in support of an amnesty for supporters of the former president who stormed government buildings following Bolsonaro’s loss to current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2022. Bolsonaro had refused to publically acknowledge his defeat at the time. Bolsonaro had been touring the country attempting to drum up support for an amnesty for the January 2023 riots when he was hospitalised after experiencing severe abdominal pain during a political event in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte in April. The ex-president, who is aligned with right-wing figures in the United States and elsewhere, has his own legal troubles, after Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled in March that he shouldstand trialfor being part of an alleged plot to overturn his 2022 election loss. Thirty-three others have been accused of being part of the coup plot, which reportedly included a plan to poison President Lula and kill a Supreme Court judge. Bolsonaro has already been barred by the Supreme Court from running in any elections until 2030 over his abuse of power while he was in office, and spreading rumours that the country’s electronic voting system was rife with fraud.",

    "title": "Real Madrid-Celta Vigo: Mbappe brace keeps LaLiga title hopes alive",
    "article_text": "Kylian Mbappe struck twice as Real Madrid held off Celta Vigo with athrilling 3-2 winto stay within sight of LaLiga leaders Barcelona, whom they face next weekend. After the Catalans scraped a comeback win at Valladolid on Saturday, Madrid survived a late Celta fightback a day later to maintain the four-point gap ahead of next Sunday’s Clasico. Defending champions Madrid, in second place, were left clinging on at the Santiago Bernabeu against a Celta side seventh and hoping to qualify for European football next season. Madrid’s Champions League defence crumbled and Los Blancos were also beaten in theCopa del Rey finalagainst Barcelona last week, but Los Blancos are still hopeful of overhauling Hansi Flick’s side in LaLiga. Carlo Ancelotti’s side came into the game with a spate of defensive injuries, but after riding out an early wave of Celta chances, took control, with 20-year-old Turkish Arda Guler pulling the strings. With Rodrygo out with illness, the youngster started in his stead and took full advantage. Guler directed a spectacular overhead effort wide of goal in the opening stages, showing his ambition has no limits. Former Barcelona defender Marcos Alonso headed just over and then forced a fine save from Thibaut Courtois, as Celta threatened. Aurelien Tchouameni headed over when well-placed at the other end, as Madrid stifled the visitors. Madrid opened the scoring through Guler after 33 minutes, when the playmaker cleverly worked some space in the box and then brilliantly curled a strike past the reach of Vicente Guaita. Mbappe doubled Madrid’s lead after 39 minutes at the sharp end of a rapid breakaway. Courtois saved well from Borja Iglesias and immediately Madrid thrust forward, with Bellingham setting Mbappe free down the right. The French superstar ruthlessly lashed past Guaita from just inside the area. Just three minutes into the second half, Mbappe struck again for his 24th league goal of the season, putting him one behind the top scorer, Barcelona’s Robert Lewandowski. Guler was the creator, playing in the striker with a perfectly-weighted ball, and Mbappe finished low with a stroke of his left boot. It seemed the game was won for Madrid, but Javier Rodriguez pulled Celta back into it with a finish from close range after a corner. Lucas Vazquez blocked Pablo Duran’s backheeled effort on the line, but Rodriguez was on hand to pounce. Iago Aspas’s introduction off the bench for the Galicians immediately gave them more attacking impetus, and he produced a superb pass for Williot Swedberg to slot a second past Courtois. The Belgian goalkeeper had his heart in his mouth a few minutes later as Duran’s shot slipped out of his hands and could have squirmed across the line behind him if it had not slowed to a stop on the grass. But Real were able to see off the late pressure to ensure the win. If Madrid had dropped points, it would have allowed Barcelona to lift the title next weekend with a Clasico victory.",

    "title": "Israeli soldiers, settlers harass Palestinian activist featured in BBC film",
    "article_text": "Israeli soldiers andsettlershave harassed a Palestinian activist featured in a recent BBC documentary that has received praise for shedding light on the plight of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. As the world’s attention has been fixed on Israel’s 18-month war on Gaza, settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem have spiked, forcing Palestinians to flee their homes. A lack of Israeli police action has further emboldened settlers, who cite the Torah in claiming rights over Palestinian lands. Issa Amro, who was featured in The Settlers documentary made by British-American journalist and broadcaster Louis Theroux, released footage online showing how armed soldiers and settlers raided his house in Hebron in the occupied West Bank. Amro said police also threatened him with arrest and told him not to file a complaint in what he said is another instance ofapartheidimposed by Israel in the West Bank. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused Israel of practising apartheid in occupied territory. Amro added on Sunday that the Israeli settlers who attacked him a day earlier told him United States PresidentDonald Trump backed them. The settlers felt “emboldened because of the Trump administration’s blind support”, the activist said. Theroux said he and his team have remained in regular contact with Amro. .@Issaamrowho featured in The Settlers has posted videos of his latest harassment by settlers and soldiers.  Our team has been in regular contact with him since the documentary and over the last 24 hours. We are continuing to monitor the situation.https://t.co/asEWKkVX5h — Louis Theroux (@louistheroux)May 4, 2025 The BBC documentary, a follow-up to Theroux’s 2012 film The Ultra Zionists, reflects on how the situation has evolved in occupied Palestinian territory. While conducting interviews with Palestinian and Israeli figures, the documentary explored how the settler population has grown significantly and how new military outposts and Israeli infrastructure have expanded across Palestinian territories, often with direct state support. It delves into the religious and ideological motivations behind the Israeli expansion, which has led to mass displacement of Palestinians and violent clashes, and it questions thelegality and morality of the occupationas courts rule that it undermines international laws and norms. “You bring Jewish families [to the occupied West Bank], you live Jewish life, and this will bring light instead of darkness. And this is how the state of Israel was established, and this is what we want to do in Gaza,” Daniella Weiss, a key member of the Israeli settler movement for decades, says in the documentary. Weiss, who has enjoyed support from a number of Israeli rabbis as well, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “happy” about the settler expansion. Netanyahu hasopposedthe Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on private Palestinian land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They now number more than 700,000. All Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law. Settlements and their expansions are seen as the biggest hurdle in the realisation of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. TheUnited Nations General Assemblylast year called on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory. This came months after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Israeli presence in Palestinian territory is ‘”unlawful”. Theroux himself was harassed as well when making part of the documentary in Hebron when Israeli soldiers approached him and tried to make him leave the area. The harassment of Amro comes shortly after Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of theOscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was attacked by Israeli settlers in his home in the West Bank village of Susya. Armed and masked settlers vandalised his home and vehicle in late March and injured Ballal. While receiving treatment in an ambulance, Israeli soldiers blindfolded and arrested the filmmaker, who was later released without charge. Like the harassment of Amro on Saturday, that attack was also seen as retaliation for the documentary’s international acclaim and its efforts to show the struggles of Palestinians in the West Bank. The incidents have also further highlighted the dangers faced by journalists and filmmakers under Israeli occupation at a time when Israel haskilled more than 200 media workers in the Gaza Strip.",

    "title": "‘Starbase’: Residents of Texas site home to Musk’s SpaceX back city status",
    "article_text": "A community in the southern US state of Texas that is home to tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX will be renamed Starbase after residents – nearly all employees of the firm – backed the move to formally organise it into a city. In a vote on Saturday, 212 of the almost 300 residents eligible to cast ballots were in favour of the change at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, with only six against. Bobby Peden, who is vice president of testing and launches at SpaceX, was also confirmed as mayor. He was the only name on the ballot. Official documents show nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees. “Starbase, Texas,” Musk wrote on X, a social media platform he owns, “Is now a real city!” The vote came at a difficult time for Musk, a majordonorto US President Donald Trump and abackerof European far-right groups. The South African-born entrepreneur is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to instead focus more on his troubled electric car company, Tesla. It was Musk who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the facility – a key testing location for the company’s rocket launches – four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant municipality status to the site. Saturday’s vote was never in doubt, but the change allows Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law. However, not everyone has been upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town. Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, was among those voicing concern over the environmental impact, warning of more “destruction”. “They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,” she told the AFP news agency before election day. Some reports in 2024 had also said SpaceX’s rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests. In response, Musk had said on social media at the time: “To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.” Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities also found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and the release of pollutants into Texas waterways. Lueders argued in her letter in December that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure such as roads, education services and medical care at the site. She promised the creation of the new city would not undermine the company’s efforts to mitigate the base’s environmental impact.",

    "title": "What led to Mike Waltz’s ouster as Trump’s national security adviser?",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump on Thursdayremoved Mike Waltzas national security adviser (NSA), a key policy-shaping role, and tapped Secretary of State Marco Rubio to take over the role in the interim. Trump announced that he was nominating Waltz to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations. “Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role,” he posted on his Truth Social platform. “I’m deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” Waltz posted on X Thursday. The senior official’s reassignment comes in the aftermath of the so-called “Signalgate” incident and his leaning towards aggressive military action against arch foe Iran. The army veteran came under heavy criticism after creating a group on the Signal messaging app with other top officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, to discuss military attack plans on Yemen. The group’s chat became public after the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to the group mistakenly. After Goldberg published extracts from the chat, Waltz said he took “full responsibility” for the mistake. The scandal cast a doubt on Trump’s national security team, with both Waltz and Hegseth coming under fire. Several Democrats called for their resignation in the immediate aftermath of the scandal. While attending a cabinet meeting held by Trump last week, Waltz was also photographed using a modified and less secure version of Signal to text top officials. According to The Washington Post, he also upset Trump after engaging in “intense coordination” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the possibility of launching military strikes on Iran. As the Trump administration continues to pursue Omani-mediated talks with Tehran, Waltz reportedly frustrated the president by adopting an increasingly hawkish stance that favoured military aggression. Netanyahu’s office, however, denied the daily’s report that claimed he had “intensive contact” with Waltz. Moreover, he was reported to have built up tensions with White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, who increasingly felt he was not fit for the Trump team. Along with Waltz, the president is kicking out his deputy, Alex Wong, according to US media reports, becoming the first senior White House officials to be fired from the second Trump presidency. A number of inspectors general, federal workers, and senior military officials, including Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Commander of Air Force Special Operations Command General James Slife, have also been fired. During his first term, Trump sacked a large number of senior officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, and NSAs John Bolton and Michael Flynn. Waltz has come under fire from some recognised figures in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) camp backing Trump, mainly for a perceived lack of loyalty to the president and a difference in policy approach. Steve Bannon, a former chief White House strategist and influential figure, criticised Waltz for his hawkish foreign policy stance, particularly his support for military interventions. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, highlighted a 2016 video in which Waltz criticised Trump’s remarks about military service members as a sign of his disloyalty. She also accused Waltz of appointing staffers with anti-Trump sentiments and targeted his deputy, Wong, for alleged ties to Chinese interests. But JD Vance backed him, arguing that his reassignment was not a demotion but a strategic move that would allow Waltz to better serve the administration in a new diplomatic role. Waltz will now have to secure confirmation from the Senate to become the new US envoy to the UN, in what is expected to be a challenging path. Waltz is a former army green beret with deployments to Afghanistan that earned him a bronze star for valour. He has written extensively about military strategy and robustly supports national defence. The Republican is also a former member of the US House of Representatives and used to work as a counterterrorism adviser in the Pentagon during the George W Bush administration. But the Signalgate controversy, his reported unauthorised communications with Israeli leaders, and opposition by Democrats in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could work against him. For now, and without any specific time period announced, Rubio is taking over as NSA. Rubio, himself one of the more hawkish figures in the White House, is assuming more responsibility in a move that could be aimed at consolidating foreign policy leadership and streamlining the decision-making process. This is the first time since the 1970s that the secretary of state is also acting as NSA. Trump has not confirmed any potential replacements for Waltz in the future, but Stephen Miller, Steve Witkoff and Ric Grenell are some of the top figures in his circle. Miller is a senior policy and homeland security adviser known for his hardline immigration and foreign policy stances. Witkoff is serving as special envoy, leading the talks with Russia, Iran, and the Palestinian group Hamas. Grenell is the acting director of national intelligence and a former ambassador to Germany.",

    "title": "No, Trump is not a fascist. He is a hypercapitalist and just as dangerous",
    "article_text": "Since taking office in January, United States President Donald Trump has undertaken policy after policy that has shocked Americans and the world. From launching an immigration crackdown and persecuting legal residents sympathetic to the Palestinian people to dismantling diversity and inclusion programmes and assaulting higher education and free speech, Trump has fully embraced far-right agendas. His critics at home and abroad have readily called him a fascist. But fascism is not the ideology of choice for the US president. Fascist movements varied in their approaches to political and economic issues, but they have had several elements in common: The good of the nation is elevated above all, and the state plays an overarching role in society and the economy. In other words, fascism was an attempt to reformulate the socialist ideal into a strong nationalistic framework. And as a historical reaction to communism and liberalism, it remains exiled in the 20th century, in “the age of extremes,” as the British historian Eric Hobsbawm famously called it. Trump may be using the language of “America first” in his rhetoric, but he is not really pursuing the “good of the nation”. He is pursuing the good of the 1 percent. Trump and his cheerleaders want to go beyond neoliberalism, which maintains that a minimal state is ideal for economic prosperity, and establish hypercapitalism by dissolving any controls the state has over the accumulation of wealth by the extremely rich. They understand that we are living in times when extracting profit from society is not as easy, so they want to free capitalism from the hindrances of democracy and the demands of the people that their rights – political, social and human – be protected by the law and by the state. The tech bros that Trump has surrounded himself with have wrapped this hypercapitalism in a technological cover, claiming that technology can solve all woes and unlimited growth – read unlimited profits for the rich – is the only way to progress. This is clearly outlined in writings produced by the likes of Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley billionaire, who penned aTechno-Optimist Manifestoa year before US elections brought Trump to power for a second time. With an almost religious conception of technology and markets, he wrote: “Techno-Optimists believe that societies, like sharks, grow or die. … We believe in ambition, aggression, persistence, relentlessness – strength. … We believe in agency, in individualism. … We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology.” This view combines unrestrained capitalism with transhumanism – the belief that humans should use technology to enhance their abilities – and an individualistic interpretation of Charles Darwin’s survival of the fittest. It is easy to see that this sharp individualistic vision is the opposite of historical fascism, which prioritises the nation and the community over the individual. Some may point to Trump’s tariff policies as proof that he has statist tendencies. But if you scratch the surface, you would see that the trade war the US president is waging is really not about “bringing jobs back”, “defending national interests” or reversing globalisation. Trump is using tariffs as a coercive tool to force various countries into negotiating with him. When he announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, he himself bragged about 75 governments reaching out to his administration. It is far more likely that these bilateral talks will be used to extort concessions that will favour big capital closely associated with the Trump administration rather than to defend the rights of American workers and to create the conditions for the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. It is true that Trump has attracted the support of postfascist politicians in Europe and uses fascist language and tools, but that is not enough to brand him a “fascist”. European postfascists, like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, have themselves veered away from fascist conceptions of state and economy. Meloni and others have readily embraced “free market” policies of cutting taxes for the rich and wiping out social security provision for the poor. Her economic policies differ little from Trump’s. The US president has fully embraced xenophobic and racist language reminiscent of fascist rhetoric and launched a vicious campaign against immigrants. He does so not only to scare and win over marginalised parts of society but also to divert their growing discontent towards a racialised “other” rather than the wealthy class. This strategy is working not only because of the growing resentment for liberal elites that the impoverished majority has accumulated but also because the left has failed to act. Leftist and progressive politicians have condemned themselves to fruitlessly repeating the old right and left cliches, going on tirades about “Trump’s fascism” and debates about the Nazi or Roman salutes of his associates. Engaging in such rhetoric is futile and a waste of time and energy. Instead, the left should focus on developing concrete strategies to counter Trump’s popularity and hypercapitalist drive. It should go back to the root of problems that ordinary people face in their lives: jobs, healthcare, education and the ever-deepening cynicism about politics. It needs to not only expose Trump for who he really is – a champion of big capital interests – but also to provide a solid, realistic alternative.

    "title": "Trump faces backlash after posting AI image dressed as pope",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has faced backlash, including from Catholics, after he posted an artificial intelligence-generated photo showing himself as thepopedays in advance of a conclave to elect the next pontiff. Trump, who is not a Catholic and does not attend church regularly, posted the image on his Truth Social platform late on Friday, less than a week after attending the funeral of Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88. The White House then reposted it on its official X account. The image shows an unsmiling Trump seated in an ornate chair, dressed in white papal vestments and headdress, with his right forefinger raised. It came after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor of Pope Francis. pic.twitter.com/x2HrR939tn — The White House (@WhiteHouse)May 3, 2025 Asked who he would like to succeed Francis, Trump said: “I’d like to be pope, that would be my number one choice.” Trump went on to say he did not have a preference, but said there was a cardinal in New York who was “very good”. He appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative and fiercely opposed to abortion. Dolan said on Sunday that Trump’s AI pope image “wasn’t good” but declined to say whether the White House should apologise to offended Catholics. “I hope he didn’t have anything to do with that,” he said before a Mass at a Rome church. The irreverent posting, however, drew instant outrage on X, including from Republicans against Trump, a group that describes itself as “pro-democracy conservative Republicans fighting Trump & Trumpism”. The group reposted the image, calling it “a blatant insult to Catholics and a mockery of their faith”. The New York State Catholic Conference, which says it represents bishops of the state in working with the government, voiced sharp criticism of the picture. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,” it wrote in a post on X. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.” Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to comment on the image during a briefing with journalists about the process of electing a new pope, which begins on May 7. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wrote on X: “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the global right enjoys being a clown. In the meantime, the American economy risks recession and the dollar loses value.” Italy’s left-leaning La Repubblica also featured the image on its homepage on Saturday with a commentary accusing Trump of “pathological megalomania”. When asked to respond to the criticism, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.” Pope Francis hadarguably beenone of the most powerful moral voices on the world stage critical of Trump. When Trump first ran for president in 2016, Francis was unsparing on his signature promise to build a border wall to seal off Mexico. Francis had told reporters: “Anyone, whoever he is, who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.” Cardinals will gather on May 7 in a conclave in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope.",

    "article_text": "More than 3,500 children below the age of five years “face imminent death by starvation”, Gaza’s Government Media Office (GMO) has said, adding that some 70,000 children are being hospitalised in the enclave due to severe malnutrition amid more than two months of total Israeli blockade. “Under this systematic blockade, more than 3,500 children under the age of five face imminent death by starvation, while approximately 290,000 children are on the brink of death,” the GMO statement on Telegram said on Sunday. “At a time when 1.1 million children daily lack the minimum nutritional requirements for survival, this crime is being perpetrated by the ‘Israeli’ occupation using starvation as a weapon, amid shameful international silence,” it added. At least 57 Palestinians have starved to death, causing global outrage, but that has failed to convince Israel to allow entry of aid into the enclave of 2.3 million people. A shortage of food and supplies has driven the territory towards starvation, according to aid agencies. Supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition are depleted and quickly running out as documented cases of malnutrition rise. The price of what little food is still available in the market is unaffordable for most in Gaza, where the United Nations says more than 80 percent of the population relies on aid. Aid groups and rights campaigners have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel, for its part, insists the blockade is necessary to pressure Hamas to release the captives it still holds. Of the 59 captives still in Gaza, 24 are believed to be alive. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 52,495 Palestinians and wounded 118,366, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The GMO updated thedeath tollto more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "title": "Roku is looking into complaints about washed-out HDR streams",
    "article_text": "The problem seems to stem from a recent software update. The problem seems to stem from a recent software update. byWes Davis Roku is investigating user reports of washed-out colors when streaming HDR content from Disney Plus, according to athread on the Roku issue tracking board. However, the issue seems to go beyond that, affecting almost any app for Roku TVs, suggest user comments on the thread over the last week. The problem appears to be tied to a recent Roku software update. A community moderator called RokuEmmanuel-D writes in an update from Thursday that the company is “investigating the Disney Plus HDR content that was washed out after the recent update,” and asks for community members to share examples and details about what content is being affected, which model of TV they have, and what software version they’re on. The first several comments only report the problem in Disney Plus, and only on TCL TVs, with users saying that app menus and that colors are okay in non-HDR content. But asone user showsin the above images of Disney Plus showAndortaken from two different TVs,normally-vibrant colorshave instead taken on agray-ish pall. Later comments report the same problems with YouTube TV, Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and others. One said they saw the issue with theirHisense-branded Roku TV, rather than a TCL model. The same person reported HDR working fine over HDMIfrom their PS5, while another said the signal from their4K Blu-Ray playerlooked good, implying the issue is limited to Roku streaming, rather than any deeper TV firmware issues. People in the thread said their TVs — Hisense and TCL — were onRoku software version 14.5. Washed-out or flat colors can already be an issue when watching HDR content on a TV that’s not bright enough to produce a good HDR image — that was the reason I turned the feature off the old, cheap TCL Roku TV I once owned. But these reports describe something beyond that, with Roku producing desaturated, almost black-and-white images when HDR is on. It’s unclear how widespread the problem is, but there are recent Reddit threads that seem to fit the bill,mentioning grayishorblack-and-white picturethat doesn’t affect streaming app menus.

    "article_text": "The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. The latest iPad Mini and iPad Pro are getting cheaper by the day, but the basic models offer the best value. byBrandon WidderandQuentyn Kennemer If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times. The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air. It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters atThe Vergeare doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips. Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and home button. Apple’s10th-gen iPadcame out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted byApple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale atWalmartstarting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date.AmazonandWalmartare also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazonstarting at $299($100 off). Apple’s 11th-gen iPad offers 128GB of storage — twice that of its predecessor — and runs on a faster A16 chip. It also comes in four colors: blue, pink, yellow, and silver. As noted above,Apple’s 11th-gen iPadjust recently landed on the scene. Thenew base-model tabletis a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model. Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andTargetstarting at around $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $599 ($50 off). The seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds. The newseventh-gen iPad Miniis similar tothe outgoing modelbut comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades. The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is. Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetfor around $399 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the 256GB variant atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetfor $499 ($100 off), or the 512GB model atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetfor $699 ($100 off). That’s the best price we’ve seen on both of the step-up configurations. The new 11-inch iPad Air comes with Apple’s M3 chip and GPU upgrades. It’s available in dark gray, blue, purple, and a “starlight” cream shade. In addition to the 11-inch model, the iPad Air is also available in a 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M3 processor. The2025 iPad Airis little more than a spec bump over theprevious model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement. The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetin its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at around $499 ($50 off). Amazon also has the256GB model for around $599($100 off) and the512GB model for around $799($100 off), as doesBest BuyandTarget. The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetwith 128GB of storage starting at around $699 ($100 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model atAmazonstarting at $776.50 (about $123 off), or the 512GB variant atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetstarting at around $999 ($100 off), which remains its lowest price to date. Apple’s latest iPad Pro is the first Apple device with an M4 processor and an OLED-based Ultra Retina XDR display. It also features an improved camera system with adaptive flash and compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro and the newest Magic Keyboard. The newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor. Both models also feature an OLED display, a much thinner and lighter build, new horizontal placement for the front camera, and support for the Apple Pencil Pro. The2024 iPad Prois a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latestM4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call. As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetstarting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration atAmazon,Best Buy, andTargetstarting at $1,099 ($200 off), which matches the lowest price we’ve seen.

    "title": "Nintendo is suing accessory maker Genki after its unofficial Switch 2 mockups",
    "article_text": "Genki has allegedly been misusing Nintendo’s trademarks and misleading customers about its Switch 2 accessories. Genki has allegedly been misusing Nintendo’s trademarks and misleading customers about its Switch 2 accessories. byWes Davis Earlier this year, accessory maker Genki showed off a3D-printed mockupit said was based on the Nintendo Switch 2’s official dimensions just days before the console’sfirst official reveal. The company has since started offering Switch 2 accessories that it says will be compatible with the system at launch. Now, Nintendo is suing the company,reportsThe Game Post. Filed May 2nd,Nintendo’s complaintalleges that Genki is guilty of five counts of “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising,” and that its actions violated multiple laws, including the Trademark Act of 1946. It claims that Genki’s use of Nintendo’s trademarks is confusing to buyers, who are “likely to impute any shortcomings, defects, or lack of quality in Genki’s products to Nintendo” itself. Nintendo’s lawyers write that although Genki has promoted its products as compatible with the Switch 2 at launch, it has been inconsistent about whether their designs are truly based on unofficial access to the console itself. Nevertheless, they claim customers will probably think the products are Nintendo-authorized, and that Genki is “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.” Nintendo asks that the court require Genki to stop selling products marketed with Nintendo’s trademarks, and for compensation for any damages Nintendo sustained from the the alleged offenses, and more. Genki addresses the lawsuit in a statementposted to X, asEurogamerspotted: You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully. What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products. While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week. We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers. —Team Genki Genki isn’t the only company that unveiled accessories for the Switch 2 before Nintendo officially revealed it. Dbrand announced aSwitch 2 casein December, and before that, smaller accessory makers announced things likescreen protectors. These sorts of early accessory announcements aren’t unusual in the world of smartphones, where case makers turn to leaked specifications to make risky betsthat don’t always pan out. But for Nintendo, Genki at least seems to have crossed a line that it simply isn’t willing to tolerate. Nintendo did not immediately respond toThe Verge’s request for comment.

    "title": "Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now",
    "article_text": "Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. Every model in Apple’s current lineup, from the entry-level SE to the Ultra 2, is receiving some sort of discount right now. byBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing theApple Watch Series 10alongside ablack renditionof theApple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does thesecond-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update,watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2. While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, theSeries 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyright now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains its best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at $329 ($100 off) — which is the best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $399 ($100 off). The latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE. Apple’s entry-level wearable represents a minor upgrade when compared to the prior SE, though it does sport a faster chipset and make use of many watchOS 11 features. The Apple Watch SEreceived a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration). Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for an all-time low of $169 ($80 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor $199 (also $80 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale atWalmartstarting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at around $219 (about $79 off). The rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s handy double tap feature. The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors. In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazonwith a Trail Loop,an Alpine Loop, oran Ocean Bandstarting at $729.99 (about $69 off). You can also pick it up atBest BuyorTarget, though only for its full retail price of $799. While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.

    "article_text": "SpaceX employees near the company’s Texas launch site voted yesterday to incorporate as Starbase, Texas. SpaceX employees near the company’s Texas launch site voted yesterday to incorporate as Starbase, Texas. byWes Davis South Texas voters mostly employed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX have approved a measure to incorporate as Starbase, a new city in Texas’ Cameron County near the company’s Boca Chica Beach launch site on the Gulf of Mexico. The final tally was 212–6 in support of the measure,reportsThe Associated Press. The election took place followinga petitionthat had gained enough signatures by February to force a vote, in which just 283 people were eligible to participate,according toThe Texas Tribune.Last week,an analysisby public journalism collaborationThe TexasNewsroomfound that three in five of those people were SpaceX employees, and per theTribune, the city will be led by three peoplewith ties to SpaceX. Musk, who first posted aboutstarting his very own company townin 2021, declared victoryin a post on Xbefore the vote tally was complete last night, saying, “Starbase is now officially a city.” Hefirst posted about the idea of forming the city in 2021. With the measure approved, SpaceX now stands to gain more control over the launch site. As theTribunenotes, the company has to get permission from Cameron County officials to close Boca Chica Beach for launches, but TexasSenate Bill 2188could change that. The bill doesn’t mention Starbase, which wasn’t a city when it was written, but would give the power to approve beach closures to a municipality that meets certain conditions, including containing “a spaceport” and existing within a county that “borders the Gulf of Mexico or its tidewater limits.” As that bill makes its way through the state legislature, the federal government is seemingly losing its ability to constrain SpaceX. Musk’s DOGE has worked under President Donald Trump to hamstring federal agencies, includingThe Environmental Protection Agencyandthe Federal Aviation Administration, whose regulatory authority the billionaire’s company falls under.

    "title": "The fantasy of playing Final Fantasy",
    "article_text": "A portrait of the parent as an NPC. byJoseph Earl Thomas Collage: Ian Woods / Photos: Eva Alicia Lépiz for The Verge, Square Enix A portrait of the parent as an NPC. byJoseph Earl Thomas Collage: Ian Woods / Photos: Eva Alicia Lépiz for The Verge, Square Enix You are a negro bunny bound for greatness in the New World, as if the old were simply a mistake. You can’t stop thinking about Sylvia Wynter and something like New World natives; you stall, with everyone else, rather than negotiate a true critique of the present, rather than pauseFinal Fantasy XIVas ordered by necessity and place your twin boys in the bath. No, the little fuckers berate each other and bash plastic dinosaurs against wood drawers, the floor, and on too many occasions, each other’s faces; a waterlogged mosasaur with a missing fin lay wrecked beside the tub. You understand that, unlike NPCs, the children will die if left unattended, which you’ve had waking dreams about since the moment they were born, boring ones mostly, for seven years now. Some nights they’re burning up in a windowless room and you simply can’t break in to get them out, your family dog (also already dead from heatstroke, oh how she loved to run with you all summer) crying just outside the door. Instead, you get bodied in a dungeon called Alzadaal’s Legacy on your way to potential riches, the rewards of narrative forestalled by an octo-jelly hybrid named Ambujam slamming big waves and needling tiny tentacles into the core of your little party. What otherwise forces literary allusion — Octavia Butler’s Oankali, the race-adjacent tyranny of jellies in John Vercher’sDevil Is Fine, that short comic you’d drawn about Tentacool from which your child obsesses, or the diabolical Meduse in Nnedi Okorafor’sBinti— all latch on and linger in the part of your brain that understands intertextuality as a prime necessity for living an examined life in the 21st century, and of course, rap music. How many times has the spineless jelly been plopped down at the end of somebody’s cipher for effect? Fantasies of full immersion glitter on repeat across the pandemic-ravaged synapses of your brain. It is a peculiar sensation, this forked road of desire and responsibility, children or game, both shortcuts away from sociality, or sex, or thought: two radically opposed sets of reality, two modes of impression upon the world, two diffracted futures in which you die anyway. The children laugh at your body, dying like that. The bath is too hot, then too cold. Then they splash murky water all the way from the bathroom onto your carpet and PlayStation controller as you try to explain the situation to your beleaguered team members via in-game party chat. Responses range from,Oh I get it man, to laments about the reproductive class ruining the real worldandthis one. Time is of the present, and you wonder, is the New World still new if it takes too long to get there? Bedtime is eight o’clock, but you’re aware that bedtime can’t happen if the children catch you doing anything, like breathing, let alone ostensibly enjoying yourself. In Eorzea, you don’t really have to do things like breathe, or take a shit, which is nice. When you tell friends about returning to Eorzea after a hiatus too long for most of them to stand, they laugh.You thought you could just hop right in like nothing changed?You were, after all, maxed out on Dark Knight, Black Mage, and Reaper last time you checked. That they respond at all feels grand, though, the otherwise silence of each individual’s formal responsibilities all but eradicating forms of play and friendship; here, it’s potential pleasure that pushes everyone out of their day-to-day: the children’s needs; dead and dying lovers and friends; the coy stupidity governing a “civil” discourse around what is or is not the amplification of an ongoing genocide; the prisons, lord the prisons; Friends Hospital off Roosevelt Boulevard, where another friend reminds you “those people are notactuallyyour friends.” To be honest, the breakdown you had at that little Mississippi airport a week ago was a serious low, frustrated about the impulse to conform aesthetically, emotionally, socially, and politically in order to survive or be loved, yupping up tears as the old southern ladies tried to comfort you and writing sad but competent poems on the plane ride home. Complaining to your old adviser and friend that Earth feels horrible, to which she agrees,Yeah, sometimes earth feels v bad. Reintegration — into Eorzea, not Earth, of course — seems a better deal than ending your own life, a pathetic point on which your analyst, and perhaps your children when they are older, all agree. You think of the story your homegirl told yesterday on her way to a wake, a newlywed from around the way who shot himself in the bathroom while everyone had dinner beyond the locked door. These stories are many, and you’ve seen the aftermath dozens of times — and even worse — how the family is denied even the life insurance money, dignity a foregone conclusion of such fates. “Daddy, you still playin’ that game?” the children say. “What’s it even about?” Just then you remember why there are so many portal fantasies, as two seven-year-olds transform into characters in need of aesthetic education, who sponge up the worldbuilding, solving for you a pattern of rote explanation you seek to avoid in everything you’ve ever written. You often fail. You are, after all, a negro bunny, you explain, which is technically a race called Viera, yes, which is one of the playable races inFinal Fantasy XIV, a Japanese massively multiplayer online roleplaying game; this part, naturally, they don’t find strange, as Japan’s soft power exportation since the ’60s has been so successful at obscuring the nationalist position that such games, some of the most popular in the world — to say little of their interlocution with manga and animation — appear either textureless or international since at leastSuper Street Fighter II; “asiatic” Christopher Patterson calls them, inaugurating their own genres, and “no” is what you said to the fellow traveler poet Benjamin Krusling at a comparative literature conference when he asked, after thinking together about Simone White’s writing on black music, if you thought black people had any such soft power. You’ll keep thinking about Benji’s question for some time as you go on explaining to the children that you play the hero called the Warrior of Light, no matter your race, and yes, races are real differentiations in the game with specific markers, and yes, that one is a lion, or a cat, and some look human and then you have jobs. Why would I want a job? Because, well, I would rather not, but these aren’t like regular jobs. They’re fun jobs. They’re basically sets of abilities you can use, and I know, right, don’t that one look cool? I got that sword from the marketplace. Yes, you can just go to the marketplace and players sell each other goods and stuff. One of the jobs is a dancer because it’s a long-heldFinal Fantasything, which kind of makes sense because dancers are ostensibly in great fighting shape, and what do we do in the game? Well, lots of things. I have a house and bred this red chocobo here, and no, red isn’t my favorite color; it’s purple, why y’all always tryna revise history? You gonna ask your mom? Go ahead ask her. I’m telling you my favorite color is purple. Anyway, you basically join up with your friends to save the world and such or collect cool items. Like what? Like that sword or this armor or decorations for your house and stuff, yeah. Your friends can come to your house. Wait, you think we need a bigger house in case a blind person or my friend Astride in her wheelchair comes over? Yes, it’s true that accommodation is a broader societal problem that is often overlooked, but we can’t afford an elevator for our house and we only have one floor. No, they don’t have elevators in the game, either, not like the regular kind. Well, we’re saving the world from lots of things: ourselves, aliens, evil, and on and on. There’s a larger story, of course, usually about getting stronger together and killing God. Why would you want to kill God? Well, lots of reasons, and it’s a long story either way but what makes this — no, that’s not one of my friends running by. That’s a random person… Time passes. The explanatory project ends a half hour later (you’re a fast talker) with a brief history of the previous game in this series, fond memories of playingFinal Fantasy XIin your friend’s basement all day and night, hunting Notorious Monsters for pelts and necklaces and sometimes selling them for the more limited resource of real money to buy hoagies and cheesesteaks, when, back then, all y’all had was time. And to paraphrase Audre Lorde, the quality of time by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the changes (wages?) we hope to bring about through those lives in Eorzea. When asked if those friends are playing now, you’re forced to be honest, hating people who lie to their children incessantly, and say that you had a falling out with one over race and racism, power, and the apoplexy of male comportment, and another was too sad and you think, based on eyewitness accounts — though you are unsure because you have not spoken directly — is addicted to crack cocaine now. “Do you want to be friends with them?” the children say. “Yes,” you say, “but I don’t know if we can anymore.” Eorzea will not let you move on till you finish with Meteion, the bewinged girl, created by an ancient magic derived from emotion, turned supervillain. You’re tired of talking about affect, explaining the theoretical difference between such a thing and feeling, and so you split the difference with Megan Boler and Elizabeth Davis and thinkfeelings on the move, which is exactly what Meteion is about. You see, Meteion and her sisters were created in order to scour the universe for love and life, to find the polymorphous meanings and variegated reasons for living. They’re essentially hyperempathetic, like Lauren Olamina, which you can’t help but see as terrible, despite an odd celebration of that text and her ability in the pantheon of liberal surface dwelling. This is when the older one walks in, your young girl of 12 with purple locs, whose life at present is split between hoop dreams and acting. Who is Lauren Olamina? Everybody knows her, you say. That’s Octavia Butler’s character from — who is Octavia Butler? Okay, I’m gonna disown y’all in a minute. All her books are on the top row of the living room bookshelf, but anyway, they can literally feel what other people are feeling. Yes, contrary to popular belief, thatisbad, and it creates a horrible cycle of amplified violence, recalling the succinctness with which Natalie Diaz referred to it as a “hunting strategy” onBetween the Covers,or Namwali Serpell’s “The Banality of Empathy,” or Saidiya Hartman’s question about the paradigm generally inScenes of Subjection; suffice it to say, it’s not always just good, nor is it a totalizing positivity logic for reading books or whatever. Yes, you can read that last one, too, if you want. It’s on the first and fourth row of the bookshelf behind my desk: I suggest you start with the original edition. That other part will get answered, so hold questions for further explanation. “Okay,” they all say now, their little bodies wrapped around your body on the bench at the end of your bed. So, anyway, to no one’s surprise, what Meteion and her sisters find all across the universe isn’t exactly the kind of happy happy joy joy espoused by your better-bred peers giving the social justice 101 lectures at universities for half a year’s salary under the banner of change or progress or whatever. They found lots of dead worlds, warring worlds, failed empires, societies on the brink of collapse or otherwise ushered into demise by the soft sharing of their own hyperempathy. It’s one of those invention-gone-wrong stories, the premonition of which Samuel Delany once described in the subjunctive mood of “this could happen,” though technically, it’s fantasy and in the past. Those books are on the second shelf from the top by the front door. So yeah, they decide to do the only reasonable thing and end all life in the universe as a form of mercy killing, sort of like Eren fromAttack on Titan,but without the history of extreme and intractable subjection and sans the logic of saving your friends. No, this is not the first time this has happened in a fantasy story, but it’s particularly interesting as a plotline now, as it directly involves something closer to feeling. Meteion and them drain the aether (magic) from the universe, and this transforms many people into monsters, which you slay with brutal efficiency and remorse for the infinitely memorable or easily forgettable NPCs they once were. Well, you don’t mourn, so much as their families and friends mourn after you slaughter the lot of them with greatswords and scythes, black magic and knives in this city called Radz-at-Han, a facsimile of a stereotypical rural Indian village where both humans and humanoid elephants live that is run by an ancient dragon disguised as a small boy. Anyway, to describe the music or accents would be racist in principle. To assuage your frustration that they do not read enough, the children take to reading the story text and dialogue out loud, unprompted: Alisaie (read by M-): “We must find a solution that addresses the fundamental cause. Before our strength is exhausted. Before the crisis spirals out of control!” Y’shtola (read by Leah): “Throughout history, some have deliberately embellished the truth, but I believe many — if not most — deviations are the result of similar linguistic shortcomings, piling one upon the other, until the end result is unrecognizable from its origin.” She continues, after a beat of reflection: “Which is why I fear that writing an account of my own words would be akin to diluting fine wine with water.” “Daddy,” a lap baby says, “why you always make everything so complicated?” Another voice comes through the screen, more familiar. “Yo, what up man!” “Is that Uncle Brandon?!” the children ask. “Uncle Brandon!” They love Uncle Brandon, who, in the pantheon of IRL negro life, is technically not their uncle but your friend’s long-term partner turned family. Uncle Brandon always has baby Leon in his lap, cooing and being an angry little baby with a large head. Brandon bounces back and forth between Eorzea andElden Ring, only able to play one for so long before fatigue sets in. He welcomes you back to the land and you trade jabs about this plotline and the next, the tropes of family organization, and for the first time, you discover that yet another new baby is being onboarded to Earth from your friend’s, his partner’s, belly. This makes you sad at first, which is selfish, so you turn congratulatory as recompense. You say the word “vasectomy” half-jokingly. You’d last seen him onElden Ringmonths back and ask now whether he plans on helping you through the new dungeon leading up to your battle with Meteion, the sad creation of a shockingly unsick (at the time) society whose explosion of feeling threatens to obliterate the universe. Yes, he will, soon as Tasia gets home, and you hear a familiar voice through the screen. “Hey, Uncle Jo Jo!” Lily shouts from beyond the screen, beyond the pale, if you will. How the game fixes character and voice the way black folks, as long-term friends, have always fixed each other as family. The way kids always shout, but it’s okay because you miss her. Through her voice, you can only picture her new lanky body and giant hair on a longboard from the last time you saw her, some summer ago, cheesing on a ride down the cul-de-sac hill and draped in long-gone sunlight. You dap her up virtually, against the limits of the digital, and she asks when’s the next time you’ll all get onMonster Hunter, wherein “all” includes your eldest son and namesake who fled Philadelphia for Fort Lauderdale with his mother, going on a year now. You are at the midway point of grieving this circumstance; his visits over the holidays or in the summer do not make this better. Another character enters the fray, having heard the aforementioned Lily from the television one room over (the yelling). “Is that Lily!?” Leah yells, pushing the twins off your lap. “Hey, Leah!” Lily yells. You and Brandon and the twins fall to the background as the girls argue over skateboarding, anime,Roblox, kids movies, and why Leah isn’t playing the game even though she’s talking so much shit. “Older” now, she’s in denial about her former (very recent) place in the lap-sitting-while-watching-the-game order because she’s 12. You have to remind her of humble origins onLego BatmanorLego Star Wars,where, facts, she sat on your lap and forced you into combat with all of her then-fiercest enemies, the Joker and Darth Maul, Darth Vader, and Two Face. Don’t act brand new, you say; she acts brand new anyway. “That was like seven years ago,” she says. “I could barely hold the controller.” “And now you can. You’re welcome,” you say. She’s off to make ramen that will be “better than yours!” but doesn’t respond when you ask who taught her to make the ramen. You don’t technically have to eat in Eorzea, but you can if it suits you. Brandon’s avatar approaches in new gear. He’s a samurai with “traditional” garb and a long, glowing katana; he does flips and fight stances like in real life, showing off. “Oh my gosh, Uncle Brandon’s character is so cool,” the lap babies say, dickeatin. “Daddy, can you dress like that?” To be aesthetically pleasing in-game is more important than food but requires immense labor; cool gear is a wearable distillation of said labor, and fashion is king. This is the moment you decide to stay up all night if you must, dealing with Meteion and missing deadlines, ignoring a sext, and knowing how difficult the morning will be because, first and foremost, you must improve your fashion sense in Eorzea. You’re queued up for another run at this midtier dungeon when the growling commences. The lap children make animal noises and moan in such a way that you know what’s coming next. You exit the party queue with the swiftness and hit the kitchen, dispensing Chobani Greek yogurt cups to quell the whining. You like the anticipation of needs and the simultaneous quashing of said needs as they nonetheless yell. “Daddyyyyy, I’m hungry!” and “Yeah, Daddy can we have some casadillas?!” You are too pleased with the fact that you need say nothing but dispense the goods. You’ve beaten them at their own game, their salty little faces having received the things they’re screaming for prior to the end note of the scream. Shut they little asses right on up. You heat the casadillas — good lord,quesadillas— you had already prepped and chilled earlier and deliver the order to smiling faces who say things like “Thank you, Daddy” or “We love you, Daddy” and proceed to play with, rather than eat, the food. Eventually, they will fight and spill water on their plates, the table, the floor, hit a dog for nibbling the food they teased it with, and cry, before demanding zero-calorie Gatorade. On cue, they say, “Can we at least have a Gatorade?!” Here you make jokes about exercising, which they’ve consistently refused to do, save a few jumping jacks or stuffed animal curls, mocking push-ups and fake moonwalks, but what you really want is a return to Eorzea, and of all the options available to you, dispensing the Gatorade is the quickest route of reentry. You give them your least favorite flavor, orange, which they gulp in seconds like the insane babies they are, before standing at the threshold of your door once again. “Daddy! Can we watch you play the game?” They return to your lap on the eve of bedtime, while hardly across the hall in the other room, door half-open, your 12-year-old boots up her PS5. You feel both proud and ashamed of the shift in permissibility, recalling all the old arguments to infinity and beyond with your ex about what children should be able to do, eat, or drink, and when; you’ve acquiesced to almost everything, and you fear the infiltration of acquiescence from, and toward, that terribly beautiful thing called the world. You wonder if they will be able to live examined lives or slip into the comforting tendrils of normative power relations and drown. Too much of everything, too many rules, too much fear that your children need a source of formal discipline while understanding the long and indefensible reach of discipline in the world; all old questions regarding the scope of punishment for negro children to survive percolate through your brain: pride taken in the visual economy of beatings that everybody swears up and down would improve your children’s dispositions, if only you would just do it, the agonizing literatures through which a transition from slavery to Jim Crow to the present is described as absolutely continuous with said beatings, a failed reclamation of “The Family” as an autonomous sphere within which black people have never been given any real choice whatsoever. This is what you love quite dearly about N.K. Jemisin’sThe Fifth Seasonnovels, another example of the “End of World” type in which “The End” was always already happening, both at the level of intimate relations and the structure of being. You consider how much sense Jemisin’s love of anime makes in such a context, the only place where children are taken seriously, her advocating forFullmetal Alchemiston her blog and essentially writing a spate of novels that reimagines that very narrative in broad, black strokes. What’s not to love about such things, not at all meant for you and your children, but whose structure of feeling is so rich and in kind with your own that you might have otherwise died without them, suffocating under the shallow representation of someCosby Showor whatever. The infinite web of bad options in the collective sphere of choice crisscrosses through your skull and hurts and gets stuck in your gut at the reminder that you have fed those people but not eaten yourself. Your analyst is, often enough, concerned about your time and blood pressure, how blood pressure has circumscribed in one way or another, the time of everyone you know who was not murdered outright. She thinks that you refuse to organize your life in a way that might garner more pleasure than distress. You refuse to listen to your body. You tell her that doing this would mandate unreasonable degrees of abandonment; she says that someone else can take on more responsibility, because what if you die? You say that people die all the time, as it’s one of the major risks of being alive, and besides, it’s not like you know anyone who can take on more responsibility or how you’d be able to pay them any more money than you already do, even if you did trust other people like that with your kids. In Eorzea, there are consequences to death that sink mostly to the level of annoyance, unlikeFinal Fantasy XI, where you might never recover from such a loss, having experience itself ripped from your body. Here, losing the durability of your gear and a little bit of cash is a fine price to pay for starting over. But you are still a negro bunny bound for the New World in which all forms of discourse blend into a puree of fatigue: PlayStation voice chat, Instagram Messenger texts, missed calls, student emails, wailing babies, brooding preteens who copy your playlist and blast it on speakerphone after bedtime in some form of unclear protest against, what, rest? Or attention perhaps? Though you consider the fact that you did play ball with her on a torn ligament earlier that day as requested after getting trashed by her inNBA 2K5a few times, needy parents who can’t cook but eat all your food and demand money, whining doggies and the little black cat with the UTI, all swirl around the demand to attend or ignore the stretch of imposition both feasting upon and forcing the continuation of your spirit, none of which you can integrate at this particular moment. In Eorzea, you turn off the local chat field to minimize distractions and raise an arm around one of the lap babies to better position yourself with the limp anatomy of sleepy children. You can never remove yourself from this plot, sitting on the bench at the foot of your bed, most often used for, well, other things, though now enrobed in immovable lap babies. “Daddy go there!” they say. “No over there!” “Oh my gosh, what’s that monster called?!” “Daddy can you change jobs?!” You receive a text alert from Tasia saying she’s bout to get on the game and help your “punk ass” succeed against a spate of punk ass monsters that don’t even rise to the level of remembrance for her, alongside an invitation to a gender reveal party for the next baby. You write back asking whether you need to bring an incredibly heterosexual cisgendered baby toy for entry, first into the game chat because you’re confused about which one you’re using, and then to her cellphone once you get it together. She says, no, it’s really just a cookout, like last time. She says you are the only friend she invited, and you’re always happy to be invited to any cookout where you are not the one cooking or the only one watching kids. You don’t have babies in Eorzea, or states to garnish wages for a child whom you take sole responsibility for, which is refreshing. You are just a negro bunny walking by every night, talking sweet and looking fly, and anything hectic inside can be manageably excised through axes, spears, spells, and the unevenly warmed-up fried chicken drumstick you clutch in your left hand. Tasia and Brandon both join and you mix up jobs, deciding that, much like with lovers, you’ll be whatever you need to be for this to work out. Together, you enter the dungeon and discover that this battle was not nearly as difficult as you recalled hours earlier with a group of strangers and then NPCs. Were you asleep at the wheel? Is it the power of friendship? Or is it simply that you and Tasia and Brandon have very little time and turned the level cap off in order to sweep through with just a party of three? Tasia’s Red Mage dies once, and your Reaper drops half a dozen times, though she revives you, each time hocking a new low-grade insult. Brandon is apparently invincible. The pattern of enemy attacks all seem simple now, and perhaps it was you who’d rather have made it hard. You sidebar about children’s grades and aging bodies no longer capable of hooping for seven hours a day as you pile up enemies and knock them down, pile them up and knock them down. The 12-year-old walks into your room for her goodnight hug and kiss, shaking her head at the half-sleep babies desperate to maintain attention to the sekai kei plot of Eorzea, where the end of the world comes in seasons or modes of attention. Brandon returns her gesture from the dungeon, a goodnight without missing the beat of a single combo. In Eorzea, multitasking is possible, if only for the fact that it is necessary. Only then do you recognize the added weight of the lap babies, nodding off still glued to your chest and legs. Their way-past-bedtime bodies whimper as you carry them two rooms away, for they can’t wake up and walk or part from you for anything other than the plushie dinosaur pillows they call their babies, dressed in diapers and pajamas on each of their bunk beds. They only wake up slightly as you lay them down, addressing the matter of hugs and kisses directly and ensuring you don’t forget the cracked door, and the breakfast options, and the calling mommy tomorrow, and the plans to have a good day at school, and the final gesture tucked underneath all of it after the hugs and kisses and “I love yous,” the question that emerges like a non sequitur dependent clause but isn’t: “but can we watch you play the game tomorrow?” They’re both worried about Meteion, because she’s sad, and to be honest, so are you. Y’shtola again (1:13AM and nary a second after the children have gone to sleep): “An event is described as ‘sad.’ A summation which fails to express the emotional complexity. Yet the word on the page is what endures. A pale shadow of reality.” ©2025Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved",

    "title": "Shotgun Cop Man is a weird-as-hell platformer about arresting Satan",
    "article_text": "It’s a dark trip to catch a petulant Satan using your guns. It’s a dark trip to catch a petulant Satan using your guns. byJay Peters Shotgun Cop Manis a strange platformer. You play as a square man with a round, bald head who’s chasing Satan to arrest him. At the beginning of each of the game’s nine worlds, Satan gives you the middle finger. And you don’t just use guns for fighting, but for traversal as well. You start each world with two guns: a rapid-fire but weak pistol and a more powerful shotgun that only has three blasts. When you’re on the ground, your ammo constantly refills, meaning you essentially have infinite ammo. But when you’re in the air, if you run out of bullets, you won’t get a refill until you touch the ground. This all matters because there’s no jump button. That means you get into the air by shooting your guns: the pistol lets you hover, while the shotgun can rocket you upward to reach high platforms. You can aim in any direction, so the shotgun can blast you backward and forward, too — it’s a speedy and fun way to get around. It’s all a little bit likeDownwell, but sideways. You’ll need to get around quickly to dodge Satan’s minions. Most often, you’ll take on little devils that spit bullets and are generally a nuisance. But there are a few more difficult enemies, such as flying sentient saws with one eye. There are bosses at the end of each world, too, like a flying skull with horns that can manifest a body to attack you with. If you get hit by an enemy or stung by a spike, your heart will fly a short distance away from your body. If you get the heart back, you’ll survive another hit and the heart will float away again. It’s similar to aSonicgame, where you can take a hit so long as you have at least one ring. If you’re hit while your heart is out, you’ll die — though thanks to the game’s generous checkpoint system, you usually won’t start too far from where you were killed. Each world has 17 short levels that are filled with typical platforming dangers including baddies, spikes, moving platforms, lasers, and block pushing puzzles. (Block shooting puzzles?) Individual levels generally take 30 seconds to a couple minutes to beat, so depending on how skillful you are with your guns, you can zip to the goal quickly and feel like a speedrunner. You’ll frequently find new guns, too. I was a big fan of one that made bullets bounce off walls, which doubled as a useful puzzle-solving tool. The sniper rifle was a welcome upgrade because it could blast through multiple enemies at once. Visually, the game looks like a platformer in dark mode: black is the primary color, and enemies are generally a shade of red. Throughout the game, you’ll hear a persistent, thumping, and unnerving soundtrack that sounds like what you’d hear at some kind of Satan-worshipping club. The whole vibe makes you feel as if you’re actually descending into the pits of some dark hell. My favorite part of the game was that you could accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. My full playthrough was about three and a half hours, and I could get through most of the nine worlds in about 20 or 30 minutes. I appreciated the brevity, because even though I very much enjoyed the game, the intentionally uncomfortable atmosphere got under my skin, and I could only play it in short bursts. Once you understand how to navigate just withShotgun Cop Man’sguns, you can really fly around the levels like some kind of cartoony action hero. By the end, you’ll use those guns to give the finger right back to Satan. Shotgun Cop Man is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 4, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News Two brands of tomatoes have been recalled in 14 states due to possible salmonella contamination, the Food and Drug Administration said this week. Ray & Mascari Inc. recalled four-count Vine Ripe tomatoes that were sold by Gordon Food Service Stores in 11 states, including New York, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania. According to theFDA, Ray & Mascari Inc. was notified by Hanshaw & Caping Farms of Immokalee, Florida, that they were recalling a lot of tomatoes they had received and repacked into 4 Count Vine Ripe Tomatoes due to the possible presence of salmonella in their facility. People infected with salmonella can often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare cases, salmonella can result in more serious illness and can be fatal in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems. The FDA said that while no illnesses have been reported from the tomatoes, it recommends consumers either throw out the tomatoes or return them if they are unopened. The tomatoes were sold in plastic clamshells and had a VINE RIPE TOMATOES label containing \"Packed by Ray & Mascari Inc.\" The other states impacted by this recall are Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Williams Farms Repack LLC is recalling tomatoes sold to wholesalers in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia and had been distributed between April 23-28, 2025, the FDA said in a separate notice. The tomatoes affected by this recall can be found on theFDA's website. Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 4, 2025 / 6:15 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump shared an AI-generated photo of himself dressed as the pope just days after telling reporters that he'd \"like to be pope.\" The image – which Mr. Trump first posted on his social media platformTruth Social– was also shared by the White House's officialsocial media accounton Friday. It comes ascardinalsfrom around the world are set to gather in Vatican City to choosePope Francis' successor as the leader of the Catholic Church. The image shows Mr. Trump seated in an ornate chair, dressed in white papal vestments and headdress, with a finger raised. pic.twitter.com/x2HrR939tn Mr. Trump, who is not Catholic, joked to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday that he would like to succeed Francis, who died at 88 last month. \"I'd like to be pope. That would be my No. 1 choice,\" he said. The president noted that he actually had no preference, adding, \"I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who's very good, so we'll see what happens.\" Mr. Trump was referring to Timothy Cardinal Dolan, archbishop of New York. While there has never been a pope from the U.S., Francis was the first from the Americas. In response to the AI-generated photo,Dolan said Sundaythat it \"wasn't good.\" \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with it,\" he told CBS News New York. Francis died of a stroke that ultimately led to irreversible heart failure, according to a death certificate issued by the Vatican. Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump wereamong the dignitarieswho attended Francis'funeral last week. While there, Mr. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Days later, Ukrainian and U.S. officialssigneda joint economic investment deal on Wednesday that includes granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni, according to Reuters, declined to comment on the image shared by Mr. Trump during a briefing with journalists about the process of electing a new pope, which begins onMay 7.Some 133 cardinals will choose the next pope, with no clear frontrunner in sight. The AI-generated image sparked backlash from some on social media, while others defended it as a joke. Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, an outspoken critic of the president, criticized the post andsaidit \"affirms how unserious and incapable [Mr. Trump] is.\" The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mockery. \"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President. We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us,\" they wrote onX. Debbie Macchia, 60, a supporter of the president outside his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida on Saturday morning, told Reuters he was \"clearly joking.\" \"But I wouldn't want to see them do anything sacrilegious with the pope, or anything,\" she said. CBS News has reached out to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for comment. This is not the first time Mr. Trump or the White House has shared an AI-generated photo of the president. In mid-February, their official social media accounts posteda different AI-generated imageof Mr. Trump wearing a crown and captioned \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.

    "title": "Brazilian police arrest 2 in thwarted bomb plot at Lady Gaga Rio concert",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 4, 2025 / 6:03 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro. Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach. Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. \"The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,\" the police said. Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack — the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio. The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career. \"Tonight, we're making history,\" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. \"Thank you for making history with me.\" A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports. \"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\" the spokesperson said. \"Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\" The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \"Bloody Mary.\" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand. Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million. For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming\"Mayhem Ball\" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like \"Abracadabra.\" Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including \"Poker Face\" and \"Alejandro,\" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag. Some fans — many of them young — arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view. \"Today is the best day of my life,\" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \"It's surreal to be here.\" Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year. The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June. \"It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season — filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month. Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028. Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out. While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors. More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show. \"I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years. For her, the mega-star represents \"total freedom of expression — being who one wants without shame.\" Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that wasthe biggest free rock concert in history. To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach. Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters. Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues. Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait. \"She's the best artist in the world,\" the 25-year-old said, as chants of \"Gaga, I love you\" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Wisconsin woman missing nearly 63 years was found \"alive and well\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 4, 2025 / 5:44 PM EDT/ CBS News A Wisconsin woman who went missing more than 60 years ago was recently found \"alive and well,\" authorities revealed last week. Audrey Backeberg was 20 years old when she first disappeared from her home in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, in July 1962, the Sauk County Sheriff's Office said in anews release. Backeberg reportedly left her family's home on July 7, 1962 and the family's babysitter claimed the two of them hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, before taking a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana, theWisconsin Department of Justicesaid. The babysitter, who was not identified, said she last saw Backeberg, then a mother of two, walking around the corner away from the bus stop. Backeberg never returned home and was not heard from again — until now. Earlier this year, a detective assigned to do a comprehensive review of the cold case, and \"through diligent investigative work,\" they uncovered new insights into the disappearance. \"Further investigation has revealed that Ms. Backeberg's disappearance was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play,\" the sheriff's office said, though it did not disclose where she was found. Backeberg, now 82, lives outside of Wisconsin, officials said. Speaking toABC affiliate WSIN, Detective Isaac Hanson, who found Backeberg, said he was able to locate her through her sister's ancestry.com account. \"That was pretty key in locating death records, census reports, all kinds of data,\" he said. \"Ultimately, we came up with an address ... So I called the local sheriff's department, said 'Hey, there's this lady living at this address. Do you guys have somebody, you can just go pop in?' ... Ten minutes later, she called me, and we talked for 45 minutes.\" Hanson said an abusive husband may have played a role in her initial decision to leave her home. He said Backeberg sounded \"happy. Confident in her decision, no regrets.\" \"The Sheriff's Office would like to acknowledge the work of Investigators, both past and present,\" it said in a news release. \"Despite the significant challenges that many cold cases present, this resolution underscores both the importance of continued work and the dedication of the Sheriff's Office to providing answers to families and the community.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 4, 2025 / 4:27 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The South Texas home ofElon Musk's SpaceX rocket companyis on its way to becoming an official city with a galactic name: Starbase. A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX. Starbase is the facility and launch site for theSpaceX rocket programthat is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars. Muskfirst floated the idea of Starbase in 2021, and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers. The unofficial results on election night show 212 votes for the City of Starbase incorporation, or 100%, with Bobby Peden elected as mayor with 100% of the votes. The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire's popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted. SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area. But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council. All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year. The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes. SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment. \"We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\" Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot. The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \"the provisions of schooling and medical care\" for those living on the property. SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach. Critics say the beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change. Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, plan to hold another protest Saturday night as the polls close. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "A tariff loophole expires Friday. Here's what that means for shoppers.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 4, 2025 / 4:24 PM EDT/ CBS News Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S. Temu, for one, announced a dramatic shift to its business model. \"All sales in the U.S. are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countrieswill no longerbe as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note. The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government. From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a Februaryreportfrom the Congressional Research Service. The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes. President Trump in Februarysaidhe would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Mr. Trump in April signed anexecutive ordereliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\" \"We put an end to it,\" he said. Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S. Retailers are already tacking on heftytariff surchargesto customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods. \"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch. Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said. The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods. \"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said. Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted. \"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch. It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\" \"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added. Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs. \"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company. Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better thansmaller retailersthat operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains. The consumer won't emerge unscathed. \"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch. She expects to see consumers start \"trading down\" by swapping name brands for store labels, or even turning to resale platforms to stretch budgets.

    "title": "Trump on using military force says \"I don't see it with Canada\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 4, 2025 / 3:43 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump said he would talk toCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carneyabout making Canada the 51st state. But the president said he didn't expect it to get to the point of using military force — though he wouldn't commit to the same for Greenland. \"Something could happen with Greenland, I'll be honest,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired on Sunday.  He said that \"we need that for national and international security,\" but he added \"I don't see it with Canada. I just don't see it.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly vowed tosecure U.S. control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, while also threatening to make Canada the 51st state. And last week, the president's territorial threats against Canada, coupled with his tariffs, appeared to play a part in a major political turnaround for Canada's Liberal Party in the federal elections. The president spoke with Carney following his victory, but the men said they didn't talk about making Canada the 51st state. Still, when asked whether he would do so when the leaders next speak, Mr. Trump said \"I'll always talk about that.\" Mr. Trump outlined his reasoning, claiming \"we subsidize Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year\" and arguing that \"we don't need anything that they have.\" He said \"if Canada was a state, it wouldn't cost us.\" The president said it would be a \"cherished state,\" while urging that North America would be \"beautiful\" without the U.S.-Canadian border running through it. \"When I look down at that, without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago — it was just an artificial line, it goes straight across — you don't even realize what a beautiful country it would be,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It would be great.\" As for Greenland, the president said when asked to clarify whether he would rule out using military force on the territory that \"I don't rule it out, I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything, no — not there.\" \"We need Greenland very badly,\" he added. \"Greenland is a very small amount of people we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them and all of that, but we need that for international security.\" Located between the U.S., Russia and Europe, Greenland is viewed as a strategic position for both economic and defense purposes, with melting sea ice opening up new shipping routes through the Arctic. Greenland's prime minister has pushed back sharply against Mr. Trump's threats, saying in March that \"we are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\" In the wide-ranging hourlong interview with \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump waffled on whether the thinks he needs to \"uphold the Constitution.\" \"I don't know. I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what Supreme Court said,\" Mr. Trump said regarding due process for immigrants sent to a prison in El Salvador.

    "title": "PBS CEO says \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" after Trump targets funds",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 4, 2025 / 3:09 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Sunday that \"we have never seen a circumstance like this\" afterPresident Trump issued an executive orderlast week aimed at cutting federal funding to the two major public broadcasting systems — PBS and NPR. \"This is different. They're coming after us on many different ways,\"Kerger said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing theCorporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. The executive order dictates that the government \"shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration's policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.\" Kerger said it's one of a number of avenues where the administration is \"coming after us,\" including with a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things. \"Obviously we're going to be pushing back very hard, because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations, across the country,\" Kerger said. Kerger said PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but said that figure is an aggregate number, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 40% or 50% of their funding from the government. For them, she said \"it's existential,\" adding \"that's what's at risk if this funding goes away.\" Among the funding that Kerger said she expects to be impacted is funding from the Department of Education, which she said has supported the creation of children's programming and the research behind its educational components. Kerger said the programming was created because not all children have access to formal pre-kindergarten. \"That was the idea with Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers, and everything that's followed since is to make sure that children that do not have access to a full array of resources have the opportunity to learn and to develop skills that they'll need the first time they enter preschool,\" Kerger said. \"That's what's at risk.\" NPR CEO Katherine Maher also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and said \"we're looking at whatever options are available to us\" to challenge the executive order. Maher echoed that the \"immediate damage is to local stations,\" while noting that other scenarios, like a clawback of already appropriated funds, or if stations were no longer able to participate in their membership dues, would be \"damaging.\" \"The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities,\" Maher said, noting that there are 246 stations throughout the country, and for some Americans, they provide the sole local source of news. Theexecutive ordersays \"Americans have the right to expect that if their tax dollars fund public broadcasting at all, they fund only fair, accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news coverage,\" while arguing that government funding for news media is \"not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\" The order claims that neither PBS nor NPR present \"a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\" Maher, who noted that she doesn't personally make editorial decisions, said in response to the suggestion that NPR is not fair and non-partisan that \"I think our newsroom would really take issue with that.\" \"We have been on air for more than 50 years. We have been covering news as it occurs across the nation, in local communities, overseas,\" Maher said. \"We have an extraordinary Washington desk, and our people report straight down the line, and I think that not only do they do that, they do so with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting.\" Kaia Hubbard is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The attack was apparently premeditated, the officials said. Three guards were stabbed and taken for medical treatment along with two others hurt Friday at Wallens Ridge State Prison in western Virginia, the state Department of Corrections said. The agency said in a press release that six inmates involved had all been convicted of violent crimes including murder and rape and that five of them were \"confirmed MS-13 gang members from El Salvador, who were in this country illegally.\" It said the sixth inmate was a U.S. citizen with ties to a different gang. \"Five of the individuals responsible for this senseless attack should never have been in this country in the first place,\" Chad Dotson, director of the Virginia Department of Corrections, said in a statement. \"Every single day, our officers put their lives on the line to ensure public safety for the more than 8.8 million people across the Commonwealth. This attack is an example of the dangers they face when they show up to work every day.\" Corrections officials gave no further details about the prison attack, citing an ongoing investigation. The agency said three of the injured officers were treated and released the day of the attack. The remaining two were hospitalized in stable condition. Carla Miles, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, said she did not know if the two guards remained in the hospital Sunday. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin responded to the attack on social media. \"Praying for the full recovery of the three Virginia correctional officers brutally stabbed today in a premeditated attack by MS-13 gang members, criminal illegal immigrants who should never have been in our country to begin with,\" Youngkin wrote in apost on X. \"Virginia will always stand with the brave men and women who protect and serve our Commonwealth.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "'I'll be an eight-year president': Trump weighs in on third-term speculation",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump offered his clearest indication yet that he will leave the White House at the end of his second term without trying to extend his stay, acknowledging the constraints preventing him from seeking a third term in an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Trump also highlighted several other rising stars in the Republican Party he said are capable of carrying the MAGA mantle after he’s finished as the GOP’s elected leader, mentioning not only Vice President JD Vance but also Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whohas become a central playerin his second administration. “I’ll be an eight-year president; I’ll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,” Trump told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in an interview that aired Sunday. Trumptold Welkerin March that he was “not joking” about his consideration of a third run, and he said again in his latest interview that he’s received strong requests from allies to run again. Despite those entreaties, Trump told Welker, he’s aware of the realities standing in the way. “It’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional that they’re not allowing you to do it or anything else,” Trump said. The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment says, “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Amending the Constitution to abolish that limit would be extremely difficult, requiring the support of either two-thirds of both the House and Senate or two-thirds of state legislatures. Both routes would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn.,introduceda House joint resolution in January seeking to amend the Constitution to allow the president to be elected for up to three terms, a legislative effort that so far has seen little movement. Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman of New York, who served as lead counsel during Trump’s first impeachment,introduced a resolutionin response urging his colleagues to reaffirm the 22nd Amendment’s prohibition on a third term. Trump told Welker he has had no official meetings specifically about establishing a pathway for a third term, but he’s heard “different concepts” about potential options — including a legally dubious strategy in which Vance would seek the presidency and then pass the role on to Trump. \"Other people say, 'You can have a write-in vote,'\" Trump added, despite the constitutional limitation. Talk of a potential third Trump term reached a fever pitch last month after the Trump Organization, led in part by the president’s two adult sons,began sellingTrump 2028-branded red hats. The hats were listed for $50 with the description: “The future looks bright! Rewrite the rules with the Trump 2028 high crown hat.” Despite that description — and its pointed reference to “rewrite the rules” — Trump said his aim is to ultimately pass the torch ahead of the next presidential election. “There are many people selling the 2028 hat,” Trump said. “But this is not something I’m looking to do. I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward.” Among the GOP stars Trump said can take charge of the MAGA brand — which he described as the greatest political movement in history — is Vance, who Trump suggested would likely have an advantage over other competitors in a Republican primary for the top job. Welker asked if Vance would be “at the top of the list” as his successor, and Trump praised his vice president without making any commitments. “It could very well be,” Trump said, before adding, “I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy. Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great.” He also emphasized that such discussions are “far too early.” “But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,” Trump said. Trump has declined to be drawn into endorsing or labeling Vance as his anointed successor, while still showering him with praise over his work. In February, Trump told Fox News’ Bret Baier that Vance is “very capable” but that he did not necessarily view Vance as his successor. Trump also named Rubio as a “great” potential GOP leader. Trump’s confidence in the former Florida senator is reflected in Rubio’s wide portfolio in the administration: He’s been tapped by the president to serve as the acting head of the National Archives, acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and, most recently, national security adviser — replacing Michael Waltz, whom Trump instead said he would nominate to be ambassador to the United Nations. “Marco’s doing an outstanding job,” Trump said when the interview turned to Waltz. He added that while he does not expect Rubio to remain in his newest role in the “long term,” he’s inno rush to replace him. “Now, Marco won’t keep — Marco’s very busy doing other things, so he’s not going to keep it long term. We’re going to put somebody else in,” Trump said, though he later noted that Henry Kissinger served as both secretary of state and national security adviser, adding: “Henry Kissinger did both. There’s a theory that you don’t need two people. But I think I have some really great people that could do a good job.” Asked by Welker if Rubio could continue in both jobs “indefinitely,” Trump said: “He could, yeah. He could. But I think he even would like to probably see — because it is a little bit different. But in the meantime, he’ll handle it.” The field of “tremendous” Republicans Trump said could emerge as 2028 front-runners, a group that he said includes as many as 20 people, does not appear to be a chief concern for the president months into his second term. He suggested to Welker that he’s much more focused on a more immediate election, the 2026 midterms, in which Republicans will have to fight historical odds to maintain control of both chambers of Congress. Backlash against Trump’s swift use of executive authority to reshape the federal government — from targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to imposing new tariffs on dozens of countries — have weighed on the GOP politically, with Trump’s approval ratings steadily declining throughhis first 100 days. The economic consequences of the tariffs in particular appear to be politically damaging, with Trump’s handling of tariffs earning him especially low marks compared to other issues in recent public surveys,including CNBCandNBC News Stay Tuned polls. Trump told Welker he plans to play a “very active” role in the midterm cycle, especially through his fundraising prowess. He downplayed concerns that his agenda may cost Republicans one or both chambers of Congress. “If you look, it’s pretty consistent that whoever wins the presidency ends up losing the House, losing the Senate. I think we’re going to turn that around. I think we’re going to turn it around easy,” Trump said.",

    "title": "Trump defends the high price tag for his military parade: 'Peanuts compared to the value'",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump told NBC News he plans to hold several events to celebrate U.S. military victories this year, including a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate Flag Day, which also happens to fall on his birthday. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in a wide-ranging interview at Mar-a-Lago that aired on Sunday. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14 maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.” The parade won’t be cheap. Defense officials told NBC Newsthat the estimated cost could be as high as $45 million, with individual Army units ultimately bearing the cost of the parade — which could potentially impact funds used for training. Trump said it would be worth it. “Peanuts compared to the value of doing it,” Trump said of the cost. “We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it.” The event, which will also mark the Army’s 250th birthday, is expected to include 6,600 soldiers, an Army spokesman said. Defense officials familiar with the planning said it is also expected to feature more than 50 aircraft and 150 military vehicles, which could include wheeled vehicles such as Humvees and trucks, and so-called tracked vehicles, like tanks. The military parade is just one of several events Trump said he intends to host this year to mark America’s wartime achievements. Trump said he was inspired after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron about Victory Day celebrations in Europe commemorating the end of World War II. He said he was considering celebrations on separate days to commemorate the end of the two world wars. Recounting a past conversation with Macron, Trump recalled saying, \"'We had more to do with winning World War II than any other nation. Why don’t we have a Victory Day?' So we’re going to have a Victory Day for World War I and for World War II.\" “You know, if you look at Russia, they celebrate Victory Day,” he had previously noted. “I think you can have two days,” Trump said. “This doesn’t mean we’re going to go and not work and have a national holiday and all of that, because we don’t have many of those days left. You know, eventually our country will become all national holidays.” When Welker pressed for more details on these celebrations, Trump pivoted back to talking about Flag Day and didn’t get into specifics. The U.S. officially claims Nov. 11, 1918, the day an armistice agreement was signed with Germany, as the end of World War I. Sept. 2, 1945, when the U.S. accepted Japan’s surrender, is the date recorded as the end of World War II. Trump also revealed his plans to remodel the White House, starting by replacing grass in the Rose Garden with a “beautiful stone surface.” “We had the prime minister of India here, and they had a lot of press, and the women were walking out with their shoes full of mud. So we can’t have that,” Trump said. The renovations will also include an effort to build a ballroom in the East Wing of the White House using existing meeting rooms. It would be used in part to host world leaders. “You know, when they have a party for, like, when the head of China comes in, or the head of anybody, you know, head of anything,” Trump said, “they have a party where they have a tent 200 yards away, where people have to walk in the rain to get to a tent. And that’s not for us. That’s not for the United States of America.” Trump noted that he built a ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago property and said his background as a real estate developer makes him uniquely equipped to carry out the White House renovation. He told Welker he plans to fund the effort himself. “Yeah, I’m not going to ask the government for money. I’ll fund it, and I’m sure we’ll have some donations to it. But it’s not an inexpensive thing. It’ll cost a lot of money,” Trump said, adding that “it will be something really beautiful, top of the line.”",

    "title": "Trump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisions",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Friday reflected onhis phone callearlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that the Amazonwas going to begin to list tariff chargeson certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. \"He’s just a very nice guy,\" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. \"We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don’t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately.\" Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump’s first administration. In December, Amazondonated $1 millionto Trump’s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman. Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, \"The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: \"Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them.\" \"If I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call,\" he added. \"Wouldn’t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do.\" In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs. \"I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive,\" he told Welker. \"What people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all,\" he added. Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as “import charges.” Other popular American retailers, like Béis, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, haveurged consumers to shop morein the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices. Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings,telling shareholdersin recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings. Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term. Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: \"I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.\" Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs. \"I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,\" he said, adding, \"we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.\"",

    "title": "Stocks unleash remarkable comeback after a historic dive from Trump's tariffs announcement",
    "article_text": "In the week following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost. Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II. Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump’s tariff plan were testing traders’ faith in the United States’ ability to make timely payments on its debt. Stocks around the world sold off, too. “April was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,” analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. “The initial moves were truly historic in their speed.” With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts,Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announceda 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for “non-retaliating” countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized. Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the “Liberation Day” tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off. The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker’s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president’s policies. Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, is still 40% off its December peak. Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. And with Friday’s close, the indexsaw its longest winning streak in 20 years. Experts say the recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump’s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an “acceptance” stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another. “Markets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, ‘OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?’” said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. “People are starting to look more forward than backward.” If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, therecovery has been led by so-called “retail” investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing. According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), “bulls,” or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered “bears” (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month,the most in its 15-year historyand the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported. “It would be simplistic to say it’s just retail — but to a large extent it has been,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group. The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in “meme” stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds. The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to “buy the dip” — the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they’ve gone down — remains, Sosnick said. “I think the key element has been American investors’ unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,” he said. “And if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.” The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump’s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday,stocks surgedon a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump’s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute. And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despitea strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back.Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year. Friday’s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing. Companies, too,are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing itas they await clarity on how Trump’s tariffs shake out. As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whoseregular surveymost recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%. “Bearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,” the AAII said. “Bearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey’s history.” Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “Those negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,” he said. There are also signs that the“Sell America” tradeis lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, whonoted in a post on X Fridaythat the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities. There’s been a “rotation away from the U.S.” even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said. In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here. “It’s still early,” said Islam, of VettaFi. “There’s still a lot of that uncertainty.”",

    "article_text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Oscar Piastri won an action-packed Formula 1 race full of wheel-to-wheel battles Sunday, extendinghis championship leadover fellowMcLaren driver Lando Norris, who finished second. The Miami Grand Prix secured the city's place on the Formula 1 calendar with a contract extension through 2041, reflecting a huge bet by the sport on the growing U.S. market. The opening sequence proved crucial for Piastri. He qualified fourth, two positions behind Norris, but got ahead of his teammate as Norris tangled with Red Bull pole-sitter Max Verstappen in the first few corners and lost positions. Norris fell to sixth place accused Verstappen of pushing him off the track. Verstappen, thereigning four-time world champion, aggressively defended against the charging McLarens of Piastri and then Norris, but he was ultimately unable to keep them behind. Verstappen and Norris battled for second place over multiple laps and traded positions before Norris won out. Meanwhile, Piastri built up a 9-second gap out front that was important to his win. Norris closed the gap significantly in the final stretch of the race, but he ran out of laps and finished 4.6 seconds behind Piastri. \"It was a good thing that I built that gap in the first stint,\" Piastri said, adding that he was struggling later in the race. Piastri now leads Norris by 16 points in the championship standings, having won four of the six opening races. Mercedes driver George Russell completed the podium in third place. Verstappen finished fourth after he fell behind Russell during the pit stops. There was drama between Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, leading to curt radio messages by Hamilton accusing Ferrari of poor teamwork when he got stuck behind his teammate while on faster tires. Leclerc finished seventh and Hamilton eighth. The Miami Grand Prix, which held its first race in 2022, is now the longest-contracted race on the calendar, the promoters said. F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali called Miami \"one of the most important and spectacular events on our calendar.\" \"Extending this agreement until 2041 is a strategic milestone of enormous importance, which strengthens our presence in America and consolidates the ever-deepening bond with our fan base there, which is constantly growing and passionate like never before,\" Domenicali said in a statement. The Miami paddock and weekend party circuit were abuzz with celebrities and VIPs, including former football players Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, Olympic medalist Lindsey Vonn, comedian Andrew Schulz, singer Jelly Roll and Lisa, the Thai singer and actor who appeared in the recent season of \"The White Lotus.\" While President Donald Trump didn't make an appearance as he did last year, his national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, attended and was photographed speaking to Verstappen after the qualifying session Saturday. The weekend included a shortened \"sprint\" race Saturday, which turned chaotic amid rainand was won by Norris. One of the stars in Miami was the 18-year-old Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli, who made history as the youngest-ever pole-sitter in the Saturday sprint. Antonelli finished sixth Sunday, behind Alex Albon of Williams, who scored an impressive fifth place. On the night before the race, the Cadillac F1 team unveiled its logo at a swanky red-carpet launch party in Miami Beach as it prepares to join the grid next year. “This decision was made with the fans in mind and continues to push the boundaries of motorsport to the highest level. Cadillac’s entry represents a powerful fusion of American engineering excellence, heritage, and innovation and I look forward to welcoming them,\" Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of the FIA, the sport’s governing body, said in a statement. In attendance was Mario Andretti, the 1978 F1 world champion, who is advising the team on driver selection and other matters. \"Seeing the Cadillac Formula 1 team come to life was an adrenaline rush, coming from my passion and love for it. It was a celebration of teamwork, dedication and resilience. A night to acknowledge the effort and perseverance of so many people,\" Andretti told NBC News. \"My congratulations to Cadillac and to each individual who helped navigate and offer reassurance about the future. I’m so proud to be on this team with them.\" The paddock featured a garage experience aimed at promoting the upcoming \"F1\" movie, starring Brad Pitt, which Warner Bros. is scheduled to release in the United States on June 27. The area included an immersive opportunity, produced by the Los Angeles-based creative agency Sturdy.co, for VIPs and attendees to listen to the movie’s album. It also offered F1 race simulators decked out in style of the fictional APXGP team for which Pitt’s character races. \"It's romantic, it's exciting, and it's most authentic racing movie ever made because of the technology we were able to use,\" producer Jerry Bruckheimer said in an interview in the paddock. \"The story is emotional. It's a comeback story — the kind of stuff that inspired me to go see movies and make movies.\" Pitt plays a retired F1 driver named Sonny Hayes who unexpectedly returns to racing years after a horrible crash. Bruckheimer said Pitt trained for three months to learn to drive an F1 car. Pitt \"did all his own driving,\" he said. \"He loves driving cars. And I think the saddest day for Brad is when he had to step out of the car and we wrapped the movie. I was more relieved than anybody else that everything was safe.\"",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump played down the fears of his critics — from the potential harms of a recession to worries about rising prices due to his tariffs to the possibility that he would seek a constitutionally forbidden third term —in a wide-ranging,exclusiveinterviewwith NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker. With his approval numbers sliding modestly amid a flurry of executive actions, Trump waved away concerns about rising prices on some goods in the wake of his expansive program of tariffs. Asked about small businesses concerned about pain from tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump said “many businesses are being helped” and that there was no need for the relief some small businesses are seeking. “They’re not going to need it. They’re going to make so much money,” he said. The president suggested that Americans ought to be able to make do with fewer common goods, like dolls or pencils. Asked about rising prices on items like tires or strollers, Trump pivoted to gasoline, saying that was “thousands of times more important.” In the interview, he also: You can read a fact-check of Trump’s interviewhere. You can also read the full transcripthere. I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know. Trump, whenasked if he has to “uphold the Constitution,”argued that fulfilling his ambitious campaign promise to rapidly carry out mass deportations may take precedence over giving immigrants the right to due process under the Constitution, as required by courts. On amuddy track at Churchill Downs, 9-to-1 outsider Sovereigntywon the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby, with favorite Journalism ending up in second place. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who takes home $3.1 million in winnings, had already pulled off an upset of his own, bouncing back from a hairline fracture in his shoulder two months ago that left him sidelined for weeks. He said: “Every day since I got the injury I kept telling God, ‘Please heal me, please heal me. If it’s meant to be, I know you’re going to put me right back in action before the Derby.’” Alvarado spoke of Sovereignty’s loyalty, noting how the horse stuck by him when he couldn’t ride. “I didn’t have any reservations about him,” Sovereignty trainer Bill Mott said in reference to the horse. “Everything had gone smoothly. Ordinarily to win these kinds of races, you can’t have any hiccups in your training schedule or the way the horse is doing.” But the derby didn’t just bring high-stakes races. It also, of course, brought ahost of fabulous outfitsand mint juleps galore. Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal known for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people,has emerged as a leading contenderas cardinals prepare to meet Wednesday to begin the process of electing Francis’ replacement. Like Francis, the Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, adopted a simple life that has led to comparisons to the late pontiff. If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia — about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic — and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region. Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community. But Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News that Tagle lacks the “prophetic voice” that saw Francis exert moral authority on issues like capitalism or the injustices of war.",

An NBC News analysis of maps, evacuation orders and statements released by the Israel Defense Forces, as well as interviews with experts, humanitarian workers and civilians, shows that people have been pushed into increasingly crowded areas, and that a humanitarian zone once deemed safe is no longer designated as such. Israel broke itsfragile trucewith Hamas on March 18, just over two weeks after the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal came to an end. Negotiations on the second phase of the deal, meant to establish a permanent end to the fighting, have since stalled, with Israel also blocking the flow of aid and goods into Gaza for more than 60 days. Along with regular airstrikes and ground operations, its military has also moved to secure more of the enclave, while nearly half a million Palestinians in Gaza have been newly displaced, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees,UNRWA, recently warned.",

    "title": "U.K. probing possible link between two suspected state-sponsored Iranian plots",
    "article_text": "British authorities are investigating two plots involving mostly Iranian nationals in the United Kingdom that appear at this stage of the investigationlikely to be state-sponsored, according to a senior official briefed on the threat. Eight people have been arrested in London and in other parts of the U.K. over the weekend, according to statements from local authorities. Seven of them are Iranian nationals, officials said. Police said three of the men were arrested under Section 27 of the U.K.’s 2023 National Security Act, which allows police to arrest people suspected of acting in association with a foreign power. Officials said the two plots were separate, but the senior official briefed on the threat said British law enforcement is now trying to determine whether the same entity was directing both plots. The CIA and the U.S. National Intelligence Director's office did not respond to requests for comment. Some information about one of the two plots came to light early Sunday local time. In the first announcement of arrests, Metropolitan Police said they took five men into custody, four of whom are of Iranian descent, in connection with what they called “an alleged terror plot in the U.K.” The men range, who are 29 to 46, were arrested in various areas around the U.K. — including Swindon, London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester — under the Terrorism Act “on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act,” police said. The age and the nationality of the fifth man is still being determined. All remain in police custody. A motive was not immediately clear. Police said a “fast moving” investigation into the first potential attack was underway. Counterterrorism police alleged the first group was targeting a specific site but declined to say where. Details about the other purported attack plan have not been revealed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called the two attacks “major operations” and said they reflect “some of the biggest counter-state threat and counterterrorism operations that we have seen in recent years,”according to video of the statement from Sky News. She also called the ongoing investigation “immensely important.” Iranian nationals in the past have targeted U.K.-based Iranians. In one case, an independent television network named Iran International — which broadcasts in Farsi and had been critical of the Iranian government — moved from London to the United States after its journalists received state-backed threats from Iran,the BBC reported in 2023. According to anITV News investigation of that plot, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps planned to kill two journalists at the network using a people smuggler, whom they paid $200,000 to carry out the attack. The plan was ultimately foiled when the smuggler became a “double agent” for an unnamed Western intelligence agency, according to the investigation. In March 2024, another Iran International journalist was targeted and stabbed outside his London home,The Associated Press reported at the time. Two Romanian men werelater chargedin the attack. The U.K. has responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since the start of 2022, which present “potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents,” U.K. Minister of State Dan Jarvis said inan update last month, citing MI5 officials. Jarvis said Iran is targeting dissidents, media organizations and journalists reporting on the violent oppression of the Iranian regime. He added that Iran could also be planning attacks on Jewish or Israeli target, citing a “long-standing pattern of targeting Jewish and Israeli people internationally by the Iranian Intelligence Services.” “It is clear that these plots are a conscious strategy of the Iranian regime to stifle criticism through intimidation and fear,” Jarvis said.",

    "title": "Catholic leaders criticize Trump for posting apparent AI photo of himself as the pope",
    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez President Trump is pictured at the Vatican in 2017 with Pope Francis, who died last month.  Trump posted on social media Friday what appears to be an AI-generated image of himself dressed as the pope.Alessandra Tarantino/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Some Catholic leaders and at least one U.S. Catholic group are criticizing President Trump after he posted on social media what appears to be an artificial intelligence-generated image of himself dressed as the pope. Trumpposted the imageon his Truth Social account on Friday night, and shortly after it wasreposted by the White Houseon its official X account. Trump traveled to the Vatican late last month toattend the funeralof Pope Francis, whohad diedseveral days earlier at age 88. The papal conclave to elect the next pope isset to beginon Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/x2HrR939tn The image shows Trump in the pope's traditional white cassock, wearing a gold cross around his neck as well as the iconic papal hat, or mitre. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York who is friendly with Trump,told journalistsin Rome Sunday morning that he hoped Trump \"didn't have anything to do with\" the image. When asked if it offended him, Dolan said, \"it wasn't good.\" The New York State Catholic Conferencesaid in a poston X: \"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President. We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\" Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of the Diocese of Springfield in Illinoissaid in a Facebook postthat by publishing the image \"Trump mocks God, the Catholic Church, and the Papacy.\" Paprocki added the image was \"deeply offensive\" — especially as Catholics continue to mourn Pope Francis and prepare for the papal conclave. \"President Trump owes an apology to Catholics and all people of good will,\" he said. The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment Sunday morning. But theAssociated Press reportedthat White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has responded to the criticism, saying \"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.\" Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019,said on social mediaSaturday afternoon that \"[a]s a general rule, I'm fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen.\" Last week, whenasked by reporterswho he'd like to see elected pope, Trump said: \"I'd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,\" before adding, \"no, I don't know, I have no preference. I must say we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who's very good\" — an apparent reference to Dolan. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Does a president need to uphold the Constitution? Trump says 'I don't know'",
    "article_text": "Luke Garrett President Donald Trump arrives to give a commencement address at the University of Alabama, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP/APhide caption President Trump — when asked if he thinks he needs to uphold the Constitution on \"Meet the Press with Kristen Welker\" — said, \"I don't know,\" but added that his lawyers \"are obviously going to follow what the Supreme Court said.\" The response came after a series of questions regarding the right to due process for people living in the United States and the Fifth Amendment. During this exchange, Trump said he wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants — who he called \"some of the worst people on Earth.\" \"I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it,\" Trump said. Immigration enforcement was one of the top issues ahead of the 2024 presidential elections. It has been a strong issue for Trump, but recent polls show thatAmericans are disapproving of his handling of immigration. Welker then pressed Trump on whether he, as president, needs to abide by the Constitution and the rights it provides to people in the U.S. \"I don't know,\" Trump said. \"I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.\" During the wide-ranging interview with NBC News, Trump also ruled out running for a third term — which the Constitution prohibits. \"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody.\" Previously, Trump said he was \"not joking\" abouta third termand contended \"there are methods.\" When asked about his successor, Trump complimented both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"JD's doing a fantastic job,\" he said. \"Marco is great… We have a lot of good people in this party.\" On the economy, Trump blamed former-President Joe Biden for the \"bad parts,\" while taking credit for \"good parts\" of the economy. \"Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything,\" Trump said when pressed by Welker. \"But I've only just been here for a little more than three months.\" Trump also celebrated his tariff policies — which have roiled financial markets andincreased the possibility of a recession. He said the tariffs could be permanent. Last week, the Commerce Department reported thatthe U.S. economy shrankby a annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter of the year. \"The fake news was giving me such press on the tariffs,\" Trump said. \"The tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country.\" When asked if the president believes a recession in the short term could benefit the country long term, Trump said the country is in a time of transformation. \"Look, yeah, it's everything's OK,\" he said. \"What we are. I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically.\" The president continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump would like, but the presidentnotably said he has no plans to remove Powell before the end of his term in 2026. Previously,Trump threatened to terminate the chairman— sending shock waves in the markets over worries that the Federal Reserve would lose its independence. Later in the interview, Trump refused to rule out the use of military force on Greenland and said, \"it could happen.\" \"We need Greenland very badly,\" he said. \"Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.\" Trump also said he plans to continue to talk about annexing Canada and making it the 51st state, but he said it's \"highly unlikely\" he'd use military force against Canada. Trump is set to meet with newly elect Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney soon. When asked about worries that he is taking the country down an authoritarian path, Trump rebuffed the suggestion. \"Those people are going to be very happy,\" Trump said of those critics who see the country headed down an authoritarian path. \"They're going to have to see some results.\" Welker then asked Trump whether he believes his critics have the right to speak against him without fear of retribution. \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"Yeah, I do. That I do.\" Trump has frequently railed against his political critics in his social media posts, pulled the security clearances and details for some, and vowed investigations against others.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press FILE - An employee watches an electronic signboard displaying the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at the lounge of Bithumb cryptocurrency exchange in Seoul, South Korea, Nov. 21, 2024.Ahn Young-joon/APhide caption PARIS — French police rescued the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur in a nighttime raid after he was taken hostage for ransom, the latest alleged criminal effort in France to extort people involved in the management of digital assets. The man was kidnapped Thursday morning in Paris, the prosecutor's office said Sunday. \"The victim turned out to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, and the incident was accompanied by a ransom demand,\" its statement said, without giving their names or other specifics about their identities. Police investigators located the hostage in a house in the Essonne region south of Paris, from which he was rescued on Saturday night, the prosecutor's office said. It said he was treated for injuries but gave no details. French media reported that the alleged hostage-takers cut off one of the man's fingers. Police detained 5 people — four were in or close to the house where the man was held captive, while the fifth was at the wheel of a vehicle thought to have been used for the alleged abduction, the prosecutor's office said. It said the police investigation is looking at an array of possible criminal charges, including kidnapping \"with torture or a barbaric act.\" In January, police said a co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, was also kidnapped with his wife from their home in the region of Cher of central France. Police said they made 10 arrests and that the alleged kidnappers demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency from another of Ledger's co-founders. A raid by France's elite National Gendarmerie Intervention Group unit that specializes in hostage situations freed Balland the next day, followed the day after that by the liberation, again by the GIGN, of his wife, found tied up in a vehicle, police said.

    "title": "Ports brace for the impact of tariffs as shipments from China drop drastically",
    "article_text": "Ayesha Rascoe The Trump administration's tariffs are already having an impact on the nation's ports. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks with Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, about the effect. AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:Major ports up and down the West Coast are bracing for the full impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. The number of ships arriving is expected to drop dramatically, and the effect will be especially striking in Southern California. Los Angeles and Long Beach are the country's two busiest ports, processing around a third of all cargo containers arriving from overseas, a huge number of them from China. Joining us now is Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach. Welcome to the program.MARIO CORDERO: Well, thank you for inviting me here, Ayesha.RASCOE: So can you give us a sense of what's happening right now with your port?CORDERO: Well, I think the story of the day for the Port of Long Beach is we're starting to see less vessel arrivals, which means less cargo. And of course, that translates to potentially less jobs and an impact to consumers. In other words, they may not have their products in a couple months unless things change.RASCOE: And so, I mean, how much of a drop are you seeing right now?CORDERO: Well, right now, the first drop that we're seeing actually is going to be here in the month of May. Keep in mind that for the first quarter 2025 - that is, January through March - the Port of Long Beach moved more container cargo than any other port in the country. So we were certainly on a very high-volume movement. April was decent, but now May, we're going to start seeing reduction. For the second half of 2025, we're looking to at least a 20% reduction in volume.RASCOE: And how do you know that? Is it because of, like, contracts, or are these things planned out way in advance?CORDERO: Well, there's two metrics that give you an indication. One, the diminished bookings that are coming out of Asia - there are importers now here in the USA that are not calling for orders from Asia. They're waiting on the sideline to see where this tariff number falls or more clarity because right now, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what that tariff number will be at the end of the day. No. 2, as of right now, our numbers through the month of June indicate that the carriers have had 34 blank sailings. What that basically means, 34 less vessels that are coming into the port complex.RASCOE: And what impact does this have on the wider port economy?CORDERO: Unless things change, you are going to have an impact in terms of job reduction across the supply chain, whether it's dock workers here at the port, truck drivers, people who work in the warehouses and/or on a logistics supply chain. So we already have seen what that is in the COVID-19 crisis, if you recall when, during the COVID years, particularly in the latter part of 2020, 2021, everything came to a stop, so to speak.RASCOE: Those supply chain disruptions during COVID led to higher prices. And then there were also concerns about, like, Christmas presents and stuff like that, whether you would just be able to get basic supplies. Is that something that could happen this time around?CORDERO: There is a potential of that occurring. So let me give you an example. In this industry, when we talk about peak season, that is the time of year where cargo really comes in at higher numbers. Every year, annually, that starts around July, and the reason is because from July to August, you're looking to advance products coming into the country in preparation for the back-to-school spending and the holiday spending. Beginning July - that's going to be critical because if you're a shipper and you're importing holiday type of products or even back-to-school, are you going to be paying 10%, or are you going to be paying 46% of tariffs or, in the case if it's from China, 145%? It's a scenario right now that time's ticking, so to speak, to get clarity and remove uncertainty, and I think that's all the business sectors are asking for at this point.RASCOE: So the Trump administration is saying it wants to do a deal with China. If that happens, do you think that there will be a lasting impact of these tariffs, or if they come out with a deal, will everything kind of just get back to normal?CORDERO: Well, No. 1, we've been living in a tariff environment. If you recall, in the first Trump administration, there was an implementation of tariffs. The Biden administration basically followed that. I think the question now is, the percentiles that we're talking about are sometimes prohibitive, specifically the smaller shipper, the midsized shipper and even the larger beneficial cargo owner. And you start seeing every day you listen to the news, CEOs of major companies are concerned. Some of the bigger players in terms of shipments - they're looking to perhaps a 100 million to a 300 million additional cost on products. And that's concerning because it's going to get passed down to the consumer. So if you get an example of a Nike shoe, so to speak, that shoe that could cost you $125 could now be at least $165.RASCOE: You said the time is ticking. Is there a time by which you think that companies need these tariffs, whatever deal is going to be made, to be made so they have that clarity? Like, is it by July? Is it by June? When does this need to be done?CORDERO: Actually, the month of May is very key because when you start booking shipments of products, you do that two months in anticipation. So if you're looking to getting a product in July, you have to start making this order now. So I think the inflection point here is now in the next 30 days.RASCOE: That's Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach.

Beginning July - that's going to be critical because if you're a shipper and you're importing holiday type of products or even back-to-school, are you going to be paying 10%, or are you going to be paying 46% of tariffs or, in the case if it's from China, 145%? It's a scenario right now that time's ticking, so to speak, to get clarity and remove uncertainty, and I think that's all the business sectors are asking for at this point.RASCOE: So the Trump administration is saying it wants to do a deal with China. If that happens, do you think that there will be a lasting impact of these tariffs, or if they come out with a deal, will everything kind of just get back to normal?CORDERO: Well, No. 1, we've been living in a tariff environment. If you recall, in the first Trump administration, there was an implementation of tariffs. The Biden administration basically followed that. I think the question now is, the percentiles that we're talking about are sometimes prohibitive, specifically the smaller shipper, the midsized shipper and even the larger beneficial cargo owner. And you start seeing every day you listen to the news, CEOs of major companies are concerned. Some of the bigger players in terms of shipments - they're looking to perhaps a 100 million to a 300 million additional cost on products. And that's concerning because it's going to get passed down to the consumer. So if you get an example of a Nike shoe, so to speak, that shoe that could cost you $125 could now be at least $165.RASCOE: You said the time is ticking. Is there a time by which you think that companies need these tariffs, whatever deal is going to be made, to be made so they have that clarity? Like, is it by July? Is it by June? When does this need to be done?CORDERO: Actually, the month of May is very key because when you start booking shipments of products, you do that two months in anticipation. So if you're looking to getting a product in July, you have to start making this order now. So I think the inflection point here is now in the next 30 days.RASCOE: That's Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach. Thank you so much for joining us.CORDERO: My pleasure.Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MARIO CORDERO: Well, thank you for inviting me here, Ayesha.RASCOE: So can you give us a sense of what's happening right now with your port?CORDERO: Well, I think the story of the day for the Port of Long Beach is we're starting to see less vessel arrivals, which means less cargo. And of course, that translates to potentially less jobs and an impact to consumers. In other words, they may not have their products in a couple months unless things change.RASCOE: And so, I mean, how much of a drop are you seeing right now?CORDERO: Well, right now, the first drop that we're seeing actually is going to be here in the month of May. Keep in mind that for the first quarter 2025 - that is, January through March - the Port of Long Beach moved more container cargo than any other port in the country. So we were certainly on a very high-volume movement. April was decent, but now May, we're going to start seeing reduction. For the second half of 2025, we're looking to at least a 20% reduction in volume.RASCOE: And how do you know that? Is it because of, like, contracts, or are these things planned out way in advance?CORDERO: Well, there's two metrics that give you an indication. One, the diminished bookings that are coming out of Asia - there are importers now here in the USA that are not calling for orders from Asia. They're waiting on the sideline to see where this tariff number falls or more clarity because right now, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what that tariff number will be at the end of the day. No. 2, as of right now, our numbers through the month of June indicate that the carriers have had 34 blank sailings. What that basically means, 34 less vessels that are coming into the port complex.RASCOE: And what impact does this have on the wider port economy?CORDERO: Unless things change, you are going to have an impact in terms of job reduction across the supply chain, whether it's dock workers here at the port, truck drivers, people who work in the warehouses and/or on a logistics supply chain. So we already have seen what that is in the COVID-19 crisis, if you recall when, during the COVID years, particularly in the latter part of 2020, 2021, everything came to a stop, so to speak.RASCOE: Those supply chain disruptions during COVID led to higher prices. And then there were also concerns about, like, Christmas presents and stuff like that, whether you would just be able to get basic supplies. Is that something that could happen this time around?CORDERO: There is a potential of that occurring. So let me give you an example.

It's a scenario right now that time's ticking, so to speak, to get clarity and remove uncertainty, and I think that's all the business sectors are asking for at this point.RASCOE: So the Trump administration is saying it wants to do a deal with China. If that happens, do you think that there will be a lasting impact of these tariffs, or if they come out with a deal, will everything kind of just get back to normal?CORDERO: Well, No. 1, we've been living in a tariff environment. If you recall, in the first Trump administration, there was an implementation of tariffs. The Biden administration basically followed that. I think the question now is, the percentiles that we're talking about are sometimes prohibitive, specifically the smaller shipper, the midsized shipper and even the larger beneficial cargo owner. And you start seeing every day you listen to the news, CEOs of major companies are concerned. Some of the bigger players in terms of shipments - they're looking to perhaps a 100 million to a 300 million additional cost on products. And that's concerning because it's going to get passed down to the consumer. So if you get an example of a Nike shoe, so to speak, that shoe that could cost you $125 could now be at least $165.RASCOE: You said the time is ticking. Is there a time by which you think that companies need these tariffs, whatever deal is going to be made, to be made so they have that clarity? Like, is it by July? Is it by June? When does this need to be done?CORDERO: Actually, the month of May is very key because when you start booking shipments of products, you do that two months in anticipation. So if you're looking to getting a product in July, you have to start making this order now. So I think the inflection point here is now in the next 30 days.RASCOE: That's Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach. Thank you so much for joining us.CORDERO: My pleasure.Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. RASCOE: And so, I mean, how much of a drop are you seeing right now?CORDERO: Well, right now, the first drop that we're seeing actually is going to be here in the month of May. Keep in mind that for the first quarter 2025 - that is, January through March - the Port of Long Beach moved more container cargo than any other port in the country. So we were certainly on a very high-volume movement. April was decent, but now May, we're going to start seeing reduction. For the second half of 2025, we're looking to at least a 20% reduction in volume.RASCOE: And how do you know that? Is it because of, like, contracts, or are these things planned out way in advance?CORDERO: Well, there's two metrics that give you an indication. One, the diminished bookings that are coming out of Asia - there are importers now here in the USA that are not calling for orders from Asia. They're waiting on the sideline to see where this tariff number falls or more clarity because right now, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what that tariff number will be at the end of the day. No. 2, as of right now, our numbers through the month of June indicate that the carriers have had 34 blank sailings. What that basically means, 34 less vessels that are coming into the port complex.RASCOE: And what impact does this have on the wider port economy?CORDERO: Unless things change, you are going to have an impact in terms of job reduction across the supply chain, whether it's dock workers here at the port, truck drivers, people who work in the warehouses and/or on a logistics supply chain. So we already have seen what that is in the COVID-19 crisis, if you recall when, during the COVID years, particularly in the latter part of 2020, 2021, everything came to a stop, so to speak.RASCOE: Those supply chain disruptions during COVID led to higher prices. And then there were also concerns about, like, Christmas presents and stuff like that, whether you would just be able to get basic supplies. Is that something that could happen this time around?CORDERO: There is a potential of that occurring. So let me give you an example. In this industry, when we talk about peak season, that is the time of year where cargo really comes in at higher numbers. Every year, annually, that starts around July, and the reason is because from July to August, you're looking to advance products coming into the country in preparation for the back-to-school spending and the holiday spending. Beginning July - that's going to be critical because if you're a shipper and you're importing holiday type of products or even back-to-school, are you going to be paying 10%, or are you going to be paying 46% of tariffs or, in the case if it's from China, 145%?

Every year, annually, that starts around July, and the reason is because from July to August, you're looking to advance products coming into the country in preparation for the back-to-school spending and the holiday spending. Beginning July - that's going to be critical because if you're a shipper and you're importing holiday type of products or even back-to-school, are you going to be paying 10%, or are you going to be paying 46% of tariffs or, in the case if it's from China, 145%? It's a scenario right now that time's ticking, so to speak, to get clarity and remove uncertainty, and I think that's all the business sectors are asking for at this point.RASCOE: So the Trump administration is saying it wants to do a deal with China. If that happens, do you think that there will be a lasting impact of these tariffs, or if they come out with a deal, will everything kind of just get back to normal?CORDERO: Well, No. 1, we've been living in a tariff environment. If you recall, in the first Trump administration, there was an implementation of tariffs. The Biden administration basically followed that. I think the question now is, the percentiles that we're talking about are sometimes prohibitive, specifically the smaller shipper, the midsized shipper and even the larger beneficial cargo owner. And you start seeing every day you listen to the news, CEOs of major companies are concerned. Some of the bigger players in terms of shipments - they're looking to perhaps a 100 million to a 300 million additional cost on products. And that's concerning because it's going to get passed down to the consumer. So if you get an example of a Nike shoe, so to speak, that shoe that could cost you $125 could now be at least $165.RASCOE: You said the time is ticking. Is there a time by which you think that companies need these tariffs, whatever deal is going to be made, to be made so they have that clarity? Like, is it by July? Is it by June? When does this need to be done?CORDERO: Actually, the month of May is very key because when you start booking shipments of products, you do that two months in anticipation. So if you're looking to getting a product in July, you have to start making this order now. So I think the inflection point here is now in the next 30 days.RASCOE: That's Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach. Thank you so much for joining us.CORDERO: My pleasure.Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. CORDERO: Well, there's two metrics that give you an indication. One, the diminished bookings that are coming out of Asia - there are importers now here in the USA that are not calling for orders from Asia. They're waiting on the sideline to see where this tariff number falls or more clarity because right now, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what that tariff number will be at the end of the day. No. 2, as of right now, our numbers through the month of June indicate that the carriers have had 34 blank sailings. What that basically means, 34 less vessels that are coming into the port complex.RASCOE: And what impact does this have on the wider port economy?CORDERO: Unless things change, you are going to have an impact in terms of job reduction across the supply chain, whether it's dock workers here at the port, truck drivers, people who work in the warehouses and/or on a logistics supply chain. So we already have seen what that is in the COVID-19 crisis, if you recall when, during the COVID years, particularly in the latter part of 2020, 2021, everything came to a stop, so to speak.RASCOE: Those supply chain disruptions during COVID led to higher prices. And then there were also concerns about, like, Christmas presents and stuff like that, whether you would just be able to get basic supplies. Is that something that could happen this time around?CORDERO: There is a potential of that occurring. So let me give you an example.

    "title": "Houthi missile strike at Israel airport halts flights ahead of key vote on Gaza war",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Israeli security forces inspect the site where the Israeli military said a projectile fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels landed in the area of Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, on Sunday, May 4, 2025.Ohad Zwigenberg/APhide caption BEN-GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Israel  — A missile launched by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen  on Sunday briefly halted flights and commuter traffic at Israel's main international airport after an impact left a plume of smoke and caused panic among passengers. The Houthi rebels have been striking Israel throughout the war in Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians. The attack on Ben-Gurion International Airport came hours before top Israeli Cabinet ministers were set to vote on whether to intensify the country's military operations in the Gaza strip. The army meanwhile began calling up thousands of reserves in anticipation of a wider operation in Gaza, officials said. The missile launch Sunday set off air raid sirens in multiple parts of Israel. A plume of smoke was visible at the airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media. Passengers were heard yelling and scrambling for cover. It was not immediately clear whether the projectile, which landed in a field near an access road leading to airport parking lots, was the missile or its fragments, or an interceptor from Israel's air defense systems. It left a deep crater in the ground and a nearby road was littered with dirt. Police said that air, road and rail traffic were halted following the attack. The traffic resumed after about an hour, Israel Airports Authority said. Israel's paramedic service Magen David Adom said four people were lightly wounded. Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a video statement that the group fired a hypersonic ballistic missile at the airport. Houthi rebels have been firing at Israel since the war with Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, and the missiles have mostly been intercepted, although some have penetrated Israel's missile defense systems, causing damage. Israel has struck back against the rebels in Yemen and the U.S., Israel's top ally, also launched a campaign of strikes in March against them. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed retribution for the airport attack: \"Whoever harms us, we will harm them sevenfold.\" An Israeli official said the influential security Cabinet would meet on Sunday evening to vote on plans to expand the fighting. A military official said the country was calling up thousands of reserves. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a \"powerful\" expansion of the war, but did not disclose details as to what the new plans would entail. \"We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,\" he said. He demanded that Israel bomb \"the food and electricity supplies\" in Gaza. Palestinians look at a house targeted by an Israeli army strike in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Saturday, May 3, 2025.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption The plans to escalate fighting in Gaza more than 18 months after the war there erupted come as a humanitarian crisis in the territory deepens. As part of its efforts to pressure the militant group Hamas to negotiate on Israel's terms for a new ceasefire, Israel in early March halted the entry of goods into Gaza. That has plunged the territory of 2.3 million people into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began. An eight-week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought a lull in fighting and freed Israeli hostages collapsed in March. Israel resumed its strikes on Gaza on March 18 and has captured swaths of the coastal enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed, according to local health officials. At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, ages 2 and 4, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in southern and central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said. Asked about the strikes, the Israeli military had no direct comment. The Israeli military said Sunday that two soldiers were killed in combat in Gaza, bringing the number of soldiers killed since fighting resumed in March to six. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. Israel says 59 remain in Gaza, although roughly 35 are said to be dead. Israel's offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count. The fighting has displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and the shortage of food has set off looting. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "How this teen fled Russian occupation and became a hero in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "By Eleanor Beardsley , Kateryna Malofieieva Ivan Sarancha, 18, who left Luhansk after 11 years of living under occupation, stands in front of a memorial for the fallen at Maidan Square — where the pro-Europe uprising known as the \"Revolution of Dignity\" took place in February 2014 — in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 26.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption KYIV, Ukraine — Ivan Sarancha was 7 when Ukrainian literature and history classes disappeared from his school. That was in 2014 after Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and began to foment separatist unrest in his eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. Sarancha says he was too young to realize what was going on back then. But his eyes were fully opened with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later. By then Sarancha was 15. He says he was deeply shocked by Russia's destruction of the port city ofMariupoland its massacre of civilians in the Kyiv suburb ofBucha. \"I began to develop critical thinking,\" says Sarancha. \"I watched the Russian news and compared it with Ukrainian and American news that I could see using a VPN [an online virtual private network]. And I figured out what was true and what was false. It was just common sense.\" That's when Sarancha also began to think about running away from occupied territory to free Ukraine. The story of this shy 18-year-old's escape from enemy territory to what he calls \"the country and culture of his birth\" has turned him into a media star and is inspiring a war-weary nation. It's also giving Ukrainians a rare glimpse at life in a region that has long been cut off, as well as a small dose of hope. Ivan Sarancha sits in his room in a dormitory, where other Ukrainians displaced by the war are staying, set up by the charity Save Ukraine, in Gatne, Kyiv region.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption The tall, long-haired youth smiles and offers a soft \"hullo\" — the extent of his English — when he meets NPR in Kyiv. Sarancha gives the interview in Ukrainian. He says he now feels uncomfortable speaking Russian — spoken in his hometown of Luhansk— preferring instead to speak Ukrainian \"as a matter of principle.\" He's standing in front of the apartment building where he is staying with other Ukrainians who have fled towns along the front line. He says he took big risks to leave a largely peaceful home with his parents. Much of his short life has been under the shadow of Putin's war on Ukraine. His region of Luhansk, and neighboring Donetsk, became gray zones when Kremlin-backed separatists declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 and held referendums to proclaim the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics. At the time, Sarancha says he was too young to realize that provoking chaos and instability in Ukraine was Putin's revenge for the pro-European uprising in Kyiv's Maidan Square months earlier known as \"the Revolution of Dignity.\" A memorial for the fallen in Maidan Square, in Kyiv, where a pro-Europe uprising known as the \"Revolution of Dignity\" took place in 2014, which led to the Kremlin's interference in Ukraine.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Sarancha says an atmosphere of fear pervades everything in his hometown of Luhansk, the capital of the region of the same name. \"There is basically no political or public activity because any opinion for or against anything could get you in trouble,\" he says. Sarancha says people are most afraid of being taken to a place known as \"the basement\" for interrogation. He says his hometown changed dramatically after the full-scale invasion. \"Many Russians started moving to Luhansk, and for the first time we had traffic jams,\" Sarancha says. \"On my way to school one day, I counted more than a hundred Russian flags along the main street. It really shocked me. There were even flags with Putin's face on them.\" He says most young people his age support Ukraine over Russia — but would never openly talk about it. He says locals don't dare protest. Though sometimes people will give Russians wrong directions as an act of personal defiance. After the war started, Sarancha joined pro-Ukraine groups online. And he began to speak Ukrainian — though only with his internet friends. It had become too dangerous to speak Ukrainian in public. \"They would have beaten me and taken me to the basement, first by the police and then by the [Russian] Federal Security Service,\" he says. He had to hide his views from his parents, who support Putin. He says they believed Russian propaganda. For example, they believe the falsehood that Ukraine staged the massacres in Bucha and made fake videos to sway global opinion, he says, even though it's well documented that Russian forces carried out the killings. As he began to entertain the idea of escaping, Sarancha for the first time noticed flyers on a wall that said, \"We help people leave for Ukraine from Luhansk and Donetsk.\" \"They were like ordinary advertisements and I saw some of the numbers were torn off so I realized there are maybe a lot of people who want to leave, and I never realized that before,\" he says. Like a Ukrainian underground railroad, there is a whole network of organizations helping people flee from Russian occupied territory. Kate works for one of them, called \"Helping to Leave.\" She is Russian but says she can't give her last name because it's dangerous work. The Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories are now separated from Ukraine by the front line. To get to Ukraine, you have to pass through Russia or a third country such as Belarus. That means going through an extensive interrogation and search process on the Russian border known as \"filtration.\" \"It's definitely frightening,\" says Kate. \"People check your phones, your belongings and often look for a reason to detain you. It's a very dangerous process and not everyone is allowed to leave.\" Kate says it's becoming more and more difficult to get out of Russian-occupied Ukraine. In 2023 thousands of people escaped. Last year only a few hundred made it out. Ivan Sarancha shows Ukraine's coat of arms on a chain in the dormitory for displaced Ukrainians where he's staying. He says for a long time he wanted to buy this type of necklace, which he says could not be worn in occupied Luhansk.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Sarancha began watching videos of how other people had made it through filtration to prepare mentally. He realized his phone was full of pro-Ukrainian information. So he bought a new one and filled it with pro-Russian pictures and messages. He got a job and began saving money. He told his parents he would be 18 soon and wanted to go somewhere to celebrate — his first solo trip. His parents would not allow him to travel to Moscow, or Georgia, where there had been protests, but finally agreed he could spend a few days in Rostov-on-Don, a Russian city 100 miles south of Luhansk. What they didn't know was that from there, Sarancha planned to travel on to Moscow and Belarus, where there is a humanitarian corridor allowing entry into Ukraine. Sarancha says his plans were further complicated by his short time window. \"If you're not 18 you can't cross the border into Belarus without a certificate from your parents,\" he says. But to leave Luhansk without any problems he needed to be 17 — and below Russian military draft age. On a cold dark January morning, the day before Sarancha's 18th birthday, his father took him to the bus station. \"I was sitting there thinking, what am I doing?\" he remembers. \"I thought, where will I be in a week — Luhansk? Russia? Ukraine? I was so worried. But I pulled myself together and decided to go all the way.\" When he arrived in Rostov-on-Don he checked into a hotel for the day. His guide, who he communicated with over his phone, advised doing so because his mother had asked to see pictures of his room. Sarancha took pictures of himself in the room and in different changes of clothing at popular spots around the city. He sent them to his parents so they wouldn't suspect anything. That evening he boarded a bus for the 600-mile, overnight trip to Moscow. He says he was nervous, as it was full of Russian soldiers. The next day when Sarancha arrived in Moscow, it was his birthday. His parents called him, believing he was still in Rostov-on-Don. \"My parents are the kind of people who like to drink often,\" Sarancha says. \"So they had already begun celebrating my birthday. And that was to my advantage. I told them, go ahead and celebrate and don't worry about me since you're having fun.\" Meanwhile, he took a train on to Minsk, the Belarusian capital. He'd brought food along but couldn't eat a thing he was so anxious. He says his biggest fear was that his own parents would find out the truth and alert the authorities. Once in Minsk, he headed straight for the Ukrainian Embassy. \"And that's when I saw the flag of Ukraine for the first time,\" Sarancha says. \"It was so big, so beautiful. I had tears in my eyes. I had not seen that flag since the first grade.\" Ivan Sarancha receives his Ukrainian national ID card in the Kyiv region.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption At first officials at the embassy thought Sarancha was Russian and told him to go away. But he insisted, showing them the only Ukrainian document he had: his birth certificate. After a meeting with the ambassador himself, the embassy issued Sarancha a temporary Ukrainian passport. The last stop on his risky trip was the Belarusian border with Ukraine, where he went through filtration. \"They told me, 'Unlock your phone and hand it over,' \" Sarancha recalls. One guard scrolled through it, scrutinizing his pictures and messages. Another stood behind him. They questioned him and searched his bag. Sarancha says the tension was unbearable. But he was somehow able to remain calm and they finally opened the barrier and let him through. He walked the few hundred feet to the Ukrainian border and freedom. Sarancha says he likes everything about Ukraine. \"Everyone is united for the sake of one goal,\" he says. He says at first his parents didn't believe he was in Ukraine. His mother was hysterical. He says he wants his parents to recognize the truth about the war and has threatened to block them on his phone until they do. He also misses them terribly. Sarancha wants to become a sculptor and hopes to enter the Kyiv Art Academy next fall. But for now he admits he doesn't mind the media attention. Ukrainian TV reporter Karina Kyrychenko who has come to interview him says Sarancha's bravery is an inspiration for the entire country. \"His story is necessary for all Ukrainians right now because everyone is tired and his story has a lot motivation,\" she says. Kyrychenko says Sarancha is proof that Russia's indoctrination of a generation of youth in the occupied territories may not be working after all. There are Ukrainians there waiting to be liberated. Ivan holds the Ukrainian flag after receiving his Ukrainian national ID card, in the Kyiv region.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption NPR's Polina Lytvynova and Hanna Palamarenko contributed to this story.

    "title": "Brazilian police say they prevented a bomb attack at the free Lady Gaga concert",
    "article_text": "Andrew Limbong Lady Gaga performs during a massive free show at Copacabana Beach on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Buda Mendes/Getty Imageshide caption Brazilian police say they prevented a planned bomb attack targeting the freeLady Gaga concertin Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. According to astatement from police, a group was attempting to attack \"children, adolescents, and the LGBTQIA+ community.\" Two people allegedly involved were arrested in raids across different states, police said. The free concert took place onSaturday night on Copacabana Beach.More than 2 million people attended, making it the largest show of Lady Gaga's career. The anticipation leading up to the gig was immense, with fans coming to thebeach days earlierto watch the stage go up and possibly catch a glimpse of the pop star. According to Brazilian police, the attack's alleged organizers were recruiting participants online — including teenagers — to carry out the bombing using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails. The overarching plan, police say, was to frame the attack as a \"collective challenge\" and gain notoriety on social media. Police said one person arrested was the alleged leader of the group, and the other was a teenager arrested for storing child pornography. Police said 15 search and seizure warrants were served against nine \"targets\" in multiple cities and that authorities gathered \"electronic devices and other materials.\" A representative for Lady Gaga did not immediately return NPR's request for comment, but toldThe Associated Pressthat the pop star's team learned about the alleged threat via media reports on Sunday morning. \"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.\" In an Instagram post following the concert, the artist said the show was a \"historical moment.\" \"Thank you Rio for waiting for me to come back. Thank you little monsters all over the world,\" she said, referring to her fanbase. \"I love you. I will never forget this moment,\" she wrote.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attends her morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, April 2, 2025.Marco Ugarte/APhide caption MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it. Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico. \"He said, 'How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.' And you know what I said to him? 'No, President Trump.'\" She added: \"Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.\" White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said in a statement later Saturday that Trump has worked closely with Mexico's president \"to achieve the most secure southwest border in history.\" \"Dangerous Foreign Terrorist Organizations, however, continue to threaten our shared security and the drugs and crime they spread threaten American communities across the country,\" the statement said. \"The President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries.\" The U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump's order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants. The U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels. Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them. But Sheinbaum's hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade. \"We can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,\" Sheinbaum said.

    "title": "The Vatican installs chimney to signal the selection of the next pope",
    "article_text": "Clare Marie Schneider Workers have completed the installation of the chimney on top of the Vatican building in Rome, Italy. The color of the chimney smoke will give hints to the public about how the papal selection process is going.Vatican Mediahide caption Workers attached a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel on Friday, ahead of the election process for the next pope. The chimney, which is attached to the chapel before a new pope is elected, will signal to the public the election of Pope Francis' successor. With thedeath of Pope Francislast month, cardinals, senior members of the Catholic Church, will gather on Wednesday, May 7, for what's known as a \"conclave\" to determine the next pope and head of the some 1.4 billion Catholics around the world. There are currently 135 cardinal electors, and to join the conclave, cardinalsmust be under 80 years old. Throughout this secretive, locked-door affair, the recently installed chimney will be the only indication to the public about how the process is going. After a ceremony within the Sistine Chapel is held to mark the beginning of the conclave, the doors are locked, Bry Jensen, host of the long-running Pontifacts podcast,told NPR. That's when \"the verbal and communicative gates go down,\" Jensen said. \"There is no further communication until a pope has been elected, aside from smoke.\" As the cardinals deliberate, they vote until they reach a two-thirds majority agreement on who to elect. With each vote, they burn their ballots in a stove installed in the Sistine Chapel for this purpose. If black smoke plumes from the chimney, the cardinals aren't in agreement and will need to vote again. Once white smoke can be seen from the chimney, it signals to the public that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader. The process relies on chemicals to produce the desired color. Throughout the election process, the chimney may fill the sky above the Sistine Chapel with black smoke multiple times. Kurt Martens, ordinary professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America, told NPR that an initial round of voting occurs on the first evening the conclave commences. Typically though, he said, the first round is merely an indication of the cardinals' priorities. The following day, the conclave starts holding two rounds of voting each morning, and another two in the afternoon, until they reach consensus. Regarding how long conclaves usually last,  Jensen said that all of the conclaves from the 1900s onward have ended in under four days. Francis was elected pope at the end of the conclave's second day in 2013. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Review: Thunderbolts* is a refreshing return to peak Marvel form",
    "article_text": "That weird asterisk in the title makes sense once the credits roll, but we're not gonna spoil it for you. It looks like Marvel has another critical and box office hit on its hands—and deservedly so—withThunderbolts*,a follow-up of sorts to 2021'sBlack Widowand the final film in the MCU's Phase Five. Yes, the asterisk is part of the title. Yes, I found that choice inexplicable when it was first announced.  And yes, having seen the film, the asterisk makes perfect sense now as a well-timed joke. I won't spill the beans because that would spoil the fun. Instead, I'll simply say thatThunderbolts*is a refreshing return to peak Marvel form: well-paced, witty, and action-packed with enough heart to ensure you care about the characters. (Some spoilers below.) It's basically the MCU's version ofThe Suicide Squad(2021) with less over-the-top R-rated violence.  In fact, that film's director, James Gunn, was originally attached to directThunderbolts*but bowed out because he felt the projects were just too similar. Yet the PG-13 film definitely boasts that irreverent Gunn sensibility, with a vibe on par with the director's delightfulGuardians of the Galaxy(2014).Thunderbolts*might not reach the spectacular box office heights of last year's R-ratedDeadpool and Wolverine, but so far I'm optimistic about the MCU's future. Black Widowintroduced us to Natasha Romanoff's (Scarlett Johansson) backstory as a child recruited for training as an elite assassin, along with her adoptive sister (and equally lethal assassin) Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh).Thunderbolts*finds Yelena working as hired mercenary for CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), but she's still grieving the loss of Natasha and her heart just isn't in. Yelena's existential ennui leads her to seek out her adoptive father, Alexei/Red Guardian (David Harbour), the Russian super soldier counterpart to Captain America. He's not doing much better, working as a limo driver and living off takeout, and tells Yelena that Natasha found the secret to fulfillment: be a superhero. (WARNING: A couple of significant character spoilers below the galleries.) That's a bridge too far for the cynical Yelena but she does inform Valentina that she's retiring. Valentina asks her to do one last covert mission to take out an enemy operative at a warehouse and destroy the contents. But when Yelena arrives, she's immediately attacked by super soldier John Walker (Wyatt Russell): briefly Captain America (cf:The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) but now going by U.S. Agent and also working for Valentina. Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko)—introduced inBlack Widow—and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), aka Ava Starr—introduced inAnt-Man and the Wasp(2018)—soon join the fight. They also find an awkward, nebbishy man in hospital PJs named Bob (Lewis Pullman) who can't remember anything about how he ended up there—just a vague sense that something pretty bad happened. It soon becomes clear Valentina has set a trap, hoping they will all kill each other and be destroyed along with a ton of incriminating evidence. The stakes are high for Valentina, who is facing impeachment by Congress for her misdeeds. But the unexpected happens. Apart from one fatality—RIP Taskmaster, who deserved a better end—Yelena, Wyatt, and Ghost decide to work together to escape, with an unexpected assist from Bob, who turns out to have superpowers of his own. Red Guardian shows up at a tight moment to give them a ride in his not-so-bullet-proof  limo. Add Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan)—now a member of Congress representing Brooklyn—and you've got a team that just might be able to take down Valentina. Maybe. They took their name from Yelena's childhood sports team who never won a single game. So maybe not People will no doubt have their quibbles, but there's not much to criticize inThunderbolts*; it's top-notch pure entertainment. I confess to often finding the extended action sequences in many Marvel movies (particularly the more recent ones) exhausting and repetitive, and only loosely tied to what is more often than not a muddled, incoherent plot (I'm looking at you,The Marvels). That's not the case withThunderbolts*;the 126-minute run time flew by. It's well-plotted with a witty, clever script that doesn't take itself too seriously. Director Jake Schreier (Robot & Frank,Beef) expertly balances the action sequences with well-placed bantering wisecracks and quieter introspective moments that serve to actually develop the characters, each of whom has their inner demons and plenty of red in their respective ledgers. And Schreier has an incredibly talented cast to work with, all of whom give stellar performances—including Lewis Pullman as Bob, a newcomer to the MCU. This is very much an ensemble cast, but Pugh's Yelena is the film''s anchor and emotional core. She and Bob share an early bonding moment over their respective inner voids, and thesubtext rapidly becomes textwhen Bob morphs into the Void—the invincible dark side of Valentina's Sentry, intended to be a superhero to replace the Avengers. Instead, he casts darkness over New York City, turning residents into literal shadows. That's an over-arching theme of the film: confronting the source(s) of one's inner darkness and depression, in hopes of finding a kind of reluctant redemption. (\"It was always a parable for mental health,\" Schreierrecently told Variety.) Thunderbolts*is now playing in theaters. We won't spoil the amusingpost-credits sceneeither, except to say it garnered loud audience cheers and nicely tees upThe Fantastic Four: First Stepscoming to theaters this July.

    "title": "Chips aren’t improving like they used to, and it’s killing game console price cuts",
    "article_text": "Op-ed: Slowed manufacturing advancements are upending the way tech progresses. For many, many years, I wouldn't get a new game console until a couple years after it launched. This was partly because I wanted any new console I bought to have a decent-sized library of things to play, and partly because it sometimes paid to sit back and see which console was going to \"win\" the generation in terms of first-party exclusives and third-party developer support. But mostly it was because, from the Atari VCS in the 70s all the way up through the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation in the 2010s, you could always count on game consoles getting cheaper as time went on. Those price reductions would often also come with internal tweaks and external redesigns—smaller or slimmer or otherwise improved versions of the console that made them superior to the originals (though you would occasionally lose a lesser-used feature or two along the way). But both of those things have mostly stopped. The last permanent price drop for a major home or portable console we could find came back in 2016, when the PS4 Slim launched and dropped the price of entry from $349 to $299 (this doesn't count the launch of new editions of consoles with reduced feature sets, like the New Nintendo 2DS in 2017 or$249 all-digital Xbox Onein 2019). This generation, we've seen something that would have been unheard of a few years ago: priceincreasesfor consoles, including$50 extra for the new OLED editionof the Nintendo Switch in 2021, a$50 price hikefor the slimmer disc-drive-less version of the PlayStation 5 in 2023, and$80 to $100 price hikesfor the exact same unimproved versions of the Xbox Series S and X earlier this week. These price increases have multiple intertwining causes, some direct and some less so: inflation, pandemic-era supply crunches, the unpredictable trade policies of the Trump administration, and a gradual shift among console makers away from selling hardware at a loss or breaking even in the hopes that game sales will subsidize the hardware. And you never want to rule out good old shareholder-prioritizing corporate greed. But one major factor, both in the price increases and in the reduction in drastic “slim”-style redesigns, is technical: the death of Moore’s Law and a noticeable slowdown in the rate at which processors and graphics chips can improve. Don’t let the name throw you: It’s not really a law! Moore’s Law is something in between “a goal” and “an observation,” coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965: that the number of transistors in a given chip would double roughly every year (later revised in 1975 to every two years). Moore's Law held true over the next four decades thanks in part to dramatic improvements in the manufacturing processes used to make silicon chips. Chip fabricators like Intel and AMD and Samsung and TSMC—and many others that have come and gone—kept developing more and more advanced ways to cram more transistors into the same amount of physical space, making that continued doubling of transistor counts over time feasible. Not everyone will declare in so many words that Moore’s Law is “dead,” and any given tech exec’s opinion on that says just as much about that exec’s motivations as anything else (Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who can sell GPUs for more money if Moore’s Law is “dead,”will tell you it’s dead; Intel execs who are trying to convince you that Intel is on the road to being competitive manufacturer of high-end chips willcontest that). But the fact remains that progress in new manufacturing technologieshas slowed, and developing new ones has gotten dramatically more time-consuming andexpensive. And unless people find a way to make transistors sub-atomic, we'll hit the boundaries of actual laws sooner or later: the laws of physics. How does this relate to game consoles? We're getting to that. A side effect of fitting more transistors into a given area is that power usage also goes down, because you need to use less electrical current to switch those transistors on and off. Taking any given silicon chip and making it on a newer, more efficient manufacturing process is commonly called a \"die shrink,\" because you're making a functionally equivalent silicon die that uses less physical space. For computer processors and GPUs, those power savings are usually “spent” by adding transistors, either to improve performance or add new capabilities—that's why a processor from 2020 can perform dramatically better than one from 2010 and consume about the same amount of power. But game consoles are meant to be static, stable targets for game developers to aim at, so that their internal testing of a game and how it runs is always indicative of how the game will run on everyone’s consoles. So when you shrink the chips in a console, the benefit comes almost exclusively in the form of smaller physical chips that draw less power and put out less heat. You're also potentially getting more chips out of a single wafer of silicon, which theoretically can lower the price per chip (if the manufacturing process itself doesn't cost a ton more money). Game consoles have benefited massively from those die shrinks, and those benefits were passed down to buyers in the form of streamlined hardware and lower costs. These changes are particularly pronounced once you get to the 3D home console era in the late 90s and early 2000s, when dramatic redesigns like the original PlayStation and PS2 Slim were possible within just a few years of the original console's launch. Consider the PlayStation 2. Not all of the PS2 Slim's streamlining came from chip improvements—it also shed a full-sized 3.5-inch hard drive bay and a little-used IEEE 1394 port, and initially required an external power brick. But shrinking and consolidating the console's CPU, GPU, memory, and other components took the console from its original design in 2000, to the Slim in 2004, to an even lighter and lower-power version of the Slim that returned to using an internal power supply without increasing the size of the console at all. Over that same span, the console's price dropped frequently and significantly, from $299 at launch to just $129 by 2006 (the price was lowered again to $99 in 2009, deep into the PS3 era). Or look at Microsoft's Xbox 360. Its external design didn't change as much over the years—the mid-generation \"slim\" refresh was actually only a little smaller than the original. But between late 2005 and early 2010, the CPU, GPU, and the GPU's high-speed eDRAM memory chip went from being built on a 90 nm process, to 80 nm, to 65 nm, and finally to a single 45 nm chip that combined the CPU and GPU into one. Over that time, the system's power supply fell from 203 W to 133 W, and the base price fell from $300 to $200. The mid-generation 65nm refresh also substantially fixed the early consoles' endemic \"red ring of death\" issue, which was caused in part by the heat that the older, larger chips generated. As you can see when comparing these various consoles' external and internal design revisions, shrinking the chips had a cascade of other beneficial and cost-lowering effects: smaller power supplies, smaller enclosures that use less metal and plastic, smaller heatsinks and cooling assemblies, and smaller and less complicated motherboard designs. A slowdown of that progression was already evident when we hit the PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch generation, but technological improvements and pricing reductions still followed familiar patterns. Both the mid-generation PS4 Slim and Xbox One S used a 16 nm processor instead of the original consoles' 28 nm version, and each also had its price cut by $100 over its lifetime (comparing the Kinect-less Xbox One variant, and excluding the digital-only $249 Xbox One). The Switch's single die shrink, from 20nm to 16nm, didn't come with a price cut, but it did improve battery life and help to enable the cheaper Switch Lite variant. Sony and Microsoft have marginally tweaked the hardware inside the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles since launching them, but as die shrinks have become rarer and more expensive to pull off, the benefits have become a whole lot less noticeable. Until recently, you could at least tell yourself that keeping the prices of these consoles stable during a 40-year inflation high could count as a \"price cut\" of sorts, but now that costs are going up, even that cold comfort is no longer available. It's the same story we've seen in new PC CPUs and GPUs in recent years, too. In the mid-2010s, a new Nvidia GPU generation meantthe same or better performance at lower pricesthan previous-generation cards; this decade, you mostly need to either pay more to get more, or you have tosettle for minor improvements at similar prices. AMD has had to keep its nearly decade-old AM4 motherboard and CPU platformin circulation for yearsafter technically \"replacing\" it, because socket AM5 boards and chips still aren't quite cheap enough to address the budget-to-midrange PC market. We could still see prices come down gradually for all this tech in the coming years if trade deals are struck and cutting-edge manufacturing processes get cheaper. I'm not holding my breath! But the possibility still exists. Either way, though, it's clear that we can no longer assume by default that the patterns and precedents of the last 40 years will hold up. Last week, I put in a pre-order fora Nintendo Switch 2. It's the first brand-new game console I've ever bought on the first day it was available. I figure the technology won't get much better and the price won't get any lower in the next couple years, and it might even goup. There used to be lots of benefits to waiting for this kind of thing—not anymore. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "A DOGE recruiter is staffing a project to deploy AI agents across the US government",
    "article_text": "A startup founder said that AI agents could do the work of tens of thousands of government employees. A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk’s so-calledDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has a new, related gig—and he’s hiring.Anthony Jancso, cofounder of AcclerateX, a government tech startup, is looking for technologists to work on a project that aims to have artificial intelligence perform tasks that are currently the responsibility of tens of thousands of federal workers. Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he’s hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. Agents are programs that can perform work autonomously. We’ve identified over 300 roles with almost full-process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. Workers for the project, he wrote, would be based on site in Washington, DC, and would not require a security clearance; it isn’t clear for whom they would work. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment. The post was not well received. Eight people reacted with clown face emojis, three reacted with a custom emoji of a man licking a boot, two reacted with custom emoji of Joaquin Phoenix giving a thumbs down in the movieGladiator, and three reacted with a custom emoji with the word “Fascist.” Three responded with a heart emoji. “DOGE does not seem interested in finding ‘higher impact work’ for federal employees,” one person said in a comment that received 11 heart reactions. “You’re complicit in firing 70k federal employees and replacing them with shitty autocorrect.” “Tbf we’re all going to be replaced with shitty autocorrect (written by chatgpt),” another person commented, which received one “+1” reaction. “How ‘DOGE orthogonal’ is it? Like, does it still require Kremlin oversight?” another person said in a comment that received five reactions with a fire emoji. “Or do they just use your credentials to log in later?” AccelerateX was originally calledAccelerateSF, which VentureBeatreportedin 2023 had received support from OpenAI and Anthropic. In its earliest incarnation, AccelerateSF hosted a hackathon for AI developers aimed at using the technology to solve San Francisco’s social problems. According to a 2023Mission Local story, for instance, Jancso proposed that using large language models to help businesses fill out permit forms to streamline the construction paperwork process might help drive down housing prices. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghiglieri tells WIRED that the company \"never invested in AccelerateX/SF,” but did sponsor a hackathon AccelerateSF hosted in 2023 by providing free access to its API usage at a time when its Claude API “was still in beta.”) In 2024, the mission pivoted, with the venture becoming known asAccelerateX. In a post on X announcing the change, the company posted, “Outdated tech is dragging down the US Government. Legacy vendors sell broken systems at increasingly steep prices. This hurts every American citizen.” AccelerateX did not respond to a request for comment. According to sources with direct knowledge, Jancso disclosed that AccelerateX had signed a partnership agreement with Palantir in 2024. According to the LinkedIn of someone described as one of AccelerateX’s cofounders,Rachel Yee, the company looks to have received funding from OpenAI’s Converge 2 Accelerator. Another of AccelerateSF’s cofounders, Kay Sorin, now works for OpenAI, having joined the company several months after that hackathon. Sorin and Yee did not respond to requests for comment. Jancso’s cofounder, Jordan Wick, a former Waymo engineer, has been an active member of DOGE, appearing at several agencies over the past few months, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Education. In 2023, Jancso attended a hackathonhosted by ScaleAI; WIRED found that another DOGE member, Ethan Shaotran, also attended the same hackathon. Since its creation in the first days of the second Trump administration, DOGE has pushed the use of AI across agencies, even as it has sought to cut tens of thousands of federal jobs. At theDepartment of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE associate suggested using AI to write code for the agency’s website; at the General Services Administration, DOGE has rolled out theGSAi chatbot; the group has sought to automate the process of firing government employees with a tool calledAutoRIF; anda DOGE operative at the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentis using AI tools to examine and propose changes to regulations. But experts say that deploying AI agents to do the work of 70,000 people would be tricky if not impossible. A federal employee with knowledge of government contracting, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, says, “A lot of agencies have procedures that can differ widely based on their own rules and regulations, and so deploying AI agents across agencies at scale would likely be very difficult.” Oren Etzioni, cofounder of the AI startup Vercept, says that while AI agents can be good at doing some things—like using an internet browser to conduct research—their outputs can still vary widely and be highly unreliable. For instance, customer service AI agents haveinvented nonexistent policieswhen trying to address user concerns. Even research, he says, requires a human to actually make sure what the AI is spitting out is correct. “We want our government to be something that we can rely on, as opposed to something that is on the absolute bleeding edge,” says Etzioni. “We don't need it to be bureaucratic and slow, but if corporations haven't adopted this yet, is the government really where we want to be experimenting with the cutting edge AI?” Etzioni says that AI agents are also not great 1-1 fits for job replacements. Rather, AI is able to do certain tasks or make others more efficient, but the idea that the technology could do the jobs of 70,000 employees would not be possible. “Unless you're using funny math,” he says, “no way.” Jancso,first identified by WIRED in February, was one of the earliest recruiters for DOGE in the months before Donald Trump was inaugurated. In December, Jancso, who sources told WIRED said he had been recruited by Steve Davis, president of the Musk-founded Boring Company and a current member of DOGE, used the Palantir alumni group to recruit DOGE members. On December 2nd, 2024, he wrote, “I’m helping Elon’s team find tech talent for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the new admin. This is a historic opportunity to build an efficient government, and to cut the federal budget by 1/3. If you’re interested in playing a role in this mission, please reach out in the next few days.” According to one source at SpaceX, who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the press, Jancso appeared to be one of the DOGE members who worked out of the company’s DC office in the days before inaugurationalong with several other peoplewho would constitute some of DOGE’s earliest members. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Palantir was cofounded by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and longtime Trump supporter with close ties to Musk. Palantir, which provides data analytics tools to several government agencies including the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, has received billions of dollars in government contracts. During the second Trump administration, the company has been involved in helping to build a“mega API”to connect data from the Internal Revenue Service to other government agencies, and isworking with Immigration and Customs Enforcementto create a massive surveillance platform to identify immigrants to target for deportation.

    "title": "Thunderbolts Assembles a Mighty Start At the Box Office",
    "article_text": "May is here, and so is thesummer movie season, starting withÂThunderbolts. Marvel’s newest movie isn’t just a hit with audiences and critics, it’s also taking off financially. Domestically, the film has opened to $76 million at time of writing, per theHollywood Reporter. That’s slightly pastexpectationspegging it in the $70-75 million range, and puts it over the 3-day openings forÂShang-ChiÂ($75.4 million) andEternalsÂ($71.3 million), and a bit behindÂBlack Widow’sÂ($80 million). Its international take was $86.1 million, resulting in a total of $162.1 million globally. Marvel’s been marketingÂThunderboltsÂlike mad over the last few months with trailers, ads, and cereal box stand-ins promising adysfunctional team-upbetween fairly recent and somewhat older MCU antiheroes. That, combined with the mystery over the asterisk’s place in the title andthe team’s placeinÂAvengers: Doomsday,Âdid a lot to court audience interest. It also doesn’t hurt that Marvel was openly proud of this one; there were pre-release IMAX screenings andassurancesthat this was going to bea Real Movieand not something disposable. With Marvel in play,ÂSinnersÂfell to second place in the domestic box office. This weekend, it made $33 million, down 28% from the previous weekend. Its total is now $179.7 million domestically and $236.7 million globally. That number will likely grow when itcomes back to IMAXfor a few days beginning Thursday, May 15, and analysts think it’ll end its theatrical run in the$330-400 millionglobal range.ÂMinecraft,ÂWarner Bros.’ other spring hit, is now at$873.4 millionthanks to Japan’s Golden Week, and it might end up at $1 billion if that hold stays strong. Speaking of staying strong,ÂUntil Dawn’sÂmanaged to hold out since its late April release. Domestically, it made$3.8 millionâa 52.5% drop from last weekend, but its international take was $6.4 million, a somewhat better decline of 36.6%. It’s now made$34.8 milliontotal and could have a solid run when all’s said and done.

    "title": "Dating App ‘Raw’ Accidentally Rawdogs Users’ Location Data, Personal Info",
    "article_text": "A dating app that, just this week, announced a creepy new wearable, has been found to have publicly exposed users’ data. The data was granular and personal, including their approximate locations. The app, Raw, says it isdedicated to promoting“real and unfiltered love” through its unique user interface, which resemblesBeReal(it utilizes the front and back cameras of your phone), but for dating. Raw also recently announceda bizarre new piece of hardware, called theRaw ring, which purports to allow users to track the location of their lovers to ensure they’re not cheating (there’s no way that could ever lead to problematic scenarios, right?). Unfortunately, it would appear that Raw has also been promoting something else in quite an “unfiltered” fashion: users’ data. TechCrunchreports thatdue to a lack of basic digital security protections, Raw was accidentally leaving users’ personal information open to public inspection. Indeed, prior to this week, anyone with a web browser would have been able to access detailed app user information, including their date of birth, display names, sexual preferences, and quite specific “street-level” location data. TechCrunch says it discovered the security deficiencies during a brief test of the company’s app. Raw was downloaded onto a virtualized Android device, and then TC staffers used a network monitoring tool to observe the data being transmitted to and from the app. The analysis showed that the personal data was not being protected with any sort of authentication barrier. TC says it discovered the problem within the first “few minutes” of using the app. TC also notes that, while Raw claims to protect users with end-to-end encryption, it found no evidence that E2EE was present. They break down the security loophole like so: When we first loaded the app, we found that it was pulling the userâs profile information directly from the companyâs servers, but that the server was not protecting the returned data with any authentication. In practice, that meant anyone could access any other userâs private information by using a web browser to visit the web address of the exposed server âÂapi.raw.app/users/followed by a unique 11-digit number corresponding to another app user. Changing the digits to correspond with any other userâs 11-digit identifier returned private information from that userâs profile, including their location data. This kind of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a type of bug that can allow someone to access or modify data on someone elseâs server because of a lack of proper security checks on the user accessing the data. Gizmodo reached out to Raw for more information. According to statements made to TechCrunch, the security issues have been patched as of Wednesday.Â  âAll previously exposed endpoints have been secured, and weâve implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future,â Marina Anderson, the co-founder of Raw dating app, told the outlet. It’s not uncommon for companies to poorly secure user data. Strange as it may sound, security is not a particularly huge priority in the software industry. It can be time-consuming, expensive, and may slow down other parts of production, so many companiessimply don’t bother with it. With a dating app, howeverâa business which is dedicated to handling users’ most intimate (literally) and sensitive dataâit obviously pays to spend a little bit more time locking stuff down. As they say: wrap it before you tap it. Dating appsRaw Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "article_text": "As it goes with every Marvel movie,ÂThunderboltsÂends twice: first before the end titles, and againafter the creditshave rolled. Both closers are pretty important for what’s next for the team and their upcoming appearance inAvengers: Doomsday,Âand director Jake Schreier’s discussed about how the post-credits came about. After the credits, the film jumps ahead 14 months after the motley crew was publicly unveiled as the New Avengers. They’re put out about Sam Wilson suing them over the Avengers trademark, but that matter falls to the wayside when they learn a rocket’s coming to Earth, and it’s bearing the logo of the Fantastic Four. Schreier toldVarietythat scene was shot about a month ago (prior to its mid-April premiere), and byDoomsdayÂdirectors Joe and Anthony Russo in London. The team was already confirmed to be among that film’s cast back in March, and for those keeping track, this post-credits makes the brothers’ first scene they shot since they exited the MCU withÂAvengers: Endgame. Schreier may not have directed his former Thunderbolts, but he looked at the scene’s scripts and collborated on it “to make sure it was honest to where our characters were. [We’re] giving them over to this whole new world and new scope, and [we] want them to function in that way.” Being there on set was “very fun to watch your buddies go on to this grander scale…and see them directed in another context and on a different level of scope than we had been treating it.” Now that they’re in the hands of the Russos, we’ll have to wait untilÂAvengers: DoomsdayÂreleases on May 1 to see what the New Avengers get up to when they meet the Fantastic Four, Sam’s Avengers, and the X-Men.

    "title": "Trump Torched Decades of Science in Just 100 Days—and the Fallout Is Global",
    "article_text": "Across seven decades and a dozen presidencies, Americaâs scientific prowess was arguably unmatched. At universities and federal agencies alike, researchers in the United States revolutionized weather forecasting, cured deadly diseases, and began monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. As far back as 1990, Congress directed this scientific might toward understanding climate change, after finding that human-induced global warming posed a threat to âhuman health, and global economic and social well-being.â Donald Trump and his new administration evidently disagree. In the first 100 days of his second stint in the White House, the president has released a slew of orders that destabilize this apparatus. Earlier this month, the administration effectively scrapped the governmentâs comprehensive National Climate Assessment â a quadrennial report that provides scientifically-backed guidance for how towns, cities, and regions can prepare for a hotter climate â when itcanceled a contract for the firm that facilitates the research. Recently leaked memos, reviewed by Grist, show the White House hopes to slash scientific research at NASA and eliminate all research at theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which is responsible for a host of climate, weather, and conservation science. And two weeks ago, the administration froze over$2 billion of research fundingto Harvard â the latest in a series of punishments targeting the nationâs top schools that the president claims have become overrun by âwokeâ ideology. Experts fear this siege against science could jeopardize the United Statesâ status as a global leader in climate research. Since Trump took office in January, the federal government has frozen billions of dollars inclimate fundingandgrants for universities. At the same time, Elon Muskâs Department of Government Efficiency has decimated the federal workforce, firing thousands of scientists, in a purported attempt to cut a trillion dollars in âwaste and fraudâ from the federal budget. This month, Muskâs team began canceling hundreds of millions of dollarsâ worth of scientific grants distributed by the National Science Foundation. And last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio shuttered the Office of Global Change, which oversees international climate negotiations. âOne of the things that has made America great and will keep America great is our scientific excellence and world leadership in climate science,â said Max Holmes, who leads the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. âGutting those things will send our country in a different direction.â While other countries may fill the void, he said, the loss of American research and expertise will affect the entire world. One way of measuring a countryâs scientific heft is by looking at the number of papers its researchers publish. For the last quarter century, American scientists havechurned out some 400,000 studies each yearâ an unrivaled pace that has remained consistent throughout presidential administrations until Chinaâs scientists surpassed it in 2016. This is largely thanks to the federal government, which has been the countryâs largest overall funder of science and research since World War II. Until now, no former president â including Trump â has tried to dismantle this legacy. For example, the fourth edition of the National Climate Assessment, a recurring report mandated by Congress under the auspices of the U.S. Global Change Research Program in 1990, was nearly complete the first time Trump took office in 2016. Although his administration limited the reportâs publicity when it was released, they did not alter the contents of the report, according to federal scientists who worked on it. But this go-round is different: On April 9, the Trump administration ended the contract with the consulting firm responsible for running the U.S. Global Change Research Program â a likely fatal blow for the sixth National Climate Assessment, which was due to be published in the next few years. âFor hundreds and even thousands of years, we humans have been making decisions based on conditions of the past,â said Katharine Hayhoe, a leading author of the last four assessments and a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. âItâs like driving down the road looking in the rearview mirror. But now, thanks entirely to human actions, we are facing a curve in the road greater than we humans have ever confronted.â Other consequences of ending the Global Change Research Program are more immediate. The programâs interagency working groups are the primary way that federal agencies collaborate on climate problems, sharing data and expertise on greenhouse gas monitoring and sea level rise. Federal scientists told Grist that the program was essential for efficient communication between agencies and that without it, continuing these collaborations may not be possible. The program also facilitates the United Statesâ participation in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, through which scientists from nearly 200 countries work together to create a global report with the latest climate science. âThe U.S. has long had a profound presence at these reports â we have excellent research capacity,â said Kevin Gurney, an atmospheric scientist at Northern Arizona University and a leading author on several IPCC reports. âPolitics aside, having the best available knowledge on climate change problems is crucial.â Gurney noted that because Americaâs scientific workforce is so large and holds a wealth of research, climate models, and data, a diminished U.S. presence deprives other countries of crucial climate information. Pulling back could also dampen American input and influence over the contents of the IPCC report â which is used to inform international climate mitigation policies, such as a recently announcedinternational shipping tax that aims to reduce emissions. âThereâs loss in both directions,â Gurney said. âI worry that itâs going to take us years to regain the momentum and capacity that it seems weâre just frivolously letting go of right now.â In March, Gurney â who is not a federal employee â was one of a few U.S. scientists who attended an IPCC meeting in Japan after the Trump administration barred federal delegates from attending an IPCC planning meeting the previous month. In light of crumbling government support, a group of 10 American research institutionsrecently came togetherto form the U.S. Academic Alliance, which aims to preserve U.S. participation in the report. Hosted by the American Geophysical Union, the alliance is stepping up in place of the federal government to handle nominations for U.S. scientists to contribute to the next IPCC assessment. Beyond losing crucial data on the changing climate, culling science at NOAA will âhurt every aspect of society,â said Rick Spinrad, who led NOAA under Joe Bidenâs administration. The data produced by the agencyâs research division supports a wide range of government services, such as disaster management and agricultural forecasting. And because the agencyâs research capacity, equipment, and expert workforce took decades to build up, the losses canât be easily recovered. âThe American public needs to understand that you canât just turn a science switch off and then turn it back on again,â Spinrad said. âThis is not like tariffs.â He pointed out that while NOAAâs budget is small â just 0.01 percent of the federal budget, by some estimates â it plays an outsize role in American lives. It also financially benefits taxpayers far more than it costs them:A recent study by the American Meteorological Societyfound that every dollar invested into the National Weather Service returns $73 in value for the public. The passback budget document also includes guidance to reshuffle the small parts of NOAAâs research division that may be spared into other parts of the agency. But because NOAAâs various offices are so interconnected, Spinrad said breaking it up and reorganizing it will disrupt the entire agencyâs ability to function. âThe idea that all of this is predicated on government efficiency is really contradictory,â he said. âThe consequences will be risks to lives, property, and economic development. Thereâs no question of that.â Over the past couple weeks, other agencies that conduct climate science have received passback budget memos too. The budget proposal for NASA reveals the administrationâs plans to halve the space agencyâs science funding â docking over $3 billion from its 2026 budget. The cuts would likely mean that NOAA and NASA will no longer be able to launch the next generation ofEarth-observing satellites, which provide crucial data for climate and weather forecasting. Meanwhile, the Trump administrationâs passback memo sent to the Department of Health and Human Services reportedly proposesslashing $40 billionfrom its budget. Many offices and programs inside the department â which houses the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Disease Control â would be shuffled, consolidated, or eliminated entirely. According to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times and ProPublica, National Institutes of Health programs and grants for studying the health impacts of climate change willno longer be funded, and the agencyâs new policy isânot to prioritizeâresearch related to climate change. The Trump administration alsoplans to amputate the Environmental Protection Agencyâs scientific arm, a move that means laying off thousands of scientists. On April 15, amid reports that the EPAplans to gut its greenhouse gas monitoring program, the U.S.missed the deadlineto report its emissions to the United Nations for the first time in three decades. âEssentially everything that is related to how we understand climate is on the table for being cut,â said a scientist who has worked at NASA and who requested anonymity. âWeâll just be flying blind while the planet is undergoing some of the most significant impacts and changes that have been experienced.â The funding cuts could also imperil climate research outside the government. Many federal agencies, such as NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health, play a large role in providing universities grants to pay for research and fund graduate students. But in recent weeks, the Trump administration has frozen billions of these dollars as part of its investigation into antisemitism at over 60 universities, catching climate research in the broad net. In 2018, the last year that the Government Accountability Office took stock of federal climate funding, the government was spending over $13 billion on climate change research, with many agencies providing grants to universities or collaborating directly with them. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy have both revoked large chunks of funding to universities, sparkinglawsuits. In mid-April, the National Science Foundation â which provided $800 million toward climate research in 2018 âfroze all grant applicationsas Elon Muskâs team began combing through its books.Crowdsourced information from scientistsshows that on April 18, DOGE had canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding. The agency has already been operating cautiously since Trump took office, funding50 percent fewer grantsthan this time last year. And in early April the Commerce Department announced $4 million of funding from NOAA would be pulled back from Princetonâs Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System, which helps create improved weather forecasts and model water availability. According to reporting in The Washington Post, the Trump administration says the initiatives areâno longer alignedâ with the agencyâs objectivesand that the research contributes to climate anxiety by promoting âexaggerated and implausible climate threats.â âClimate science is important in tackling a complicated problem, but a lot of this is not about the research,â said David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley. âThe research funding is being used as a political pawn in a battle about something else.â Ackerly said itâs too soon to know how the broadly applied cuts might reshape climate science done at universities, but expressed concerns that a generation of students could lose confidence in pursuing careers in higher education. International students â who earn roughly half of all graduate degrees in science and technology fields â may forgo coming to study in the U.S. at all. Some schools have already tightened their belts byfreezing or restricting their graduate admissions. Because graduate students provide the workforce necessary to conduct scientific studies, run laboratories, help teach classes, and write papers, the slimming of student populations means less climate research can be produced in the United States. âOur ability to educate the next generation of people to do this work is starting to be cut off,â said Gurney, the IPCC author. âIt may take a while and we may not notice it at first, but we will. This is damage that could last for a long time.â Holmes, of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, said that the escalating cuts signal to the international community that the U.S. is stepping back from leadership in climate research. With so much uncertainty, he said, scientists may begin to seek opportunities in other countries. It appears the brain drain has already begun. According to arecent analysis from Nature, data from the scientific journalâs job board indicates that American scientists have submitted 32 percent more applications for international jobs during the beginning of this year compared to last year. In March alone, U.S.-based job seekers viewed international job listings 68 percent more than last year. At the same time, applications to U.S. institutions from European researchers fell by 41 percent. Some European institutions are actively trying to attract American scientific talent, too. In March, Franceâs Aix-Marseille University said it was âready to welcome American scientistsâ and created the Safe Place for Science program to sponsor those working in climate, health, and environmental fields. Germanyâs top research institution, the Max Planck Society, announced in early April a new transatlantic program to create collaborative research centers with American institutions. After job applications from the U.S. researchers doubled over last year, the institutionâs president said he is planning to tour U.S. cities to speak to Germanyâsânew talent poolâ. According to Nature, recruiters in China have also been targeting career ads toward fired American scientists. âOther countries will take the lead if we cede it, because we need leadership in climate solutions and science,â Holmes said. âThe sooner we can right the ship, the sooner we can get heading in the right direction again.â Rachel Cleetus, a senior policy director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that nothing should be considered final until Congress approves the federal budget later this year. âCongress needs to push back on these disastrous cuts, because this scientific enterprise has been built up by investments over decades from U.S. taxpayers,â she said. âThis is the crown jewel of science and expertise for our nation â even the world.â Even if the lost funding is restored, Ackerly said the Trump administrationâs attacks represent an unprecedented breakdown in the governmentâs longstanding support of science and research. It is this relationship, he said, that fosters a uniquely robust network of both private and public universities, and has made higher education and science in the United States stand out among other countries for decades. But now, said Ackerly, a new normal is being established. âThis will always be part of a history we live with,â he said. âYou can never fully go back to where things were before.â This article originally appeared inGristathttps://grist.org/science/american-climate-research-agencies-universities-trump-100-days/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

    "title": "What You Learned About Cell Division Is Probably Wrong",
    "article_text": "If you took high school biology, you probably learned about cell division: a crucial process in all life forms officially called mitosis. For over one hundred years, students have learned that during mitosis, a parent cell becomes spherical before dividing into two daughter cells of the same size and shape. A new study, however, might rewrite many, many biology textbooks. Researchers revealed that mitosis doesn’t always feature cell rounding (when a parent cell becomes spherical), meaning that the resulting daughter cells aren’t always symmetrical, nor do they carry the same function. Their work is detailed in astudypublished Thursday in the journal Science, and holds important implications for understanding cell division in diseases such as cancer. âStudents learn that when a cell divides, it will generate a uniform spherical shape. Our study, however, shows that in real living organisms, it is not as simple as that,” Shane Herbert, co-lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester’s faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, said in a universitystatement. In the new study, researchers observed blood vessel formation in zebrafish embryos. The growth of new vessels consists of slow-moving cells led by a single fast-moving cell. When the lead cell underwent mitosis, it didn’t become spherical or experience rounding. The asymmetrical division allowed it to form two different cells: one slow-moving cell and one fast-moving cell to take the lead in the parent cell’s place. Previously, scientists had mainly associated asymmetric cell division with specialized cells called stem cells. âUsing transparent 1-day old zebrafish embryos allows us to study a dynamic process like cell division inside a living organism,” said Holly Lovegrove, co-lead author of the study and a lecturer in cardiovascular sciences at The University of Manchester. âWe are therefore able to make movies of this fundamental cell behaviour and in doing so reveal exciting new aspects of how tissues grow.â Furthermore, the researchers noted that the shape of the parent cell can determine whether its division will be symmetrical or asymmetrical. For example, they observed that shorter and wider cells were more likely to become spherical and split into two similar daughter cells. In contrast, longer and thinner cells didn’t “round-up,” and as a result, divided asymmetrically. To further investigate this, Herbert, Lovegrove, and their colleagues manipulated the size of human parent cells via micropatterning. “Micropatterning allows us to generate specifically shaped microscopic patches of proteins that cells can stick to,” explained Georgia Hulmes, co-first author of the study and a postdoctoral research associate at The University of Manchester’s School of Biological Sciences. “The cells will then take the shape of the patch. This therefore allows us to change the shape of the cells and test how these shapes impact on the subsequent cell division.” âOur research suggests that the shape of the cell before it divides can fundamentally direct whether a cell rounds, and importantly, if its daughters are symmetric or asymmetric both in size and function,” Herbert said. As a result, scientists might one day be able to generate cells with different functions by controlling the shape of their parent cells. More broadly, their analyses suggest that asymmetric divisions play an important role in the creation of different tissues and organs. The study also holds important implications for diseases such as cancer, in which asymmetric division could lead to different cell behaviors potentially associated with cancer progression.

    "title": "El Paso Is Having Its Dustiest Year Since the Actual Dust Bowl",
    "article_text": "If you live in El Paso, Las Cruces, or Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and feel like youâve been inhaling the Chihuahuan Desert lately, youâre not imagining things. The Borderplex region is experiencing its dustiest season since the Dust Bowl, the period of devastating dust storms that hit North America a century ago. NASAâs Aqua satellite captured an image of the airborne dust from low-Earth orbit on April 27. The swaths of airborne particles are part of an ongoing set of storms pummeling the Borderplex, the transnational area that includes southern New Mexico, West Texas, and the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The imaged storm is just the latest in a string that is yeeting dried-up lake beds and parched soil into the southern skies. This year’s drought-exacerbated dusty season is âtruly exceptionalâone for the record books,â said Thomas Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, in a NASA Earth Observatoryrelease. Gill has tracked dust activity across the planet (and the Borderplex specifically) for decades. The event imaged above is the tenth “full-fledged” storm of the yearâa full-fledged event being a storm that reduces visibility to less than half a mile, Gill said. Thatâs more than five times the average of 1.8 storms per yearâand makes 2025 the worst dust season since 1936, when the Dust Bowl swept America, laying into El Paso with 11 storms. Why are there so many storms this year? You can blame it on a climatic cocktail of drought and record-breaking wind. March was the windiest month the region has seen in over 50 years, Gill said, and the area is in “the worst drought we’ve seen in at least a decade.” My allergy clogged sinus is thanking its lucky stars it isn’t in the Southwest right now. But dust storms arenât just an eyesore. The eventscontributeto traffic accidents and raise the risk of cardiorespiratory problems, and may worsen the spread ofValley Fever, a fungal infection. Gill and his colleagues estimated that dust storms rack up over $150 billion in damage nationally each year, hitting farmers, the energy and healthcare industries, and households especially hard. NASAâs satellites and modeling tools are helping scientists monitor and better understand how dust travelsâand way up in the atmosphere, the particles can traverse significant distances. One March storm sent particles all the way to Greenland, according to Santiago Gasso, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland who is based at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, in the same release. So far in 2025, the Borderplex has accrued 28 dusty daysâalready exceeding the annual average of 22 over the last quarter-centuryâand more dust is in the forecast for the region this weekend.

    "title": "'You can't escape us': Devolver plots to release a game on GTA 6's release date, no matter when that is",
    "article_text": "No offers found Instead of running away from GTA 6's new May 2026 release date, indie publisher Devolver Digital is targeting it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While every other publisher runs from the new GTA 6 release date, Devolver Digital is determined to have its own 'Doom Crossing' moment. This weekend, Devolvershared a post on Xin response tothe Grand Theft Auto 6 release date announcement, with the ominous message, \"You can't escape us. May 26, 2026 it is then.\" This challenge was a follow-up to a post from back in March where Devolver casually vowed, \"Gonna release a game the exact same day and time as GTA 6.\" Devolver hasn't yet announced what game it'll be pitting against GTA 6. The publisher is known for its irreverent industry stunts, but there could be something to the plan if it finds the same mutually-beneficial hype experienced by Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Doom Eternal on March 20, 2020. That shared release date was notable for the comical contrast—as with movies Barbie and Oppenheimer—so whatever Devolver lands on will likely be a wildly different game from GTA 6. Devolver has published some spectacular indie games, includingCult of the Lamb,Death's Door, The Talos Principle, Gris, and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood. If anyone can successfully launch an indie game on the same day as GTA6, it's probably them. The mystery upcoming game destined for GTA 6's new May 26, 2026 release date could be almost anything. We knowEnter the Gungeon 2is slated for a 2026 release, although Hotline Miami 3 might be a more theme-appropriate candidate (however, a third installment in the series has yet to be announced). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The situation could get especially spicy if GTA 6 gets delayed again, allowing Devolver to either release its game on time and brag or delay it unnecessarily to stay true to its word.

    "title": "Tales of the Shire embraces a 'clutter-core experience' with grid-free decorating for your hobbit house",
    "article_text": "No offers found Tales of the Shire's devs are letting you decorate your hobbit house however you want—including making it a mess When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cozy Lord of the Rings life sim Tales of the Shire is embracing the comforting mess of Hobbiton by allowing players to decorate without being locked into a grid. Currently slated for release on July 29, Tales of the Shire invites players to live the hobbit life in the village of Bywater, where they can garden, fish, cook, craft, and, of course, decorate. In adev update posted on YouTubethis weekend, the developers shared some new details about how decorating will work in the game, or rather how itwon'twork. UX designer Jordan Peat explained, \"Home decoration is kind of one of our core ways of expressing yourself in the game. Very early on we actually decided on making it gridless, so you don't place anything on a square within a grid.\" A grid-free decorating system means you have the freedom to place items however and wherever you want, even if the end result turns out messy or cluttered. \"If you want to, you can cover your wall with shelves and pictures and all of that, and you can put individual items on every shelf,\" Peat added. \"Big items, small items, there is no limit to the kind of stuff you can have in your house, which allows the player to kind of engage in a 'clutter-core' experience.\" Personally, I love having that kind of freedom in games like this because a gridless decorating system makes it much easier to create a unique home that looks and feels organic. As the developers point out, gridless decorating is also more accurate to what we see in Bag End in the Lord of the Rings (and Hobbit) movies, with books, papers, and various whimsical knick knacks scattered all over the place. Gridless decorating isn't found in many other games in the genre, like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. Palia, which has an art style similar to Tales of the Shire, has a good gridless decorating system that I've enjoyed much more than the more restricted systems in Stardew or AC, so I'll be curious to see how Tales of the Shire's decorating experience compares. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The devs also showed off how the camera angles in Tales of the Shire will shift to make decorating easier. When you switch into decorating mode in your house, the camera zooms out to a top-down \"doll house\" cutaway view where you can more easily move around all your furniture, paintings, and books before going back to the normal camera angle. We'll have to wait a bit longer to try all of this out since Tales of the Shire isn't launching until July 29,after a delay earlier this year. I'm looking forward to giving life in Bywater a try, but I'm also hoping Tales of the Shire brings something new to the cozy game genre beyond just the Lord of the Rings. Tales of the Shire will launch on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, and is available towishlist now on Steam. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Stevie Bonifield is a freelance tech journalist specializing in mobile tech, gaming gear, and accessories.

    "title": "Inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Oxygen Not Included, adorable side-scrolling city-builder Ratopia burrows out of early access",
    "article_text": "No offers found Just because it's cute doesn't mean it's going to be easy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're in the market for a technical, complex city-builder sim, you're kinda spoilt for choice right now, but few games in the field can claim to be even half as cute as Ratopia, from Korean indie outfit Cassel Games. After a couple years scurrying around in early access, it's officially a complete game andout now on Steam. While I've yet to dig into it myself, I've had half an eye on this one for a while, as it seems to be drawing inspiration from all the best in the genre: Dwarf Fortress, Oxygen Not Included and Rimworld. Thankfully, Ratropolis starts things small, with players directly controlling a lone rat noble, left to fend for herself after her kingdom (as seen in the studio's previousKingdommeets deck-builder hybridRatropolis) collapsed. While initially you'll be directly controlling your leader to gather resources, hunt for food and maybe even do a little bit of dungeon-delving (there's even some light RPG elements here), you'll probably want to rustle up some loyal subjects to do the heavy lifting for you. Have a look at some of that in the launch trailer below: While you won't have to be doing anything as fiddly as circulating atmosphere or running complex water filtration systems (Oxygen Not Included is a tad much for me, I'll admit), the city-building in Ratopia looks surprisingly involved, akin to Dwarf Fortress. Each squeaky citizen has their own wants and needs, and the potential to go rogue if you don't keep them fed, healthy and paid more than you're taxing them. Considering that you're controlling a leader with a head that can be removed by surly peasants feels like a good reason to stay in their good books. There's also a heavy focus on technological advancement. While you might start out with medieval tech in the early game, those willing to dig deep into the tech tree will eventually unlock electricity and the option to construct robot rats, which I presume are less likely to revolt against an unjust ruler, and will leave your cheese stocks un-nibbled. It seems that Ratopia includes just about every trapping of the genre, including literal traps, which you'll probably want to set up to ward off the squeaking undead and raids from other factions that don't feel like trading. In addition to treasure and monster-filled depths below your kingdom, there's a whole overworld map to explore, with options to pursue diplomacy or war with your neighbors depending on whether you're taking inspiration from the Redwall novels or Warhammer's deliciously chaotic Skaven. Ratopia isout now on Steamfor £16.75/$20, with a respectable 20% discount running until May 14th. The game has been well received so far in early access, with the most consistent complaint being that the English translation can be a little bit stiff in places.

    "article_text": "No offers found Boldly going forward 'cause we can't find reverse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Us old-school rogue-likers are eating good. It feels like we've barely had time to digest the fantastic 'final' version ofCaves Of Qud(there's more coming, of course), and already we've got another massive indie roguelike passion project to dive into.Approaching Infinityby micro-indie outfit Ibology has been in development for over twelve years now. It's a massive turn-based sandbox heavily inspired by classic Star Trek, and now freshly launched out of early access after many an update. From what little I've played (and I do hope to pour more time into this one), Approaching Infinity is just about everything you'd expect when you hear 'Star Trek roguelike'. You're the highly customizable captain of an equally modular ship, assembling a crew of specialist oddballs and rank-and-file staff to keep your exploration boldly going and your reactor from exploding. There's planets to survey, problems to solve, shipwrecks to explore and an assortment of strange aliens of varying levels of friendliness to meet. For when the going gets tough on those planetside away missions, another nod to Trek is that redshirts will save your neck. Reminding me of the old Star Trek point-and-click adventures, each time you or one of your important officers would normally die, an expendable (and posthumously named) crewmate will take the hit for you. Let this be a lesson: if you're ever going on a space adventure, make sure you've properly introduced yourself and your specialist skillsbeforethe danger starts. Much like Caves of Qud, while there is an end goal (several, even—you can complete some game-ending objectives within a single sitting), this is a sandbox experience to be played your way. While the general behavior of each alien race and species of critter you can encounter remains consistent, the universe is reshuffled with each new character. There's a lot of fun stuff to discover in the weirder corners of the galaxy, owing to this being a mostly-solo passion project in the works for over a decade. Approaching Infinity definitely has a sense of humor to it too. Space is full of weird problems, like planets overrun by carnivorous, rapidly reproducing bunnies, or the occasional haunted space-casino, walls lined with slot machines and halls patrolled by the undead. Some sectors are crawling with cutthroat space-mafia, while some warrior races will continually pick fights with you until they've lost enough times to begrudgingly respect you. Unfortunately the universe of Approaching Infinity hasn't reached the utopian state of fully automated luxury gay space communism, so money is what makes the galaxy go round here. You'll be taking jobs from any species that's willing to pay, and making ends meet by selling salvage and sometimes even fixing up and towing ships that you've poked sufficient holes in to vacate the previous owners. It's a good metric of progress, though I'm curious what a true post-scarcity take on the game would look like. Idle musings aside, this one seems legit, and the only thing keeping it from Steam's coveted 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating is it needing a few dozen more user reviews. If you're fresh from Caves of Qud or Dwarf Fortress' new adventure mode, you might want to look to the stars.Approaching Infinity is out now on Steam for £15/$18.

Not everyone has years, weeks or even hours to commit to demon slaughter. Not all of us can be Coincident,fighting through the armies of hell for six hours solid. Sometimes you've not even got a minute to spare, and if that's the case, I recommend seeking better work-life balance. Also to check out madcap Doom modBlitz: Race Against Time, a collection of 32 maps, each with a 30 second timer. Ready, set, kill! Having played through about half of the set over lunch, I can confirm that Blitz is a genuinely fun collection of levels built aroundOG Doomguy's absurd 50 mph run speed. The second each level begins, you've got to make a beeline to the finish before the exit door seals itself shut. Each map starts you out with just the basic pistol, but the weapons you'll be picking up here have been re-tuned with speed in mind, making for a satisfying little scramble. The bad news is that the enemies are a bit twitchier as well, along with a few new baddies that can stop a run dead. The main difficulty comes from the sheer chaos of it all. Given that there were 17 mappers involved in this project, you'll have to think fast and adapt to wildly varied environments. From a sprint across crumbling rooftops taken straight out of Evangelion to barreling through an office building in search of the toilet, there's never a dull moment, and there's a surprisingly cool and varied soundtrack to be heard, even if you won't get through half a track most of the time. Of course, Doom mappers being especially extra, there's plenty to see and be explored in many of these levels. Lower difficulties disable the time limit, but also if you manage to reach the end of a level before the timer runs out, you'll be free to backtrack through each map in search of goodies you might have missed in your haste. It gives Blitz a bit of a double identity; each level providing both a fast shot of adrenaline followed by a more relaxed round of exploration. Of course, Doom being both infinite and eternal, this isn't the first mod focused on going fast. If you want something similar in concept but a little more fleshed out (to the point of being effectively a whole game unto itself), check outSkulldashand its fifty time-trial maps. It might be over eight years old now, but still holds up great. You can snag Blitz: Race Against Timeover on the Doomworld forums here, although you'll need a modern source port likeDSDAorGZDoomto play it.

    "article_text": "No offers found Help with solving Sunday's puzzle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's Sunday, so let's make sure you can take today'sWordleat your own pace. Refresh your general guessing with our handy tips if you want to keep things simple, and then take a look at our hint for today's game if you find yourself in need of something more direct. Still not enough? Don't worry about it. There's only a click between you and the May 4 (1415) answer.What a cunning puzzle. How could a simple word game be so mysterious? So perplexing? So…oh I see it now. My own clues were almost my downfall today, getting me all caught up in an all-consuming and completely wrong train of thought for far too long. I did have a good laugh when I realised what I'd done though, so I didn't mind the slow game today. This is a kind of freshwater fish, commonly caught for fun, sport, and food in many parts of the world. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. Easy as pie. The answer to the May 4 (1415) Wordle isTROUT. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "Bungie's attempt to dismiss the Destiny 2 copyright case using YouTube videos describing 'vaulted' elements of the game has been shut down by a judge who is not going to sit through a 10-hour lore explainer",
    "article_text": "No offers found Fair enough. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In October of 2024 science-fiction writer Matthew Kelsey Martineauaccused Bungie of lifting ideas for its first Destiny 2 campaign from a story published on his blogunder the pseudonym Caspar Cole. While some of the ideas in question are fairly generic sci-fi elements, like consciousness transfer and the use of emergency failsafes to prevent disasters, both storylines involve groups called the \"Red Legion\" who use flamethrowers and trained hounds of war. It's entirely possible that's a coincidence, but Bungie is struggling to prove it since all the relevant parts of Destiny 2 are now unplayable and tucked away in the 'vault'. Among the many problems with live-service games is the way they eat themselves, rendering parts of the game inaccessible when they're overwritten by new material, made redundant, or just trimmed to get the install size down. In the case of Destiny 2, that began when the Beyond Light expansion launched andthe original Red War campaign as well as its two follow-ups were put in the 'Destiny 2 Content Vault'. New players would never get to be baffled by them, and would instead have to settle for being baffled by whatever Bungie put in their place. While Bungie's always maintained that old Destiny 2 material is just sitting in the vault for now, when the lawsuit was filed it suddenly turned out thatmaterial in the vault couldn't be restored. The engine had been updated, and it simply wasn't possible to restore the Red War. Instead, Bungie insisted \"the attached videos are the best possible way for the Court to review the accused work.\" The videos in question included, as Exhibit B, a 10-hour lore video put together by YouTuber MynameisByf. Exhibit C is a cutscene compilation, again put together by a fan, that's a meretwo hours and 40 minutes long. AsThe Game Post reports, Judge Susie Morgan does not have time for that nonsense. When Bungie filed a motion to dismiss the case using only citations from the Destinypedia fan wiki and ridiculously long YouTube videos, the judge disregarded it. \"The Court will not consider the exhibits attached to Defendant's motion to dismiss and will not convert the Defendant's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment,\" the decision went. \"There has not been sufficient time for discovery, and the attachments are admittedly of third-party origination. Their authenticity has not been established.\" Which means the copyright infringement court case is going ahead after all. It sure would be nice if this served as some kind of warning that sunsetting huge chunks of videogames just to keep the treadmill grinding on isn't worthwhile, but given how much money the companies at the pointy end of the live-service war are making out of them I wouldn't hold your breath.

    "article_text": "No offers found Rebecca Heineman, one of Interplay's founders, kept the receipts. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tim Cain, lead developer of the original Fallout, recently lamented theloss of Fallout's earliest development materials. When he left Interplay he was told to delete his copies of early builds and even his notes from development meetings, and apparently Interplay has since lost not only the source code but also the original Fallout artwork and the clay models that were scanned to make the 3D talking heads some of its NPCs are blessed with. Fortunately, it turns out Interplay cofounder and programmer Rebecca Heineman kept copies of the source code for Fallout 1 and 2, as she toldVideoGamer. In 1993, Interplay published a CD collecting one game it published in each of the previous 10 years, including Battle Chess, Bard's Tale, The Lord of the Rings Vol. I, and the original Wasteland. Heineman put the anthology together using her own copies of the source code of those games, except for Wasteland. When she went looking for it, she discovered others weren't putting as much effort into backups. As she explained, \"I asked for the source and was given a blank stare. I went to the COO's office and he gave me a cardboard box that looked like it was run over by a truck and it had some of the source on floppies. I ended up contacting friends at Electronic Arts to get a copy of the source we sent them when Wasteland shipped.\" From then on Heineman took snapshots of the code for each game she worked on at Interplay, as well as those she ported for MacPlay—which was originally a division of Interplay before being licensed out. \"I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,\" Heineman said. \"When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included Fallout 1 and 2\". Heineman previously made thesource code for the 3DO version of Doomfreely available on Github. \"I wrote the code, so I gave myself permission, and I asked id Software and they said, 'Sure!' Fallout would require permission from Bethesda. I hadn't gotten around to asking them. They are on my list,\" she said.

    "article_text": "ThinkCentre neo Ultra 2025 enjoys massive gains thanks to Intel’s new Core Ultra 9 285 CPU When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple’s Mac Studio continues to dominate the conversation around compact high-performance desktops, butLenovois pushing back with its ThinkCentre neo Ultra series. Originally released at CES 2024, the firstThinkCentre neo Ultrafeatured a 14th GenIntelprocessor. Just six months later, Lenovo refreshed the device withIntel’s Core Ultra CPUs, and also upgraded the GPU in a separate system, theLenovo Yoga Portal mini PC. Now, Lenovo has introduced yet another update to the ThinkCentre neo Ultra series - a new mini workstation equipped with Intel’s high-end Core Ultra 9 285 CPU and a 16GB RTX 5060 Ti GPU rated at 180W. “Small Stature, Big Energy” is how Lenovo describes this year’s model, and the tagline fits. Despite its compact 3.6-liter chassis, thismini PCdelivers a total performance output of 825 TOPS and upgrades from the desktop-grade LGA-1700 to the newer LGA-1851 socket. The power supply has been reduced from 350W in the previous version to 300W, suggesting improved power efficiency. Although this model still avoids unlocked K-series CPUs, it aims for a balance between thermal limitations and computational performance that should appeal to its business-focused audience. One of the standout features is the upgraded graphics. Replacing the RTX 4060 with a 16GB RTX 5060 Ti offers a substantial boost for users handling AI inference, 3D rendering, or high-resolution video workflows. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Lenovo also hints at a dedicated NPU card, though it’s unclear whether this refers to separate hardware or is tied to Intel’s Arrow Lake architecture. Either way, the system supports locally deployed large language models with up to 14 billion parameters - an appealing option for organizations looking to run AI workloads in-house. Lenovo says the system earned a CES 2025 Best New Tech for Home and Workplace Award, adding further credibility to its performance claims. Base configurations include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, with pricing set at 14,999 RMB (about $2,056) for the Core Ultra 5 and RTX 5060, or 19,999 RMB (about $2,741) for the Ultra 7 and RTX 5060 Ti. Pricing and availability for the Core Ultra 9 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB variant have yet to be announced, and there's no word on international launch details.

    "article_text": "Formula Lego has a good ring to it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new kind of electric vehicle just took to the Miami Grand Prix ahead of Sunday’s Formula 1 race there: 10 fully drivable racecars built almost entirely out of Lego. The bespoke big builds – one for each of F1’s 10 teams – are close to 1:1 scale with their F1 counterparts. They were constructed out of 400,000 Lego bricks each and powered by an 8kW electric engine, which allows them to reach speeds of 20km/h (roughly 12mph). The only non-Lego elements are the engine, the wheel rims and tires (which were each sourced from their respective F1 teams and Pirelli for authenticity), the steering wheel (though it is decorated with Lego), and the steel frame attaching all these elements. Also, glue and bolts are holding the bricks and frame together. Otherwise, the designers and engineers behind the builds told me that they wanted this to be something that a kid (with enough Lego bricks) could build at home, or perhaps construct a smaller version using fewer bricks and Lego Technic motors that can drive around on a more manageable scale. The team behind the F1 big builds explained that each car is based on its respective Speed Champions Lego set, blown up from minifigure to human scale. The only changes to the Lego design were to incorporate space for two passengers rather than one and replace stickered elements with the same detailing constructed from bricks (such as the branding and logos decorating each vehicle). Once the outer Lego design was decided, the engineers had to work out how a steel frame and engine would be incorporated to make it move. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. “We are Lego so our designs are always bricks first,” they explained. “So we created the Lego design then built a frame and engine design that would fit inside the Lego rather than the other way around.” Apparently, their only major challenge with this brick-first approach was working out how to make the front wheels turn, given the tight space the steel frame had to move. They were forced to come up with a new approach compared to their previous moving Lego big builds, but once that was solved, they were off to the races. The project has been a major labor of love. The 26-person strong design team spent over 22,000 combined hours working on the cars in Lego’s Kladno factory located in the Czech Republic, and it was their first time working on so many cars at once in a tight time frame. “We had around eight months to build all 10 cars, which is the time we might take for one.” But roughly 4 million bricks later (which account for around two-thirds of each big build’s 1,500kg weight) they said seeing all 10 cars together for the first time in Miami was “definitely worth it.” Hamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you’ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

    "article_text": "Second digital gold rush? CFOs say AI isn’t paying off - yet, anyway When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence is transforming every industry, but a new report has claimed many companies are failing to capture its financial value. A global study of 614 Chief Financial Officers conducted by DigitalRoute found nearly three-quarters (71%) said they were struggling to monetize AI effectively, despite nearly 90% naming it a mission-critical priority over the next five years. Only 29% of companies currently have a working AI monetization model, and the rest are either experimenting or “flying blind,” according to the data, and over two-thirds (68%) of tech firms say their traditional pricing strategies are no longer applicable in an AI-driven economy. “AI is in the second digital gold rush,” said Ari Vanttinen, CMO at DigitalRoute. “But without the usage-level visibility, companies are gambling with pricing, profitability and even product viability. Our data shows CFOs urgently need real-time metering and revenue management to turn AI from a cost line into a genuine profit engine.” Boardrooms are taking notice - nearly two-thirds (64%) of those surveyed say AI monetization is now a formal board priority, yet just one in five businesses can track individual AI consumption, leaving finance teams with limited tools for accurate billing, forecasting, or margin analysis. 70% of CFOs cite pricing complexity as the biggest barrier to scaling AI, and more than half report misalignment between finance and product teams. Legacy systems are also a challenge: 63% of companies are investing in new revenue management infrastructure, acknowledging that traditional quote-to-cash systems aren’t fit for usage-based AI pricing models. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The study also highlights regional differences. Nordic countries lead in implementation but struggle with profitability, while France and the UK are showing stronger early commercial returns. The US remains a global leader in AI development, but the data suggests a slightly more cautious approach to monetization at the organizational level. Although American businesses clearly understand the importance of AI, many are still developing the internal frameworks needed to scale effectively. The US scores highly on perceived significance but lags slightly behind the UK in terms of perceived criticality, indicating a broader, more experimental AI culture that has yet to fully transition to commercial execution. The report recommends three steps for success: first, meter AI consumption at the feature level; second, model value-based and usage-based pricing before launch; and third, align product, finance, and revenue teams around shared data. As Vanttinen puts it, “Every prompt is now a revenue event. When businesses can see, price and bill for AI usage in real-time, they unlock the margins the market expects.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "Return of the Smart Battery Case? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The rumors around aniPhone 17 Airhave been swirling for months at this point, but we just got some fresh information about this super-slim phone, which is set to replace theiPhone 16 Plus– including the potential return of a retiredAppleaccessory. According to a new report inThe Information(via9to5Mac), Apple is planning to release an optional accessory at the same time as the iPhone 17 Air: a case with an integrated battery pack. This is apparently to make up for shortfalls in the battery life of the iPhone 17 Air. You may remember that back in the day, Apple made a Smart Battery Case for its iPhones. As MagSafe and its wireless charging was introduced with the iPhone 12 though, the battery case was discontinued. Now, it looks as though it might be coming back. Sources speaking to The Information say the thinness of the iPhone 17 Air means it only lasts a day without a recharge for 60-70% of users – whereas for other models, it's more like 80-90%. Battery life isn't the only concern around the iPhone 17 Air though. The report in The Information also suggests there's no space for a physical SIM, so it'll be eSIM all the way – which may cause issues with regulators in China. What's more, there's only going to be room for one speaker on the device, which may impact sound quality. We'vepreviously heardboth these rumors, around the eSIM and speaker, and we've more inclined to believe them now they've been repeated. It's set to be quite a year for the Apple iPhone. We've already had a new model in the shape of theApple iPhone 16e, and later in the year with the Air we'll be getting another new model that doesn't really have a direct predecessor. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The same report from The Information suggests that there might be even more changes to come next year,with Apple planning tosplit the launches of the iPhone 18 models so that they launch at different times throughout the course of 2026 and 2027.

    "article_text": "JPMorganChase says SaaS is assisting cyber attackers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. JPMorganChase, the largest bank in the world, has warned about the dangers of SaaS technology used by organizations across the world every single day. Writing in anopen letter, CISO Patrick Opet outlined growing concerns that the speed of SaaS adoption has outpaced security development. In particular, Opet noted that vendors have prioritized rapid feature delivery over secure architecture, creating systemic vulnerabilities across the software supply chain. “An AI-driven calendar optimization service integrating directly into corporate email systems through \"read only roles\" and \"authentication tokens\" can no doubt boost productivity when functioning correctly,” Opet said. “Yet, if compromised, this direct integration grants attackers unprecedented access to confidential data and critical internal communications.” Opet went on to warn thousands of organizations are now embedded in ecosystems that depend heavily on a small group of service providers - so if one is compromised, the ripple effects could be devastating. \"Modern integration patterns dismantle these essential boundaries, relying heavily on modern identity protocols (e.g., OAuth) to create direct, often unchecked interactions between third-party services and firms’ sensitive internal resources,\" Opet said. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \"In practice, these integration models collapse authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (granting permissions) into overly simplified interactions, effectively creating single-factor explicit trust between systems on the internet and private internal resources. This architectural regression undermines fundamental security principles that have proven durability.\" JPMorganChase has already experienced a number of third-party breaches over the past three years, requiring swift action to isolate compromised partners and mitigate threats. These incidents have emphasized the risks tied to highly connected third-party ecosystems. \"Fierce competition among software providers has driven prioritization of rapid feature development over robust security,\" Opet wrote. \"This often results in rushed product releases without comprehensive security built in or enabled by default, creating repeated opportunities for attackers to exploit weaknesses. The pursuit of market share at the expense of security exposes entire customer ecosystems to significant risk and will result in an unsustainable situation for the economic system.\" He also cited new threats emerging from token theft, opaque fourth-party dependencies, and privileged access without sufficient transparency. \"The most effective way to begin change is to reject these integration models without better solutions,” Opet concluded. “I hope you’ll join me inrecognizing this challenge and responding decisively, collaboratively, and immediately.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "You need to be careful when buying new vinyl – the digital music loudness war can mean they sound worse than second-hand records",
    "article_text": "Some re-releases can be a downgrade, not an upgrade When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Some of the most-wanted vinyl releases aren't new records; they're remastered versions of old favorites. But those remasters might not sound as good as you hope even when played on thebest turntables– and in some case they might actually sound worse than the originals. Remastering – creating a new master copy of the record that's then copied to discs and/or digital – is commonplace because it's a great way for record companies to sell you a record all over again. And it's catnip for music fans, because it promises to take an album you already adore and make it even more magical. With a lot of old music, remastering really does deliver a massive improvement, so for example it can give you the clarity and low-end thump that's often lacking from early rock records because not everyone making music or playback kit really knew what they were doing back then. But for some remasters, it might be wise to wait until others have taken the plunge before deciding if you want to sign up. It's all about the loudness war. If you've heard of it, you've probably heard of it in the context of digital music: CD, and more recently digital files. It existed before digital, but it was more of a skirmish until digital formats entered the battlefield. The loudness war is what you get when records are being made to sound as loud as possible on digital formats and low-quality speakers, even if that takes all the dynamics out of the performance. And while vinyl is an analog medium, not a digital one, that doesn't mean it can't be collateral damage. In a fascinating post,Jeff from Magic of Analog, Vinyl, Digital and Spatial Soundsets out the issue: some vinyl releases have been made from master copies that were created for a digital release, and that can be a problem. Making vinyl records is as much of an art as a science, and there are physical limits to what you can do – so for example, if the bass is boosted too much in the recording, when that translates into the etching on the record, the needle can move so much it bounces out of the groove on some turntables, particularly cheaper ones. With digital, that's not a problem, so when the song's being mastered the bass can turned way up – and that's fine… unless you then use that digital master to make the vinyl version. The key weapon in the loudness war is compression, which reduces the dynamic range of music. Dynamic range is the distance between the loudest bits and the quiet bits, and it's what makes music breathe; artists use dynamics to make their music more involving. To paraphrase Spinal Tap, if everything's turned up to 10, where do you go from there? Compression can turn it up to eleven and keep it there. Used judiciously, compression can make a song sound better, and more punchy. But too much of it can create a wall of volume, and that's something you hear every day: it's why ads on TV are so loud, because they're heavily compressed so they'll get your attention. In music, if you overcook things too much you getCalifornication. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers releasedCalifornicationin 1999, it sounded dreadful – and the band will almost admit that now. \"When it comes on the radio you want it to be the loudest thing that comes on,\" drummer Chad Smith told SiriusXM about the \"too hot\" mastering. Producer Rick Rubin got mastering expert Vlado Mello to achieve exactly that. The resulting album was indeed the loudest thing that came on the radio. But it also sounded distorted. \"Audiophiles were getting upset about it,\" Smith admitted. Audiophiles were right to be. What's mastered to sound massive on a cheap radio (or in a more modern sense, on tinny laptop or smartphone speakers) is not being mastered to sound good on a McIntosh system or even something as good as a pair ofAirPods Pro 2, and when you listen to it on decent kit it can be positively painful, tedious and tiring. There's a lot of music out there that's been given the loudness war treatment since its original release. Jeff uses Prince'sPurple Rainas an example, comparing the waveforms of the CD master with the 2015 remaster. The former looks like a song with lots of dynamics, and sounds that way too: it ebbs and flows like rainfall. The latter is like being thrown off Niagara Falls. Jeff says the same applies to some remastered records by Bruce Springsteen, David Gilmour, Norah Jones and others – although some genres such as jazz, blues and classical are pretty safe for loudness pacifists. What does this mean for vinyl buyers? The short answer is: it depends. There are some absolutely astonishing remasters out there – The Beatles' 2014 remasters are rightly regarded as masterpieces, pun fully intended – and remasters that are made specifically for vinyl are usually approached with respect rather than a desire to assault your eardrums unless, of course, that was the artists' intent. The ones to watch out for aren't the audiophile editions, the reverent restorations. They're the cynical cash-ins made from masters that were only ever destined for digital.

I’m pretty sure I got ASSOCIATED WITH COUNT DRACULA not because of Transylvania’s famous resident, but because I’ve been watching a lot ofWhat We Do In The Shadows. One of the greatest TV comedies of the past decade imho, about a group of four vampires who live in Staten Island. It’s wonderful. My favouriteWWDITScharacter is Colin Robinson, an energy vampire, who prefers to drain mental energy from his victims rather than blood – making him far more believable than the regular type of vampire. We all know someone like Colin. Having said that, doing a daily column about Connections is exactly the kind of job Colin Robinson would do. Er… How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "I tested two mid-range Dolby Atmos soundbars side-by-side, and the battle for your money has never been more competitive",
    "article_text": "Sonos vs Sony When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Soundbars are an effective way of boosting your TV’s built-in sound, as the built-in speakers even on thebest TVscan’t match the quality of their picture. TheSonos Beam (Gen 2) is one of thebest soundbarson the market, delivering punchy, immersive performance across movies and music at a mid-range price. The mid-range soundbar market is extremely competitive, with various brands offering alternatives to theSonosBeam. One such brand isSony. I recently got to test theSony Bravia Theater Bar 6, a 3.1.2 channel soundbar, side-by-side with the Sonos Beam. The Theater 6 comes with a subwoofer in-box, something that isn't the case for the Sonos Beam (though it does have effective bass for an all-in-one soundbar). How would these two similarly priced soundbars fare against one another? I hooked them up to thePanasonicMZ1500, a brilliantOLEDTV, and used some reference4KBlu-rays to test that out. A quick note first: the Sony Theater 6 is a better value in the UK. The Sonos Beam (Gen 2) is priced at $449 / £449 / AU$799, and the Sony Bravia Theater 6 is priced at $649 / £499 / (roughly AU$1,000 converted from US price), meaning you’re getting a closer price match in the UK. The Beam could be seen as having one big obstacle to overcome out-of-the-box: no included subwoofer. For that reason, you’d think it would have significantly weaker bass compared to the Bravia Theater 6, but that didn’t exactly turn out to be the case. Watching a chase scene fromThe Batman, the Beam delivered punchy, weighty bass for a compact soundbar, perfectly capturing the rumble of the Batmobile’s roaring engine. The same was true watchingTop Gun: Maverick, as the ignition of the Darkstar jet’s engine in the Mach 10 scene was impactful. Speech clarity was another area where the Beam performed well despite its size. Watching various musical performances fromA Complete Unknown(the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet), vocals were delivered precisely without sacrificing other elements in the mix. InWicked, Elphaba’s soaring, powerful vocals in the ‘Defying Gravity’ scene were delivered accurately through the Beam. I also found myself preferring the Beam over the Bar 6 when it came to the music sequences inA Complete Unknown. The Beam’s sound connected to the action on screen as well, accurately placing effects such as screeching tyres and careering cars inThe Batman, and the jets inTop Gun: Maverick. The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 external subwoofer gives it one big advantage over the Sonos Beam. Although the Beam is great for its size, it cannot compete with Bar 6 when it comes to bass. Sony’s mammoth sub means the Bar 6’s bass is room-filling and delivers plenty of heft. Watching the same scene fromThe Batman, the rumble of the Batmobile’s engine was more powerful and engaging than what the Beam could muster – I even had to turn the bass level down. Bass was also tightly controlled and nuanced. For sheer sound power, the Bar 6 was the winner in this contest. With two height speakers positioned on the soundbar, the Bar 6 does a better job of delivering height effects than the Beam. The sound of rain throughoutThe Batmanwas more prevalent, even during the Batmobile chase with its propulsive score and loud explosions. And in the Mach 10 scene fromTop Gun: Maverick,where the Darkstar jet flies over Admiral Cain, the trajectory of the jet was more accurately mapped by the Bar 6 than by the Beam. The Bar 6 soundbar is significantly wider than the Beam (37 inches / 950mm to the Beam’s 25 inches / 651mm), which gives it a wider soundstage. During the defying gravity scene inWicked, the winds and direction of sound felt more immersive on the Bar 6 as Elphaba took flight on her broom, although the Beam also did a credible job here. And activating the Sound Field mode on the Bar 6 made the sound even more immersive. During the musical performances inA Complete Unknown, the Bar 6 delivered a fuller, more spacious sound than the Beam. For instance, as Dylan and Joan Baez played at the Newport Folk Festival, the applauding crowd sounded clearer on the Bar 6, and the vocals and guitars had a more sprawling, expansive quality. Both the Beam and the Bar 6 are great examples of how effectively mid-range soundbars can improve a TV’s sound, and both have their unique strengths. The Beam shines with music-related content and has an impressive soundstage and bass considering its size. But the Bar 6 with its included subwoofer has the more powerful bass, a wider soundstage thanks to its wider size, and upfiring speakers that deliver more accurate height effects than the Beam. Which soundbar is ultimately better will depend on your circumstances. If you have a smaller space, the Beam will be more than enough. But if you have a medium-sized room and are looking for more powerful, spacious sound, the Bar 6 is the way to go. If you’re in the US, it will be tough to ignore the $200 price gap between the two. The Beam arguably delivers better bang for your buck in that case, but in the UK, it’s a much closer contest. Since I’m in the UK, I’d choose the Bar 6 over the Beam, but the latter is a fantastic example of what an all-in-one soundbar can do. In the end, you’re spoilt for choice with these two great soundbars. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. James is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

    "title": "iPhone release date schedule could be set for a big shakeup – here's what we know",
    "article_text": "Breaking with tradition When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For many years now, we've got used toApplelaunching itsbest iPhonesall together every September – most recently theiPhone 16series – but if a new report is to be believed, that scheduling could be set for a major shakeup in the years to come. According toThe Information(viaMacRumors), Apple is planning to stick to September releases for the Pro and Pro Max models, while shifting the other iPhones to springtime in the US (so presumably around March time). The idea is that splitting up the iPhone launches like this will \"rejuvenate long-stagnant sales\", the report from The Information says. There also seems to be some uncertainty over how well the upcoming, ultra-thiniPhone 17 Airis going to sell. It seems these changes aren't planned for this year, but will instead be put into place next year – with the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone 18 Air launching in September 2026, and the standardiPhone 18and quite possibly the iPhone 18e then arriving in March 2027. The Information acknowledges there are risks involved in shaking up this long-established schedule. However, it's thought that it'll persuade consumers to upgrade more regularly, while also easing the production pressure on Apple's manufacturing partners. Another reason for the switch: to make room for thefoldable iPhone, expected sometime in 2026. Pushing the less expensive iPhones to a launch window earlier in the year will mean more production capacity for a new model. None of this is confirmed yet, of course: we'll have to wait and see what Apple does in the months ahead. It's possible that Apple itself hasn't fully decided whether or not to try and mix up its release schedule in 2026 and 2027. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. If the company does go through with it, it's going to be a substantial shift in the annual phone launch calendar. We've already seenSamsungandGooglemove their flagship phone launches to earlier in the year – and it's possible that these moves are part of the reason Apple is thinking about a revamp of its own.

    "title": "No, this is not the PS5 gaming console, but rather a mini PC that supports a 120W GeForce RTX 5060 GPU",
    "article_text": "Minisforum's G1 / G1 Pro packs real desktop power When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the recent Japan IT Week Spring event, Chinesemini PCmaker Minisforum unveiled two exciting new systems: the MS-A2, which is a superfastAMDRyzen 9 9955HX CPU powered follow-up to theMS-A1micro workstation(but really the spiritual successor to theMS-01), and the G1 / G1 Pro gaming mini PC. It’s fair to say the latter takes more than a few design cues from theSonyPlayStation 5, with a vertically oriented white chassis and a center-mounted black I/O strip that closely mimics the PS5's iconic silhouette. Spotted byPC Watch, the G1 / G1 Pro is Minisforum’s latest living-room-friendly system aimed at gamers who want desktop-level power in a console-style form factor. The slim, upright unit - reportedly scheduled for release in the third quarter of 2025 - is the direct successor to Minisforum’s AtomMan G7 Ti. The standout feature of the new mini PC is support for a desktop-class GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card (up to 120W), installed using a low-profile, dual-slot configuration. Minisforum says users will eventually be able to upgrade the GPU themselves. Inside, the system is powered by AMD's Ryzen 9 8945HX processor, making it well-suited for demanding gaming workloads - or other creative tasks, if you like the look of the PS5 but aren’t that into gaming. Storage support includes up to two M.2 SSDs, and there's a built-in 350W power supply to help reduce cable clutter in a media center setup. Despite its compact size (216 x 315 x 57.2mm), the G1 series offers two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports, three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, HDMI 2.1, two DisplayPort 1.2 outputs, 5 Gigabit Ethernet, and audio I/O jacks. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! By combining console-style design with true gaming hardware, Minisforum aims to deliver a compact alternative to traditional towers without compromising performance or upgradeability. Pricing and global availability have yet to be announced but, as with the MS-A2, more details are expected soon. Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "Apple might be blowing over a billion dollars a year but I think The Studio is worth every penny",
    "article_text": "Apple Studios seems dedicated to making quality entertainment, no matter the cost When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Studio, streaming now onApple TV+, seeks to answer one central question: Can you make great art and still make a billion dollars doing it? And in case you were wondering, the answer is no, but we’re going to have a lot of fun along the way! The Studiofollows the daily trials and tribulations of Matt Remick, played by Seth Rogen, who lands his dream job as head of Continental Studios, a movie studio whose job is to make 'movies' not 'films', you know, the sort of movies that make a lot of money at the box office, but aren’t necessarily going to win an Academy Award. I got into all of this cause I love movies. Now I have this fear that my job is to ruin them The problem is that Remick is a film devotee who dreams of making great films, the sorts of films that mean something to people. The kind of films that are actually shot on film. Unfortunately, his efforts get thwarted at every step, normally by his own cowardice and eagerness to abandon all his principles in order to keep his job, often with hilarious results. What follows, over ten immaculately-crafted and performed episodes, is an ensemble comedic performance worthy of every award going. Think of the great workplace-based comedies likeThe OfficeorParks and Recreation, but put them into the world of LA hotels, parties and movie sets dripping in all the luxury and celebrities that only Hollywood can provide. And that's not to mention the supporting cast that casually throws acting giants like Kathryn Hahn and Bryan Cranston into the mix. Many of the celebrities and movie directors here are playing themselves, so many in fact that thecameo list(courtesy of Collider) is longer than the cast list on most feature films. We get treated to appearances by Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Zack Snyder, Charlize Theron and more all playing exaggerated versions of themselves. In fact, there are so many celebrities in each episode that some of them, like Ben Stiller, just appear in the background and aren’t even part of the plot. But it’s not just thatThe Studiohas some of the sharpest satirical writing you’ll find in any TV show, it’s made in such a captivating way. Long, single-camera shots are used almost all the time with whip pans across the screen at dizzying speed putting you right in the conversation, which is further fueled by a jazz drumming accompaniment that feels improvised, as if the drummer was playing live while the actors riff their lines back and forth at each other. The drumming often reflects the mood of the scene, starting slow and building to a crescendo, then tense and tight when it needs to be before signaling a sudden breezy change of atmosphere when a key plot point is resolved. The one moment when you realize thatThe Studioisn’t just anotherAppleTV+ show on one of thebest streaming services, but is something genuinely special is halfway through episode one when Remick is trying to find a director for his ridiculous Kool Aid movie. Martin Scorsese actually appears, playing himself, pitching his movie script to Remick, who despite being handed the gift of one of the world’s all-time great directors wanting to actually direct his ridiculously dumb movie, then goes on to fumble the ball spectacularly with hilarious results. There are so many other great set pieces that you’re guaranteed at least one genuinely unbelievable moment in each episode, but I don’t want to spoil the fun. Let me just say that the burrito incident sticks out in my mind in particular. When you consider how much money Apple TV+ is losing a year (current estimates are around the $1 billion dollars mark) to make TV like this, I wonder if we’ll look back at 2025 as a high point in ridiculously good streaming shows and if we’ll ever see their like again, becauseThe Studiois up there with thebest Apple TV+ shows.

    "article_text": "George Simion, a critic of the EU who has been banned from entering Ukraine, won the first round of the rerun of the Romanian presidential election on Sunday. With more than 95% of the ballots counted, Simion, the leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), received 40.52% of the votes, according to the news websiteG4 Media. Former senator Crin Antonescu and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, both known for pro-EU views, each received a little over 20% of the votes. “This is not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country,”Simion said, according to Reuters. The vote took place after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the election held in November, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu received 23% of the votes. The court cited“irregularities”in Georgescu’s campaign, as well as intelligence reports claiming Russian meddling. Moscow rejected the claims of interference as“anti-Russia hysteria.” In March, Georgescu was barred by the Central Electoral Bureau from running again, citing his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”stance, as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures. On Sunday, Georgescu and Simion arrived at a polling station together.“We are here with a single mission: to restore constitutional order and democracy,”Simion told reporters. In November 2024, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that Simion had been blacklisted for his“systematic anti-Ukrainian activities, which contradict the national interests of Ukraine and violate its state sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Simion argued that he was targeted because of his“promotion of historical truth”among the Romanian minority in western Ukraine. He was also banned from entering neighboring Moldova, which he labeled“an artificial country”that“will never join the European Union.” Simion has opposed the delivery of weapons to Kiev.“We will not send military aid to Ukraine, and that doesn’t make us pro-Russian,”he told reporters last year. He also criticized EU bureaucrats.“The EU is a remarkable project that brought peace to Europe after centuries of war, but Brussels has become a greedy and corrupt bubble,”Simion said.",

    "title": "Lavrov speaks with Pakistan on India tensions",
    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has discussed the escalation of tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Lavrov expressed Moscow’s willingness to support peaceful efforts to ease the tensions.“The Russian side emphasized its readiness to assist in the political resolution of the situation that arose after the April 22 terrorist attack in the Pahalgam area, if there is mutual interest from Islamabad and New Delhi,”the ministry said. The statement added that the call took place at Pakistan’s request. On Saturday, Lavrovspoke to his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar. According to a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov urged“a settlement of disagreements between New Delhi and Islamabad by political and diplomatic means”on a bilateral basis in accordance with the provisions of the 1972 Simla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration, which are historical frameworks under which the two South Asian countries previously agreed to resolve disputes diplomatically. According to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, during the call Dar rejected India’s“baseless allegations and inflammatory rhetoric against Pakistan” and condemned New Delhi’s “illegal move” to hold the water treaty in abeyance.” The nuclear-armed neighbors have witnessed a sharp nosedive in already strained ties after a terrorist attack in southern Kashmir left 26 civilians dead. The terrorist attack occurred in the Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam in India’s Jammu and Kashmir union territory on April 22. Following the attack, India took a series of measures against the neighboring country, including expelling some Pakistani diplomats, cancelling visas of Pakistani citizens, and closing the land border. It also suspended parts of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty that governs water sharing with Pakistan. On Saturday, New Delhi announced a set of further measures aimed at downgrading already severed trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan has responded with its own countermeasures and warned of further escalation. Islamabad last week claimed that it has“credible intelligence”that India intends to launch military action against it, and has said it is prepared to respond. The two countries have reportedly exchanged gunfire for ten consecutive nights along the Line of Control in Kashmir. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militant group allegedly behind the Kashmir attack, reiterating its long-standing claim that Islamabad supports cross-border terrorism and uses terrorism as a tool. Islamabad has denied India’s claims. Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif has claimed that his country itself was a victim of terrorism in the region stemming from the policies of Western governments, particularly the US, tracing back decades, starting with the Soviet-Afghanistan war in the late 1980s. The minister admitted his country had previously done“dirty work”by“training and indoctrinating jihadists on behalf of the West.”He, however, called it a mistake and said Pakistan now bears the consequences of previous policies.",

    "title": "Trump speaks out on potential third term",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has ruled out running for office for a third term, suggesting he would like“a great Republican”to succeed him. The president made the remarks on Sunday in an interview with NBC News when asked about repeated suggestions he might seek reelection. Such a move would require a major overhaul of the US electoral system, given the presidential terms are limited to two only by the US Constitution. Trump claimed that while“many people”want him to run for office again, he will not seek reelection. He also appeared to question the nature of the restrictions on the number of terms. “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional, that they’re not allowing you to do it or anything else,”he said. The earlier remarks on the matter sparked fears that Trump could ultimately opt to rewire the whole US electoral system to try and stay in power. Multiple high-profile Republicans, however, have insisted the president was only joking about a third turn. The concerns were reinforced by the emergence of a new line of ‘TRUMP 2028’ merchandise on his official campaign store last month. The store offers baseball caps and T-shirts, featuring ‘TRUMP 2028’ and ‘Rewrite the Rules’ slogans. The US president appeared to distance himself from the merchandise despite its availability at his official store. “There are many people selling the 2028 hat, but this is not something I’m looking to do. I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody. Ideally, a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward. But I think we’re going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular,”he said. Asked about a potential successor, Trump said it was too early to endorse one. The US administration and the Republican Party have several prominent individuals to pick from, the president suggested. “I think [the party is] so strong, and I think we have tremendous people. I think we have a tremendous group of people. We talked about a number of them. You look at Marco. You look at J.D. Vance, who’s fantastic. You look at I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here,”he said.",

The following two years, the event was held online due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which was followed by a three-year hiatus amid tensions between the US and Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Aleksandr Kim, a representative of the Russian Embassy, stated that while the“situation has improved a little,[it]remains uneasy,”as evidenced by“attempts at provocation and other undesirable actions”during the latest Immortal Regiment event in the US capital, as quoted by RIA Novosti. Izvestia has published a video showing a group of pro-Ukraine activists confronting the marchers and chanting anti-Russian slogans. In Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, more than 200 people, both Russian nationals and locals, as well as Venezuelan, Cuban, and Serbian diplomats, also paid homage to Red Army veterans. Nearly 500 people took to the streets of Caracas, Venezuela as part of an Immortal Regiment rally, too. Similar scenes played out in Istanbul, Türkiye, as well as several Italian cities, including Rome and Naples, over the weekend. The Immortal Regiment is a large-scale event held in cities across Russia and other nations, in which people carry portraits of their relatives who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II. The idea was first conceived in the Russian city of Tomsk in 2012, and has since gained in popularity.",

    "title": "The empire returns: The new global order for the new world",
    "article_text": "Changes in the modern world suggest that the imperial order may not be so morally obsolete after all. Empires could return to world politics – not only as dark shadows of the past. ‘Empire’ may soon become a buzzword for discussing the direction in which the world’s political organization is heading. US President Donald Trump’s incessant talk of annexing Canada and Greenland to the US, the musings of Dutch politicians about splitting up Belgium – these are just the first sips of the great debate that will inevitably emerge as the order created in the second half of the 20th century unravels. This order, it should be remembered, was based on granting independence to as many peoples as possible. The US, which promoted this concept, always assumed it was much easier to subjugate small and weak countries economically than to deal with large territorial powers. The new ‘empire game’ is being launched by the West, while the rest of the world looks on – though not necessarily eager to join in. As always, Russia – whose supposed intent to restore an empire is a favorite thesis of US and European military propaganda – has acted with restraint, especially in relation to countries of the former Soviet Union. Russian observers, of course, have their own ideas when neighboring states look fragile or hostile powers try to exploit their territory to harm Russia. In academic and popular literature, the concept of ‘empire’ is among the most compromised – largely thanks to American authors. In the popular imagination, it is associated either with the ancient world or with the era when aging European empires, including Russia, sought to impose their will on the rest of humanity. Ultimately, this culminated in World War I (1914-18), in which virtually every empire perished – physically or politically. Later, the US, which had rejected imperialism, and Russia, reborn as the USSR, rose to global prominence. They soon began calling each other empires, reinforcing the term’s negative connotation. Even today, using the word ‘empire’ as a strategic foreign policy goal is considered the domain of political outliers. This is especially true because friendly nations in the Global South that are aligned with Russia view empires with deep suspicion. To them, empires represent European colonizers who brought nothing but plunder, followed by neocolonial domination through bribed elites and exploitative economic deals. In this respect, Russia was never an empire in the European sense of the word. Its core principle was the integration of local elites into the Russian state and the development of new territories. A striking indicator is the demographic statistics of Central Asia since its incorporation into Russia, especially during its time in the USSR. There is reason to believe that the current demographic boom in the five republics of the region is still supported by the health and social policies of the 20th century. Whether that continues, as these countries gravitate towards a South Asian model with harsher climates, remains to be seen. Even now, the concept of empire remains mostly negative. However, in recent decades, it has increasingly been applied to the US, and occasionally, to Europe. The ‘American empire’ has become a staple in public debate, referring to Washington’s ability to enlist many countries in its foreign policy ventures. As for Europe, it’s mostly rhetorical. While Western European powers maintain some influence over their former colonies, it can hardly be called imperial. Talk of the EU as an empire quickly turns into satire. A“blooming garden”may sound nice, but an empire – with its sense of unchallenged might and unchecked expansion – is something modern the bloc is ill-equipped to embody. Yet there are now signs that empires may return to world politics – not just as echoes of the past. First, in a functional sense: As a way of organizing security and development in a chaotic world, both for the empire’s own people (Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ springs to mind) and for other nations under its wing. These discussions are becoming inevitable as old frameworks collapse and crises grow – whether we like it or not. In the West, this discussion uses different language than history books do. But the idea is the same: Improve conditions at home by extending control abroad. Traditional economic partnerships no longer suffice. The competition from other great powers is too fierce. Trump often warns that if the US doesn’t take Canada or Greenland, China or Russia will. Russia, of course, has no such plans. But it’s becoming axiomatic that direct administrative control is seen as essential for future security. There are good reasons for this, grounded in reality. International institutions are failing. The UN, hampered by Western sabotage, is becoming almost a symbolic organization. While Russia will continue to defend the UN’s role and international law – perhaps even successfully – the weakening of 20th-century institutions hasn’t led to credible replacements. BRICS is an impressive exception but does not aim to replace national governments in their core functions. The EU, an old-style institution, is slowly drifting towards disintegration. Other international bodies have no real means to compel members to meet obligations. As a result, the major powers propping up these institutions are left disillusioned. Even developments in science and tech fuel imperial discussions. While the author is no expert here, it’s clear that AI competition could lead to ‘digital empires’ –zones of dominance by tech giants from capable states. Another factor is the failure of some countries to maintain peace in their neighborhoods, reviving questions about whether imperial models are as obsolete as once thought. But empires are hugely expensive. Even Western empires paid dearly to maintain their reach – remember Kipling’s grim lines about British soldiers’ fate after retirement in the likes of ‘Tommy’ and ‘The Last of the Light Brigade’? That’s why Britain and France happily shed their empires mid-century. Russia later realized it didn’t need vast territories, contributing to the USSR’s collapse. Still, in places like Tbilisi, some locals quietly express nostalgia for being part of a great power’s multicultural elite. Another key obstacle is the contribution of new territories to the core state’s stability and prosperity. Russia isn’t trying to recreate an empire because it is now a different kind of state – combining imperial traits with principles unfamiliar to Europe, especially the equality of its citizens. True equality demands cultural cohesion, or at least a foundation for it. Russia and the USSR historically overextended this idea, often to their detriment. Today, Russia seeks new ways to ensure its neighbors’ security without harming its own interests. This article was first published byVzglyadnewspaper and was translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "No Ukraine in EU without Budapest’s approval – Orban",
    "article_text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky have clashed over Kiev’s prospects of joining the EU. Orban reminded the Ukrainian leader that Kiev has no chance of becoming part of the bloc without Budapest’s approval. The war of words started on Friday when Orban warned that Ukraine’s EU membership“would bankrupt the Hungarian economy,”describing Kiev’s potential accession as a“collective economic trap.” The Hungarian leader also criticized the EU’s goal of admitting Ukraine by 2030, a target recently reiterated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.“We know when they want to bring them in. It’s not some vague future; it’s here, knocking at our door,”he said.“Forget the fairy tales about when and how. They want to do it now, as fast as possible.” Zelensky responded by citing domestic polling in Hungary.“70% support Ukraine joining the EU. That means people in Hungary are with us,”Zelensky claimed. However, the poll conducted by the opposition Tisza Party to which Zelensky referred showed only 58% support. An earlier poll by the Hungarian newspaper Nepszava showed even lower figures, with 47% in favor and 46% against. Orban fired back at Zelensky on X, writing:“What the Hungarian people think is not decided by the president in Kiev or the bureaucrats in Brussels. There is no Ukrainian EU accession without Hungary. Every Hungarian will have their say on this. Whether you like it or not. That’s how we do things here.” All EU member states must unanimously approve any new country joining the bloc. Hungary has repeatedly cited widespread graft and minority rights issues as reasons to oppose Ukraine’s fast-track membership, with Orban at one point describing the nation as“one of the most corrupt countries in the world.” Ukraine, which has designated EU membership as a national priority, formally applied to join the bloc in February 2022, just days after the escalation of hostilities with Russia. Despite support from several EU members, the timeline for Ukraine’s membership remains uncertain. Brussels has cited the need for Kiev to undertake significant legal, political, and economic reforms.",

    "title": "Musk reacts to VIDEO of forced mobilization in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has drawn attention to a viral video showing Ukrainian military recruiters forcibly detaining a deliveryman in Lutsk, in the western part of the country. Kiev has pursued a violent mobilization campaign for months, often resulting in clashes between reluctant civilians and military personnel. On Saturday, a media user on X shared a video showing three Ukrainian soldiers approaching a man on a bicycle carrying a large yellow bag and wearing a vest, who appears to be a delivery worker. After a brief conversation, the soldiers attempt to drag him into a white van parked nearby, but he resists. Following a struggle, the recruitment officers manage to shove the man into the vehicle, which then drives off. The fate of the detainee is unknown. Reacting to the video, Musk posted“!!”on his social media platform. The X owner and close ally of US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on the Ukrainian leadership to sign a ceasefire with Russia to avoid further casualties. Last November, he also criticized reported calls by the US government for Ukraine to lower the minimum conscription age to 18, writing:“How many more need to die?” On Friday, another mobilization video from Lutsk surfaced on social media, with recruitment officers – potentially driving the same van as in the first clip – forcibly detaining a man riding a scooter. Ukraine announced a general mobilization following the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, barring most men 18 to 60 years old from leaving the country. In 2024, faced with manpower shortages and mounting losses, Kiev lowered the conscription age from 27 to 25, while introducing stricter penalties for draft evasion and tightening other mobilization rules. As the mobilization drive continues, numerous videos have emerged on social media showing Ukrainian officials trying to forcibly recruit reluctant civilians, often leading to violent clashes.",

    "article_text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is expected to attend Russia’s Victory Day celebrations, despite a recent health scare, Finance Minister and Deputy PM Sinisa Mali has said. The May 9 parade on Moscow’s Red Square will mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The Kremlin has invited a number of leaders from countries including Serbia, Slovakia, China, India, and Brazil. EU officials have warned member and candidate states against attending. On Friday, Vucic abruptly ended a trip to the US after experiencing chest pain during a meeting in Florida, reportedly caused by high blood pressure. He had planned to meet with the Serbian diaspora and US President Donald Trump, but returned to Belgrade and was admitted to the Military Medical Academy, according to local broadcaster RTS. Doctors said the president“cannot be expected to return to his regular activities for several days.” Speaking on Saturday, Mali said Vucic will likely follow through with the visit.“One thing I can say is, knowing him, considering that he is a man of his word, he gave his word that he would be there, I assume that he will keep his word. But I cannot tell you that at this moment.”Vucic was discharged from the hospital on Saturday. The Military Medical Academy confirmed that the president underwent cardiovascular and hematological diagnostics and is now in stable condition. Doctors ordered him to rest, and he has canceled all activities and obligations for the next few days. Among the EU leaders invited to the event were Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Slovak counterpart, Robert Fico. Hungary declined the invitation, stating that the end of World War II represented“a bitter defeat”due to the country’s alliance with Nazi Germany. Fico has confirmed his attendance. During a meeting with Vucic last month, EC Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos reportedly cautioned that his attendance would be held against Serbia’s EU bid. Despite the pressure, Vucic said he had not changed his decision to attend the event, where a unit of the Serbian Armed Forces will also take part. Russian President Vladimir Putin praised those who accepted the invitation, calling them courageous for attending despite pressure from Brussels.",

    "title": "Romanian presidential election rerun kicks off",
    "article_text": "Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election on Sunday after the previous vote was annulled on grounds of alleged Russian interference and electoral violations. Moscow has denied all claims of interference. The annulled election in late November saw independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, known for his NATO-sceptic stance, unexpectedly prevail in the first round with 23% of the vote. However, the Constitutional Court later invalidated the results, citing electoral“irregularities.”The country’s officials claimed that the candidate’s campaign had utilized undeclared funds, and that Russia was behind“hybrid”attacks, including in the cyber realm. In March, Georgescu was barred by the Central Electoral Bureau from running again, citing his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”stance as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures. In the current election, a total of 11 candidates are competing for the presidential post. The key contenders include George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), who is known for his opposition to the EU, and criticism of military support to Ukraine. He is leading the polls with approximately 30% support. Other prominent candidates include Crin Antonescu, representing the governing Social-Democrat and National Liberal coalition, and Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, both of whom support pro-EU agendas. If no candidate wins an absolute majority, a run-off between the two leading candidates will be held on May 18. Ahead of the rerun, meanwhile, Romanian detained RT journalist Chay Bowes, who had traveled to Bucharest from Dublin, Ireland, to cover the election. According to the reporter, he was presented with a paper – of which he was not given a copy – alleging that he was“a threat to the security of the state”and therefore should be deported. Bowes, a EU citizen, has insisted that he entered Romania“completely legally… to do [his] job.” Commenting on the detention, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the Romanian election had turned into a“meme.”She added that“the situation around the election in Romania is so scandalous. It’s so dead-ended and it discredits the level of that pseudo democracy in Romania.”",

    "title": "Israel warns of retaliation after Houthi strike on airport: As it happened",
    "article_text": "Israel’s main airport was struck by a ballistic missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Sunday morning. The missile hit a grove near an access road inside the perimeter of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. Media reports suggest that at least six people were wounded. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it failed to intercept the missile despite several attempts.“An impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport,”the IDF said in a post on Telegram. The Israeli Air Force is investigating the failure. The Houthis, who control western Yemen, including the capital and the port of Hodeidah, have launched a number of drones and missiles at commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea and at targets in Israel over the past year, aiming to pressure West Jerusalem over its military operation in Gaza. Israel launched the campaign following a deadly raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023. The Houthis said they would stop the attacks if Israel halts its operation in Gaza. Israel has not launched strikes against Yemen in response to the Houthi attacks. The US, however, began air and naval strikes against Houthi targets in March, citing threats to Red Sea shipping. Last week, US President Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to intensify strikes in Yemen and warned that the Houthis would be“completely annihilated”if they continued their attacks. The UK has also taken part in the strikes, with the Defense Ministry saying it targeted a Houthi-controlled facility. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accused Iran of arming the Houthis and warned there would be consequences. Tehran denied the claims. The US, however, announced sweeping sanctions on countries buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals on Thursday, citing Tehran’s alleged role in fueling conflict in the Middle East, among other things. Russia has urged Washington to halt its strikes on Yemen. In a phone call in March with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for an immediate end to the use of force and urged all sides to engage in political dialogue.",

    "title": "US plans to end International Space Station before 2030",
    "article_text": "The US government has confirmed it will begin winding down operations on the International Space Station (ISS), with the goal of retiring the orbiting lab by 2030. The decision is included in the White House’s Fiscal Year 2026 Discretionary Budget Request released on Friday. NASA first detailed the plan to decommission the ISS in December 2021. This was reiterated in follow-up documents published in early 2022. According to the new document,“The Budget reflects the upcoming transition to a more cost-effective commercial approach to human activities in space as the space station approaches the end of its life cycle.” The 2026 budget request would allocate around $18.6 billion to NASA, down from $24.9 billion in fiscal year 2024, with deep cuts to science programs. The Trump administration stated that crewed and cargo missions to the ISS would be significantly reduced during the transition period. Remaining onboard research will focus on long-duration spaceflight studies crucial to upcoming Moon and Mars missions – efforts that are strongly backed by US President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. NASA is expected to rely more heavily on the private sector to maintain a US presence in low Earth orbit. The budget request says the agency will replace the ISS with“commercial space stations,”which will gradually take over operations previously handled by the aging government-owned facility. The ISS was launched in 1998 as a joint effort involving the US, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, and other countries. The project began with the launch of Russia’s Zarya module in November 1998, followed by NASA’s Unity module delivered by the Space Shuttle Endeavour in December that year. Since then, the ISS has hosted astronauts from over a dozen nations and supported thousands of science experiments. Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, previously raised doubts about extending ISS operations until 2030. In July 2022, then-Roscosmos head Yury Borisov announced that Russia would leave the ISS program after 2024 and begin building its own Russian Orbital Station (ROS). In 2024, Borisov approved a master schedule for constructing the ROS through 2033, though he later clarified that Russia’s exact exit date would depend on the condition of the ISS.",

    "title": "Mexico rejects Trump’s troops offer",
    "article_text": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has rejected US President Donald Trump’s offer to deploy troops to fight the drug cartels. She insisted that while Mexico is open to cooperation, it will never accept“subordination”to Washington. Sheinbaum’s comments came after a Wall Street Journal report on Saturday claimed that Trump had pressured her to allow US military operations inside Mexico. The report focused on a mid-April phone call in which Trump reportedly pushed for troops to be deployed to combat fentanyl-smuggling cartels. According to sources, Sheinbaum rebuffed the idea, leading to a heated exchange. Speaking at a university opening on Saturday, Sheinbaum confirmed the report and outlined her position. “It is true… he said, ‘I propose that the US army enter to help.’ And you know what I told him? No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, our sovereignty is inalienable, our sovereignty is not for sale!”she said. She added that if Trump wants to help, he should focus on stopping the flow of weapons from the US into Mexico. A statement from the White House on Saturday said Sheinbaum and Trump have worked closely“to achieve the most secure southwest border in history,”but did not address the reported offer of troops. “The president has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more to combat these gangs and cartels, and the US stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries,”the statement read. Trump has long accused Mexico of failing to prevent drug cartels from smuggling fentanyl into the US. During last year’s presidential campaign, he pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He later claimed that Mexico is“essentially run by the cartels,”and suggested that the US should“wage war”on them. In order to place pressure on the country, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all Mexican imports. They were later paused for goods covered under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, including food, medical devices, clothing, chemicals, and machinery. A separate 25% tariff on Mexican car imports remains in effect. In addition to tariffs, the US has sanctioned cartel members and affiliates. In February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to combat fentanyl smuggling and help stem illegal border crossings. That month, Mexico extradited 29 cartel suspects to the US.",

    "article_text": "The co-leader of the German Left party, Jan van Aken, has called for NATO to be replaced with a new security alliance involving both Russia and the United States, arguing that the US-led military bloc“has no future.” In an interview with Die Zeit published on Saturday, van Aken said the party continues to support its 2011 platform, which called for Germany to exit NATO and help create a new collective security system. “We never wanted to abolish NATO without replacement but rather replace it with a cooperative security system,”van Aken said when asked whether Germany and its European allies could defend themselves without US support. He proposed a new model similar to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), focusing on peacekeeping and joint defense. “Something like OECD 2.0. A peace and defense alliance, together with Russia and the US. But of course, if we were to rebuild it, it would certainly require another ten years of confidence-building measures. NATO would still exist that long, but it no longer has a future,”he stated. Van Aken also called for the withdrawal of US troops stationed in Germany.“Yes, and they should take their nuclear weapons with them,”he said, noting that the nuclear stockpiles in France and the UK are already“more than enough.” He confirmed that the vision of a demilitarized Europe remains central to the party’s agenda.“Of course I want to live in a country without an army. Don’t you?” Last month, Germany unveiled a new military aid package for Ukraine, including vehicles, air-defense rockets, and howitzers. Incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz has indicated support for supplying Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles capable of striking deep into Russian territory. The Social Democrats, who are holding coalition talks with Merz’s Christian Democrats, have opposed the move as a needless escalation. Moscow has warned that supplying the missiles would make Germany directly involved in the conflict, arguing that Ukrainian forces cannot operate the Taurus without the help of German personnel.",

Marvel movie Thunderbolts brought in US$162 million (S$210.3 million) at theatres around the world over the weekend, providing a solid start to the summer movie season that is key to Hollywood's year at the box office. Thunderbolts, the story of a ragtag group of heroes who unite to fight a supervillain, earned US$76 million of its total in the United States and Canada, distributor Walt Disney said on Sunday (May 4). The returns were in line with pre-weekend forecasts, though below the US$88.8 million North American opening of Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World in February. \"This is about what we've come to expect from Marvel movies in the recent marketplace,\" said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. It was a decent start, he said, for a movie with lesser-known characters that have played sidekicks in other Marvel stories. StarringFlorence Pughand Sebastian Stan, Thunderbolts sets the stage for Marvel's July release Fantastic Four and next summer's Avengers: Doomsday. \"This is a prelude to something much bigger,\" Bock said. Thunderbolts had a slow opening of US$10.4 million in China, where it was the first test of Chinese appetites for Hollywood films since authorities pledged to limit movie imports as part of a trade war with the Trump administration. The figures from the rest of the world were positive, Bock said, considering Thunderbolts doubled last year's dismal start to summer with The Fall Guy. Hollywood brings in about 40 per cent of the year's box office receipts during the summer season, which the industry measures from the first weekend in May through Labor Day in September. Theatres are still trying to climb back to pre-pandemic ticket sales levels. Through Sunday, year-to-date ticket sales in the United States and Canada were running 15 per cent above 2024 but 31.8 per cent below 2019. The summer of 2019 benefited from Avengers: Endgame, which had a record opening of US$357.1 million at domestic theatres. Thunderbolts had the strongest reviews for a Marvel Cinematic Universe film since 2021’s hit Spider-Man: No Way Home, said Andrew Cripps, head of global theatrical distribution at Disney. On the Rotten Tomatoes website, 88 per cent of critics and 94 per cent of moviegoers gave it positive marks. \"I think word of mouth will be really strong and people will continue to discover it,\" Cripps said of \"Thunderbolts.\" Also this weekend, spring smash Sinners finished the weekend in second place on North American charts behind Thunderbolts, collecting US$33 million and bringing its total to US$179.7 million. Family film A Minecraft Movie landed third with US$13.7 million. Its North American total reached US$398.2 million. The coming summer slate is filled with sequels including Jurassic World: Rebirth and Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning, plus a new Superman movie. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Singapore Obsessions Trending Style & Beauty Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Dining Travel Experiences Dining Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Women Women For Nasrin Shah Beevi, motherhood isn’t defined by biology. After fostering five children, she and her husband adopted one of their foster daughters, creating a forever family. Here’s how love led them on this extraordinary journey. Nasrin Shah Beevi with her adopted daughter. (Photo: CNA/Aik Chen) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When asked how many children they want, most married couples might say one, two, or perhaps none. But Nasrin Shah Beevi, 35, has raised six children – and she doesn’t plan to stop there. None of these children were born to her, however. They are her foster children, and have ranged from a baby to children in their tweens. Nasrin, who’s a counsellor, began herfostering journeyin 2021, two years after marrying her husband, Nizamudheen Ishak, 52, an IT manager. Though Nasrin loves all her foster children dearly, she knows that they are all only with her for a season. Placed in foster care due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or because their parents are unable to care for them due toincarceration, illness, or death, most of them return to their biological families once the situation stabilises – usually within a few months to a few years. But one girl stayed. Two years ago, around Mother’s Day, Nasrin received news that she could adopt Nur (not her real name), a spirited three-year-old girl she had been fostering. “I cried. It was like a Mother’s Day gift to me,” she recalled. In turns laughing and crying during our interview, Nasrin shares her incredible motherhood journey with CNA Women. Nasrin was first told about Nur through a phone call. Days later, she and her husband made their way to a respite house –short-term accommodation typically for children in crises or whose carers need a brief reprieve. Balloon and lollipop in hand, she met three-and-a-half-year-old Nur for the first time. The first thing that struck Nasrin was how small the child was. Part of this might have been genetic, but Nur also wasn’t well-fed as a baby and toddler, Nasrin said. “Nobody would believe she was three-and-a-half. They’d probably think she is barely two years old,” she remarked. From the beginning, Nasrin was told the child would be available for adoption. However, the social worker wanted to observe how the girl adjusted under Nasrin and Nizamudheen’s care. The young girl was playing with another child and refused to even look at her fosterers. Later, when she followed the two strangers home, she silently held Nasrin’s hand, not uttering a word. For the next few days, Nur did not speak to Nasrin, responding to questions with non-verbal sounds. She was slightly more communicative with Nizamudheen, but still very reserved. Nasrin had been told that Nur was more comfortable with men due to her history of neglect and abandonment, particularly with women. Nonetheless, she couldn’t help wondering if she was doing something wrong. Taking the rejection in her stride, Nasrin worked hard to win Nur’s trust, caring for the child and carving out time to give her undivided attention. Slowly but surely, the breakthrough came. Two weeks later, Nur began responding to Nasrin, and even called her “mummy” for the first time. “It was really beautiful when I was able to reach her, and she acknowledged my presence – embraced my existence,” Nasrin said. It’s hard to believe the six-year-old Nur today was the neglected, withdrawn child Nasrin met at respite care. Today, she is chatty, opinionated, bursting with energy, and full of life. “My cousins say that she’ll be a good lawyer. She tries to negotiate everything to the best of her ability,” Nasrin chuckled. “She’s bright, intelligent, sociable, happy and mischievous – everybody adores her.” Noticing the positive changes in Nur, the social worker initiated the adoption process. The day after Mother’s Day in 2023, Nasrin and her husband received the joyful news that they could legally adopt her. In October 2024, the adoption was finalised – and Nur officially became their daughter. The mother and daughter are very attached. “I’ve never received this much love and attention from a child,” Nasrin said, choking up with tears. “She jumps on you, cuddles you, hugs you and kisses you. Even though we don’t share blood ties, she loves us so much. It’s really beautiful,” Nasrin added. “Every night, before we go to bed, we hug and kiss.” The family enjoyscycling,reading, doing craft activities and travelling together. “Every day is a precious memory,” Nasrin said. Insights from PPIS Oasis, a fostering agency appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. About foster children Eligibility criteria How to apply Support for foster parents Watching Nur blossom has been a magical experience for Nasrin. It has also convinced her that a loving family can transform the life of a vulnerable child. Nasrin told CNA Women that she has been drawn to fostering since she began working as a counsellor at a social service agency in her twenties, where she worked with many vulnerable children. Her husband, an active volunteer working with offenders and ex-offenders, is also passionate about helping those in need. Hence, shortly after their marriage, the couple agreed to start their fostering journey, regardless of whether they have biological children. “We didn’t put pressure on each other to have a biological child. We will let nature take its course,” she said. After adopting Nur, the couple, at Nur’s request, also fostered a 13-month-old baby for a few months. Nur had been wishing for a little sister. This was the first baby Nasrin has fostered – her other foster children were between four and 10 years old. While Nasrin bonded with the baby and found the experience meaningful, Nur had a harder time adjusting. The baby demanded much of Nasrin’s attention, and Nur missed the one-on-one time they used to share. She also struggled withmum guilt. Hence, the couple have decided to hold off fostering for now, and instead offer short-term respite care lasting a few days to children in need. They hope to continue fostering in a couple of years when Nur is ready and Nasrin has the bandwidth. “We felt that with Nur’s transition from foster to adopted child, it may be too soon for her to be an older sister. Hopefully, in a couple of years, when Nur is more mature, we will engage her in the decision-making (on whether to foster again),” Nasrin said. Reflecting on the importance of stepping up to provide a temporary home and family for children in need, Nasrin poignantly recalled her first foster child, a four-year-old, in 2020. “I will never be able to forget this experience. The social worker brought him from the hospital, so he was wearing hospital clothes and didn’t have any home clothes. “After we signed the fostering agreement, my husband and I brought him to a mall to get new clothes. He was a very fair-skinned boy and looked very different from us. As my husband and I held his hands, the public’s eye was on us. I wondered how the child felt,” she added, tears welling in her eyes. One challenge of fostering is that the children come from diverse backgrounds. Every child is different, and depending on their age, are going through different transitions, Nasrin said. Another challenge is that no matter how much you love the child, he or she will usually leave you in time, she said. “Right from the start, I knew the fostering journey could end abruptly. It was what I had signed up for,” she said. Even with adopted children, this may be the case, Nasrin added. As her adopted daughter grows older and begins asking questions about her biological mother, Nasrin is ready to support her if she ever decides to search for and return to her birth parents, she said. “If that is her decision, we will walk the journey with her,” she said resolutely. For Nasrin, it doesn’t matter whether they came from her womb or through foster care – she loves her adopted daughter and foster children as her own. She said she would have adopted her other foster kids if reunification with their biological families hadn’t been possible. \"My husband once told the social worker that he wants to take a family photo with all our foster children and hang it on the wall one day,\" Nasrin said, her voice full of warmth. This unconventional family tree is a dream Nasrin holds close to her heart as well. CNA Womenis a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

    "title": "Work It Podcast: What should you do with a retrenchment payout?",
    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts When she was laid off, Lily Fung got a six-figure payout. Find out how she put that money to good use. Looking for a job or trying to nail it at your current one? Host Tiffany Ang and career counsellor Gerald Tan help navigate your important - and sometimes thorny - work life questions. Some companies offer a “golden handshake” when they retrench their workers. Financial advisory manager Lily Fung, who got a high six-figure sum, shares with Tiffany Ang and Gerald Tan what she did with the money after she was laid off from her company of 20 years. Here's an excerpt from the conversation: Tiffany Ang:You had this high six-figure sum (retrenchment payout) right? Did you need so much money to study, get (certified) in financial advisory? What else did you do with the money that you had?Lily Fung, financial advisory manager: Tiffany:That can be quite risky, isn't it? Lily:Oh, because I know where to place my risk. So I actually diversified my portfolio quite well. And in fact, this lump sum was strategised towards capital preservation, more than anything else. But the whole intention of that was to generate passive income because I wanted this lump sum money that I have worked so hard, and is my sweat and blood in it ... and my youth in it. So I wanted that lump sum to work harder for me. So that's where I decided I'm not going to place it in the bank and just have the comfort that I have that money. So just in case my financial advisory business fails, then I can go back to this lump sum, right? So to me, I think one thing is about mindset ... I have gone through so many business cycles. I led the organisation through success every time there is a crisis. So I told myself, I cannot fail, even if I move on to financial advisory. Gerald Tan, host:I'm just thinking, there are three groups of people, the way they use their retrenchment money. The first group of people who take their golden handshake and they spend it very quickly away, maybe without much thought, maybe not the most useful manner, right? Then there's the middle group of people who, I think the majority, they use it to do something for their careers. They transit, maybe use it to manage some of their loans. And then we have people like Lily, who had been planning their careers, their finances, all the while and then right now, at this point, they are just using the golden handshake as to open up more options for them in the future. Tiffany:Was there any point of time at the start where you felt that there were possible financial risks that you were going to undertake? Were there fears that you felt at that point of time? Lily:Definitely, there were fears for sure. When I made that bold leap of faith, right? It was scary. Why scary? It is really because for the past 26 years, I have always been in a structured corporate environment, so having to tell myself that, hey, I'm going to get out of my comfort zone. I'm going to start all over in a new role, self- employed, totally going into the uncertainties of self employment, it was really scary. My heart was like beating super fast. But then again, I guess different stage of life, right? I just have to close my eyes, do my best, every month I get my paycheck. Listen to more episodeshere.

    "title": "Grace Wales Bonner Took Over the Guggenheim for a Wildly Stylish Pre-Met Bash",
    "article_text": "“I want to be able to celebrate with people,” saidGrace Wales Bonner. “I feel like sometimes doing a fashion show, it's quite a small group of people that can experience that. And I want to open up and allow people to interact with intentionality.” On Saturday evening, the London-based fashion designer was in the auditorium at the Guggenheim, where she was hosting “Togetherness,” the second edition of a traveling concert starring a lineup of artists whose sounds resonate with her vision of elegant Afro-Atlantic menswear. Wales Bonner’s desire to expand the world of her brand isn’t theoretical: Unlike an exclusive runway show or any number of the fashion parties that have sprung up ahead of Monday’s Met Gala, Togetherness was open to the public. Tickets to the event—featuring performances by South African acapella group The Joy, fashion world-favorite DJ and producer Acyde, Lagos highlife band The Cavemen, American-Ghanian R&B superstar Amaarae, and skater-rapper Sage Elsesser, a.k.a. Navy Blue—quickly sold out. The designer has a lot to celebrate. A decade after its founding, Wales Bonner is one of the most culturally influential menswear brands in fashion. Led by Wales Bonner’s confident spirit of collaboration across music, art, and sportswear (herAdidas collectionremains a massively successful contemporary style touchstone), the luxury label is firmly grounded in a flourishing creative community who inspire Wales Bonner, and who are in turn inspired by her. The impact of her work is evident in this year’s Metropolitan Museum of Artexhibition“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which includesseveral Wales Bonner looks. “I’m excited for Monday!” said Wales Bonner, who will be making her first appearance at the Met Gala, where she’s also set to dress a number of A-list attendees, a process she called “very enriching.” But first, she was eager for her own bash to get underway. Music, she said, “underlies a lot of what I do.” Togetherness first debuted last June in Paris. “Being able to have it travel to different cities is really, really exciting for me, because it's been something that's been in my head for a long time,” she said of the concept, which she conceived as a way to introduce her favorite performers (some familiar, many not) in unorthodox venues. “I'm really excited about people that break the boundaries of what they're doing, or have lots of different influences that can be felt within the music.” Shortly after 8 p.m., the rotunda was already filling up as guests snaked their way up the spiral ramp to take in “Rashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” the Chicago artist’s epic survey of painting, sculpture, and performance. Wales Bonner herself is a multidisciplinary thinker—she and Johnson have stayed in touch ever since the designer included his work in a show she curated for the Serpentine Gallery in London. “To be around this incredible artwork is really a special moment,” she said. “Togetherness is also about seeing artists in different contexts, so it was really aligned.” The festival atmosphere steadily increased as Sir Rashad Ringo Smith, the OG hip-hop DJ, spun through a set in the rotunda. Though Wales Bonner described herself as more of a “good listener” than a performer herself, she frequently collaborates with musicians on custom show soundtracks, from Kendrick Lamar to the young composer Duval Timothy. “It's quite natural, these kinds of friendships and relationships that work around and support and enhance or inspire what I do,” she said. “So [Togetherness] feels like a natural extension of that kind of relationship, which is symbiotic.” Wales Bonner’s plan is to bring Togetherness to different cities in the near future. The fashion set in attendance seemed to unanimously agree that it was the best party of all the pre-Met festivities. Where else could you see a Rashid Johnson show before roaming from an Acyde set to a Cavemen concert, all within an unparalleled aesthetic temple? But the night’s main attraction, arguably, was the diverse and supremely stylish audience.

    "title": "One-Shot Scenes in Film and TV, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "Pride of place in the filmmaker's toolkit is the one-shot sequence, also known as a one-er. Whenever a director and their crew pulls off one of these elaborately orchestrated sequences, it usually makes for a memorable moment, from Danny Torrance Big Wheeling through the haunted hotel in Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shiningto the hallway fight inDaredevil.Aside from being a deeply satisfying way of heightening the narrative on our screens, it's basically a blue ribbon for anyone able to pull it off. From choreography to lighting to camera techniques, no one-shot sequence is an accident. While most of the one-ers that end up in TV and film these days aren't pure single shots, but instead an expertly crafted series of shots stitched together to create the illusion of seamlessness, there are some that are a straight, unbroken line of storytelling. When utilised well, the single-shot boosts action, heightens emotion and creates the kind of tension that could be easily deflated by a quick cut here and there. Here are the 12 best one-shot sequences in film and TV. An episode about a one-shot sequence that is itself a one-shot sequence—\"meta,\" thy name isThe Studio!Seth Rogenand Evan Goldberg's Hollywood satire—with Rogen as movie exec Matt Remmick, who fancies himself a defender of cinema even though his job requires him to sell out the art form time and again—uses unbroken takes to create a sense of mounting absurdity and kinetic energy in what would otherwise be a visually static show about people arguing in conference rooms. But the series' second episode ups the ante. Matt visits director Sarah Polley (playing herself) on set, and his bumbling presence becomes another complication as Polley attempts to pull off a complicated one-shot sequence starring Greta Lee (also playing herself.) The twist? The entire episode is itself a one-er—assembled from four different long takes over the course of several days, but we'll let them have it. Ok, we're kind of cheating here, butSuccession's shocking fourth-seasondeath revealhas all the building tension of a one-shot sequence with just the odd cut every now and then. The series is shot on film, which means there's a finite amount of time that the camera can be held before reels need to be changed. Still, the director said they more or less filmed the scene where Kendall, Roman and Shiv find out about Logan's death at Connor's wedding in one go. One scene where that tracking shot is most deftly deployed is when Kendall tells Shiv to talk to their dad on the phone, with the single frame following them mirroring their frenzied intensity. There's something claustrophobic and heavy about the way the camera sticks to the siblings as the cracks in their cold veneer show the fear of losing their dad. Considering it was a mid-season twist of sorts, having a shot you literally can't look away from for fear of missing something just adds to the impact. The key to a great sports movie is how well the director can make it feel like you're experiencing the intense highs and lows that come with competition. Normally, that means ramping up the adrenaline with fast-paced cuts, speeding us through the action to the all-important, euphoric win. In 2015'sCreed, however, that technique (used, naturally, inRocky) is shunned in favor of a brutal, extensive long shot that puts you in the ring withMichael B. Jordan's Donnie and his opponent. The scene tracks a fight that doesn't seem to want to end, highlighting the labor-intensive mundanity it takes to get to the final knock-out stage of a boxing match. With the tracking shot almost reflexively re-centering constantly on Jordan's face, we're never for a second allowed to step out of the ring. Martin Scorsese's iconic one-shot sequence inGoodfellasis all about seduction. It follows Ray Liotta's Henry and his date Karen (Lorraine Bracco) going from the car to the best seat at the Copacabana nightclub, with the camera following them from the back door through to the kitchen and then the packed patrons at the front of the club. This is Henry's seduction of Karen, sure, but it's also his seduction of us, the audience, as we get our first glimpse of the luxurious perks of organized crime. From Henry's deft ease at navigating the hallways of the club to his easy banter with the workers, every gesture is a casual display of power.  It makes his subsequent, self-inflicted fall from grace into a schnook's life in the suburbs all the more stark and humbling. This intenseChildren of Mentracking shot, one of a few in the movie, shifts the film into a different gear almost instantly. Having already set the scene of a fragile dystopia descended into chaos and prejudice, this scene—which involves Julianne Moore's Julian, Clive Owen's Theo andChiwetel Ejiofor's Luke transporting a young pregnant woman across the country in a car—ramps up the danger with a shocking ambush that goes from zero to a hundred in just a few seconds. Tracking shots, by design, are tense, as they subconsciously keep viewers on tenterhooks. Even as the car of people joke around as if they're on a normal road trip, there's a mounting unease that bursts like a balloon once the gang of men try to destroy and kill them. The shot perfectly shows the way life can change in a split second. War will always serve as a deeply visceral setting for a lingering, one-shot sequence. FromChristopher Nolan'sDunkirkto Sam Mendes'1917, the trick has been used to portray the innocent and overwhelming humanity at the centre of the world's most brutal and shocking circumstances. That's never more apparent, however, than in 2007'sAtonement. James McAvoy's Robbie is at the centre of the scene, at first almost unfazed by the sensory enormity of what's happening around him on the shores of Dunkirk. In the background, horses are shot, men are carried on stretchers, and soldiers shake with shell shock, all the while McAvoy is determined in his mission to get home. But as the beach fills the screen, the reality that he is just one of 300,000 men wanting to return to normality wipes across his face. By the end of the five minutes, your heart is in your stomach. The stylish one-shot fight sequence fromDaredevil's second season works on a number of levels. First, it's a primal hand-to-hand sequence befitting the most street-level of Marvel's superheroes. Second, it plays on our understanding of Matt Murdock's visual impairment, with no end to the shocks that await someone unable to see their way through the world. Finally, it just looks really cool. In a genre that falls back time and again on elaborate (and weightless) CGI battles, there's something satisfying about something so choreographed and analogue. Clearly heavily influenced by Park Chan-Wook'sOldboy(more on that in a second) and martial arts films coming out of East Asia, there's something deeply human and relatable about seeing someone's energy deplete in real-time, even if they are endowed with superpowers. LikeDaredevil, which obviously took influence from this iconic sequence, Park Chan Wook's one-shot fight scene takes place in a long hallway. The camera tracks it from the side, as if hugging the wall, making the area feels like an interminable stretch. The South Korean filmmaker revels in his protagonist Oh Dae-su's (Choi Min-sik) seemingly unwinnable bid for freedom as he takes on a neverending slew of bad guys, getting progressively more battered and bruised in the process. Unlike itsDaredevilcounterpart, the violence against Dae-su feels more grounded. He's kicked in the head and stabbed in the back, all while somehow clambering to defeat his foes. Miraculously, he does. Most one-shot sequences are actually a few shots cobbled together with the help of some expertly crafted cuts.True Detective's first season gives us a six-minute sequence that honestly could be a few neatly stitched scenes, but actually, it really is one, long continuous shot. One of the first offerings of the McConaissance,True Detective's power lies in its deft ability to be entertaining while being so incredibly bleak. Their one-shot trick comes in a scene of a police bust that turns into a public shoot-out. The beauty of a tracking shot is that, while our visual focus remains on McConaughey, we still hear the chaos around him while being unable to know exactly what's happening. It's an incredibly effective tool, as it drops us right into the action with them, highlighting the unpredictability and second-by-second decision-making of the character. Orson Welles was an innovator of cinema, always attempting new things at the advent of modern movies, and one of his finest achievements is the long opening shot of his film 1958Touch of Evil.There are no bells and whistles with this sequence, no tricks of the camera because, to put it bluntly, no one knew how to do that yet. The camera pans over a man placing a bomb in a car, that car driving away, a couple, played by Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston coming into focus and then the car, off camera, blowing up. Nowadays, this would be constructed by automated cameras and sound dollies, but back then the camera was stuck on tracks and a man with a boom mic had to remain off-screen. As one-shot sequences go, this is about as gold standard as you can get. One-shot sequences are often reserved for action as they're a particularly effective tool to focus a person at the centre of something enormous. ButCall Me By Your Name's final shot shows the impact of using a lingering shot for some of the most intimate and small moments. From the POV of a crackling fire,Timothée Chalamet's Elio stares into the light, sadness and tears slowly taking over his features. The sequence lasts for almost four minutes, the camera never cutting away from Chalamet's face. It's a deeply personal moment as his parents bustle behind him unable to see our vantage point. Like most of the film, much is said in the unsaid, the audience is asked to imprint their own relationship to being a teenager in love onto Elio. This sequence is the epitome of that, as we're invited to understand heartbreak in our own personal way. The Beardidn't just drop a one-er in their series to create a splash. No, they gave us a full, 18-minute-long complete one-shot episode. The series, about a volatile chef (Jeremy Allen White) returning to his hometown to run his late brother's restaurant, understands that a kitchen is like a battlefield. It's a sensory overload of stress, with any number of people at the centre trying to keep afloat. In that way, a single-shot episode feels fitting, especially when they're used so effectively in scenes of warfare. The never-ending shot only helps build up the mounting pressure of a busy restaurant at lunchtime, whipping our nerves into a bundled frenzy in real-time as the promise of some respite feels interminably long. The episode is a feat of technique, skill and choreography. You can't talk about one-shot sequences without mentioning the most unsettling of them all, from Stanely Kubrick'sThe Shining. As a whole, the film is a powder keg of unease, a bubbling pot of tension waiting to blow but never, even in its bigger moments, fully bursting. As we gear up to the final moments of explosiveness from Jack Nicholson's Jack, we're cued up with a series of ghostly set pieces. One of the more famous is Danny (Daniel Lloyd) riding his tricycle through the iconically carpeted floors of the Overlook Hotel. The child weaves his big wheel through the resort's winding corridor, and if it weren't for the choreography needed to execute a one-shot, you could easily believe he had just been told to go wherever he wants. His speedy journey is halted, however, by happening across door 237, the room of a haunted woman. The scene is short but impactful. Danny is young and innocent, but even he can't be spared from the horrors lurking in the corridors of his weird new home.   ‘The Studio’ This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Elon Musk Wins Vote To Make SpaceX Site Into Its Own City",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk, the richest person on Earth, is set to have his own microcity in South Texas after winning alocal voteon Saturday, mainly made up of people who work for him and their families. Starbase, the new city built around the billionaire’s company SpaceX, is located in a coastal southern town in Texas close to the Mexico border and covers only about one and a half square miles. Musk spent the weekend celebrating the vote on X, the social media site he owns, writing that Starbase is “now a real city!” and sharing photos of himopeningthe company’s launch site over a decade ago. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. It’s been a long wish for Musk, whopostedin March of 2021 that he was “creating” Starbase. It became a reality when nearly all voters, 212 to 6, opted to incorporate the city.Accordingto The Texas Newsroom, the majority of eligible voters worked for Musk. Many others are family members of SpaceX employees. Next, to cement Starbase, Texas, a judge must issue an order declaring the election results and the official incorporation of the new city. Boca Chica Village, a small beach town founded over 80 years ago, sits on the Starbase compound. In recent years, it’s experienced a seismic shift. SpaceX, The Texas Newsroom reports, has bought up almost all the houses in the area, adding Airstream trailers and tiny homes for its employees.Accordingto SpaceX officials, in the proposed boundaries of Starbase, only 10 out of 247 lots aren’t owned by Musk’s company or its employees. “We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,” Starbase General ManagerKathryn Luederswrote in a request to local officials in 2024 aimed at getting a vote on the city onto the ballot. People sit on a boat with a Trump flag as they watch Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship lift off from Starbase near Boca Chica, Texas, on March 6, 2025, during its 8th test flight. In addition to Musk’s control over the company, Starbase is expected to be overseen by three people with longstanding connections with SpaceX, all of whom ran unopposed and without much electoral flair. The Texas Tribune, along with the nonprofit Sunlight Research Center,reviewedthe three candidates’ public records and social media to understand who will govern the newly designated area. “There have been no signs of a traditional campaign along the Boca Chica Beach region in South Texas,” the Tribune’sBerenice Garciawrote on Friday. “No yard signs. No campaign websites. No candidate forums.” Only one person ran for Mayor of Starbase:Robert “Bobby” Peden. Peden is in his mid-thirties, has worked for SpaceX for over a decade, and contributed $5,000 to SpaceX’s political action committee in December. Jenna PetrzelkaandJordan Bussran to be the two commissioners for Starbase. Petrzelka, whose husband also works at SpaceX, started at the company in 2012 and rose to manager of operations engineering at Starbase, a role she had for about a year leading up to last summer. On campaign documents, she listed herself as a “philanthropist.” In 2022, she volunteered at Good Neighbor Settlement House, a local nonprofit assisting migrants and the homeless community. Buss, a senior director of Environmental Health and Safety for SpaceX, has worked at the company since 2023. That year, he made a $600 political contribution to the SpaceX PAC. After Saturday’s vote to create the city of Starbase, the three candidates win automatically. The city’s incorporation comes as both a professional and personal win for Musk, who has faced backlash from Americans across the country for his actions heading up the Department of Government Efficiency since PresidentDonald Trumptook office just over a hundred days ago. In addition tonationwide protestsagainst Musk at Tesla facilities and hisinvolvementin gutting key federal funding programs, multiple polls haveillustratedbroad disapproval for the billionaire’s growing influence in Washington. Protesters demonstrate against Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during a nationwide “Tesla Takedown” rally outside a Tesla dealership on March 29, 2025 in Pasadena, California. In a FebruaryWashington Post-Ipsospoll, 49 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the job Musk was doing within the federal government. Three other polls from February, conducted by Quinnipiac, Emerson College, and Marist Poll for NPR and PBS, all found that respondents were more likely to disapprove of Musk’s role in Trump’s administration than support it. (Republicans were more likely to approve of Musk, compared to a small number of Democrats, according to the polls.) It’s unclear how long Musk will continue his central-facing role in Trump’s orbit, andrumorscontinue to pop up that his days in Washington may be coming to a close. Musk himself recently claimed that he’ll pull back from his work at DOGE to focus on running Tesla. Still, the billionaire remains deeply involved with the current administration, and theimpactsof DOGE’s cuts are already being acutely felt in homes across thecountryandthe world. Though the vote for Starbase passed handily with support from those within Musk’s network, its creation is not without protest. The company town will now have increased power over a nearby popular beach and state park to use for rocket launches. And, a proposed bill is aimed at charging anyone who doesn’t comply with an order to evacuate the beach with a Class B misdemeanor and up to 180 days in jail. Critics feel that beach closure should stay with the county government, representing a larger population that enjoys the beach and park. A piñata representing Elon Musk is seen at Boca Chica Beach in Brownsville, Texas, on May 3, 2025 during a protest against the Boca Chica Village neighborhood, where the SpaceX facilities are located, becoming its own municipality, known as Starbase. On Saturday, the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which hasopposedthe new city and SpaceX’s control over the beach, held a demonstration that brought out dozens of people. Christopher Basaldú, an SOTXEJN co-founder and a member of the Carrizo Comecrudo Nation of Texas, said his ancestors have long been in the area, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf. “It’s not just important,” he said, “it’s sacred.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

    "title": "Lady Gaga Concert Bomb Plot Revealed By Brazilian Police",
    "article_text": "The biggest event inLady Gaga’scareerwas nearly derailed this weekend, according to a Sunday announcement from Rio de Janeiro’s state police and Brazil’s Justice Ministry. According to the agencies,theMayhemartistwas the focus of a bomb plot from a shadowy online organization set on disrupting Gaga’s Saturday concert at Copacabana Beach, which reportedly drew a crowd of millions. Police say that two people were arrested in the alleged plot: An adult male, who was charged with illegal weapons possession in Rio Grande do Sul; and a juvenile, who was arrested in Rio on allegations of child pornography. Officials have yet to name either suspect, nor have they provided additional details on the specific circumstances of the detentions. The adult was the alleged leader of an online group “that promoted hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community,”the AP reports. It also “attempts to recruit other teenagers while encouraging acts of violence,” according toABC News. “The plan was treated as a ‘collective challenge’ with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,” police said Sunday. “Those involved were recruiting participants, including teenagers, to carry out integrated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails.” Aerial view of US pop star Lady Gaga performing during a free concert at Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on May 3, 2025. The attacks were planned for Lady Gaga’s free concert Saturday, which attracted a crowd of over 2.5 million people.According to Variety,that means Gaga has set a new attendance record for a concert held by a female artist, breakingMadonna’s2024 recordof 1.6 million duringherCelebrationtour, which was also set at Copacabana Beach. The event, which was funded bythe city of Rio, was also seen as an opportunity to boost the region’s economy. According to Rio’s City Hall, the concert was expected to generate around $106 million in revenue for area businesses. In advance of the concert, the Brazilian Justice Ministry, Federal Police, and digital intelligence services launched a joint effort called Operation Fake Monsters in an effort to root out any potential threats to the event. As a result of information gleaned in that operation, the homes of 15 suspects were raided across multiple Brazilian states. According to police, law enforcement confiscated electronic devices and cell phones during the raids. It’s unclear if any explosives were discovered in any of the searches, which took place on Saturday morning but were kept under wraps until after the show, to avoid “panic or distortion of information among the population,\" police say. Ina statementsent to theHollywood Reporter, a spokesperson for Lady Gaga said “We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning.” “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,” the statement continued. “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.” The arrests are an eerie reminder ofa similar attackallegedly planned for aTaylor Swiftconcert in Viennalast year. In that case, the shows were canceled, with Swift later saying that she would not speak publicly about the alleged plot, as her words “might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

    "article_text": "The growing epidemic of unruly air travelers hitthe art worldthis weekend, when news broke thatJames Rondeau, the president and director of the Art Institute of Chicago allegedly disrobed in the middle of a flight from the Windy City to Germany. Unnamed sourcesinformedCBS News that Rondeau, who has led the museum for nearly a decade, allegedly “drank alcohol and took prescription medication,” then removed his clothing while on United Airlines flight 953, which traveled from Chicago to Munich on April 18. Police were called to the flight after it landed in Munich,reportstheNew York Times. Via statement, the Art Institute of Chicago confirmed the report, saying that Rondeau has returned to Chicago, and is currently on voluntary leave from his position. “The Art Institute takes this very seriously and has opened an independent investigation into the incident to gather all available information,” the statement reads. “Art Institute leadership is meeting to determine next steps.” James Rondeau, Director of the Art Institute of Chicago stands next to the iconic painting American Gothic, 1930 by Grant Wood, as it is installed at the Royal Academy of Arts ahead of the exhibition \"America After The Fall: Painting in the 1930s\" at Royal Academy of Arts on February 13, 2017 in London, England. Founded in 1879, the Art Institute of Chicago is one of the largest art museums in the US, with over 300,000 pieces inits permanent collectionand over 30special exhibitionsa year. It’s home to works such asEdward Hopper’sNighthawks, Georges Seurat’sA Sunday on La Grande Jatte(the inspiration forStephen Sondheim’sSunday in the Park With George), and—contraryto the claimsof PresidentDonald Trump—Pierre-Auguste Renoir’sTwo Sisters (On the Terrace). Rondeauwas appointedas museum president and director in 2016, following the retirement of longtime leaderDouglas Druick. He’s been at the Art Institute since 1998, first joining the organization as an associate curator of contemporary art. Art Institutetax recordsshow he is paid over $1 million annually. United Airlines has not responded toVanity Fair’s request for comment, but the April 18 incident on flight 953 is but one in a growing number of reports of unruly air travelers. According to data from the Federal Aviation Administration, in-flight outburstshave sharply risensince 2019, prompting the agency to begin referring cases of passenger-related flight disruptions to the FBI.

    "title": "Quinta Brunson Has Benson Boone Flipping Over Her on Saturday Night Live",
    "article_text": "Quinta Brunsonsashayed onto the main stage looking like Betty Boop, ready for her sophomore stint hostingSaturday Night Live. She gave passing glance to her brief tenure working a phone sex line before moving onto the driving bit of her monologue. The 4'11\" Emmy-winning star and creator ofAbbott Elementarybroke into song—her voice a bit quavery to start—in praise of her humble stature. “If you're looking for a superstar, start looking down,” she sang. “You can flip likeSimone, Olympic superstar, or start a war withDrakelike you'reKendrick Lamar. You can be likeTom Hollandand marry a 10, or likeSabrina Carpenterand…” Enter Carpenter in the pink, shiny flesh, cute as a cupcake. She helped smooth out Brunson's voice and the two were off to the races, singing about about all the fun sights from their point of view, like “toddlers' eyes, peoples' crotches, andJeremy Allen White!”Marcello Hernandezwanted in because hanging around polly pockets helped him feel tall. Basketball hall-of-famerDwyane Wadewas a left-field add to the mix, but a welcome one, mainly because he seemed so earnestly dedicated to his dance choreography. Brunson's best scene partner throughout the episode wasKenan Thompson, who was at her side for most of the night. Their finest hour perhaps was “OnlySeniors,” in which they played aging parents bragging to their grown children—Ego NwodimandDevon Walker—about their new life insurance plan. All they had to was “set up our camera and do stuff to each other.” Sometimes with a ball gag. Or in a swing. Or with the Johnsons from next door,Mikey DayandHeidi Gardnerin open bathrobes. Speaking of Day, he was back raging behind the steering wheel. Alongside his daughter, played with salivating aplomb byChloe Fineman, he parked next to Brunson on a ferry. His pantomimes of annoyance over her bad parking job escalated to him acting out the word toxic and Fineman dangling imaginary balls over her mouth to tell Brunson she was nuts. “You raised a hoe,” said Brunson, raking an imaginary garden tool. If the conceit of placing the sketch on a ferry seemed an odd one, the payoff was a franticColin Jostappearing in the passenger window wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Thurston Howell's silk neck scarf. “Hey, you say you love ferries?Would you like to buy one?Please buy it. I'mPete Davidson, hi.” With summer fast approaching, women have a big decision to make. Can they still pull off Coachella Whore, or is it time to bleach their wardrobes of joy? “Your 20s are over, mama. It's time to close that book and move on. Introducing Forever 31… with styles in every color of the bummer rainbow.\" Fineman misremembering the moves to theCharli XCXApple dance while draped in shapeless swathes of charcoal grey was one of the best moments of the entire episode. Suits, bigger suits, “big ol'David Byrnesuits.” Trenches, inexplicably expensive t-shirts, and loose trousers, “because we know you freezing your eggs.” Okay, now do Forever 51. Michael Longfellow, who himself admitted he hasn't been up to much this season, was a delight on Weekend Update. (Speaking of, he might have anchorman potential...) Piggybacking off the news that travelers will soon be needing REAL IDs in order to fly, he was simply alerting the powers that be that no, actually, he refuses. He's got a good, withholding energy about him, with top notes of genuine menace. Being told by Jost that he wouldn't be able to fly if he didn't submit to government pressure, Longfellow merely scoffed. “Honey, it's 2025. Planes are barely allowed to fly.” In fact, he had some conditions to discuss with the aviation industry. He's not wrong. Next were Darlene and Duke, two Applebee's barflies played by best cast goodbye budsSarah ShermanandBowen Yang. They were protesting the nationwide rash of closings of casual chain restaurants. “Where are we supposed to go?” said Yang, trying out a new butch accent and a hair metal wig. “Uber Eats? Hub Grub? Roblox?” In between slurps of their punch bowl of booze, Darlene and Duke sucked a little face before getting back to their mission to save America. “You're 12 years old in the 'burbs,” says Yang, getting nostalgic. “You have your birthday at Fuddruckers and you joke about the name.” “I thought it was a slur. Like look at that Fuddrucker over there. What the Fuddruck is wrong with him?” said Sherman, handing the baton back to Yang who said, “Yeah yeah, is he gay? Is he a Fuddraggot?” Soon musical guestBenson Boonewas delivering sizzling sriracha fajitas with a side of Asian glaze to the anchor desk, which gave them all an opportunity to riff on his earworm, “Beautiful Things\"—which happily was not one of his musical performances. Speaking of Boone: He of course flipped into view after Brunson's first introduction of him It was a cute little moment, him in his revealing purple pants, grinning cheekily into Brunson's ear. I do wish he'd showed some restraint and not felt the need to give another showy flip during his second performance. Don't overwork a bit, kid.

    "article_text": "Uneven distribution of chargers with output power of between 20 and 99 kilowatts raises concerns about whether supply sufficient to support development goals Hong Kong’s public quick chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) are unevenly distributed across the city’s 18 districts, government figures show, raising concerns about whether the supply is sufficient to support local development goals. According to the reply, 1,744 were quick chargers with a rated output power of between 20 and 99 kilowatts. Another nine were fast chargers, meaning they had a rated output power of 100kW or above. In terms of the supply of quick chargers, the lowest numbers were seen in Tai Po, North and Islands districts – standing at 33, 44 and 52, respectively. In comparison, Sha Tin, Kwun Tong and Yau Tsim Mong had the largest number of quick chargers at 229, 207 and 187, respectively.",

    "title": "Ukraine critic wins Romanian election first round rerun",
    "article_text": "George Simion, a critic of the EU who has been banned from entering Ukraine, won the first round of the rerun of the Romanian presidential election on Sunday. With more than 95% of the ballots counted, Simion, the leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), received 40.52% of the votes, according to the news websiteG4 Media. Former Senator Crin Antonescu and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, both known for their pro-EU views, each received a little over 20%. “This is not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country,”Simion said after the exit polls were published, according to Reuters. The vote took place after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the election held in November, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu received 23% of the votes. The court cited“irregularities”in Georgescu’s campaign, as well as intelligence reports claiming that the Kremlin had meddled in the election. Moscow rejected these claims of interference at the time as“anti-Russia hysteria.” In March, the Central Electoral Bureau barred Georgescu from running again, citing his alleged“anti-democratic”and“extremist”stance, as well as a failure to comply with electoral procedures. On Sunday, Georgescu and Simion arrived at a polling station together.“We are here with a single mission: to restore constitutional order and democracy,”Simion told reporters. In November 2024, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that Simion had been blacklisted for his“systematic anti-Ukrainian activities, which contradict the national interests of Ukraine and violate its state sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Simion argued that he was targeted because of his“promotion of historical truth”among the Romanian minority in western Ukraine. He was also banned from entering neighboring Moldova, which he labeled“an artificial country”that“will never join the European Union.” Simion has opposed the delivery of weapons to Kiev.“We will not send military aid to Ukraine, and that doesn’t make us pro-Russian,”he told reporters last year. He has also criticized EU bureaucrats.“The EU is a remarkable project that brought peace to Europe after centuries of war, but Brussels has become a greedy and corrupt bubble,”according to the politician.",
