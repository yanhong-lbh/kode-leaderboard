A convicted murderer on the run since his escape from custody in California last year is now wanted for killing a Mexican police commander in an elite unit known as \"the Gringo Hunters\" after a shootout with authorities this week. The unit was trying to arrest Cesar Hernandez, 34, who remains wanted in the U.S., in the border city of Tijuana when a shooting occurred. Mexican police commander Abigail Esparza Reyes, the head of the unit dedicated to capturing American suspects in Mexico, was shot and killed, Reuters reported. THOUSANDS LEAVE COUNTRY VOLUNTARILY AMID TRUMP SELF-DEPORT PUSH, DHS SAYS Caesar Hernandez(California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation) Marina del Pilar, the governor of Baja California, confirmed Reyes' death in a statement on Wednesday. \"I deeply regret the death of State Citizen Security Force Agent Abigail Esparza Reyes, while participating in an arrest warrant enforcement operation currently underway,\" she wrote on X. \"To the family and loved ones of Officer Abigail, we recognize your bravery and dedication in the service of your state,\" Pilar added. \"Our wishes for a speedy resignation are with you; Abigail's life will be honored, and her death will not go unpunished.\" Mexico has long been seen by criminal suspects as a place to evade U.S. law enforcement. In 2002, the unit nicknamed \"Gringo Hunters\" was created to cooperate with U.S. authorities and apprehend fugitives who cross the border, the report said. Esparza Reyes had led the regional team of the unit for eight years, carrying out more than 400 operations aimed at arresting U.S. fugitives who had fled to Mexico.

    "title": "Justin Rose leads Masters after first round; Scottie Scheffler right behind",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Scottie Schefflerwas expected to be near the top of the Masters leaderboard after the first round at Augusta National Golf Club. But it was Justin Rose, the Englishman playing in his20th Masters, who walked into the clubhouse with a three-stroke lead over the 2024 winner at 7-under after posting a miraculous first round Thursday. Rose, whose only major win came in 2013 at the U.S. Open, matched his best round ever at Augusta National, and this marks his fifth time leading after the tournament's first round. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Justin Rose reacts on the 18th green during the first round of the Masters.(Michael Madrid/Imagn Images) The 44-year-old sprinted out to a 3-under start after hebirdied the first three holes.After doing the same on holes 8 and 9, he finished the first nine at 5-under. He birdied 10 before coming back down to earth with four straight pars before finding more red marks on holes 15 and 16 to sit at 8-under. Rose was flirting with the best opening round in Masters history, Greg Norman's 9-under in 1996. But Rose couldn’t find the fairway on the narrow 18th fairway, and he finished his round with a bogey. However, he was all smiles after his great start. His best finishes at the Masters came in 2015 and 2017, when he finished second and tied for second, respectively. SERGIO GARCIA GOES VIRAL AT MASTERS FOR 1ST ROUND OUTFIT There were some questions about how Scheffler would fare this week in Augusta due to him missing a few tournaments to start the year with a freak hand injury he sustained while preparing Christmas dinner. And he admitted weeks before the tournament it’s still affecting his play. Yet, he shot 4-under to set himself up for a good week to defend his 2024 Masters title. And some theatrics came with it when he drained a 60-foot birdie on the par-3 fourth hole. He also knocked down a long putt on the par-3 16th that would be his final birdie of the day in a bogey-free round to begin his tournament. However, he isn’t the only one in the clubhouse at 4-under, three strokes back of Rose. Canadian Corey Conners, picked by some as a dark horse candidate to win this week, birdied three of his final four holes to also sit 4-under heading into Friday. Finally, Sweden's Ludvig Åberg, who finished second in last year's Masters behind Scheffler, had a strong second nine with four birdies to finish tied for second at 4-under. Scottie Scheffler walks off the No. 5 tee during the first round of the Masters.(Kyle Terada/Imagn Images) It was looking like Rose could have some very close company, if not a tie for the lead, because Rory McIlroy was cruising in his opening round as he searches for that elusive career Grand Slam. He needs a Masters victory to complete that. He was looking great at 4-under after 14 holes, but a costly error on the par-5 15th derailed what would’ve been a sparkling start to the tournament. A beautiful drive started the hole, but after his second shot went through the green, McIlroy had to chip down to the hole, which sat at the front of the green on a downslope. It was a similar situation Patrick Cantlay faced earlier Thursday, and both of his attempts rolled off the green and into the water below for a disastrous turn of events. McIlroy’s chip got a hard second bounce, and he watched as his ball rolled into the water. Instead of going back to the same spot like Cantlay, he opted for the drop zone and would need to chip again after it bounced just off the green into the fringe. McIlroy finished with a double bogey to fall to 2-under on the day, and it got worse from there. He was able to par No. 16 but found trouble again with a double bogey on 17 to drop to even-par on the round. That’s where McIlroy finished, which isn’t terrible by any means. However, after such a great start to the day, especially with all the expectations for him entering the week after two victories, McIlroy now needs to build momentum again Friday instead of riding high from it Thursday. Rory McIlroy walks off of the No. 13 green during the first round of the Masters.(Katie Goodale/Imagn Images) There is a 65-year-old tied within the top 10 at Augusta National, and it’s none other than 1992 Masters champion Fred Couples, who posted a 1-under 71 first round Thursday. It was a round for the Masters record books. It had been 42 years since he first broke par at Augusta National in 1983. The longest gap prior to that was Jack Nicklaus, who first broke par in 1960 before his last in 2000, a 40-year gap. Tom Watson also had 40 years between his first and last, and both he and Nicklaus were honorary starters Thursday. Couples, with his ever-so-sweet swing from the right side, is draining eagles from the fairway as he did Hole 14 with a hybrid from just under 200 yards out. His neon yellow ball hit the green perfectly in line, and it quickly turned the tide for Couples, who bogeyed two of his last three holes prior to that to go 1-over on the day. Couples is usually aiming to make the cut each year so he can play into the weekend. This was a start to give him that opportunity.

    "title": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth touts 'historic' deals to deter 'Chinese influence' in Panama Canal",
    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discusses the latest developments with Panama, tensions with China and more on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ The Trump administration announced major moves in the Panama Canal this week, with Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethexplaining Thursday that the deals are a means of serving American interests and working to \"stop the sphere of Chinese influence.\" The Panama Canal Authority confirmed in a press release Wednesday that Panama’s minister for canal affairs and Hegseth signed a joint declaration that reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty and outlines new military cooperation. \"We're going to invest in ways that serve American interests in our backyard as we stop the sphere of Chinese influence,\" Hegseth said Thursday on \"The Will Cain Show.\" PANAMA AND US LOCK IN NEW SECURITY PACT FOR CANAL AS CHINA TENSIONS SIMMER The deal \"reaffirms respect for, and the recognition of, Panamanian sovereignty over the interoceanic waterway,\" the Canal Authority stated. It upholds both nations’ commitment to the Neutrality Treaty and the legal framework that governs canal operations, including Panama’s Constitution, the treaty itself and the Canal’s Organic Law. The declaration laid out plans for a cost-sharing model to cover services provided to U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels, with the goal of keeping it \"cost-neutral.\" \"It's in our direct U.S. interest to ensure that waterway is free and that our ships can transit freely. So, it was two historic arrangements that serve American interests, and it would never have happened without President Trump,\"Hegseth said. Hegseth saida broader framework is in the works, one that would guarantee U.S. warships \"first and free\" passage through the Panama Canal. He announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panamanian officials had already signed a memorandum of understanding, and that a final document is on the way to formally secure toll-free priority for American naval vessels. The defense secretary added on \"The Will Cain Show\" that the deal \"codifies first, and it codifies a cost-neutral basis where we're able to freely transit, and it saves our Treasury money,\" noting the arrangement has an \"economic upside\" on top of the \"strategic\" interests. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA’S INFLUENCE,' SAYS HEGSETH Earlier this week, Hegseth visited U.S. troops, met with Panamanian officials and toured the canal. He warned that China’s reach in the Western Hemisphere is already too big, and still growing. \"What I saw down in Panama was not just about a canal,\" Hegseth told Fox News host Will Cain. \"Of course, the canal is very important and everything that goes through there. It was a tug-of-war with the communist Chinese.\" The administration's arrangements with Panama come amid rising temperatures between the United States and China, largely spurred on by an escalating trade war. As of Thursday, the White House said it hadimposed 145% in new tariffson China, up from the 125% Trump announced the day before. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While hiking rates on China, Trump said he wouldreduce tariffs onother countriesthat did not retaliate against the United States to his baseline of 10%. The tariff tit-for-tat has been ongoing since Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last week, but Hegseth said the trade war does not have to \"lead to conflict, and I really hope it doesn't.\" \"President Trump has a great relationship with Xi Jinping. They speak often. There's a mutual respect, and I think, ultimately, what President Trump wants to do is reestablish American manufacturing and not be taken advantage of,\" Hegseth said.

    "title": "Chinese officials claimed behind closed doors PRC played role in US cyberattacks: Report",
    "article_text": "China has been ramping up its military actions around Taiwan in what one top general warned on Thursday are not just drills, but \"rehearsals.\" Chinese officialsacknowledged behind closed doors at a December meeting that their government was responsible for a series of cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to a Wall Street Journal report based on information from people familiar with the matter. The news comes as the two countries continue to spar over tariffs imposed by PresidentDonald Trumpand reciprocated and upped by President Xi Jinping. In an exclusive, the Wall Street Journal reported that those who spoke on condition of anonymity claimed Chinese officials connected the cyberattacks on U.S. ports, airports, utilities and other important targets to America’s support for Taiwan. The report noted that Biden administration officials learned of the discovery first hand during a summit in Geneva, as their Chinese counterparts blamed the campaign, referred to as Volt Typhoon, on a criminal organization. CHINA ATTACKED US WITH HACKERS. WE NEED TO HIT BACK HARD Hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Chinese officials also accused the U.S. of pointing blame at China based on their imagination. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital the State Department has made clear to Beijing that the U.S. will continue to take actions in response to Chinese malicious cyber activity targeting the U.S. \"Chinese cyber threats are some of the gravest and most persistent threats to U.S. national security,\" the spokesperson said. \"The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to safeguard U.S. critical infrastructure from irresponsible and reckless cyberattacks from Beijing. President Trump is committed to protecting the American people and U.S. critical infrastructure from these threats.\" The Chinese Embassy told FOX Business News that China \"firmly opposes\" the smear attacks against it without any factual basis. BIDEN ADMIN DOUBLING TARIFFS ON CHINESE SOLAR PANEL PARTS AFTER REPORTED 'INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE' President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \"Cyberspace is characterized by strong virtuality, difficulty in tracing origins, and diverse actors, making the tracing of cyberattacks a complex technical issue,\" Embassy spokesperson Mr. Liu Pengyu said. \"We hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude when characterizing cyber incidents, basing their conclusions on sufficient evidence rather than unfounded speculation and accusations. \"The US needs to stop using cybersecurity to smear and slander China, and stop spreading all kinds of disinformation about the so-calledChinese hacking threats,\" he added. The Biden administration warned state leaders in March 2024 that cyberattacks by hackers linked to Iran and China could take down water systems across the U.S. if cybersecurity measures were not taken out of precaution.

Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Monday May 13, 2024.(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Then Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael S. Regan and Jake Sullivan, the assistant to Biden for national security affairs, said in an email to state governors that cyberattacks were targeting water and wastewater systems throughout the U.S. In the letter, the two Biden administration officials said the attacks could disrupt clean andsafe drinking waterand impose significant costs on affected communities. While one attack was linked to Iran, the other threat came from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored hacker group, Volt Typhoon, which compromised information technology of critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water facilities in the U.S. and its territories. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WARNS STATES OF POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON WATER SYSTEMS FROM FOREIGN HACKERS Drinking water poured into glass(UBC) As U.S. officials issued warnings about Volt Typhoon’s effort, they also accused the PRC of attempting to get into U.S. computer networks in an effort to unleash cyberattacks during any unforeseen conflicts in the future. The FBI said in December that hackers in Beijing infiltrated networks of \"multiple\" telecommunication companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" But the targets, the FBI noted in December, were Americans involved in government and politics. A federal investigation uncovered a massive cyber-espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed in December that at least eight U.S. telecom companies had been affected by the hacking spree.

    "article_text": "‘Outnumbered’ co-host Kayleigh McEnany stresses that the cover-up of former President Biden’s apparent decline needs to be ‘fervently’ investigated on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ Ex-NBC anchor Chuck Todd admitted on Wednesday that the media was afraid to cover questions about former President Joe Biden's mental acuity during the 2024 race, believing that doing so would benefit his opponent, then-presidential candidateDonald Trump. During an appearance on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored,\" the British host asked Todd why the media seemed \"reluctant\" to push \"much harder\" on Biden's age at the time, particularly when \"everyone was seeing [it] with their own eyes.\" Todd defended the media at first, saying that the American public was able to come to its own conclusions about Biden because of the media's coverage, which he said drew attention to Biden's decline without being overt about it. \"Look, we were subtle. 'He's using the back staircase, he's not using the front staircase. Hey, he's not doing any interviews,'\"the former \"Meet the Press\" hostsaid. Chuck Todd said the media made a mistake in trying to hurt Trump by hiding Biden's deterioration.(Getty Images) BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS \"So there was this reluctance to draw the conclusion to say, ‘Is he not doing this?’ And that I agree with,\"Todd continued. \"That was held back, held back a lot [by the mainstream media].\" He argued that there were a number of individual members of the media who raised concerns about Biden running for re-election, such as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who wrotea brutal columnurging the president to bow out of the race in September 2023. \"But I understand the argument about the collective on that front,\" he went on. \"The only thing I can chalk it up to is this — whatever you want to call it — this fear that some members of the media had sometimes that they would be perceived as helping Trump if they somehow diminished Biden,\" Todd continued. \"And I think this has been the fundamental mistake that many members of the traditional press have done,\" Todd continued. Chuck Todd said the legacy media made a fundamental mistake in advocating for President Trump to be de-platformed after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE He listed the media'spush to de-platform Trumpfrom social media after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as one example of media mistakes. Todd argued Trump's First Amendment rights should have been protected and made the case that the media's reputation suffered because of this. \"It looks more obvious today,\" Todd said. \"Because what did he do? He built his own information ecosystem and now traditional media is doing what? Showing up on YouTube.\" \"Traditional media doesn't have the influence it did anymore because it [went] along with this deplatforming exercise,\" he argued. Two new books out this month reveal that Democrats expressed concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities behind-the-scenes.(Getty Images) The admission comes after the release of twobombshell booksout this month that reveal Democrats were privately worried about Biden's cognitive decline long before he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, while publicly denying they had any concerns. PELOSI PRIVATELY SAID BIDEN HAD LOST A STEP, BOOK SAYS, BUT PUBLICLY BASHED WSJ STORY ON HIS COGNITIVE DECLINE According to Chris Whipple's new book, \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,\"Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told a friend she was startled by Biden's appearance after a White House meeting in May 2024. \"He was not the same Joe Biden,\" Pelosi reportedly said, and according to the book, \"She couldn’t shake the realization that Joe Biden was a shadow of himself.\" Yet the next month, Pelosi took to X to bash a Wall Street Journal article as \"hit piece\" for reporting on multiple claims that mirrored what Pelosi had said, according to Whipple's book.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump answers a question about potential military action against Iran if it doesn't agree to a nuclear deal. JERUSALEM — A leading U.S. research institute devoted to monitoring Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program published an alarming report ahead of this weekend's U.S.-Iran talks, declaring Tehran’s atomic weapons system has reached an extremely dangerous stage. The Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Science and International Security titled its shocking new report, \"The Iran Threat Geiger Counter:Extreme Danger Grows.\" According to the study, \"Since February 2024, the date of its last report, the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program has worsened significantly. Major negative factors include Iran’s greater nuclear weapon capabilities, its shorter time frames to build nuclear weapons, and the growing normalization of internal Iranian discussions favoring building nuclear weapons. TRUMP VINDICATED AS EXPLOSIVE REPORT CONFIRMS IRAN SUPERVISES HOUTHI ‘POLITICAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS’ Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, left, and President Donald Trump consider direct military engagement.(West Asia News Agency, Reuters | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) \"The possibility of Iran deciding to build nuclear weapons has been increased by the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East, pitting Iran and its proxy forces against Israel and its allies, a conflict Iran is losing. The volatile security situation is now combined with the perception, if not the reality, that Iran is preparing to build nuclear weapons.\" On Wednesday, PresidentDonald Trumpsaid, \"We have a little time, but we don't have much time, because we're not going to let them have a nuclear weapon. We can't let them have a nuclear weapon.\"  He added \"I'm not asking for much. I just — I don't — they can't have a nuclear weapon.\" When asked about the potential for military action if Iran does not make a deal on their nuclear weapons, Trump said, \"Absolutely.\" \"If itrequires military,we're going to have military,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. They'll be the leader of that. But nobody leads us. We do what we want to do.\" Trumpwithdrew from the Obama-eraIran nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — in 2018 because, he argued, that the accord did not stop Tehran’s drive to build a nuclear weapons device.

Fox News Digital sought to obtain a copy of the alleged religious fatwa from Iran, but the regime has so far refused to provide the document. Iran experts have claimed that the fatwa is non-existent. The Institute for Science and International Security report also warned that \"Iran still possesses military capabilities that threaten the region. It has large stockpiles of drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles that it can employ against Israel and its allies. Iran also continues to be a major player in the Ukraine war, backing Russia with vast arms transfers, including drones and missiles.\" The mouthpiece of Iran’s Khamenei — the anti-American paper Kayhan — just urged theassassination of Trump.

    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang elaborates on the latest developments from China on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’ KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan —Taiwanese President William Laiis struggling to contain both open hostility and private \"wooing\" by China. In late March, four Taiwanese soldiers, three of whom were part of a unit that provides security for Taiwan’s Presidential Office, were jailed for up to seven years after being convicted of selling pictures of sensitive information to China. The verdicts came after last month’s speech in which Lai condemned the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the harshest terms used by a Taiwanese leader in modern history. In his remarks, the president said Taiwan will not be \"bullied or manipulated\" and promised repercussions against those who make \"expressions of loyalty to the enemy.\" Lai, aware of Beijing’s \"carrot and stick\" campaign, warned Taiwanese to be wary of China’s \"United Front,\" a political strategy employed by the CCP in which they – with plenty of smiles and often \"investment\" capital – enter international organizations and various influential groups and plant agents who then build alliances with targeted individuals, political parties and other interests. TRUMP CABINET PICKS DELIGHT TAIWAN, SEND STRONG SIGNAL TO CHINA Taiwanese President William Lai visits soldiers and air force personnel in Hualien, Taiwan, on May 28, 2024.(Reuters/Ann Wang) But Taiwan’s government is swimming upstream against a very strong flow of Chinese covert actions backed by huge sums of Chinese money. Last week, Presidential Office consultant Wu Shang-yu, along with two others from the president’s ruling party, were reportedly detained on suspicion of spying for the CCP. For many Taiwanese, Lai’s enough-is-enough speech and subsequent actions by his government are a welcome change from a period of perceived vulnerability. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insiders told Fox News Digital that they feel \"Taiwan has been on the defensive for far too long\" and that their voters \"are tired of us being a punching bag.\" The DPP government is also promising to take a harder stance against what it calls Chinese infiltration.Taiwanese citizensfound to have Chinese identity cards have had their Taiwan nationality revoked because it is illegal to be a Taiwan/China dual citizen or dual ID holder. Chinese President Xi Jinping(AP Photo/Andy Wong/File) China does not accept Taiwanese passports, so those here who wish to travel there must obtain a substitute passport known as \"Taiwan Compatriot ID,\" but these are for temporary stays. Some Taiwanese have sought a Chinese ID card to make living and working in China easier, but the days of divided loyalties are over, according to Taiwan’s government. In the days and weeks after Lai’s address, Taiwan’s National Immigration Agency revoked the visas of a handful of Chinese citizens for making online content that contravenes local laws.

But calling for the \"violent overthrow of Taiwan’s government by the military of the People’s Republic of China\" is a red line, which internet influencer \"Yaya in Taiwan\" crossed, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior. \"Yaya,\" a Chinese national whose real name is Liu Zhenya, lived in Taiwan on a spousal visa and has three children with her Taiwanese husband. But instead of treating her visa as a privilege, says Taiwan’s government, \"Yaya\" openly supported the forceful annexation of Taiwan by China. Yaya’s defenders argue that she, and others recently evicted from Taiwan, are being selectively prosecuted. Yet some here are not buying Lai's threats. Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor in the Department of Diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that all this \"get tough with China\" talk is mostly political theater: \"These dramatic Lai administration policy proposals are firstly maneuvers aimed at regaining control over Taiwan’s parliament, as well as building momentum for upcoming local elections in late 2026.\" Huang also said Taiwan’s ruling party, the DPP, is \"crying out to get the Trump administration’s attention in the hope that Trump’s officials will be more willing to endorse the DPP in power and work with, or include, the Lai administration in any ‘countering China’ policy.\" A pro-independence activist displays a flag in the Ximen District of Taipei on Feb. 3, 2024.(SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Taipei-based political risk analyst and lawyer Ross Darrell Feingold said Lai’s moves correspond with the tough-on-China approach ofSecretary of State Marco Rubioand other China hard-liners in the Trump administration: \"The Trump administration will want to see a government in Taiwan that is equally tough on China as the United States, whether in the political, trade or military spheres.\" A broad majority of Taiwanese appear to want tougher measures against acts that threaten Taiwan’s national sovereignty, but some analysts note the new tough talk has arrived just in time for Lai’s party as it hopes to succeed in an ongoing effort to remove opposition Chinese Nationalist Party legislators from office, win control of municipal governments in local elections in November 2026 and then help Lai secure a second term in 2028.

    "article_text": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the US and Panama have made moves to strengthen ties and remove ‘China's influence’ from canal. The United States and Panama have officially signed a new defense and security pact aimed at reinforcing control over the Panama Canal, a move thatDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimsis critical to pushing back against China’s growing grip in the region. In a press release posted Wednesday night on X, the Panama Canal Authority confirmed that Panama’s Minister for Canal Affairs and Hegseth signed a joint declaration that reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty and outlines new military cooperation. The deal \"reaffirms respect for, and the recognition of, Panamanian sovereignty over the interoceanic waterway,\" the Canal Authority stated.It also upholds both nations’ commitment to the Neutrality Treaty and the legal framework that governs canal operations, including Panama’s Constitution, the treaty itself, and the Canal’s Organic Law.​​HEGSETH SAYS PANAMA AGREED TO ALLOW US WARSHIPS TO TRAVEL 'FIRST AND FREE' THROUGH CANAL But the declaration goes beyond words. It lays out plans for a cost-sharing model to cover services provided to U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels, with the goal of keeping it \"cost-neutral.\" \"Efforts will be made [to] develop a mechanism which will allow compensation for services provided to warships and auxiliary vessels, seeking a cost-neutral basis,\" the statement reads. \"This mechanism will be evaluated jointly with the Ministry of Security of Panama.\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks in Panama City on April 9, 2025.(FRANCO BRANA/AFP via Getty Images) According to Hegseth, a broader framework is also in the works, one that would guarantee U.S. warships \"first and free\" passage through the Panama Canal. Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panamanian officials had already signed a memorandum of understanding, and that a final document is on the way to formally secure toll-free priority for American naval vessels. The Canal Authority, meanwhile, emphasized that this agreement is just the start. \"The declaration constitutes a first step in establishing this model, which will be developed in later stages.\" US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA’S INFLUENCE,' SAYS HEGSETH While the U.S. builds up its military coordination, the Panama Canal Authority confirmed that collaboration already includes \"engineering, security, and cybersecurity,\" key focus areas for both governments as they push back against foreign interference. The move comes just as the U.S. prepares to deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship,to the regionin a show of presence and partnership. Earlier this week, Hegseth visited U.S. troops, met with Panamanian officials, and toured the canal. He warned sharply thatChina’s reachin the Western Hemisphere is already too big, and still growing. Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino shakes hands with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the signing of a bilateral agreement in Panama City on April 9, 2025.(FRANCO BRANA/AFP via Getty Images) \"Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain,\" Hegseth said. \"They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China's global military ambitions. China's factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people.\" Hegseth stressed that war is not the objective. \"Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere,\" he said. He also made clear that the U.S. is taking steps to counter Chinese-controlled infrastructure in Panama. \"China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,\" Hegseth said. \"That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And asPresident Donald Trumphas pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.\" Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino (C) looks on as Panama's Security Minister Frank Abrego (L) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth get ready to sign a bilateral agreement, in Panama City on April 9, 2025.(FRANCO BRANA/AFP via Getty Images) Hegseth was blunt: \"The United States will not allow China to threaten the canal’s operation.\" He added, \"To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades.\" Despite the growing military and political coordination, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino has publicly denied that China controls the canal. \"I completely reject that statement,\" Mulino said, pushing back on earlier claims fromthe U.S. State Departmentthat a deal had already been reached guaranteeing toll-free passage for U.S. warships.

    "article_text": "Attorneys for Mahmoud Khalil shared video of his arrest inside his university-owned residence last weekend. (Mahmoud Khalil's family) Attorneys for anti-Israel protester Mahmoud Khalil criticized a two-page letter from Secretary of StateMarco Rubio, saying the entire case against their client rests on shaky allegations. The letter, which was filed in an immigration court this week and published Thursday, said the Trump administration has the authority to expel noncitizens whose presence in the country damages U.S. foreign policy interests. The memo alleges that Khalil, a legal permanent U.S. resident and Columbia University graduate student who served as spokesperson for anti-Israel protesters during large demonstrations, participated in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" His presence in the U.S. would have \"potentially serious adverse foreign consequences, and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" MAHMOUD KHALIL BLAMES 'ANTI-PALESTINIAN RACISM' FOR ARREST IN FIRST STATEMENT SINCE ICE DETAINMENT Mahmoud Khalil talks to the press at Columbia University on June 1, 2024.(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"Two pages, that's it,\" Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil's lawyers, told reporters during a virtual news conference Thursday. \"Yet this administration wants to silence Mahmoud, wants to silence people speaking out against the government of Israel or the government of the United States.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House. TheTrump administrationis attempting to deport Khalil over his activities at the Ivy League university last year. Federal Judge Jamee Comans said she will rule Friday on whether Khalil can be deported or if he must be freed. \"I think the bigger picture here that we all need to keep focus on is that tomorrow's hearing has momentous implications, whether the government can act in violation of the Constitution, to deport someone, is front and center, and our position is that it cannot,\" said Johnny Sinodis, another one of Khalil's lawyers. TRUMP VOWS ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST MAHMOUD KHALIL WAS 'FIRST ARREST OF MANY TO COME' Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the administration's vow to deport Hamas sympathizers.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci/Getty Images) The attorneys also accused the Trump administration of forum \"shopping\" in an effort to argue their case against Khalil in a friendly court. \"Just as the government was trying to manipulate jurisdictional rules to keep Mahmood out of federal courts in New York and New Jersey and into the federal circuit in Louisiana where the law is very favorable to the government,\" said Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Azmy said government lawyers are trying to argue the case in immigration court, which \"has to largely accept what the secretary of state has said about Mahmood and largely defer to the executive's conclusions about the fact that he is a threat to foreign policy simply because the secretary of state says without analysis or evidence.\" President Trump, Mahmoud Khalil, protesters(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khalil was arrested by U.S.Immigration and Customs Enforcementofficials on March 8. The Trump administration has targeted noncitizen, anti-Israel protesters for deportation.

Democrat Maura Sullivan, in an interview with Fox News, said \"our country clearly needs a new generation of leadership, period. And the Democratic Party needs new leadership, and I'm running to be one of those leaders.\" Sullivan said in a statement announcing her candidacy in the race to succeed four-term Democrat Rep. Chris Pappas, \"I am stepping up to serve because the issues we are facing aren’t Democrat or Republican issues, they’re American issues.\" Pappas last week launched a campaign to succeed longtime Democrat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who recently said she would retire at the end of next year rather than bid for a fourth six-year term representingNew Hampshirein the Senate.

The race is expected to be expensive and competitive. This is Sullivan'ssecond bid for Congressin the district. She came in second to Pappas in a crowded 11-candidate Democrat primary in 2018, when the congressman first won the office. Sullivan, a New Hampshire Democratic Party vice chair, took aim at PresidentDonald Trumpand his most visible White House adviser in a campaign launch video she posted on social media. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN TAKES AIM AT TRUMP, MUSK IN SENATE CAMPAIGN LAUNCH \"I saw too many of my fellow Marines give their lives for this country to just sit by and watch Donald Trump and Elon Musk tear it down,\" Sullivan said in avideo shared on X. \"They’re driving up costs for New Hampshire families, making it even more difficult to own a home and pay the bills. And that's why I'm running for Congress, to protect the promise of America and ensure a better future for our kids.\" Sullivan, in her Fox News Digital interview, said that \"I'm hearing from folks all around New Hampshire that they're worried, they're scared, they're frustrated, and I am too.\" HOUSE GOP CAMPAIGN CHAIR TELLS FOX NEWS WHAT HE'S MOST CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENDING THE MAJORITY Maura Sullivan, left, meets with Democratic Party officials and activists after announcing her candidacy for the U.S. House in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District on April 10, 2025, in Manchester, N.H.(Maura Sullivan campaign) While Sullivan is the first major candidate to enter the race, she likely won't be the last.

    "title": "ICE reveals sanctuary jurisdictions that have released the most criminal aliens",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Lawrence Jones breaks down the latest sanctuary policy data on \"Fox & Friends,\" and Jessica Vaughan discusses the findings of her report that reveals which sanctuary cities released thousands of criminals. New U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency records show that more than 25,000 of the agency’s detainer requests were declined by sanctuary jurisdictions throughout the country over the last few years, resulting in the release of dozens ofillegal immigrantsconvicted of homicide. A total of 72 criminal aliens withhomicide convictions or chargeswere released from U.S. jails despite having ICE detainers between Oct. 1, 2022, and Feb. 6, 2025, according to ICE data provided to the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which tracks the immigration laws of states and local municipalities. Seventeen of those releases came from just three detention centers: the Illinois River Corrections Center and Santa Clara County jails, which released six, and the Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois, which released five. THOUSANDS LEAVE COUNTRY VOLUNTARILY AMID TRUMP SELF-DEPORT PUSH, DHS SAYS California Gov. Gavin Newsom; Santa Clara County Main Jail (Getty) The data comes as debate over \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, those that limit or ban local cooperation with federal immigration authorities, has intensified asPresident Donald Trumphas doubled down on his campaign promise of mass deportations. Trump has hinted at federal action against the jurisdictions in recent weeks, including a Truth Social post Thursday in which the president threatened to withhold federal funding. \"No more Sanctuary Cities! They protect the Criminals, not the Victims,\" Trump wrote in the post. \"They are disgracing our Country, and are being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps to exist!!!\" Meanwhile, the ICE data provided insight into which jurisdictions were the least compliant with the agency’s detainer requests. Those numbers show that more than half (52%) of the declined detainer requests were from jails inCalifornia, which is considered a sanctuary state by CIS. President Donald Trump has doubled down on campaign promises of mass deportations.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) IMMIGRATION THINK TANK COOKS UP SCHEME TO USE ‘SNITCHES’ TO FORCE MIGRANTS TO SELF-DEPORT Other states with a large share of declined detainers were Illinois, Virginia, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Illinois, Massachusetts and Connecticut are all sanctuary states, according to CIS, while Virginia does not have a statewide sanctuary policy but is home to dozens of jurisdictions with their own such policies. \"It’s shocking that over half of the declined detainers were refused by jails and prisons in California,\" Alfonso Aguilar, the director of Hispanic engagement at the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. \"Gov. [Gavin] Newsom and mayors in the state have a lot of explaining to do to their constituents.\" Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment. The main jail in Santa Clara County was responsible for the highest number of declined detainers, the ICE data showed, with nearly 3,000 criminal aliens being released during the 2022-2025 period.

Gavin Newsom has overseen the sanctuary state of California, the state with the highest portion of declined ICE detainers.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cook County Jail in Illinois and Fairfax County Adult Detention Center in Virginia were also responsible for a large share of released criminal aliens, with both declining more than 1,000 ICE detainers during the same period. \"What’s happening in these jurisdictions is unconscionable,\" Aguilar said. \"Their leaders evidently don’t believe that illegal immigrants that have been charged or convicted with crimes should be removed from their communities. And by ignoring ICE detainers and releasing them into the community, they’re putting in danger the lives and property of their citizens.\" Michael Lee is a writer for Fox News.

Gabe Evans about the GOP’s first 90 days in Congress and what to expect for the future EXCLUSIVE:FreshmanGOP CongressmanGabe Evans revealed during an interview with Fox News Digital how Republicans have fared, and what's next, after 90 days of the new session of Congress have now passed. \"Obviously, the Republican conference has come together three times to do things that all the pundits said weren't going to happen,\" Evans told Fox News Digital this week. \"We had a speaker on the first ballot and people said we weren't gonna be able to do that. We passed the reconciliation resolution out of the House. Folks said that that was gonna be a long shot. And we kept the government funded by passing a clean CR. And so three different times we've seen the conference pull together to do things many folks were doubtful that we could get done.\" Evans said he believes that success will continue to \"breed success.\" \"I think that is going to lay just some absolutely fantastic foundational groundwork for being able to actually deliver the big things that we need to deliver, particularly around cost of living and affordability,\" Evans said. 'FULL COURT PRESS': FRESHMAN GOP LAWMAKER REVEALS BLUEPRINT TO FLIP SCRIPT ON GREEN ENERGY MANDATES Fox News Digital spoke to GOP Rep. Gabe Evans about his first 90 days in Congress.(Getty) Evans, a former captain in the National Guard and former police officer, was elected to Congress in November, defeating incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District. Evans told Fox News Digital he has been very \"excited\" over the past three months to work on issues he campaigned on, including securing the border, ending the \"scourge of fentanyl\" and working to lowercrime rates. \"It's been really, really rewarding to be able to do things like pass the the Halt Fentanyl Act out of the U.S. House, introduce my bill, the Uplift Act, unhandcuffing police to locate and interdict foreign transgressors so that we can empower state and local law enforcements and sanctuary states like Colorado to work with their federal counterparts to get violent criminals and cartel members who are illegally present in the country and committing other crimes out of the community. For me that's been the flavor of the first three months.\" TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 'TAKE A LOOK' AT EXEMPTING SOME LARGER US COMPANIES HIT ESPECIALLY HARD BY TARIFFS The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.(Fox News Digital) Evans, who has introduced six bills since becoming a member of Congress, said he is looking forward to continuing moving legislation forward, including the bipartisan Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act and theUplift Act. Over the next few months, Evans told Fox News Digital that his constituents in Colorado want Congress to focus on issues like cost of living. \"We actually just did a town hall earlier this week. We had over 8,500 people dial in and stay on the line for that town hall and we did some just unofficial polling with all of the people who were on the line and the number one issue, no surprise, that came up was cost of living,\" Evans said. \"So being able to deliver relief in that cost of Living space by being able to work on cutting through just some of the absolute punitive red tape that's out there that particularly impacts my district around things like energy production, like agricultural production, like air quality permitting.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Donald Trump(Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Evans told Fox News Digital that Republicans will also continue to address crime and illegal immigration, which he says the president has already made important strides on. \"In the crime space, what we're really seeing now is a push-pull between the priorities of the new administration and Congress and blue sanctuary cities and states like Colorado and like Denver,\" Evans explained. \"So here's the fact, Denver's homicide rate in 2024 was double San Francisco's homicide rates. Colorado is number one in the nation again, three of the last five years running, for our auto theft rate. We're number two in the nation for teenagers overdosing and dying on fentanyl. We're the third most dangerous state in the country and so that fixing that problem requires a partnership between the federal state and local government.\" \"Under the new administration in this Congress, the federal government has suddenly gotten back to business and is doing their part. The border is secured. Border crossings are at historic lows and we have federal law enforcement agencies. who are going out into communities like mine and getting violent criminals and gangs and drug traffickers out of the community.\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

    "article_text": "Columbia University student Jonas Du responds to a report that the government pressed former interim university President Katrina Armstrong over campus antisemitism issues. After Columbia University took steps to align itself with President Donald Trump's demands regarding antisemitism on its campus, the Trump administration now reportedly wants to take additional steps to ensure Columbia does not falter. Sources in the administration leaked to theWall Street Journalthat it is pursuing a legal arrangement, known as a consent decree, that would create a court-enforced compliance agreement to make certain that Columbia continues to align its policies and practices with executive directives on antisemitism laid down by Trump. After facing thethreat of losing $400 million in federal fundingover its response to alleged antisemitism on its campus, Columbia took steps to revise its policies and practices. These included changes to its protesting policies, an expansion of the school's Jewish studies program, placing the school's Middle Eastern studies program under new supervision, alterations to student disciplinary procedures and more. IVY LEAGUE ANTI-ISRAEL RINGLEADER MAHMOUD KHALIL DENIES ALLEGATIONS AS JUDGE AWAITS DEPORTATION EVIDENCE Columbia University's Gaza encampment; President Donald Trump(Getty Images) To ensure those changes last, the Trump administration is reportedly moving to usher in a consent decree, which could place Columbia in contempt of court if a judge determines that the school is not in compliance with the administration's directives. Such violations could lead to further monetary penalties for Columbia. Whilethe Trump administrationhas said Columbia is on the \"right track\" to restore its $400 million in federal funding, no formal announcement has been made indicating it has been. The consent decree must be voluntary, so Columbia must be a willing partner in the arrangement, or it can fight the matter in court. \"The University remains in active dialogue with the Federal Government to restore its critical research funding,\" a spokesperson for the University told Fox News Digital.

Under formerPresident Joe Biden, the government entered into consent decree arrangements with police departments to ensure they were implementing the president's desired criminal justice reforms. Biden also pursued these legal arrangements with various universities, including Brown and Rutgers, over antisemitism concerns after the Hamas Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israeli, according to the Wall Street Journal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the sources who leaked the information about the consent decree arrangement, the Trump administration is pursuing the matter because it has doubts about Columbia's desire to follow the president's federal directives on antisemitism in good faith, despite its public actions to do so.

    "article_text": "Entrepreneur Shawn Meaike speculates how President Trump’s DEI crackdowns could affect businesses in the private sector in an interview with Fox News Digital. President Donald Trumphas extended the deadline to April 24 for states and school districts to certify compliance with his executive order banning DEI policies, a Department of Education spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital. \"Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right. When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal anti-discrimination requirements,\" acting Assistant Secretary Craig Trainor said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.\" So far, several states have either certified their compliance or signaled their intent to do so, while blue stateslike New York, Minnesota and Illinois signaled defiance this week in the face of the administration's funding threat. Education Secretary Linda McMahon commended Puerto Rico in a post on X \"for being the first to certify that discrimination or harmful race-preferencing is not allowed in your classrooms.\" TRUMP ADMIN WARNS STATES TO COMPLY WITH HOUSING PRISONERS BY THEIR BIOLOGICAL SEX OR FACE FUNDING CUTOFF President Donald Trump and a DEI book(Getty Images) \"Every state that wants to continue receiving federal funds should follow suit,\" McMahon said Tuesday. On Monday, Willie Jett, Minnesota's education commissioner, said DEI-related funding threats \"without backing in law or established requirements put key programs at risk that students and schools depend on every day.\" Illinois' educationboard also issued a scathing response to the threats, saying the administration \"is once again threatening funding for Illinois’ children and attempting to exert power over every district in the country — even as it claims it’s returning education to the states.\" DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOLED OUT OVER $200M TO UNIVERSITIES TO INJECT DEI INTO COUNSELING COURSES: REPORT \"Illinois will never waver in its commitment to helping every child from every community, background, socioeconomic status, gender, and race — which is consistent with federal and state laws and our values,\" the board said in a statement.

Linda McMahon testifies at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.(Jack Gruber/USA Today Network via Imagn Images) Wisconsin is also bucking Trump's demands, and the state's Department of Public Instruction publisheda letterraising \"several concerns\" with the president's certification requirements Wednesday. Benjamin Jones, an attorney representing Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction, wrote in a letter that Wisconsin had already \"certified assurances of compliance with federal law,\" including \"federal statutesrelated to nondiscrimination.\" He called Trump's order \"unauthorized, unlawful and unconstitutionally vague.\" NEW YORK PREPARES TO BATTLE TRUMP’S DEI FUNDING THREATS IN FIGHT OVER SCHOOLS \"We are deeply concerned that the [certification requirement] allows the federal bureaucracy to threaten the loss of crucial education funding in order to dictate local education agency policies and decisions on what is best for kids,\" the letter states. But Trump is gaining support from other Republican-led states, and several are already pushing for stricter bans on DEI initiatives at public colleges. States like West Virginia, Iowa, Indiana, Texas and Ohio have considered or put forth measures to restrict DEI programs, training and scholarships. In Ohio, the state Senate passed a bill to eliminate DEI-related activities, while Indiana’s Senate proposed legislation that would prohibit faculty members from endorsing DEI with penalties for noncompliance. New Hampshire's Department of Education has advised school leaders to evaluate their DEI programs for compliance with the new federal directives, and the Indiana Department of Education also announced it will collect signatures from districts and schools verifying their compliance.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy previews on 'The Story' President Donald Trump's upcoming executive orders for the defense department. Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethquipped that the Trump administration has wiped out \"99.9%\" of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from the military during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. PresidentDonald Trumpquestioned Hegseth about whether the military had eradicated 100% of DEI efforts under his leadership, as Cabinet members shared updates on their own agencies' attempts to purge such policies. \"99.9, sir – I’m going to get that last point,\" Hegseth said. The Trump administration has unveiled multiple initiatives to curb DEI initiatives within the military, including signing an executive order in January barring transgender people from enlisting and serving openly in the military. However, two federal judges issued nationwide injunctions in March blocking the Trump administration from enforcing the ban while the lawsuit is pending. In a judgment rendered on March 19, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes of Washington, D.C., said the Trump administration’s order was \"soaked in animus,\" and discriminated based on a person's transgender status. A SECOND FEDERAL JUDGE RULES AGAINST TRUMP'S REMOVAL OF TRANSGENDER TROOPS Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview outside the White House, on March 21, 2025.(AP/Mark Schiefelbein) \"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in the decision. Trump signed another executive order in January banning DEI content in K–12 schools that receive federal funds. While military service academies were originally exempt since they are not classified as K–12 institutions, the Pentagon issued instructions to the Naval Academy to remove DEI-related books from its library in March. Included in the list of nearly 400 books purged are \"How to be Anti-Racist\" and \"Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America\" by Ibram X. Kendi, as well as \"Our Time is Now: Power, Purpose, and the Fight for a Fair America,\" by former Georgia Rep. Stacey Abrams.

    "article_text": "President Trump said he has heard of worse things when asked about China’s retaliation of tariffs by targeting the import of U.S. films. China announced the immediate restriction of imported American films as the country retaliated against PresidentDonald Trump’sescalated U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese goods. Trump was asked about his reaction to China’s latest move of targeting cultural exports from the U.S. on Thursday during a cabinet meeting. \"I think I've heard of worse things,\" the president said, which was followed by a room full of laughter. Reuters reported that the financial impact would likely be minimal, according to industry experts, but mainly because box office returns have significantly declined inrecent years in China. TRUMP TARIFF SPIKE FUELS NEW HOUSE BILL TO LOCK CHINA OUT OF US GOVERNMENT TECH China's President Xi Jinping, left, and President Donald Trump.(Getty Images) For about 30 years, China imported 10Hollywood moviesannually. But the National Film Administration (NFA) in Beijing said on its website that Trump’s tariffs would continue to sour its domestic demand for American movies in China. \"We will follow market rules, respect the audience's choices, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported,\" the NFA said on its website. China was once looked to by Hollywood to help boost the box office performance of movies, since the former is the world’s second-largest film market. TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 'TAKE A LOOK' AT EXEMPTING SOME LARGER US COMPANIES HIT ESPECIALLY HARD BY TARIFFS Hollywood sign in California.(Joshua Comins/Fox News) China’s domestic movies, though, are increasingly outperforming American movies shown in China. For instance, Pixar’s \"Inside Out 2\" was eclipsed by \"Ne Zha 2\" to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, Reuters reported. Hollywood movies now only account for 5% of the overall box office receipts in China. Hollywood studios also only receive 25% of ticket sales in China, though in other markets, they take in double their profits.

    "title": "3 senators lead effort to ban Chinese-owned GNC from military installations over spying concerns",
    "article_text": "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett discusses the trade progress after President Donald Trump paused most global tariffs for 90 days FIRST ON FOX:Efforts to remove Chinese-owned GNC from U.S. military bases gained momentum this week as Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., introduced companion legislation to a House-led bill targeting the nutrition retailer. Some 85 GNC stores currently operate on American military installations. Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C., first introduced a bill to ban the company from doing business on American bases, citing national security and espionage concerns. Now, fellowNorth CarolinaRepublican Budd is leading a similar effort in the Senate, decrying the stores as hubs to \"exploit personal data.\" Budd, joined by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., introduced the Military Installation Retail Security Act, which would prohibit the Department of Defense from allowing businesses owned by adversarial nations – including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – to operate on U.S. bases. CHINESE-OWNED GNC STORES OPERATING ON US MILITARY BASES SPARK NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS Sen. Ted Budd was one of three GOP senators who signed onto a bill to ban the Defense Department from authorizing companies owned by adversarial nations on U.S. bases.(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) At North Carolina’s Fort Bragg, four GNC stores service approximately 53,700 troops, nearly 10% of the U.S. Army. \"Adversarial nations have no place owning and operating businesses on U.S. military bases, all the while gaining personal identification information of American citizens, just to turn a profit,\" Budd said in a statement. \"We shouldn’t be allowing Chinese-affiliated companies in the United States, let alone on our military bases. This bill will ensure our adversaries can’t exploit our military,\" Cotton added. While much of Congress has focused on preventing Chinese land acquisitions near U.S. military installations, Harrigan said he was alarmed to find that a Chinese-owned company was already operating on U.S. bases largely unnoticed. \"It’s even crazier [than foreign land purchases],\" Harrigan told Fox News Digital last week. In June 2020, vitamin retailer GNC filed for bankruptcy and was fully acquired by Harbin Pharmaceuticals – a partially state-owned Chinese enterprise that had already purchased a 40% stake in the company in 2018. ​​​​HEGSETH SAYS PANAMA AGREED TO ALLOW US WARSHIPS TO TRAVEL 'FIRST AND FREE' THROUGH CANAL GNC was acquired by Chinese Harbin pharmaceuticals in 2020.(Reuters/Mario Anzuoni) In 2019, GNC agreed to integrate its manufacturing with International Vitamin Corporation (IVC), which has a consortium of Chinese investors. The company, founded in Pittsburgh, had already been operating on U.S. bases for years at the time of its sale, and thus its potential to help with Chinese surveillance on military bases was overlooked. Roughly 85 GNC stores on military installations operate under \"long-term concessions\" contracts, meaning they are operated, staffed and supplied directly by GNC. \"I’m glad to have Sen. Budd step in to help drive this forward and make sure CCP-owned companies have zero place inside America’s military infrastructure,\" Harrigan said of the new Senate bill. In a statement to Fox News Digital, a GNC spokesperson pushed back on the legislation, saying: \"Our systems are independently monitored and meet strict federal standards, partaking in multiple audits throughout the year.\" \"We love our military customers. Their well-being, whether it’s their personal health or the safety of their information, will always come first. We’re honored to be part of their communities and will continue to safeguard their information just like we do all our customers,\" GNC said. Harrigan said the stores could identify individuals with vulnerabilities by tracking frequent purchases of testosterone, sleep aids or any other supplements. It could also potentially monitor deployment cycles based on changes in buying patterns, he added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In-store WiFi and mobile data tracking could reveal troop geolocations, Harrigan claimed, and loyalty apps or promo emails could be used to embed malicious links or software. \"This should be common sense,\" said Scott. \"Allowing companies controlled by our biggest foreign adversaries – like Communist China, Russia and North Korea – to operate on U.S. military bases is a completely unacceptable threat.\"",

    "title": "Trump admin warns states to comply with housing prisoners by their biological sex or face funding cutoff",
    "article_text": "State Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Maine, joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the president's clash with Maine Gov. Janet Mills over his executive order to protect women's sports. FIRST ON FOX:A Trump administration official confirmed Thursday that states failing to comply with federal orders to house inmates based on their biological sex can expect \"imminent changes\" – andMaine\"will not be the last\" state to have prison funds slashed. While theTrump administration's decision to pull federal funding from Maine’s Department of Corrections due to a transgender inmate being housed in a women’s facility is not an isolated case, similar situations involving transgender inmates in female facilities have occurred across the country. In addition to Maine, California, New York, Minnesota, New Jersey and Washington state allow transgender people to be housed in jail and prison facilities that align with their gender identity. Most provide transgender treatments on thetaxpayer dimeor through other sources of state funding, though it may vary from prison to prison. Following a consent decree, Colorado is the only state to have housing facilities specific for transgender people. MAINE TRANSGENDER INMATE CONVICTED OF MURDERING PARENTS MOVED TO WOMEN'S PRISON Trump vowed to slash funding for Maine's Department of Corrections. Another transgender inmate in Maine filed a complaint against the DOC for not doing enough to facilitate his gender transition treatments.(Maine DOC/Getty Images) The official, who declined to be identified, explained that while much of prison funding is handled at the state level, states still must comply with their own versions of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), which is often modeled after federal standards. As federal changes to those regulations are expected, current PREA guidelines discourage housing inmates in isolation. That, the spokesperson said, has led some states to feel obligated to house transgender women in female facilities, even if they might prefer to create separate spaces. \"I think that that's a state call. But, right now, states are really not encouraged to make that call,\" the official said. \"They're encouraged to put those men with women. So, I think some states will just put these men dressed as women, with the men. Some of them will put them in some sort of separate space. I have no opinion on which is better.\" Prior to Trump's executive order prohibiting trans procedures and treatments in federal prisons, federal funding was allotted to some Bureau of Prisons facilities to cover cosmetic procedures and treatments that were considered \"gender-affirming\" for incarcerated men – but not provided to women – such as laser hair removal and other feminine procedures. Guidelines for such services were first earmarked under the Obama administration's second term,and Californiawas the first state to establish policies granting transgender surgeries to state prison inmates in 2017. TRANS INMATE IN PRISON FOR KILLING BABY MUST GET GENDER SURGERY AT 'EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY': JUDGE A new lawsuit against AG Pam Bondi and BOP acting director William Lothrop claims President Donald Trump's executive order revoking taxpayer-funded medical procedures and treatments for transgender inmates will endanger them as more are expected to be moved back to facilities matching their biological sex.(Getty Images) The administration argues this created a clear case of sex-based discrimination, as in the case of Maine, where women in prison were not afforded similar access to those services. In January, a transgender woman named Andrea Balcer, 24, was moved from the Maine State Prison to the women’s section of the Maine Correctional Institute. Balcer was convicted in 2018 of stabbing both parents to death, along with the family dog, and was sentenced to 40 years in prison for a crime that was attributed to struggles with gender identity. \"UnderAttorney General Bondi, the Department of Justice is committed to keeping Americans safe and using taxpayer money to ruthlessly and efficiently go after criminals,\" a DOJ spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement Thursday. \"The Department will no longer fund organizations that promote the invasion of women’s spaces by men and urges states to use commonsense to keep women and girls safe.\" Another transgender inmate in Maine – convicted of murdering a woman who was found tied between two trees with her throat and wrists slit – was identified by Fox News Digital through court documents as Walter William Moore. Moore goes by \"Nikki,\" according to the documents, and complained that Maine corrections weren't doing enough to facilitate his gender transition. ACLU SUES INDIANA OVER DENIAL OF SEX REASSIGNMENT SURGERY FOR INMATE WHO STRANGLED 11-MONTH-OLD TO DEATH In January, Moore, who is currently housed in a male facility, filed a complaint against Maine Department of Corrections employees, alleging assault, theft of thousands of dollars in personal property, and denial of requested gender transition treatments. In court testimony, Moore frequently referenced \"Nikki,\" claiming prison wardens promised gender reassignment surgery, feminine cosmetics, and transfer to a women’s facility.

This figure does not account for state-level facilities, which may also receive federal funding. The Trump administration is also in court battling the president's executive mandate to strip federal prisons of gender-transition treatments and housing preferences. In February, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth – a Reagan-appointed judge – temporarily blocked the transfer of three transgender women to men's prisons, citing concerns over their safety. Later that month, another judge issued a restraining order preventing the transfer of a transgender woman from a women's prison to a men's facility. In March,Lamberth ordered the BOPto return two transgender inmates to women's facilities and continue their hormone therapy treatments. Fox News Digital's Greg Wehner contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and ‘Gutfeld!’ guests discuss how Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz seems to be heading back out into the political landscape and urging Democrats to be ‘proud’ of their policies. Veterans heckled Gov.Tim Walz, D-Minn., for stolen valor claims during remarks at a veterans rally at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul on Wednesday. As Walz welcomed the veterans to the Capitol for the annual \"Veterans Day on the Hill,\" he was met by a fiery crowd who called him a \"coward\" and criticized him for sympathizing with China, according tofootage captured by KSTP. \"Coward! You sympathize with the Chinese!\" some veterans holding American flags and \"take action\" signs shouted at the Democratic governor as he welcomed them to the Capitol. \"Sir, you're welcome to come… Let me finish!\" Walz replied as he tried to ease tensions while another veteran shouted: \"Shut your f---ing mouth!\" WISCONSINITES KICKED OUT AND DENIED ENTRY TO THIS DEMOCRAT'S 'FAKE TOWN HALL' Minnesota Gov.

VETERANS INCREASINGLY CALLING OUT WALZ'S MILITARY RECORD: 'SHAMEFUL' Footage of the hecklers disrupting Walz's remarks has gone viral on social media, with conservative influencers celebrating the criticism. Walz faced accusations of stolen valor during the 2024 presidential election for inconsistencies describing his military service. Walz is a veteran, having served in the Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced accusations of stolen valor on the campaign trail for inconsistencies describing his military service.(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The former vice presidential candidate was accused of stolen valor for retiring just months before his battalion deployed to Iraq as war raged in the Middle East following the 9/11 attacks. Walz put in his papers for retirement at least five months before his battalion received deployment orders, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Walz was also discovered to have claimed several times that he retired as a command sergeant major, which is not accurate — he reverted to his previous rank upon retirement because he did not complete the necessary corresponding coursework, the National Guard has said. Walz's decades-longties to Chinaalso came to light when Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate last summer. He worked briefly in China as a teacher, traveling to Guangdong in 1989 for a teaching-abroad program to teach English and American history. Walz was initially believed to have made dozens of trips to China over his lifetime, but a campaign spokesperson later tried to walk that number back and said he made approximately 15 visits to China. He also boasted about Minnesota hosting several top Chinese leaders in a letter unearthed by Fox News Digital.

Tim Walz speaks at a campaign event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Oct. 14, 2024.(AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) The 2024 campaign trail brought Walz's inconsistencies regarding his background into the national conversation. Walz said he \"misspoke\" when he claimed he visited Hong Kong during the 1989Tiananmen Square protestsand incorrectly claimed his family used in vitro fertilization. Walz laughed off the missteps, calling himself a \"knucklehead.\" The Commanders' Task Force and Minnesota Association of County Veterans Service Officers hosted the rally in the Rotunda that erupted in boos for Walz on Wednesday.

Cases of aninvasive strainof strep throat have been steadily rising in some areas of the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The surveillance study, which was published in JAMA, showed that the incidence ofgroup A Streptococcus(GAS) infection \"substantially increased\" from 2013 to 2022. Affected states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Tennessee. STREP THROAT INFECTIONS HAVE SPIKED ABOVE PRE-COVID HIGHS, SAYS REPORT: ‘WE’VE MISSED CASES' The overall incidence more than doubled, going from 3.6 to 8.2 cases per 100,000 persons at that time, according to the findings. For the past near-decade, cases of group A Streptococcus (GAS) have been on the rise in 10 U.S. states.(iStock) Infection rates were higher among residents of long-term care facilities, thehomeless populationand injection drug users. While incidence was highest among people 65 and older, the relative increase over time was biggest among adults aged 18 to 64. \"Accelerated efforts to prevent and control GAS are needed, especially among groups at highest risk of infection,\" the CDC researchers concluded in the study. NOROVIRUS SICKENS OVER 200 CRUISE SHIP PASSENGERS ON MONTH-LONG VOYAGE According to a CIDRAP press release by the University of Minnesota, GAS is most known for causing non-invasive diseases likestrep throatand impetigo. The strain can also cause more severe infections, like sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. GAS can lead to more severe infections, like sepsis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.(iStock) The researchers identified 21,213 cases of invasive GAS, leading to 20,247 hospitalizations and 1,981 deaths. Bacteremic cellulitis was the most common disease caused by GAS, according to the press release, followed by septic shock, pneumonia and bacteria in the bloodstream without an apparent cause (known as bacteremia without focus). \"The recent assault of viruses, including COVID-19, has weakened people’s immune systems.\" In an accompanying JAMA editorial, Joshua Osowicki, MBBS, PhD, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, said there has been a global uptick in GAS cases following theCOVID-19 pandemic. \"In any of its forms — from skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, or sepsis without a clear clinical focus — invasive GAS can be insidious and unpredictable, testing the lifesaving capacity of even the world’s most advanced medical facilities,\" he wrote. \"We really need a vaccine against this, but don’t have it,\" Dr. Marc Siegel shared.(iStock) \"Surges of invasive and noninvasive GAS disease in 2022 and 2023 have been reported in countries spanning the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with new reports of the same phenomenon still coming to light.\" Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented that GAS requiresearly intervention, as it can be \"quite life-threatening\" and \"misperceived\" as something milder.

So, they ran a little action to the right side of the wing. [Florida’s] Will [Richard] and Alijah [Martin] did a good job of pressuring the ball. Sharp kinda slipped down there to the baseline. I thought he was going to set a back screen for Roberts, so I kinda got stuck down there in the paint a little bit. HOUSTON'S KELVIN SAMPSON ON FINAL POSSESSION IN TITLE LOSS: ‘YOU’VE GOTTA GET A SHOT' \"He ended up slipping it, so then just thinking in my head, ‘Get out there and contest the shot.’ [I] jumped to the side, he ended up kinda pump-faking, throwing the ball down, and I’ll definitely say I was a little surprised they didn’t get a shot off knowing you have to get one off in the moment.\" Clayton and the Gators are not complaining a shot was never put up by Houston. Cougars head coach Kelvin Sampson admitted his own surprise during his postgame comments, saying, \"You’ve gotta get a shot\" in that situation. Clayton gave some insight into what the Gators were looking for on the other end of the floor when play resumed. \"We talked about them running a flare screen for Cryer or a back screen for Roberts,\" Clayton said. \"So, we felt those were going to be the two options they went to. They ended up throwing us off with that little surprise, but we were ready for anything to happen.\" Houston Cougars guard Emanuel Sharp (21) shoots against Florida Gators guard Walter Clayton Jr. (1) in the second half in the 2025 national championship game at the Alamodome.(Robert Deutsch/Imagn Images) Looking back at the final play, it appeared Houston had a play for Cryer, who took the ball up, to get it again after some screens were set. But Florida sniffed it out, and Richard was right in his face when he received the pass. Sharp then ran away from Clayton to meet Cryer for a pass, and he was hoping to get off a 3-pointer for the win. But Clayton timed his jump perfectly, and the rest goes down in history as Florida won its first title since 2007. \"Man, it feels great,\" Clayton said when asked about being a national champion. \"I honestly can’t even explain the feeling. Me and some of the guys are still talking about it. It still doesn’t feel real, but it’s just a great feeling to bring it back to Gainesville.\" Alijah Martin, Walter Clayton Jr. and Thomas Haugh pose in front of Raising Cane's.(Raising Cane's ) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Clayton was with Martin and Thomas Haugh at Raising Cane's, as were hundreds of Gators fans celebrating the title.

    "article_text": "Ed McCaffrey, father of NFL superstar Christian McCaffrey, reveals the approach he took with his son's diet to achieve athletic excellence. Youth sports in America are more competitive than ever, especially football. One man with a track record of raising boys who can thrive isSuper Bowlchampion wide receiver Ed McCaffrey. McCaffrey is the father to superstar San Francisco 49ers running backChristian McCaffrey, Washington Commanders wide receiver Luke McCaffrey, Miami Dolphins assistant coach Max McCaffrey and former college quarterback Dylan McCaffrey. \"We were lucky. We had great kids who were very competitive, very motivated. We did set certain standards. Academics were important to us. We wanted to get them a good education, so if they didn't play well in the classroom, they wouldn't be allowed to play sports,\" Ed said.

Ed believed in parental intervention after moments of adversity in sports in particular. \"After the game, if things don't go well, either for them personally or their team, or if they're injured, or any time they're going through a tough time, as a parent, you want to build their spirit back up, pat them on the back and say ‘try again,’\" he said. 2025 NFL DRAFT WR AND TE RANKINGS: TYLER WARREN THE NEXT GRONK? For young athletes, Ed McCaffrey believes wins and losses are less significant than the individual mindset of competing. \"If you play to win and give your best effort, then you've already won, regardless of what the scoreboard is,\" he said. \"It's not about winning every single game. We all want to win, but you're not going to win every game you play.

McDonough/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images) For McCaffrey and his sons, arguably the most critical aspect to their athletic success was their day-to-day lifestyle, especially diet and getting enough sleep. The vast majority of the McCaffrey sons' meals were cooked at home by their mother, Lisa McCaffrey, Ed said, adding Lisa prepared dinner for the boys \"every night.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Due to the boys' constant athletic activity, the parents increased the amount of red meat and dairy they ate to higher levels than what is recommended for the average adult. \"Kids can consume a little more red meat, a little more fat, more dairy,\" McCaffrey said. Sticking with homemade food was even more important when it came to snacks before sporting events. If Ed or Lisa gave them any food at all before games or practice, it had to be free of certain ingredients and \"easily digestible.\" SiriusXM host Ed McCaffrey and NFL running back Christian McCaffrey of the Carolina Panthers pose for photos at SiriusXM at Super Bowl LIV Jan. 30, 2020, in Miami, Fla.(Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) \"It's hard to consume food before an event becausemost foodshave things in them that are hard to digest, but they have additives in them that affect your gut, and it's hard to go and compete,\" Ed said. \"It was so important for us when they were growing up to give them healthy snacks that were easy to digest.\" One of the most common snacks Ed and Lisa fed their sons was homemade protein bites, which has since inspired the family to release its own line of McCaffrey Protein Bites with similar ingredients. Those ingredients include flaxseed, brown rice and pea protein. They also made sure to keep peanuts out of the bites because of their sons' allergies.

    "title": "How thieves use new credit card numbers before you receive them",
    "article_text": "H Squared Research's Hitha Herzog says consumers have been financing their lives on \"Your World.\" Imagine receiving a notification about suspicious charges on acredit cardyou haven’t even received yet. How could that happen? While it sounds surprising and unsettling, it's increasingly common due to the rise of digital credit card fraud. Criminals no longer need physical cards to make unauthorized transactions, thanks to methods such as data breaches, phishing schemes andcard-not-present fraud. Here's how these schemes work and what steps you should take immediately to protect yourself. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Even if a new credit card hasn’t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn’t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you’ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens. If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email ormalware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox. Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their ownApple Payor Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions. Illustration of someone using their digital wallet(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in aphishing attackor large-scaledata breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities. Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider usingInformed Delivery by USPSto track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A person using their new credit card(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW CYBERSCAMS ARE DRAINING AMERICANS' WALLETS BY THE BILLIONS If you find yourself in this situation where fraudulent charges appear on a card you haven’t received yet, take these steps right away. 1. Change login credentials:Update all login information with your bank or credit card company, including: If your account is linked to an email address that may also be compromised, update the password for that email account as well.Many fraudsters gain access by first hacking your email, which can give them entry to password-reset links and sensitive notifications. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 2. Use strong antivirus software:If spyware or a keylogger has been installed on your device, it can continue to steal sensitive data, such as passwords and personal information, even after you change your credentials. To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): AddMFAto all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 4. Use an identity theft protection service:Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 5. Invest in personal data removal services:Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number. 7. Notify law enforcement:File a report with theFederal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record. DON’T LET THIS CREDIT CARD FRAUD NIGHTMARE HAPPEN TO YOU So, we've uncovered how those sneaky credit card charges can surface even before you've held the card in your hands. It's a reflection of the increasingly digital world we live in, where our personal information can be vulnerable in surprising ways. Remember, use strong antivirus software and consider a personal data removal service to minimize your online footprint. If you find yourself in this situation, act fast by changing your passwords, enabling multifactor authentication and reporting the issue to your card company.

    "article_text": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explains President Donald Trump’s tariff pause and evaluates the market reaction on ‘Special Report.’ Big media and big finance insisted the financial sky was falling this week, but withPresident Donald Trump, you never know exactly where you are in any deal-making process. Weighing in too soon can make you look stupid. On Wednesday, the deal-maker in chief announced a 90-day pause onsky-high tariffsdirected at 75 nations which did not retaliate against his measures and have asked the administration for a reprieve and time to negotiate. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT Democrats, and a fair number of free-marketeer conservatives to boot, celebrated Trump\"caving\" to the pressureof the financial markets. But when the smoke settled, it was clear that, far from folding, Trump had instituted a historic tariff regime, and somehow got a stock market rally out of it. By Thursday morning, Trump had slammed communist China with a whopping 125% tariff, maintained a 25% penalty on certain goods from Canada and Mexico, placed a blanket tariff of 10% on most of the rest of world, and had nations lined up outside the White House to negotiate like it was the Olympic opening ceremonies. Make no mistake, as little as two months ago, those accusing Trump of folding would have called the tariffs he landed at on Wednesday unconscionable, but after the past week’s turmoil, the largest tariff increase in decades looked like a moderate, market-soothing compromise. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explains President Donald Trump's tariff policy pivot on 'Special Report.'(Getty Images/Fox News) And the good news for working-class Americans, now the solid core of Trump’s support and that of the Republican Party, is that the effort to restore American manufacturing is only getting started. You see, while the Ebenezer Scrooges at libertarian think tanks have long since written off small industrial towns as gone for good, Donald Trump has not. And it isn’t just a matter of sympathy or fairness for these far-flung factory towns, it is also a matter of national security, of being capable of making our own weapons, pharmaceuticals and computer chips. The point of Trump’s tariff turmoil was never tariffs for their own sake; it was and is to reshape American trade and make our nation less dependent on geopolitical and ideological foes such as China. Those who support the president’s effort to reshore manufacturing and reinvigorate forgotten America don’t care if it happens through tariffs or trade deals. They only care that the jobs come home, even if it means paying more for Chinese widgets. Of course, this infuriates the free-marketeers for whom cheapness is next to godliness, but what did they think populism was? Mitt Romney in cowboy boots? Of course, this infuriates the free-marketeers for whom cheapness is next to godliness, but what did they think populism was? Mitt Romney in cowboy boots? I would say that the free traders and libertarians have no answers for small-town America, but actually they do. It appears to be flooding them with tens of thousands of Haitian migrants. Seriously. What the free-market fanboys fail to realize is that tariffs and trade deals are not just economic issues, they are very much cultural issues as well. The question isn’t just how big a number we can ring up on the national cash register, it’s also quality of life. President Donald Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariff plan on April 2.(Getty Images) Let’s take the COVID lockdowns as an example. Five years ago last month, the stock market crashed as the Chinese virus was unleashed. For the rest of the year, many, if not most, Americans stayed home all day and night, streamed video, and ordered from Amazon and DoorDash. By December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher than it was before COVID hit. Now, would any of us say that 2020 was a great time? Does anyone other than a hypochondriac New Yorker magazine essayist look back fondly on being locked in our homes and out of our houses of worship? Of course not. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The American novelist Jack Kerouac once famously quipped, \"I don’t want a living, I want a life.\" To be sure, those of us who are not committed to life on the road as beat poets need both, but thankfully President Trump understands that global trade is about much, much more than money. Importantly, Trump is not doing this alone. Had his supporters panicked as so many conservative commentators did last week, he would not have achieved the tariffs we’ve arrived at or the upcoming negotiations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The reason that Canada is buying billboards in Florida blaring the message \"Tariffs Are Taxes\" is that they want Americans to be as freaked out over the tariffs as the Canadians I met last month in Calgary are. But that isn’t happening. Those who believe in Trump’s vision to transform American manufacturing are heeding the president’s soothing advice to \"be cool,\" and support his America first agenda.

    "title": "Trump’s tariff war with Beijing is part of a multi-prong strategy to secure America from a much broader threat",
    "article_text": "White House deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller outlines the 'national security threat' President Donald Trump wants to address with his tariffs on 'The Story.' PresidentDonald Trumpis in an all-out trade war with China, whose leaders accused the U.S. of \"economic bullying\" and declared Beijing’s readiness to \"fight to the end\" in \"any type\" of war\" with America. Predictably, pundits, experts of all stripes and assorted members of the Washington commentariat are viciously attacking the president, predicting global economic Armageddon. What they don’t understand is that the tariff war is part of Trump’s sophisticated multipronged strategy aimed at reducing a much bigger threat that China poses to America. To execute this strategy, the self-proclaimed master of the art of the deal will be personally involved in trade negotiations, according to Trump’s right-hand man on economic deals, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. Trump is fighting a non-kinetic war with Beijing to avoid a kinetic one, which would surely be catastrophic for both the U.S. and China. Here’s what Trump understands about China and his rationale for the \"strategic decoupling\" doctrine Team Trump developed to tame our most dangerous adversary. DEEPSEEK AI BOT IS PART OF CHINA’S 'UNRESTRICTED WARFARE’ DOCTRINE Chinese President Xi Jinping stands during the closing session of the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 11, 2024.(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) China has been at war with the United States for years, using the \"unrestricted warfare\" doctrine developed by Chinese military strategists from the PLA in 1999. The goal is to fulfill China’s declared grand plan, which includes two parts – first, to become the dominant world power, replacing the United States, militarily and economically, and second, to secure control over Taiwan, through integration or by force, as part of its \"One China\" policy – all by 2049. \"Unrestricted warfare\" is designed to prevent the U.S. from interfering with China’s grand plan, by weakening America through various means – weaponizing fentanyl that kills Americans, eroding our industrial base, and developing our dependence on China in critical areas that underpin our civilian life and defense capabilities, among other things. Thus far, China has employed non-kinetic measures against our homeland. But Xi Jinping gave orders to his armed forces \"to be ready by 2027,\" to conduct a successfulinvasion of Taiwan. China regularly conducts live-fire war-games, involving its army, navy and air force, practicing for an invasion. The most recent ones took place on April 1 and 2. The bold statement, that came from China’s embassy on March 3, demonstrates that Beijing feels ready for a kinetic confrontation today. \"If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,\" it said. Soldiers take up positions during military drills in Jiangxi, China, on Jan. 29, 2023.(CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Trump wants to avoid getting dragged into a kinetic war with China that we cannot win. Should China invade Taiwan tomorrow, the U.S. would likely fail at an intervention, according to the 2024 Commission on the National Defense Strategy. Our military \"lacks both the capabilities and the capacity\" to deter or win such a war, and we would run out of armaments in three to four weeks – or even just a few days – depending on the particular weapon system. Through his tariff war, Trump likely aims to weaken China’s economy and delay the invasion of Taiwan, buying time for U.S. industries to retool, re-establish new supply chains and rebuild our manufacturing capacity, which has been almost erased thanks to Washington’s decades-long misguided China policies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Coal is unloaded from a ship at the port in Lianyungang, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, on July 12, 2023.(Stringer/AFP via Getty Images) Trump is also working to reverse U.S. dependence on China, which Beijing has been cultivating deliberately for years, probably aiming to change Xi’s decision calculus to start the invasion of the island. Today, the U.S. relies on China in key industries, including in pharmaceutical drugs and four manufacturing areas: electronics, clothing and textiles, plastics products, medical products, and healthcare supplies. These supplies include anesthesia instruments, needles, syringes, blood pressure monitors, fingertip pulse oximeters, respirators and life-saving medical devices, among many others. A large portion of over-the-counter drugs in America are imported from China. Ninety-one percent of prescriptions filled in the U.S. are generic drugs – 95% of ibuprofen supply and 45% of penicillin supply come from China. Our critical and dangerous reliance on China in the medical industry was clearly demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we experienced massive shortages of basic products like masks and hand sanitizers. Can you imagine if you couldn't buy a box of aspirin at the CVS? The U.S. imports most of its aspirin from China, which produces 120 billion tablets per year. Trump is also working to reverse our reliance on China for critical minerals, which has reached crisis proportions, presenting a grave national security risk to the homeland. These minerals serve as an essential function in manufacturing vital products, including our most sensitive weapon systems. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, citing the ongoing fentanyl crisis as a reason for the decision.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci | iStock) A recent report by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a lead federal science agency responsible for mineral resources research and analysis, reveals that the United States was 100% net import-reliant for 12 of the 50 critical minerals on the 2022 critical minerals list and more than 50% net import-reliant for an additional 29.China and Canadaare the leading exporters of these minerals to the U.S., according to USGS. A congressional hearing held in February revealed that our supply chain for critical minerals is vulnerable. China is acutely aware of this vulnerability, having banned last December U.S. exports of critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. They are part of a group of 50 \"critical\" minerals that also include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barite and beryllium, and are essential for energy, electronics and modern technology, and military applications. On April 4, China announced strict export controls of seven rare earth elements to the United States – samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium. These seven are part of the 17 \"rare\" earth minerals, a subset of the critical 50 minerals, and are essential in the production of both commercial products, such as smartphones, electric vehicles and military hardware such as missiles, rockets, fighter jets and satellites. Rare-earth mine in Inner Mongolia in China.(Bert Van Dijk/Getty Images) China produces 90% of the world's rare earths and is likely capable of de-stabilizing global supply chains at will. De-coupling from China drives Trump’s efforts to conclude a minerals deal with Ukraine andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. The same rationale underpins his pursuit to acquire Greenland, which has large reserves of critical minerals and the world’s biggest deposits of rare earths, both mostly untapped.

Consistent with his campaign promise not to send U.S. service men and women to fight foreign wars, Trump’s China strategy centers on making business deals with adversaries, rather than waging war with them.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Will the House GOP self-destruct in the week ahead?",
    "article_text": "GOP senators Ted Cruz, John Kennedy, Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, Markwayne Mullin, Katie Britt and Tim Scott discuss top priorities under the Trump administration in a 'Hannity' town hall. The House GOP doesn’t have to pass the Senate’s version of thebudgetit received this week. But if that budget doesn’t pass and Congress then moves quickly to the reconciliation trailer bills —if the House rejects the budget outright or haggles through another round of grandstanding— kiss the majority goodbye and get your impeachment gear out and lined up. Speaker Mike Johnson knows this. Majority Leader Steve Scalise knows this. Pretty much everyone with a working political brain knows this. But if President Trump and the House Leadership lose three of their GOP House members, thebudgetvote will fail. And in the wake of that failure will follow turmoil in the markets that could make last week’s look mild as uncertainty about the tax code on January 1, 2026 will add to the mix of fear and fog that is driving the market andbusiness decisionsfor the past week. The electoral tide chart tells us the GOP should lose the House anyway next year (the first Congressional election after a presidential election in which the majority party in the House loses that majority of it is the same party of the president.) Such a loss is not inevitable, but it is a recurring pattern with few exceptions. Those exceptions include 2002, when President Bush’s House GOP picked up 8 seats. JOHNSON FACES UPHILL BATTLE KEEPING GOP DIVISIONS FROM DERAILING TRUMP BUDGET BILL 2002 was the most unusual of electoral contexts as it was the first referendum on Congress after 9/11. That’s not the sort of event anyone wants, so expect a \"normal\" cycle, one in which the GOP is paddling upstream. President Trump won’t be on the ballot, so his unique pull on occasional voters will be diminished even if, as expected, he campaigns hard and long alongside other GOP draws like Vice President Vance, Senator Tom Cotton and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. Johnson and Scalise know they need not just an \"all-in\" effort but an unusual pattern ofeconomic conditionsto hang on to control of the lower House. The Senate where the GOP holds a 53-47 edge is in better shape with GOP pick-ups possible in New Hampshire and Georgia, not impossible in Michigan and Minnesota, and Senator Thom Tillis as the only vulnerable GOP incumbent. (I know the Democrats will pour money into defeating Maine’s Susan Collins but \"Saint Susan\" is the most formidable of incumbents, always on the move on the state, chair of the mighty Appropriations Committee and genuinely beloved because of her decency, courtesy, intellect and courage.) That \"unusual pattern of economic conditions\" most assuredly requires a growing if not a booming economy, and such an economy will need the promised trade deals to settle quickly in the aftermath of \"Liberation Day,\" but even more important to success in 2026 will be the extension and revision of the Trump 2017 tax cuts combined with construction of the wall, a defense buildup and soaring American energy production. It takes time for these powerfulgrowth factorsto kick in. The House GOP doesn’t have time for its show ponies to grandstand. It needs to act. Now.

    "title": "Global system took advantage of America on trade and defense. That free ride is over",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the highlights of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's push for peace in Brussels on 'Special Report.' For nearly eight decades, the United States has shouldered a disproportionate burden in maintaining global peace, prosperity and order. After World War II, we had little choice. The world lay in ruins, and America alone had the industrial strength and confidence to lead. We opened our markets, extended our military shield, rebuilt broken nations and underwrote a new international system. But that era is over. And our policies haven’t caught up. Today, wealthy nations like Germany, France, Japan, South Korea — and yes, Canada — enjoy universal healthcare, world-class infrastructure and generous social safety nets, all while under-investing in their own defense and benefiting from privileged access to American markets. Their security remains subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, our troops and defense treaties forged when these nations were fragile and vulnerable. TRUMP ADMIN FIRES NAVY ADMIRAL AT NATO TARGETED BY CONSERVATIVE GROUP Now they are competitors. They sell into our markets while protecting their own. They underfund defense while relying on us to keep the peace. Meanwhile, our own infrastructure is crumbling, our debt exceeds $36 trillion, and too many Americans remain uninsured, under-trained or economically stuck. The U.S. says it remains committed to NATO, but wants more from our allies. FILE: Heads of state pose for a group photo during the NATO 75th anniversary celebratory event at the Andrew Mellon Auditorium on July 9, 2024 in Washington, DC.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The American people are asking: Why are we still doing this? President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocating tariffs aren’t just about trade. They mark the clearest signal yet that the era of strategic altruism is ending. For decades,we accepted lopsided trade dealsand tolerated unfair tariffs from allies in exchange for Cold War alignment. That made sense in 1947. Even in 1987. It doesn’t make sense now. Take Canada. Our friendly neighbor to the north enjoys one of the largest per capita trade surpluses with the United States while protecting key industries like dairy, telecom and energy through tariffs and regulation. Canada also continues to fail itsNATO defense spending commitment,investing only 1.3% of GDP when the standard is 2%. Over the past 18 years, it has under-invested by more than $258 billion. Yet somehow the outrage is directed at the U.S. for demanding fairness. Or Europe. Despite facing Russian aggression,many EU countries still fall shortof NATO targets, preferring to spend on domestic programs while letting the U.S. deter their enemies. Russia is no longer the global menace it once was. The war in Ukraine has exposed a brittle, corrupt and backward military. Its economy is fragile, its influence shrinking, and its population aging. It is not a superpower — it is a wounded regional actor with nuclear weapons. China presents a more sophisticated challenge. But even it faces a looming demographic collapse, economic slowdowns, and rising global backlash. Our response should not be to double down on outdated security guarantees or trade relationships that favor them more than us. The answer is to refocus America’s power and priorities. We are still the world’s most powerful nation — economically, militarily, technologically. What we lack is alignment between our global commitments and our national interests. Many NATO allies spent years underfunding their militaries. FILE: Finnish Air Force F-18 are seen during a NATO Baltic Air Policing drill.(John Thys/AFP via Getty Images) That’s why this moment demands bold action. Incremental change is no longer enough. We must begin to phase out our role as the primary security guarantor for nations that are fully capable of defending themselves. This includes Europe — and Canada. The U.S. should remain in NATO but as a strategic deterrent, not the first line of defense. Allies must rearm, reinvest and take responsibility for their sovereignty. We must also renegotiate or exit trade relationships that disadvantage American workers and industries. If tariffs are the tool, use them with judgment. They are not economic warfare — they are leverage. They show that America is serious about fairness. Most importantly, we must rebuild at home. Our roads, ports, power grid, schools and healthcare systems need modernizing. Our industrial base must be restored. Our workforce must be re-skilled. And our economy must be made resilient — not dependent. Some critics say this strategy risks a trade war. Maybe. But far better to recalibrate now, while we’re strong, than wait until we’re overextended and vulnerable. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Others worry we’ll alienate allies. That’s possible too. But true partnerships require shared sacrifice. If these countries are our equals, then it’s time they act like it. To those who prefer gradualism and summit diplomacy, I say this: we don’t have the luxury of slow change. The global order is shifting. Our adversaries and allies alike are watching. We are still the world’s most powerful nation — economically, militarily, technologically. What we lack is alignment between our global commitments and our national interests. This is a tipping point. If we don’t meet it with strength, we will drift into decline — not because we lacked power, but because we lacked purpose. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP America must stop managing the old world and start shaping the new one. It’s time to stop apologizing for our strength — and start using it to protect our people, our economy and our future.

    "title": "I helped Biden defend against national security threats. NSA needs skilled leaders not politics",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has reportedly fired National Security Agency Director Timothy Haugh, who also leads U.S. Cyber Command, and NSA Deputy Director Wendy Noble. The first thing I read each morning for the last four years was the top-secret President’s Daily Brief – a summary of the most sensitive intelligence and analysis on global issues. From the president on down to cabinet members and other senior officials, we relied on that summary to warn us about China’s aggressive cyber operations, terrorist plots, Iran’s malicious activities, and other geopolitical risks. Invariably, these insights were derived mostly from intelligence collected byone entity: the National Security Agency.Why? Because in a world defined by digital communications and technology, the NSA is America’s most effective intelligence service. That’s why theabrupt firingsa few days ago of NSA Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Deputy Director Wendy Noble – two highly experienced and apolitical leaders – at a time when the U.S. is facing unprecedented cyberattacks from China and others is a gift to our adversaries. As President Donald Trump considers replacements for these vital roles, he and his national security team would be well-served to prioritize competence and leadership over politics. Here’s why. First, the NSA director and deputy director roles are unique in the U.S. government. Unlike the heads of other departments and agencies, who are primarily charged with overseeing policy, interfacing with external stakeholders and managing the workforce – all important tasks – they don’t need to be substantive experts to lead the agency. RARE CRIMINAL CONFESSIONS, BRITISH SPY SECRETS FROM 115 YEARS AGO UNVEILED IN NEW EXHIBIT Not so at the NSA. By virtue of thehighly technical nature of cyber operationsand signals intelligence activities – intercepting the communications of our adversaries – it’s imperative that NSA leaders understand both the technical details and the strategic implications of the complex operations under their command. The National Security Agency is getting new leadership after President Donald Trump fired two top people. It's essential that their replacements have the unique set of skills needed for the job.(Getty Images) They need to know how to build and deploy software platforms and code to launch cyber operations. They need to understand the cryptologic issues and programs that enable intelligence collection and harden U.S. defenses against cyberattacks. They also need to understand the immense power of the capabilities under their control. The horrific leaks by Edward Snowden illustrated the geopolitical consequences associated with expansive NSA operations even when you have competent professionals leading the agency. It’s no job for amateurs. This is precisely why presidents since NSA’s inception in 1952 have always selected leaders with deep technical expertise to run this highly sophisticated agency. Just as we need qualified doctors overseeing the emergency room of a hospital, we need competent, qualified leaders at the NSA. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Second, the decapitation of NSA leadership came at a time when China is undertaking increasingly aggressive cyber operations against the United States, as evidenced by the recent Salt Typhoon cyberattacks against US telecommunications networks. As Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated last month, \"Beijing is advancing its cyber capabilities for sophisticated operations aimed at stealing sensitive U.S. government and private sector information, and pre-positioning additional asymmetric attack options that may be deployed in a conflict.\" These are not abstract threats. Turmoil at the NSA – the agency principally responsible for detecting and countering Chinese cyber espionage – could not have come at a worse time. The unprecedented firings, apparently without cause, will have a chilling effect on the workforce and morale at the agency and signal that politics is more important than apolitical, objective analysis and production that has always defined the intelligence profession. The impacts will be further amplified if other senior NSA officials retire or leave for more lucrative positions in industry to avoid becoming the next victim of baseless political attacks. The ultimate beneficiaries of chaos at America’s most consequential spy agency will be America’s adversaries, who will look to exploit the crisis. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration has an opportunityto minimize the damage caused by these firings by selecting professionals with the competence and experience to lead NSA moving forward. This isn’t about politics, or at least it shouldn’t be. All Americans should care about having the best and brightest leading the NSA at a time when we’re facing rising threats at home and abroad – from China and Iran to ISIS and drug cartels. Choosing otherwise is a dangerous proposition that benefits only our adversaries. Brett M. Holmgren was the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center and assistant secretary of State for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research under the Biden administration.",

    "title": "How Chef Robotics found success  by turning away its original customers",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A few years ago, Chef Robotics was facing potential death. “There were a lot of dark periods where I was thinking of giving up,” founder Rajat Bhageria tells TechCrunch of his six-year-old company. But friends and investors encouraged him, so he persevered. Today, Chef Robotics has not only survived, it’s one of the few food tech robotic companies that is thriving. The startup, which recently raised a $23 million Series A, has 40 employees and marquee customers like Amy’s Kitchen and Chef Bombay. Dozens of robots installed across the U.S. have made 45 million meals to date, Bhageria says. This compares to a graveyard of failed food tech robotics companies, includingChowbotics with its salad-making robot Sally;pizza delivery robot Zume; food kiosk robotKarakuri, and, more recently, agtechSmall Robot Company. Bhageria says he saved his company by doing something that early-stage founders fear to do: turning away signed customers and millions of dollars in revenue. It all began when Bhageria did his master’s degree in robotics atUPenn’s famed GRASP Lab. He dreamed of the sci-fi promised world where robots did our housework, mowed our lawns, and cooked us five-star dinners. Such a world doesn’t exist yet because engineers have yet to fully solve the roboticgrasping problem. Training the same robot to wash a wine glass without crushing it and a cast iron pan without dropping it is a difficult task. When it comes to robotic chefs, “Nobody’s built a dataset of how do you pick up a blueberry and not squish it, or, how do you pick up cheese and not have it clump up?” he describes. His original idea with Chef Robotics was similar to the long-list of the robotics startups that died: a robotic line for fast casual restaurants. That’s an enormous industrywith a chronic employee shortage. “We actually had signed contracts. Like we had multimillion-dollar signed contracts. Obviously, we’re not doing this anymore. So what happened?” he said. “We essentially could not solve the technical problem.” In those types of businesses, an employee completes an order by assembling all the varied ingredients necessary for each meal. These restaurants want robots to replicate that process because the alternative is to have dozens of robots dedicated to, and calibrated for, a single ingredient, some of which may only be used occasionally (we’re looking at you, anchovies). But Bhageria and team couldn’t build a successful pick-up-anything robot because the training data doesn’t exist. He asked his potential customers to let him install robots for one or two ingredients, gathering training data and building from there. They said no. Then Bhageria had an epiphany. Instead of going bust trying to give existing customers what they wanted, maybe he needed different customers. “It honestly sucked, because I spent the last year and a half of my life trying to convince these people, these fast casual companies, to work up with us,” he recalled. It didn’t help that fundraising after 2021 was brutal. VCs were also looking at the graveyard. “We talked to dozens of different funds,” Bhageria said. “We just got rejected over and over.” Bhageria was thinking of giving up. “You come home and are like, what am I doing in my life? Am I doing the wrong thing? Should I quit?” he remembered. But he dug in andin March, 2023, raised an $11.2 million seed roundled by Construct Capital, while also landing checks from Promus Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, and Gaingels. Bhageria and team also found their perfect market, a part of the food industry known as “high mix manufacturing.” These are food makers that have many, many recipes, and make thousands of servings, but typically as meals or meal trays. For instance; salads and sandwiches or main courses and side dishes. These are meals used by airlines and hospitals, etc., or are frozen food meals for consumers. Rather than one employee grabbing all the ingredients for each meal, “high mix” employees form an assembly line. Each person adds their individual ingredient to the tray repeatedly until the order is complete. Then they assemble the next recipe. “It’s actually hundreds of humans who are standing in a 34 Fahrenheit room, and they’re essentially scooping food for eight hours a day,” he describes. “So it’s just a terrible job.” Consequently, this industry has chronic labor shortages as well. Robotics wasn’t economically feasible for them in the past because of the variety of ingredients involved. But a startup building a flexible-ingredient bot, where the robots are built in partnership with the food maker, works. Better still, “as we learn how to do this chorizo, or we learn peas, or this sauce, or these zucchinis,” the bots get the real-world training data they need to eventually serve fast-casual restaurants. Bhageria says this is still on his roadmap. Best of all, thanks to VC’s reborn interest in all things AI, fundraising this time was “weirdly” easy, Bhageria says. Avataar Venture Partners, co-founded by former Norwest VC Mohan Kumar, was specifically looking to fund “AI in the physical world” startups and actually pursued Chef Robotics, Bhageria says. He closed this round in less than a month. Avataar led, with existing investors Construct Capital, Bloomberg Beta, and Promus Ventures piling in,among others. The new funding brings Chef’s total raised to $38.8 million. He also signed a $26.75 million loan from Silicon Valley Bank for equipment financing. And the process this time was “exhilarating,” he said.

Founded in 2018, Nate raised over $50 million from investors like Coatue and Forerunner Ventures, most recentlyraisinga $38 million Series A in 2021 led by Renegade Partners. Nate said its app’s users could buy from any e-commerce site with a single click, thanks to AI. In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ’s Southern District of New York alleges. Saniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online “without human intervention,” except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app’s actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims. Nate’s heavy usage of human contractors was the subject ofan investigationby The Information in 2022. Saniger didn’t respond to a request for comment. He is currentlylistedas a managing partner at New York VC Buttercore Partners, which didn’t respond to a request for comment either. The DOJ’sindictmentsays that Nate ran out of money and was forced to sell its assets in January 2023, leaving its investors with “near total” losses. Albert Saniger’s LinkedIn profile indicates he was no longer CEO as of 2023. Nate isn’t the only startup that has allegedly exaggerated its AI capabilities. For example, an “AI” drive-through software startup was also powered largely by humans in the Philippines, The Vergereportedin 2023.

A section of Yahoo’s website that was previouslydedicated to DEIno longer loads andinstead redirectsto the company’s executive leadership page. A previous version ofYahoo’s leadership page from late 2024touted language mentioning diversity and inclusion butdoes not appearon Yahoo’s current website. Yahoo’s2022 diversity reportno longer loads and returns a“page not found” error. While open positions on Yahoo’s career website still advertise a link to Yahoo’s former DEI page, thepagenow redirects to Yahoo’s leadership page. Yahoo, which owns TechCrunch, made the website changes between December 2024 and January 2025, according to historical copies of Yahoo’s website hosted on the Internet Archive’sWayback Machine. Brenden Lee, a spokesperson for Yahoo, told TechCrunch in a statement: “We revamped our corporate website late last year as the first part of a planned, multi-phase redesign timed to CES and our Yahoo Ads relaunch. The first phase reduced the total volume of content by nearly 60 percent with a focus on streamlining navigation and spotlighting our advertising and business solutions.” Yahoo is the latest U.S. company of late to scale back its public statements about DEI amid ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to crack down on DEI policies in both the public and private sectors. Since taking office again, President Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at putting pressure on private companies to roll back their DEI programs. In February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondiorderedthe Justice Department to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” DEI programs at private sector companies that receive federal funds. Several tech companies, includingGoogleandOpenAI, have already scrubbed mentions of DEI from their websites in recent months. Meta alsoeliminated its corporate DEI programsdays before the Trump administration took office, citing a “changing” legal landscape regarding DEI. Soon after, Amazondeleted wording relating to inclusion and diversityfrom its annual report filed with regulators. TechCrunch reported in March that U.S. health insurance giantUnitedHealth also scrubbed much of its websiteof mentions of DEI. Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of TechCrunch.

Google’s newest Gemini models cangenerate audioas well as images and text, while OpenAI’s default model in ChatGPT can natively create images — including, of course,Studio Ghibli-style art. Amazon hasalso announced plansto launch an “any-to-any” model later this year. These omni models require a lot of training data — images, videos, audio, text, and so on. Hassabis implied that the video data for Veo is coming mostly from YouTube, a platform that Google owns. “Basically, by watching YouTube videos — a lot of YouTube videos — [Veo 2] can figure out, you know, the physics of the world,” Hassabis said.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In recent years, focus on career and delayed marriage age is driving some women to consider preserving their fertility through egg freezing. But the steep cost of the procedure,estimated at $10,000 to $15,000per attempt, means many women can’t afford it during their most fertile years: 20s and early 30s. Cofertility, a startup founded by former Uber executive Lauren Makler and health tech angel investor Halle Tecco, offers women no-cost egg freezing in exchange for donating half the retrieved eggs to those unable to conceive. The three-year-old startup just raised a $7.25 million Series A round led by Next Ventures and Offline Ventures, with participation from Initialized, Gaingels, and several other investors. This financing round brings Cofertility’s total funding to $16 million. The idea for Cofertility stems from Makler’s fertility and health scare. A 2018 diagnosis of a rare abdominal disease led to multiple surgeries that threatened the loss of her ovaries. In such situations, doctors sometimes suggest egg freezing for young women who want to have children, but that was not an option for Makler. So, she started to learn as much as possible about egg donation. She knew donors were compensated for their eggs, but she was shocked to learn how expensive the eggs could be. If she wanted an egg from a Jewish donor to match her background, it would cost more. The price increased further if she sought an egg from an educated woman. “It felt sort of like surge pricing for egg donors, which felt icky to me,” she said, referring to Uber’s approach for charging for rides during peak-demand times. Luckily, Makler ended up conceiving a child naturally, but that experience led her to want to build a business that matches young women who wish to preserve their fertility with people who need a donor egg. While the concept of egg sharing is not new, Makler claims that Cofertility is the only company that offers eggs at scale through its “Split” program. “At any given time, we have hundreds of donors that are available for intended parents,” Makler said, adding that most clinics will have only a handful of donors, which is unlikely to result in a match. Makler says that Cofertility’s egg donors come from diverse backgrounds and that about 55% of them have graduate degrees. Intended parents cover the egg retrieval costs and Cofertility’s coordination fee, similar to standard egg donation. However, they don’t have to compensate the donor, lowering their out-of-pocket expenses. While Makler doesn’t want to call Cofertility a marketplace, she agrees that it works like one and that her company is solving a big structural problem. “The big vision and the goal is removing the taboo of egg donation,” she said, “There is zero shame in however you become a parent. Doing that with the help of a donor who’s also interested in freezing her own eggs is a really exciting option.” Topics Reporter, Venture Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines Bezos-backed EV startup Slate Auto’s pickup truck spotted in the wild The US Secretary of Education referred to AI as ‘A1,’ like the steak sauce WhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels Google to embrace Anthropic’s standard for connecting AI models to data Solid, which claimed to be the ‘AWS of fintech,’ files for bankruptcy after raising nearly $81M in funding Governments identify dozens of Android apps bundled with spyware © 2025 Yahoo.",

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been over two years sinceElon Musk purchased Twitter, now X, leading people to set up shop on alternative platforms.Mastodon,Post,Pebble(two of which have alreadyshutteredoperations) andSpillhave been presented aspotential replacements, but fewaside from Meta’s Threadshave achieved the speed of growth Bluesky has reached. As of February 2025, Bluesky hassurpassed 30 million users.Its growth stems from several policy changes at X, including a heavily criticizedchange to the block featureand allowing third party companies totrain their AI on users’ posts, which helped the app soar to thetop of the U.S. App Store.Bluesky also saw a big boost following the results of the2024 U.S. presidential election(which also contributed to an X exodus byTaylor Swift fans). But while the number is promising,the growth has slowed— and the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete withThreads’ 275 million monthly active users. Below, we’ve compiled the answers to some of the most common questions users have about Bluesky. And if you’ve made the switch, you canfollow TechCrunch hereas well as our team withour Starter Pack. Bluesky is adecentralized social appconceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation. Bluesky is using anopen source frameworkbuilt in-house, theAT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed. Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from X. As of May 2024, Dorsey isno longer on Bluesky’s board.Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led byCEO Jay Graber. Upon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as@amanda.omg.lol. The app itself functionsmuch like X,where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text. You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic andpersonalized “Discover” feedfeaturing more than just trending content. For new users, Bluesky introduceda “Starter Pack” feature,which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate. You can find TechCrunch’s Starter Packright here. User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like X: posts and posts & replies. In January 2025, Bluesky also addeda new video tabto user profiles. There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates. In January 2025, Bluesky also introduceda vertical video feedto compete with TikTok. We’ve also put together a helpful guide onhow to use Bluesky here. By the beginning of July 2023, whenInstagram’s Threadslaunched,Bluesky topped a million downloadsacross iOS and Android. Notable figures likeRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,Mark Cuban,Quinta Brunson,Dril,Weird Al Yankovic,Guillermo del Toro,Barbra Streisand,andBrazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvahave migrated to Bluesky. Bluesky is also home to news organizations likeBloomberg,The Washington Post, and of course,TechCrunch! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowingheads of stateto sign up and join the platform for the first time. In 2025, some prominent U.S. political figures set up accounts on the platform, likeBarack ObamaandHillary Clinton. In many ways, yes. When it first started, Bluesky was much more pared down and didn’t even have DMs, but this key featurehas since been implemented, even withemoji reactions. But DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar toX’s Community Notes feature.Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub orAT. Bluesky has also beentesting a Trending Topics featureand developingits own photo sharing appcalled Flashes, which is expected to bereleased in beta soon. In October 2024, Elon Musk announced thatX’s block feature would work differentlythan it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some usersbelieve this update to be a safety concern,leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional. In another move that separates Bluesky from X, the social network said it has“no intention” of using user content to train generative AI toolsas X implemented a new terms of service that allows the platform totrain AI models on public posts.But that doesn’t stopthird parties from doing so. While Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021. Yes, and it is now open to the public. Bluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023,Bluesky announcedadditional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads”in order to monetize its platform. In November 2024, Bluesky announced it raiseda $15 million Series A roundand is developing a subscription service for premium features. Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s“pay to win” premium offerings.Users have spotted mockups teasing thesubscription feature, dubbed Bluesky+,which could include features like higher quality video uploads and profile customizations. In December 2024, Peter Wang announceda $1 million fund,dubbed Skyseed, that will offer grants to those building on Bluesky’s open source AT Protocol. Yes. Bluesky’s team isdeveloping the decentralized AT Protocol,which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data. “You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,”a Bluesky blog post explained. Many developers are buildingconsumer-facing appson Bluesky or its underlying AT Protocol. These apps are built on open technology, as opposed to being siloed within big tech’s centralized, opaque ownership. Some social apps includeFlashes, a photo viewing client;Spark, a TikTok-like app; andSkylight Social, which is backed by Mark Cuban. Check out our morecomprehensive listat various apps built within this ecosystem, including cross-posting apps, music apps, feed builders, and livestreamers. In October 2023, Blueskyadded email verificationas part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls.In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that wouldexpose their posts to the public webfollowing backlash from users. Yes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar. In March 2024,​​ the company announced“AT Protocol Grants,”a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization. One of the recipients, SkyFeed, is a custom tool that lets anyone build their own feeds using a graphical user interface. Yes. Bluesky has rolled out toAndroid usersafter it was initially launched to iOS users. Users can access Bluesky on the webhere. After anOctober 2023 update, the app will now warn users of misleading links by flagging them. If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go. In December 2024, the Bluesky Safety team posted that the companyupdated its impersonation policyto be “more aggressive,” adding that “impersonation and handle-squatting accounts will be removed.” The company said it isalso exploring alternativesto its current domain handle verification process. Bluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Followinga controversyabout the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames. In December 2024, Bluesky also faced criticism when writer and podcast hostJesse Singal joined the platform.Singal has been cataloged by GLAAD’s Accountability Project for his writings on transgender issues and other matters. Bluesky users have reported Singal’s account en masse, leading the company to ban him, reinstate him, and then label his account intolerant by its moderation service. In December 2023, Bluesky rolled out“more advanced automated tooling”designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team. Bluesky has moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, and a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts. However, some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private. In March 2024,the company launched Ozone, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users“unprecedented control”over their social media experience. In October 2024,Bluesky joined Instragram’s Threadsapp in an effort to court users who were frustrated by Meta’s moderation issues. In January 2025, Bluesky publishedits 2024 moderation reportthat said it saw a 17x increase in moderation reports following the rapid growth on the platform. The report also noted that the largest number of reports came from users reporting accounts or posts for harassment, trolling, or intolerance — an issue that’s plagued Bluesky as it’s grown. To meet the demands caused by this growth, Blueskyincreased its moderation team to roughly 100 moderatorsand will continue to hire. Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, whileMastodon can come off as inaccessible:Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recentlysimplifiedits sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users. However, the launch offederationwill make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will. Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site calledHappening.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other top AI labs are increasingly being used to assist with programming tasks. Google CEO Sundar Pichaisaid in Octoberthat 25% of new code at the company is generated by AI, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberghas expressed ambitionsto widely deploy AI coding models within the social media giant. Yet even some of the best models today struggle to resolve software bugs that wouldn’t trip up experienced devs. Anew studyfrom Microsoft Research, Microsoft’s R&D division, reveals that models, including Anthropic’sClaude 3.7 Sonnetand OpenAI’so3-mini,fail to debug many issues in a software development benchmark called SWE-bench Lite. The results are a sobering reminder that, despiteboldpronouncementsfrom companies like OpenAI, AI is still no match for human experts in domains such as coding. The study’s co-authors tested nine different models as the backbone for a “single prompt-based agent” that had access to a number of debugging tools, including a Python debugger. They tasked this agent with solving a curated set of 300 software debugging tasks from SWE-bench Lite. According to the co-authors, even when equipped with stronger and more recent models, their agent rarely completed more than half of the debugging tasks successfully. Claude 3.7 Sonnet had the highest average success rate (48.4%), followed by OpenAI’s o1 (30.2%), and o3-mini (22.1%). Why the underwhelming performance? Some models struggled to use the debugging tools available to them and understand how different tools might help with different issues. The bigger problem, though, was data scarcity, according to the co-authors. They speculate that there’s not enough data representing “sequential decision-making processes” — that is, human debugging traces — in current models’ training data. “We strongly believe that training or fine-tuning [models] can make them better interactive debuggers,” wrote the co-authors in their study. “However, this will require specialized data to fulfill such model training, for example, trajectory data that records agents interacting with a debugger to collect necessary information before suggesting a bug fix.” The findings aren’t exactly shocking. Many studies haveshownthat code-generating AI tends to introduce security vulnerabilities and errors, owing to weaknesses in areas like the ability to understand programming logic.One recent evaluation of Devin, a popular AI coding tool, found that it could only complete three out of 20 programming tests. But the Microsoft work is one of the more detailed looks yet at a persistent problem area for models. It likely won’t dampeninvestor enthusiasmfor AI-powered assistive coding tools, but with any luck, it’ll make developers — and their higher-ups — think twice about letting AI run the coding show. For what it’s worth, a growing number of tech leaders have disputed the notion that AI will automate away coding jobs.

Now, after its €500 millionexit to French mobile publisher Voodoo, BeReal is rolling out advertising in the U.S. Its initial products include in-feed ads in the app’s same dual-camera post style, as well as full day brand takeovers. The app already tested ads with companies like Levi’s, Nike, Netflix, and Amazon but will now launch a full U.S. advertising platform. The company appointed Ben Moore, previously of TikTok, to lead a U.S. team focused on sales, partnerships, and growth. As it seeks to woo advertisers, BeReal told TechCrunch that it has an estimated 40 million monthly active users, including 5 million monthly active users in the U.S. Overall, BeReal says that 85% of its users are Gen Z. The app also claims that in the U.S., France, and Japan — its top markets — 50% of users are active six days a week. (TechCrunch could not independently verify these figures.) The app today faces the challenge of staying relevant in a competitive social landscape where fads come and go. Founded in 2019, the ephemeral social app didn’tbloom in popularityuntil 2022, after it had secured a $30 million Series A round from a16z and Accel. EvenMetaandTikTokwere clamoring to capitalize on BeReal’s virality. By October 2022, app intelligence firm Sensor Towerestimatedthat 53 million people had downloaded the app, though only about 9% of active Android users had opened the app daily. The app hit a cultural milestone when it wasparodied on SNL that same month. According to data from third-party analytics firmAppfigures, BeReal to date has been downloaded 115 million times on iOS and Android, with 33% of those downloads coming from the U.S. But over the last few years, downloads have slowed from its viral moment. In 2023, worldwide downloads totaled an estimated 31.5 million, which decreased 60% year-over-year to 12.7 million in 2024.

Nope, it’s not an edit button! Instead, the open social network is adding support for chat reactions in its direct messages feature and is revamping its search page as “Explore,” directing users to trends, suggested accounts, Starter Packs, and more. The features both take inspiration from X, which has let usersreact to direct messages with an emojisince 2020. X expanded the feature a few years later, allowing users to choose any emoji beyond the default set. Bluesky is now offering the same, as users can now click on the emoji button next to a person’s message to add a reaction. In the initial pop-up, a handful of common emojis like the heart, thumbs up, eyes, sad face, and a laughing face are available. However, users can click on the three-dot menu to select any other emoji as their reaction, similar to what they can do in X. Notably, the Bluesky search page is becoming more useful with the new release, as it now helps connect users to what’s trending on the network. A feature like this may not have made as much sense when Bluesky was smaller, but with a now sizable user base of over 34 million users, it’s easier to spot trends surfacing among the many discussions on the platform. For instance, some of the trends today are linked to timely events, like Trump’stariffsand their impact, while others point to popular communities on Bluesky, like the readers onBookSky. The trends are also marked with labels like “New” or “Hot” or how long ago they began trending, like “5h ago.” In addition, the newExplore pagelets users enter their own interests to better personalize the content shown to them on Bluesky. It also offers suggestions of accounts to follow within different categories, like Art, Sports, Music, Comics, Politics, Science, News, Animals, Books, Video Games, and others. Below this, the app suggests interesting Starter Packs — or,curated lists of usersthat newcomers can follow with a click — as well as suggestions of other popular custom feeds, likeNFL+, which connects users to those talking about American football on Bluesky. Earlier this week, Bluesky CTO Paul Frazeecreditedthe company’s recent hire of Darrin Loeliger for the updated Explore page, saying he showed the team “the upside of hiring a designer.” Though smaller additions, these new updates could make former X users feel more comfortable when they join Bluesky, as they’ll have access to similar tools to engage with friends and discover discussions, people, and interests.

Reddit user u/discostranger09 posted aphototo the r/whatisthiscar subreddit on Wednesday of a small, dark gray, two-seater pickup truck on a flatbed. The user said it was being offloaded from a container outside their office in the Los Angeles area. The photo was first reported by automotive outletsCarscoopsandThe Autopian. The truck pictured is, in fact, the one Slate Auto has been working on, according to a person with direct knowledge of Slate Auto’s vehicle design who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person, whose identity is known to TechCrunch, said the truck is likely one of the concept vehicles the startup has created to show to potential investors — including thecontrolling owner of the LA Dodgers— at its design studio in Long Beach, California. The truck is simply styled, with a grille that somewhat resembles the one on the modern-day Ford Bronco Sport. It also looks a bit like a smaller, simplified Rivian R1T — which is interesting considering that Slate’s head of exterior design had a short stint at Rivian before coming to the secretive startup. But there are no dramatic flourishes, and that’s by design. As TechCrunchexclusively reportedearlier this week, the young company is attempting to build a business around the truck that involves selling it at a low price of around $25,000. Slate plans to upsell customers on customization and accessories of a wide variety. The company has filed for a trademark on the phrase “WE BUILT IT. YOU MAKE IT” and has mentioned something that sounds like a customization program called “Slate University” in job listings. Another Slate trademark that has not yet been reported is for the phrase “Blank Slate.” That is one way that the company may refer to the base model of the truck before a customer chooses any customization options, according to the person familiar with the matter. It is unclear if the company has settled on a name for the truck, despite being a few weeks away from coming out of stealth. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While speaking on a panel about AI in the workforce, McMahon repeatedly referred to AI as “A1,” like thesteak sauce. “You know, AI development — I mean, how can we educate at the speed of light if we don’t have the best technology around to do that?” she said. “I heard … that there was a school system that’s going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year, starting that far down in the grades. That’s a wonderful thing!” In McMahon’s defense, it doesn’t seem like she actually thinks that artificial intelligence is abbreviated “A1.” During the panel, she said “AI” at first, but became increasingly less consistent. “It wasn’t all that long ago that it was, ‘We’re going to have internet in our schools!’” she continued. “Now let’s see A1, and how can that be helpful.” AI is such a ubiquitous term that it seems hard to imagine how one could forget the correct acronym — it’s like if a professional athlete referred to Major League Baseball as the “NFL.” Sometimes people misspeak.

The game, titled “Thronglets,” from Netflix’s ownNight School Studio, serves as a companion to the episode called “Plaything.” Players interact with virtual yellow pets and strive to keep them alive. If players are successful in caring for their pets, the creatures will replicate, making it increasingly challenging to keep up with their needs. The creatures can also gather resources, develop technologies, explore new areas, and unlock tools and buildings to progress more quickly. While it may initially resemble innocent games like Tamagotchi, the beings in Thronglets are decidedly more twisted. They are sentient and communicate directly with the player. For example, when the player chops down trees using an axe, a creature might realize that bones are more effective than an axe and require less time. Consequently, the player must decide whether to sacrifice some creatures for their bones to speed up the process. Netflix’s gaming strategy to date has lacked focus, but the companymore recently said it would direct its energyon four types of games going forward. These include narrative games tied to Netflix shows, as well as gaming titles for kids, party games, and potential mainstream hits. The latter could include licensed tie-ins to shows and originals. The new “Black Mirror”-themed game is currently available for Netflix subscribers on bothiOSand Android devices. Although Netflix has occasionally launched games inspired by its IP, this is the first time we’ve seen a game that is directly tied to the narrative of a specific episode. Thronglets launches amid the company revamping its gaming strategy, having previously been scatterbrained about the titles it releases. Netflix has released a mix of indie games, popular existing titles, and games based on its IP. However, not all titles have been successful, leading to therecent cancellation of Netflix Stories, a narrative-driven game featuring shows like “Love Is Blind.” Speaking at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), vice president of games technology and portfolio development Jeet Shroffstatedthat the company is now focusing on four main areas: narrative games, multiplayer party games, games for kids, and mainstream titles. Thronglets falls into the mainstream category, making it a clever decision for the streaming giant to create a game based on one of its most popular shows. Another example of a mainstream release is Squid Game: Unleashed, which has reportedly reached 20 million downloads, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

The Series F — which includes participation from Atomico, BlackRock, DN Capital, Hercules, Infravia, Kibo, and Kinnevik — values the Madrid, Spain-based company at €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) post-money. On the surface, a unicorn raising a decent round of funding from a well-known list of backers might sound like pretty strong news. The reality is a little different. This is a down round for the company. Jobandtalent, which has operations in 10 countries in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America, last raised money inDecember 2021, a Series E of $500 million that valued it at $2.35 billion. We’ve asked for a comment from the company on why its valuation received a haircut of almost $1 billion. “This round reflects a valuation adjustment in line with broader market dynamics, particularly within the tech and growth-stage sectors,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The funding ensures that Job&Talent remains well-capitalized to execute the next phase of our growth journey. Despite challenging market conditions, we have consistently outperformed industry trends over the past year, driven by the strength of our platform and our ability to integrate AI across our entire suite of products.” Some of the reasoning may also be a reflection of the European startup scene at the moment. On the plus side: Jobandtalent was the beneficiary of strong tailwinds over the years. It came into its own in the years around COVID-19, when both businesses and workers were unsure of what was coming around the corner and gravitated to working arrangements that afforded more flexibility. Certain sectors, like e-commerce and the wider ecosystem of delivery and logistics around it, were positively booming and needed to fill lots of roles, fast. It was an especially flush time for particular kinds of roles, and Jobandtalent found a willing audience of businesses and workers taking to its platform to connect to each other. The company says over the years it has placed more than 300,000 workers in roles at more than 3,250 companies, with a particular emphasis on sectors like logistics and retail. Yet the company’s funding news today is coming at an unsettling time: The European labor market since the COVID-19 pandemic has been buffeted by a number of opposingeconomic waves. Skills and people shortages have spelled opportunity for those who can fill the gaps; yet declining corporate profits and a stagnating Eurozone economy could spell tougher times ahead. And that’s before you consider what kind of impact AI might have. It’s still unproven, but businesses and governments are staking a lot on AI being a cost-effective solution for some kinds of work, and that too could spell bad news for certain jobs. Jobandtalent is sitting in a strange position in that regard. The company’s bread and butter remains the human workforce, but it’s also leaning into ways it can use AI to be more “work efficient.” The company says that the new injection of equity will be used to scale the business internationally and to invest in building a series of AI-powered agents into the platform to support that. The first of these is called Clara, an agent focused on recruitment. In a test with a limited number of clients, Clara has conducted no less than 180,000 interviews, the company said, contributing to some 7,000 hires and “helping deliver industry-leading fill rates, even during peak periods of demand.” Jobandtalent says that the fill rates are “equivalent to the output of thousands of recruiters.” Jobandtalent said it plans to launch further agents this year to cover other functions previously handled by humans. “This capital injection reaffirms our shared vision for the future of Job&Talent,” Juan Urdiales, the startup’s co-founder and co-CEO, said in a statement. “Thanks to the platform we have built over the past years, we are now well-positioned to evolve into a fully integrated employment platform that helps companies manage their temporary and internal workforces more efficiently. Our next-generation AI agents will bring major improvements in productivity, provide better opportunities for workers, and unlock crucial cost savings for companies.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Some firms build solutions in-house, but these often require a lot of upkeep and maintenance. To ease the burden, Russ d’Sa and David Zhao createdLiveKit, an open source software package for building apps that can transmit real-time audio and video. They launched the project in 2021 and soon suspected it had business potential. It was a good hunch. LiveKit now has “more than 500 paying customers and over 100,000 developers across its cloud platform and open source products,” according to d’Sa. He also says it’s the “backbone for roughly 25% of 911 emergency calls in the U.S.” and is “used by large aerospace companies for launch and flight observation, Skydio for police drones teleoperation, and teams at Oracle and Adobe in various government applications.” It all started when “large companies like Spotify, Oracle, and Reddit were experimenting with LiveKit and asked us for a cloud-hosted version of it,” d’Sa told TechCrunch. “Think Cloudflare, but for media streaming.” So d’Sa, an early Twitter engineer, and Zhao, former director of engineering at Motorola, decided to turn LiveKit into a startup and launch a managed version of the project: LiveKit Cloud. Today, LiveKit, which also powers OpenAI’sChatGPT Voice Mode, offers SDKs, tools, and APIs that allow developers and companies to build streaming video and audio experiences. The startup’s customers include tech giants Spotify, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as Character AI, Speak, and Fanatics. The current focus of the San Jose, California, company is growing its engineering and product teams — it employs around 50 people — and expanding its core infrastructure. LiveKit is also developing what d’Sa calls an “elastic agent compute service,” meaning a product that can deploy and automatically scale up or down voice “agents” like chatbots. “It turns out what LiveKit is ultimately building is ‘AIWS’ — an AI-native cloud provider,” d’Sa said. “What Stripe did for payments, LiveKit is doing for communications.” LiveKit’s financials are quite healthy in the meantime, d’Sa claims. Last year, the company’s run rate was over $10 million. Recently, LiveKit raised $45 million in a Series B round led by Altimeter, with participation from Redpoint Ventures and Hanabi Capital.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Although there has been significant pushback from artists regarding the proliferation of AI design tools and the content used to train generative models, the companies making the software for creative work are nevertheless building AI into their toolkits. It’s a signal of just how quickly AI has gained importance — regardless of what their customers say, graphic design software makers clearly seem to think they cannot survive without implementing some form of AI. The latest to double down on that strategy is Canva. The company on Thursday said it is adding a suite of new AI features to its platform, including an AI assistant, the ability to create apps with prompts, support for spreadsheets, and AI-powered editing tools. Called Canva AI, the company’s AI assistant can perform a host of tasks, from creating images according to your instructions, to coming up with design ideas — say, collateral for social media or mock-ups for printing. It can even write copy and create documents. And by tapping into a new tool dubbed Canva Code, the assistant can also be prompted to create mini-apps, like interactive maps or custom calculators, that can then be integrated in designs. Canva has partnered with Anthropic for this feature, the Australian design company’s co-founder and chief product officer Cameron Adams told TechCrunch. “Over the years, we have encouraged our teams to make interactive prototypes because static mock-ups don’t truly represent the experience we are trying to create with Canva for users. We started seeing teams inside Canva use AI a lot for prototyping. We thought of externalizing it and giving everyone the ability to code easily and create interactive experiences,” Adams said. To be clear, Canva is not the first to do this. Several startups such asCursor,Bolt.new,Lovable, andReplithave attracted lots of customers and attention for enabling users to prompt their way to creating applications. Still, Canva has an incentive to bake such a feature into its software, as it complements its broader selling point as a service used to design everything from marketing collateral to websites. Canva is also adding new AI features to its photo editor: One tool allows users to point and click to modify artifacts in photos, while another is a background generator that accounts for lighting and layout. This feature set seems aimed at helping the company compete with tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and Pixelmator (acquired by Apple last year). Last year, Canva launched anenterprise-focused productto better serve larger teams with features like single sign-on and access management tools. Now it’s adding spreadsheets to the mix with Canva Sheets. Besides the usual spreadsheet features, Canva Sheets comes with a tool called Magic Insights, which, as it says on the tin, surfaces insights gleaned from data on the sheet. There’s also a feature called Magic Charts, which converts raw numbers into charts automatically, complete with brand-specific graphics and logos. The company said Canva Sheets supports integrations with HubSpot, Statista, Google Analytics, and more to let users import data easily. Companies like Adobe, Canva, and Pixlr may be looking to add more value to their offerings, but the fact remains that bringing AI into design tools is causing some tension. Not only are artists worried about their work being used to train AI models without permission, but there’s also a real threat to creative design jobs. Still, Adams doesn’t see this as a clash between AI and creativity; rather, he sees this as a moment of growth and opportunity in the field. “I think all our jobs will change as AI comes, as different tools are integrated across every specialty, whether it be design, product management, engineering, marketing, or sales,” he said. “I think each job is going to change and adapt to the help they will get from AI tools. We just see a massive opportunity,” Adams said. Those changes, it seems, will be here sooner than most expect.

The company says the feature, which appears in ChatGPT’s settings as “reference saved memories,” aims to make conversations with ChatGPT more relevant to users. The update will add conversational context to ChatGPT’s text, voice, and image-generation features, the company added. The new memory feature will roll out first to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers, except for those based in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. OpenAI says these regions require additional external reviews to comply with local regulations, but the company is committed to making its technology available there eventually. OpenAI didn’t have news to share on a launch for free ChatGPT users. “We are focused on the rollout to paid tiers for now,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The aim of the new memory feature is to make ChatGPT more fluid and personal — you won’t have to repeat information you’ve already shared with ChatGPT. In February, Googlerolled out a similar memory featurein Gemini. Not every user will be thrilled with the notion of OpenAI vacuuming up more of their info, of course. Fortunately, there’s an opt-out. In ChatGPT’s settings, users can choose to turn off the new memory feature, as well as manage specific saved memories. OpenAI says you can also ask ChatGPT what it remembers, or switch to a Temporary Chat for conversations that won’t get stored. Last year, OpenAI updated ChatGPTto forget or remember specific details upon request. However, that feature typically required explicit prompting from users to update ChatGPT’s memory. Today’s rollout makes the process more seamless, in theory. OpenAI says that the new memory feature will be enabled by default for users who previously had ChatGPT’s memory capabilities turned on.

    "title": "UK announces further £450m military support to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "The government has announced a further £450m of military support to Kyiv, as the UK and Germany prepare to host a meeting of 50 nations in Brussels. Defence officials are convening to \"pile pressure\" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and force him to end his invasion of Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said. \"We must step up to deter Russian aggression by continuing to bolster Ukraine's defences,\" he added. The package includes funding for hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tanks mines and and repairs to military vehicles. About £350m will by provided by the UK, with extra funding from Norway via the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine. The package includes £160m to provide repairs and maintenance to vehicles and equipment the UK has already provided to Ukraine. A \"close fight\" military aid package, with funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones, worth more than £250m is also part of the package, the government said. Healey said the work of the group \"is vital to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position\". \"We cannot jeopardise peace by forgetting the war, which is why today's major package will surge support to Ukraine's frontline fight,\" he said. \"2025 is the critical year for Ukraine. \"Our job as defence ministers is to put into the hands of the Ukrainian war fighters what they need.\" The fund follows a series of military pledges to Ukraine from the UK. Last month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a£1.6bn missile deal for Ukraine,following a summit of European leaders in London, on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more military aid backed by profits from frozen Russian assets. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was \"small change\" and called for the government to seize Russian assets in Britain to give Ukraine more funding. \"While we welcome any increase in support for Ukraine, this package is small change compared to what's needed to combat Putin's barbaric war,\" the party's defence spokeswoman Helen Maguire said. Healey and his German counterpart, defence minister Boris Pistorius, are co-chairing Friday's meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, which had traditionally been hosted by the US defence secretary until Donald Trump became president in January. Since then, in a sign of the USstepping backfrom European security matters, Healey has taken over as chair. The meeting follows a similar gathering of defence ministers from 30 countries in the Franco-British-led\"coalition of the willing\", who met in Brussels to discuss installing a force in Ukraine to ensure enduring peace. Healey said he did not envisage \"a reassurance force\" that will \"separate the currently warring sides down the line of contact\", according to the AFP news agency, but added that bolstering Ukraine's armies would be a key part of the plan. Russian-American Ksenia Karelina was released by Moscow in return for the freeing of Russian-German Arthur Petrov. The \"coalition of the willing\" nations in support of Ukraine will meet at Nato headquarters later today - but how have three years of war shaped the president? The trip is being coordinated by the charity Fire Aid, and is the eighth by UK firefighters since 2022. President Zelensky says two soldiers were captured while fighting in Ukraine's Donetsk region. The US State Department said Ukraine would not be discussed during the talks.",

    "title": "Police raid barbers and vape shops suspected of being fronts for crime gangs",
    "article_text": "Police officers smash through the back doors of a bright, modern barber shop in the market town of Shrewsbury. Inside they immediately detain two men - who we are later told are Kurdish asylum seekers. Both men are later released. It is the first of six raids that day where police seize thousands of pounds in cash and illicit vapes. The officers are here with a warrant to search the premises because of suspected money laundering. They say their intelligence also suggests the shop is linked to sale of illicit cigarettes and vapes, illegal immigration and drug-dealing. Det Insp Daniel Fenn, on his ninth raid of the week, says some barber shops such as this are claiming income of £100,000 to £150,000 a month. \"They aren't getting that amount of customers to warrant that amount of money.\" CCTV in other barbers that have been raided has shown they do not have many customers, so footage of this one will also be examined, DI Fenn says. The raid in Shrewsbury was one of 265 carried out across England and Wales last month as part of a crackdown on High Street businesses - often Turkish-style barbers, vape shops and mini-marts - suspected of being fronts for international crime gangs. Politicians and members of the public have raised concerns about many of these businesses which have boomed even while High Streets appear to be in decline. The average number of barbers per person in England and Wales has doubled in the past 10 years, according to commercial property analysts Green Street. Now the National Crime Agency (NCA) says it has launched the crackdown, called Operation Machinize, in response to growing intelligence reports that some of these shops are being used for money laundering - where gangs falsely present the proceeds of criminal operations as if they were earnings from legitimate businesses handling large amounts of cash. Despite these shops operating openly for years on High Streets and attracting widespread local suspicion, this is the first co-ordinated action of its kind by police, tax and immigration inspectors and Trading Standards officers. We were given exclusive access to dozens of raids carried out by Greater Manchester and West Mercia Police. Det Insp Melanie Johnson, who led the operation for Greater Manchester Police, said her own local High Street had 10 barbers and a mini-mart, which was \"not sustainable\". \"As a mum to young children, I want them to grow up feeling safe, in a community that isn't derelict, a High Street that isn't falling apart, and isn't populated by criminality,\" she said. During the operation: The Shrewsbury raid was on a barber shop in the centre of town, one of five close together which were also targeted in the operation. \"Members of the public are angry. They can see these fronts are there,\" says Det Insp Fenn. \"The criminals feel they are hidden here. They think they can come to sleepy areas such as Shrewsbury and Telford and won't be found.\" It looks like the two men detained here have been living in the rooms above the barbers - there are clothes, shoes and food scattered on the floor as we move from room to room. The flats are barely furnished, with just a mattress and blankets on the floor. Det Insp Fenn says organised crime groups are different all over the country, but here he has been seeing familiar patterns of shops staffed with asylum seekers or illegal immigrants, many of the people in the barber shops being from Kurdish backgrounds. The detective says that behind the front of a High Street business \"the main criminality may be modern-day slavery, exploitation and drugs\". Despite the barber shop's supposed high revenue, police find an unpaid £7,000 gas bill along with the seized cash and illicit vapes. Legitimate barbers say they want to see a registration scheme and a crackdown on unscrupulous operators. Gareth Penn, chief executive of the Hair and Barber Council, said the rise of illegal barbers has led to fungal infections, such as ringworm, from improperly cleaned equipment. \"This has a massive impact on legitimate businesses as they can't compete against those with few of the costs genuine barbers have,\" said Mr Penn. The NCA estimates that £12bn in illicit cash is laundered in the UK every year, some of it through criminal front organisations on the High Street. Their numbers appeared to surge as shop vacancies grew in the wake of the pandemic, creating an opening for criminal gangs. Politicians began to demand action, prompting law enforcement, tax, immigration and Trading Standards agencies to develop this co-ordinated response. The NCA now has to analyse what Operation Machinize has uncovered for evidence of fraud and money laundering, to try to trace the networks behind these shops and stop the flow of criminal cash. Rachael Herbert, deputy director of economic crime at the NCA, said the presence of criminal front organisations \"gives the perception from the local community that criminals have the run of the High Street\" and contributes to the demise of shopping centres. \"Money laundering is not a victimless crime. It's associated with some of the most high-harm and violent crimes on the street,\" she said. The NCA believes some barber shops or mini-marts are used as fronts for drug-trafficking, people-smuggling, modern slavery and child sexual exploitation. These kinds of shops have also been linked to the illicit importation of tobacco, vapes and firearms. In 2023, it secured the conviction of one Iranian Kurdish barber shop owner, Hewa Rahimpur, who wasusing his shop in London as a base for a far-reaching criminal organisationwhich smuggled 10,000 people to the UK in small boats. \"These businesses also evade an enormous amount of tax. That is money that doesn't go to the exchequer to be used for local communities,\" Ms Herbert said. Seeing illicit products like vapes, cigarettes and tobacco on sale is also a red flag to the investigating teams. In Rochdale, the sniffer dog shakes with excitement, her tail wagging frantically, above a hole concealing dozens of boxes of illegally imported tobacco products in one shop. \"We could hit this shop every day for a week and we'd still find stuff. It's non-stop,\" Dennis Chalmers from Trading Standards says. \"These shops are just set up to do this.\" Outside on the street, Mr Chalmers gestures to half a dozen shops on the street which he has visited and believes to be linked. \"They seem to be popping up everywhere. There's like five, six hairdressers in one row.\" He estimates across Rochdale there are more than 20 businesses that are fronts for criminal organisations and he says he sees many of the same people from Iran, Iraq and Kurdistan working in them. In one shop, a worker who says he is Kurdish claims he has only worked there for two days. \"Two days?\" asks Mr Chalmers. \"Even though I saw you here last week?\" The shop worker tells the Trading Standards officer he doers not know his boss's name. Mr Chalmers tells us: \"The danger is, because you don't know who is behind these businesses, as the employee doesn't know who the owner is, when we try and chase them they just keep changing, changing.\" Companies House documents show the shop address has been used to register four almost-identically named businesses since 2019, three of which faced action to strike them off the company register for failing to file accounts properly. Immigration officers say the Kurdish man in the shop has been in the country for four years, but has been granted the right to work while he waits for his asylum application to be decided. Close by, police and Trading Standards officers show us more mini-marts that have been left empty - they say staff disappeared as soon as police arrived. Outside one, a man approaches us laughing. It is clear he is not put off by the police action. He tells us he is from Iran and, when questioned, claims he does not work in the shop. We return later and see him inside the mini-mart, apparently working. \"We see him every day,\" says Mr Chalmers in frustration. \"It's just a game to them. A dangerous one.\" He says he would like more resources to get on top of the issue and greater powers to shut down these premises more quickly. Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the operation \"highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face\". \"High Street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice,\" he said. But so far only 10 of the shops that were raided last month across England have been shut down. The majority of the shops we visited were back up and running within minutes of the police leaving. In Rochdale, we watched as Trading Standards officers identified a man they said was linked to the mini-marts walking from shop to shop with a backpack, which they believed contained illicit tobacco to restock the shelves. The challenge for authorities now is to stop the problem at its root and dismantle the suspected serious organised crime gangs - which may have been profiting in plain sight for years on our High Streets. Additional reporting by Rebecca Wearn Two men have been arrested on suspicion of kidnap, possession of a bladed article and recall to prison. Voters in parts of England will elect councillors and mayors on 1 May. Prosecutors allege girls were plied with drugs, alcohol and cigarettes and treated as \"sex slaves\".

    "title": "New pill can slow progression of incurable breast cancer",
    "article_text": "A new type of drug for one of the most common kinds of advanced breast cancer is now available on the NHS in England. Some 3,000 women a year could benefit from capivasertib after a clinical trial showed it can slow progression of the disease, and shrink tumours in a quarter of people. The drug has been given the green light for NHS funding by England's drug assessment body. It's one of a range of treatment options available to people whose cancer has spread and is no longer curable, but a cancer charity said breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with one in seven women affected in their lifetimes and 75% surviving for 10 years or more after diagnosis. If the cancer returns and spreads to other parts of the body, treatments aim to control it, reduce the symptoms and improve quality of life. Possible treatments include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drugs that help to stop the cancer growing - either by blocking hormones, boosting the body's immune system or targeting what makes cancer cells grow. This new drug capivasertib is a targeted therapy. It works in a new way, blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT which drives cancer growth. Scientists started working on the drug's development 20 years ago and say it's the most effective cancer drug they've seen for advanced cancer. \"It presents a very effective option that can work for a long time - many months, and in some people it can be years,\" said Prof Nick Turner, lead researcher and professor of medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden. In trials, in 708 women,when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months. It also shrank tumours in 23% of patients. \"It can substantially delay chemotherapy which many women fear because of the side-effects,\" Prof Turner added. \"Advanced breast cancer is highly treatable and we want kinder, better treatments.\" Linda Kelly, 67, is a keen gardener who keeps active by cycling 60 miles a week. She also does pilates. Breast cancer has spread to her bones and chest wall. But she's had \"fantastic\" results from the new drug capivasertib. \"It does let you have a normal kind of life and you forget you have cancer,\" she said. \"You feel the drug is working and you can be a lot calmer - it's given me nearly four years of extra time.\" Linda and her husband are now planning to travel. She says the drug has given her hope. \"It does make you think about your life, and what you want to do with your life in the future - but at least you feel well enough to make those plans and confident enough as well to fulfil some of those plans.\" The drug is suitable for those with certain gene mutations that affect up to half of people with hormone receptor positive secondary breast cancer - the most common type, which grows in the presence of oestrogen. Professor Peter Johnson, clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said it offered \"an additional option\" for some whose cancer has progressed despite previous hormone therapy - but it wouldn't be suitable for everyone. Claire Rowney, chief executive at charity Breast Cancer Now, said she was \"delighted\" that the drug would offer some people \"the hope of more precious time to do what matters most to them\". But she said patients had \"faced unnecessary delays in accessing it\" after the drug was initially rejected by NICE, and breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly for those who need them. \"NHS England must now put in place prompt genetic testing to ensure those eligible receive capivasertib without further delay,\" she said, adding that Scotland should also consider funding the treatment quickly so that patients across the UK would have access. Breast Friends co-founder Caroline Sturman says seeing the women on stage was a \"real proud moment\". An MHK joins others who are worried about staffing levels at the Isle of Man's breast cancer clinic. Sadie Ingamells is taking part in the Lincoln event to raise awareness of the disease. Megan Johnson has spoken about her mum's terminal cancer diagnosis and how the treatment is helping. Manx Care warns of delays to appointments due to a hold-up in having a new radiologist in place.",

    "title": "Oldest Post Office scandal victim says new compensation offer 'not good enough'",
    "article_text": "The oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal has had her offer of compensation increased but she said \"it's still not good enough\". Betty Brown, 92, was originally offered less than a third of what she had claimed for, but she has now received a new offer of 60%. However the former sub-postmistress told the BBC justice was still being denied. Post Office minister Gareth Thomas, who had previously promised to look at her case, said it was always the government's priority to pay as much redress as it could. Betty said she was forced out of her branch in Country Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent more than £50,000 of their savings to cover shortfalls that did not exist. It was the faulty software that made it look like money was missing from their branch. Her post office had been one of the most successful in the region but she was later forced to sell it at a loss. The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully accused of theft, with many being prosecuted and some even being sent to jail. The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK, and was the subject of ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\". \"It absolutely destroyed my whole life,\" she told the BBC. She thanked Mr Thomas for helping her but said there was \"still a long way to go to get the justice that we were promised\". Betty has been waiting 26 years for things to be put right. \"We're just getting fobbed off. The evidence is all there,\" she said. More than £892m has now been paid to over 6,200 claimants across four different compensation schemes, according to the latest government figures. But a group ofMPs in January saidcompensation is not being paid quickly enough, and called for changes to the way redress was being delivered. Mrs Brown was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Alan Bates against the post office. And she is seeking her compensation via the GLO scheme, established just over three years ago. Betty's story has become a high-profile case. Mr Thomas was pressed about it on BBC's Newsnight in January, where he promised to look into her case. He met Betty and several other victims the following day. Although Betty's offer has now increased from 29% to 60% of her claim it is still far less than what she says experts told her she could expect. News of her revised offer will not be encouraging for other victims also embroiled in disputes over what is full and fair redress. Post Office Minister Mr Thomas said he can \"understand the frustration when lawyers are not able to reach an agreement on a claim\". \"It is always our priority to pay as much redress as we can, and in some cases, we have been able to offer more than has been claimed,\" he said, adding that the government would take \"further steps to quickly and fairly resolve\" challenges in disputes such as Betty's.\" Betty is determined fight on to get what she still believes she is owed. Former sub-postmaster David Morley was awarded £13,000 following the Post Office Horizon scandal. About 1,000 staff will be offered the choice to work for any new owner or take voluntary redundancy. The post office in Paignton is one of 115 in the country earmarked for closure. The government takes over the Overturned Convictions Scheme for victims of the Horizon scandal. Lee Castleton has started a legal claim against his former employer over the Horizon scandal.",

    "title": "British man's tattoo wrongly linked to Venezuelan gang in US government document",
    "article_text": "A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group. Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation. \"I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire,\" he told BBC Verify. Mr Belton said it was a \"bit strange, bit funny at first\" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up \"being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo\". The Trump administration has already deported hundreds of alleged gang members toa high-security jail El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those deportees say they have been been incorrectly identified as TdA members based on their tattoos. Mr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for \"detecting and identifying\" TdA members. Other tattoos featured stars, crowns and a Michael Jordan \"jumpman\" logo. \"Open source material has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos,\" statesthe document which appeared in court filings. But reverse image searches show that several of the pictures first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious links to Venezuela or TdA. One of them led BBC Verify to an Instagram post by a Nottingham-based tattoo artist who posted about Mr Belton's tattoo nearly a decade ago. The tattoo image in the DHS document is worse quality than the Instagram post, which was shared in 2016, but it is clearly the same arm and features the same clock face tattoo. The same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 reportby the Texas Department of Public Safety(DPS) about TdA activity. BBC Verify contacted both the US DHS and the Texas DPS about the source of the images, but did not receive a response. But in an email the DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its \"assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media.\" It's unclear exactly how Mr Belton's tattoo ended up in the US documents, but he's worried about being linked to the gang. \"In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think 'hey up we've got one, he's the one in the document'.\" He provided multiple images of the tattoo to prove that it's his - and he says that he has no association to the Venezuelan group. The US government hasn't deported anyone based on their tattoos alone, according to comments from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)official in a court filing last month. However, court documents show immigration officials are employing a points-based system known as the\"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\"to determine if someone is linked to the Venezuelan gang. It includes a scorecard, and according to the document, eight points across a number of categories could be grounds for arrest or deportation. Half of these points can be given if a \"subject has tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TdA\". The document says if all eight points come from the symbolism category, which includes tattoos, then further consultation should be taken before designating someone as a member of TdA. Venezuelan investigative journalist Ronna Risquez, who wrote a book on TdA's origins, said tattoos alone are not evidence of membership. \"TdA does not have tattoos that identifies the gang,\" she said. \"To confirm whether a person is a member of TdA, authorities must conduct a police investigation to determine whether they have a criminal record. A tattoo, their clothing, or their nationality are not proof.\" However, there have been cases where lawyers have argued that people have been wrongfully identified based on their tattoos and were subsequently deported. US mediahave reported on a man who's lawyers say was deported because of a crown tattoo which was inspired by the Real Madrid football club logo. Another case saw a makeup artistwas sent to El Salvador after his a crown tattoo with the words \"mum\" and \"dad\" was used by US officials as evidence for gang membership, according to his attorneys. Back in Derbyshire, Mr Belton says his family have considered cancelling their trip to the US due to the potential risks, but they are going to monitor how the story develops. \"Hopefully now they'd realise I'm not a Venezuelan gangster but I've seen crazier things happen in the news recently, so we're just going to wait and see.\" What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

    "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex met war victims in Ukraine on Thursday when he visited a clinic which rehabilitates wounded military personnel and civilians, a spokesperson has said. Prince Harry visited the Superhumans Center, in the western city of Lviv, where he spoke to patients and staff. He was accompanied by a group from the Invictus Games Foundation, including four veterans who had been through similar rehabilitation. Lviv has frequentlybeen targetedwith Russian missiles and the visit was not announced until after the prince was out of the country. Prince Harry, who served for 10 years in the British Army, founded the Invictus Games in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events. The visit to Superhumans was to observe the support and rehabilitation services being provided in a country actively experiencing war, a spokesperson said. Prince Harry was invited by Olga Rudneva, a chief executive of the centre, at the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025. During the visit, the prince met patients and medical professionals, in addition to Ukraine's Minister of Veterans Affairs, Natalia Kalmykova. Th clinic administers psychological help, reconstructive surgery and prosthetics to victims for free. Rob Owen, chief executive of the Invictus Games Foundation, said Ukraine had been \"a vital part\" of the foundation since participating in the Invictus Games Toronto 2017. \"This visit to the Superhumans charity in Ukraine underscores the Invictus Games Foundation's broader commitment to supporting recovery and rehabilitation for wounded injured and sick service personnel and veterans, even in the most challenging environments,\" he said. Held in Vancouver, the last edition of the games involved more than 500 competitors from 23 nations, while Birmingham will host the next games in 2027. Prince Harrywas in London this week fora Court of Appeal hearing over his security arrangements in the UK. He is the second royal to visit Ukraine since Russia's full scale invasion,after the Duchess of Edinburghvisited Kyiv last year. His father the King welcomed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to his Sandringham estate in Norfolk in March, just days after Zelensky's unprecedented exchange with US president Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance in the White House's Oval Office. The Prince of Wales, Harry's brother, met Ukrainian refugees during a two-day visit to Estonia last month. The \"coalition of the willing\" nations in support of Ukraine will meet at Nato headquarters later today - but how have three years of war shaped the president? The Duke of Sussex is in court for the second day of his appeal over his level of security in the UK. The trip is being coordinated by the charity Fire Aid, and is the eighth by UK firefighters since 2022. Ukraine's operations in a second region in Russia are explicitly acknowledged for the first time. The Duke of Sussex is making his latest legal challenge on the level of police protection he should get when visiting the UK.",

    "title": "OpenAI sues Elon Musk claiming 'bad-faith tactics'",
    "article_text": "OpenAI is suing Elon Musk over claims he has tried \"nonstop\" to slow down its business for his own benefit. The company accuses the Tesla boss of using \"bad-faith tactics\" against OpenAI to help him control cutting-edge AI technology. Mr Musk sued OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman last year in a bid to stop him from changing its corporate structure. Mr Musk co-founded OpenAI with Mr Altman but left several years ago. The BBC has approached his lawyer for a response to OpenAI's lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday. The countersuit opens up a new front in the high-stakes battle between two Silicon Valley heavyweights. \"Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Today, we countersued to stop him.\" Last week, a federal judge in Oakland, California, set a March 2026 trial date in Mr Musk's suit in a bid to fast-track the legal fight. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers previously declined to grant Mr Musk an injunction that would temporarily halt OpenAI's conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit company. She also said that she expected Mr Musk to give evidence in the case. Mr Musk alleges that OpenAI strayed from its founding mission as a non-profit to develop AI for the benefit of humanity and is therefore in breach of contract. He left the company in 2018. \"This is about control. This is about revenue. It's basically about one person saying, 'I want control of that startup',\" said Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University. Lightman said it has been a distraction from making AI safe and equitable. \"That takes a backseat with all this rigmarole over control and monetization,\" Lightman said. OpenAI claims Mr Musk has \"been spreading false information about us,\" in a X post on Wednesday, adding \"Elon's never been about the mission. He's always been about his own agenda.\" Musk's xAI is a competitor to OpenAI, but has so far lagged behind. Last month, xAIacquiredMusk's social media platform X - formerly Twitter. Mr Musk claims the combined company, XAI Holdings, is valued at more than $100 billion. In February, Mr Musk made an unsolicited bid for OpenAI, offering to buy it for $97.4 billion, which Mr Altman rejected by posting: \"no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\"",

    "title": "UK sends military chief to China for first visit in 10 years",
    "article_text": "The head of the British armed forces has visited China for the first time in a decade. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin discussed \"issues of common concern\" with China's military leaders in Beijing, its defence ministry said in a short statement. \"We agreed that in an unstable world we must play our part as responsible nations with global interests,\" Sir Tony wrote on X, \"and we reflected on the importance of military-to-military communications\". The last time a Chief of the Defence Staff visited China was in 2015. Since becoming prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer has sought to strengthen ties with the country. The admiral's visit coincided with the escalation of an intense trade war between China and the US after President Trump's announcement of higher tariffs. Defence Secretary John Healey confirmed on Thursday that the trip had happened earlier this week. \"It's always good to have military to military engagement and that is what he was establishing\", Healey told reporters in Brussels. He said that the admiral's visit followed in the footsteps of one made recently by Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who became only the second foreign secretary to visit China in six yearswhen we went in October last year. Healey said that in the discussions the admiral was \"very firm in the arguments about peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific\" region \"and concerns about any use of military aggression or assertiveness to pursue political ends\". Healey did not specifically mention Taiwan, whereChina has launched major military drillswhich have been seen as provocation towards the island and wider region. Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Sir Tony has now joined the defence secretary in Brussels for meetings with allies on Ukraine. The Ministry of Defence says the technology will help keep soldiers safe.

    "title": "Faisal Islam: Trump may have backtracked, but this is far from over",
    "article_text": "There were some heroic efforts overnight from Donald Trump and those around him to suggest the past seven days were something other than absolute chaos. By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s. The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it. There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK. There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export. Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next Friday. Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remainstoo much uncertaintyfor companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade. The central issue today, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are now facing off against each other like rutting stags. Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut. The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work. Beijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever. Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough. In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts. Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars. What we saw last night was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices. Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market. As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%. This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion. The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action. Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change. Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump. China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge. More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy. The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue. The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China. Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along. This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports. The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them. It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America. There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.

    "title": "'It's fastest finger first' - traders on their tumultuous week",
    "article_text": "As a former champion runner, Richard McDonald can move quickly. But the speed of the market falls, triggered by the sweeping global tariffs Donald Trump announced last week, still kept him on his toes. Previously a trader for Credit Suisse, he now buys and sells stocks privately. At his laptop in London last week, he watched as the president unveiled a poster board outlining tariff rates, some as high as 50%, for imports from countries around the world. He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. \"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first',\" he said. \"My mind was sprinting.\" In 25 years of trading, he said he had rarely experienced anything like it. Trillions were wiped off the value of financial markets around the world in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement. Leading share indexes in the US and UK saw some of the steepest declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping more than 10% over three days. Oil prices sank and so did the dollar. By Wednesday, the worries had spread to the bond market, as investors started dumping US government debt, usually a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty. When Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied. But the market turmoil was far from over. Trump left in place a tariff of 10% on imports from most countries and a tariff of 145% on goods from China, America's third largest source of imports after the European Union and Mexico. A day after the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped another 3.5%, the Dow slid 2.5% and the Nasdaq fell 4.3%. At St Louis-based Argent Capital Management, the mood, said portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek, was \"still miserable\". Some of his firm's holdings, like health insurance giant United Healthcare, have done well over the last week, as investors look for companies likely to be able to weather the tariff storm. But his third largest investment is Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones and other products in China. \"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said. \"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said. \"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said. Faced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics. \"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\" While Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year. \"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said. \"We're just back trading again on the broader long-term outlook of the tariff implications, which is still negative.\" The government has said Kilmar Abrego Garcia was  deported because of an  \"administrative error\", but has fought against his return to the US. News of the US president's plan to halt higher-band taxes came as a surprise on Wednesday, but was it part of a plan?

    "title": "What does Trump's tariff pause mean for global trade?",
    "article_text": "There has been a historic upheaval in American trade policy. The announcement of Donald Trump's so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on 2 April - what he called \"liberation day\" - sent a shockwave through the global trading system and financial markets. And the President's 90-day pause on some of these tariffs on 9 April set off a relief rally in stock markets. But where has the rollercoaster of new US tariff announcements - and partial reversals - actually left the situation? And what will it all mean for global trade? The announced pause only applies to some of the new tariffs - taxes on imports - that Donald Trump announced on 2 April. The new minimum 10% tariff rate, which came into effect on Saturday 5 April, is still in place for goods coming from all countries, including the UK. There are exemptions for pharmaceuticals and microchips and some other items. But that 10% tariff in itself is a major change in America's trading relations with all other countries. And for China, the rate will not fall at all but will be hiked further to 125%, plus another 20% linked to the drug fentanyl. Nevertheless, the pause means the rates above 10% for 59 other territories will be suspended until July. That includes 46% on Vietnam, 44% on Sri Lanka and 20% on the European Union. That's something of a relief for these nations, especially developing countries that rely heavily on manufactured goods exports to America. Exports to the US are equivalent to 30% of Vietnam's economyand there were fears a 46% tariff would have plunged the South East Asian nation into recession. But Vietnam and others will still be paying the new 10% minimum tariff rate when previously many were facing substantially lower levies. Andcountries such as AustraliaandSouth Korea, which had free trade dealswith Washington - meaning zero tariffs on many exports to the US  - will still see a major break in their trading relationships with America. They too will be subject to the 10% tariff. The president has unilaterally torn up those free trade deals - as well as the one America had with Canada and Mexico, which Trump signed in his first term. Numerous other tariffs Trump has announced since returning to the White House remain in place and are not affected by the pause. That includes: In big picture terms, economists warn the extent to which the pause actually changes the direction of overall US trade policy should not be exaggerated. Bloomberg Economicshas calculated the US's average tariff on all its imports was set to go to 27% before yesterday's pause, the highest in more than 100 years. And after the pause they estimate it will rise to 24%, still the highest in a century. The pause on some tariffs has made relatively little difference for two reasons. First, because the 10% universal rate on all US imports still applies. Second, because of the president's simultaneous hike, alongside the pause, in the tariff rate imposed on all imports from China, from 104% to 125%. The US imported $440bn (£340bn) of goods from China in 2024,according to official US data. That still represented around 13% of all US goods imports. Most economists think, even after the pause, this all represents a major shift in US trade policy, which will harm the global economy. And the intensification of the US trade war with China on top of this is expected to do further damage. China and the US between them were projected to account for around 43% of the global economyby the International Monetary Fund in 2025. A slowdown in both economies as a result of the trade conflict will have a knock-on negative effect on most other countries. And economists caution that the impact of the additional uncertainty created by Trump's pause will in itself further undermine the world economy by holding back corporate investment. Before the Trump pause, some hoped the UK could potentially benefit in some ways from the new round of Trump tariffs. The UK's relatively lower tariff of 10% could have incentivised some multinational companies to produce more in Britain - rather than in the EU, which was facing a 20% tariff - for export to the US. With the EU now facing the same US tariff as the UK that incentive has gone, although the UK government hopes to ultimately negotiate a free trade deal with the US to eliminate the 10% tariff. It's also the case thatthe majority of the UK's exports to the US are services, rather than goods, and services are not affected by the US tariffs. Nevertheless, the UK is now in the same position as every almost every other country in the world with respect to US tariff barriers on goods. The UK is still facing America's 25% tariff on aluminium and steel exports - and also on products derived from those metals. The UK exported $720m (£558m) of raw steel and aluminium to America in 2024according to United Nations data. Andcalculations by the Global Trade Alert research groupsuggest UK exports of metal products that are exposed to these new tariffs amounted to $2.9bn in 2024. The UK is also subject to the new blanket US 25% import tariff on cars. Data from the Office for National Statisticsshows the UK exported $9bn of cars to the US in 2024, around a quarter of its total car exports. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

    "title": "Will iPhones cost more in the US because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
    "article_text": "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US. Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy. The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars. And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops. Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched. \"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US. Though others saythey believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK. And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device. While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025. \"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said. The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year,according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India. Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Reutersreported on Thursdaythat Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US. Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost. The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet. Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing. However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly. This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat. Applecommitted a $500bn (£385bn) investment in the US in February- which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing. But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money. \"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" hewrote on X on 3 April. Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash. \"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\" Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS. They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046. While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500. There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. This hasn't stopped some US customersreportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones. The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike. Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone. \"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said. Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad. \"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook. We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost. But if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices. CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market. The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost. The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions. \"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.

City police want to warn people and help reduce the £50m-a-year trade in stolen phones in London. Schools in Stamford are backing a campaign to ban smartphones for primary-age children. Ringwood School says smartphones are linked to mental health issues, poor sleep and a lack of focus.

    "title": "Retreat or negotiating strategy? Trump steps back from all-out trade war",
    "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause – news that triggered a brief stock market surge. But now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait. The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement. That framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. So was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work? It didn't take long for Trump's aides – many of the same people who said he would never back down – to fan out and celebrate the president's move. Trade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\". \"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\" They were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected? Ultimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions – but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" – a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course. Earlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. In the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course. He insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy. Democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\". \"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said. In the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. The reality is that the US is now making nice – or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. It is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs. That will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions. The big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week – setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order – will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. And in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.

    "title": "What goes on inside toddlers' brains? A pioneering project is trying to find out",
    "article_text": "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal. It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making. It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn. Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain. The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities. But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s. A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents. For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says. \"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\" Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. \"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\" During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains. Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too. \"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\" This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. \"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\" In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory. A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds. \"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read. \"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\" The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information. The Children of the 90s projectis now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health. The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers. One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it isunlikely to have any lasting impacton their health and development. Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet. And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed thatchildren who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind. In this latest study – of the children of the children of the 90s – scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school. Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles. \"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\" Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set. \"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\" Henry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats. \"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to. \"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\" Around 3,000 women a year with advanced cancer could benefit from capivasertib which can slow the disease.

    "title": "What we know about the Hudson helicopter crash",
    "article_text": "The New York Police Department (NYPD) has said a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River and killed all six people onboard. It is very much an active investigation, but here is what we know so far about the fatal crash: New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch has given some details about the fatal helicopter ride. She said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters and took off from the  Downtown Skyport on the lower side of Manhattan at 14:59 local time (19:59 BST). According to the popular real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24, the helicopter was in the air for about 15 minutes. It started its route heading towards the Statue of Liberty and pivoted north towards the George Washington Bridge. Then, the helicopter circled back down the Hudson along the New Jersey side and plunged into the River Hudson near a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey, at 15:15 local time (20:15 BST). The helicopter was upside-down when it hit the water, Tisch added. Police boats assisted in the rescue efforts and Bruce Wall, who was nearby when the crash happened, described what he saw. \"It started falling apart in mid-air and then the tail came off and then just flipped over in mid-air and started falling to the ground,\" he said. In total there were six people onboard the helicopter when it went down - including one American pilot. According to reports, a family of two adults and three children were taking the helicopter ride to see sights of New York. Dive teams worked to recover the bodies and despite CPR efforts all six people have been pronounced dead. Four victims were pronounced dead on scene, the other two victims were pronounced dead at an area hospital, officials have said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has not released any names of the victims but has said the family were from Spain. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation and early details are vague. But, NYPD Commissioner Tisch has said the \"aircraft lost control\" and hit the water \"just a few feet off the coast of a pier\". The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said the helicopter was a Bell 206. Both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate - with the NTSB leading the investigation. Thursday's incident was the deadliest helicopter crash in New York City since at least 2018, according to the New York Times. In that incident, allfive passengers drownedand only the pilot survived when a sightseeing helicopter that was flying with its doors off fell into the East River and flipped over. Five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from Spain and the sixth person was the pilot,  officials say. The government has said Kilmar Abrego Garcia was  deported because of an  \"administrative error\", but has fought against his return to the US. The former first lady says people were wrong to make assumptions that the couple were getting a divorce.

    "title": "Israeli army fired more than 100 shots in Gaza medics' killing, audio suggests",
    "article_text": "Israeli troops fired more than 100 times during an attack in which they killed 15 emergency workers in Gaza, with some shots from as close as 12m (39ft) away, a forensic audio analysis of mobile phone footage commissioned by BBC Verify has found. Two audio experts examined a 19-minute video authenticated by BBC Verify, showing the incident and the moments leading up to it near Rafah on 23 March. The findings support a claim made by the Palestinian Red Crescent that the workers were \"targeted from a very close range\". On 5 April an Israeli army official said aerial footage showed troops opening fire \"from afar\". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment on the analysis directly when approached by BBC Verify. A spokesperson said it was investigating the attack and repeated claims that six of the people killed were linked to Hamas, without offering evidence. The Palestinian Red Crescent rejected the allegation, as did a ninth paramedic who survived and was detained by the IDF for 15 hours. The Palestinian Red Crescent said thefull video was recovered from the phone of a medic killedand buried in a shallow grave by the IDF. Video filmed by medic Rifaat Radwan who was killed in the incident showed the convoy driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights. At least one medic can be seen wearing a high-vis jacket. Faced with this, the Israeli army changed its account, admitting that its initial statement that the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" with its lights off was inaccurate. Experts told BBC Verify they used sound waveforms and spectrograms to measure the distance of the gunfire from the microphone of the mobile. Shortened time gaps indicate that the distance between the microphone and the gunfire decreased as the video progressed. They concluded that the first shots were fired from around 40m to 43m away. But towards the end of the video, gunfire came from around 12m away. At a briefing on 5 April, an IDF official told reporters that surveillance showed the troops were at some distance when they opened fire, adding: \"It's not from close. They opened fire from afar.\" One military expert told BBC Verify that any engagements under 50m to 100m would be considered as being within close range. Robert Maher, an audio forensics expert at Montana State University, said towards the start of the footage one firearm is discharged about 43m away from the mobile phone. Mr Maher and another expert, Steven Beck, independently corroborated one another's view that in the final few moments of the audio, shots are fired as close at 12m away. Mr  Beck, a former FBI consultant who now runs Beck Audio Forensics, said: \"The shooter(s) at these times is much closer, with distances of 12m to 18m.  There is a strange pop sound that may be a tire hit by a bullet.\" He added: \"The shockwaves indicate that the bullets are passing close to the recorder microphone - meaning they are being shot at.\" Chris Cobb-Smith, a former British Army officer with over 20 years experience in conducting investigations in conflicts zones, said that at 50m the Israeli troops would have \"definitively been able to identify the convoy as humanitarian\" and would have been able to \"determine that the personnel were unarmed and not posing a threat\". Voices can also be heard towards the end of the recording, shouting in Hebrew: \"Get up,\" and: \"You (plural) go back\". Over the period of more than five minutes, at times, multiple firearms were in use simultaneously, the audio experts determined. Mr Maher said \"the sounds are often overlapping in such a way that it is clear multiple firearms are in use at the same time\". Because of the overlap of gunshots, Mr Maher said it's difficult to identify individual shots. But both experts determined independently that there were more than 100 shots. Our audio analysts could not comment on which weapons were being used but Mr Beck said there are \"several bursts of fully automatic gunfire\". A bullet travelling at supersonic speed first creates a sonic boom - often called a \"crack\". The sound of the bullet being fired is what creates a second sound, often called a \"pop\". At close distances, the two sounds are almost indiscernible to the human ear. But by looking closely at the waveform of the audio, the two sounds can be detected and the distance between them measured. What Mr Maher describes as \"crack-pop sequences\" are visible in these waveforms. Mr Maher said the further away the firearm is from the microphone, the longer the gap between the two sounds. Mr Maher said: \"The first few audible gunshots have a crack-pop timing of about 72ms.  Assuming a bullet speed of 800 m/s and speed of sound 343 m/s, that time gap implies the firearm was about 43 meters away.  If the bullet speed were actually faster, that would move the firearm estimate closer to the microphone.\" There are limitations to their estimates. For example, analysts told us they cannot be certain of the type of firearm used or of the miss distance, which is how far off the shot is from the intended target. They also must make an assumption about the average speed of the bullet. BBC Verify will continue to investigate this incident. Additional reporting by Thomas Spencer. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Students, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what has happened and the destruction that surrounds them.

    "title": "Trump signs order to 'make America's showers great again'",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump is going to \"make America's showers great again\" by easing rules restricting water flow, the White House says. The US president is ordering the energy secretary to rescind a change introduced by Barack Obama that restricted multi-nozzle showers from discharging over 2.5 gallons of water per minute overall. This served \"a radical green agenda that made life worse for Americans\", the White House said, as Trump criticised the \"ridiculous\" amount of time he says it takes to wet his hair in the shower. Consumer and conservation groups have previously argued that changing the rules is wasteful and unnecessary. According to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which shared a factsheet  in 2024, efficiency standards in the US set more than three decades ago \"reduce water waste... save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help protect the environment\". Under a 1992 energy law, showerheads in the US are not allowed to produce more than 2.5 gallons (9.5l) of water per minute. Obama introduced a redefinition, as part of an Energy Conservation Program, that meant for showers with multiple nozzles, the restriction applied overall rather than to each nozzle. At the end of Trump's first term, in 2020, he moved to allow each nozzle to produce up to 2.5 gallons a minute. But when Joe Biden succeeded him as president, he stopped that. The current administration has dubbed their efforts a \"war on water pressure\", saying Americans \"pay for their own water and should be free to choose their showerheads without federal meddling\". Trump now wants to return to the \"straightforward meaning\" of 'showerhead' from the 1992 law. According to the White House fact sheet: \"The Order frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare. \"No longer will showerheads be weak and worthless.\" The order says the change will come into effect 30 days after the energy secretary publishes a notice rescinding the definition. While signing the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said it was \"ridiculous\" he has to stand under the water for 15 minutes for his \"beautiful\" hair to get wet - echoing remarks he made during 2020. At that time,he also complained about water not coming out of shower heads,saying his hair \"has to be perfect\". Five of the individuals on board were a family of tourists from Spain and the sixth person was the pilot,  officials say.

A majestic first round saw 44-year-old Rose card a seven-under 65, putting him three clear of a group featuring defending champion Scottie Scheffler at the top of leaderboard. McIlroy's pursuit of a career-defining Masters win were hit by two late mistakes which leave him seven shots behind Rose. The 35-year-old Northern Irishman started his latest bid to complete the career Grand Slam with a level-par 72. Rose, also bidding to wear the Green Jacket for the first time, leads  with world number one Scheffler, last year's runner-up Ludvig Aberg and Canada's Corey Conners joint second. Tyrrell Hatton, another Englishman, is a shot back after a 69, the same score as two-time US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau. England's Aaron Rai briefly led on his Masters debut before ending the opening day in joint seventh after a two-under 70. 'I needed to pee' - Masters debutant takes relief in Rae's Creek A straight duel at the Masters? Or will another champion emerge? McIlroy's daughter steals show at 'cool and unique' Par 3 Contest With an enviable record at Augusta, Rose possesses the knowledge and expertise to finally get his hands on the Green Jacket. The former world number one has secured two runners-up finishes, plus 14 others in the top 25, since making his debut in 2003. While many thought his chance of adding to his 2013 US Open victory might have gone, Rose has given himself another opportunity as he bids to become the oldest first-time Masters champion since 41-year-old Mark O'Meara in 1998. Rose made a rapid start with three birdies in the opening three holes, continuing to use his putter marvellously to sink three more in a row around the turn. Further birdies on 15 and 16 secured his position as the first-round leader for a record fifth time - but he fell short of creating further history. Two more birdies on the final two holes would have seen Rose become the first man to shoot 62 at Augusta National. One birdie would have equalled the course record of 63 held jointly by Nick Price and Greg Norman. Loose drives led to a par-bogey finish but it did not diminish a wonderful round which saw him post his joint lowest score at the Masters. Rose looked totally relaxed as he headed off the course, smiling broadly as he slapped high-fives with the patrons congratulating him on a fantastic day's work. \"It was a really good day's golf on a course that was a stern test,\" he said. \"If you look at the overall leaderboard, there are not many low scores out there.\" This video can not be played McIlroy finds water to double 15 However, the veteran Englishman knows those errant tee-shots on 17 and 18 serve as a reminder of how quickly things can change at a major. It was a lesson McIlroy endured once again at Augusta. The world number two said he has \"never been in better form\" as he arrived in Georgia for his 11th attempt at completing the career Grand Slam - having won two PGA Tour events at Pebble Beach and TPC Sawgrass. And he demonstrated his confidence in a bogey-free first nine containing three birdies. Another birdie on the 13th left McIlroy well placed on four under before an aggressive chip from off the back of the par-five 15th green ended in the water and led to a seven. He followed that with another double bogey on the par-four 17th, blotting what had previously been a consistent card where he had played with patience and maturity. Such was his disappointment at his closing holes, McIlroy passed on post-round media interviews, and headed straight to the practice area. This video can not be played Scheffler features in Masters day one best shots Even though Scheffler's start to the season has been slow by his lofty standards, he remains the man to beat. Hampered initially by a hand injury sustained when trying to roll out ravioli with a wine glass on Christmas Day, the 28-year-old American arrived at Augusta feeling he is peaking at the right time. Scheffler finished joint runner-up in Houston two weeks ago and, with the major season getting under way at the Masters, laid down another warning to his rivals that he is finding form. While not at his clinical best, he has put himself in a strong position with a bogey-free round - and, ominously for his rivals, has the capacity to go further through the gears over the next three days. His driving and iron approaches were solid, enhanced by converting a couple of lengthy putts. Scheffler set the tone with a confident birdie putt on the second, landing a monster from 62 feet on the fourth - sending the patrons into raptures - and adding another shorter one on the ninth. The two-time champion's first real mistake of the day came when he lipped out from seven feet on the 13th and had to settle for a par. But he made amends by holing from 42 feet for a two on the par-three 16th. \"I felt pretty good. Anytime you can keep a card clean out here, it's a really good thing,\" Scheffler said. \"I had to make two really good up-and-downs. But other than that, the golf course was in front of me most of the day, kept the ball in play, did a lot of really good things out there.\" Playing at the Masters is a reward for Rai's success over the past couple of years. A maiden PGA Tour title at the Wyndham Championship last year helped the 30-year-old from Wolverhampton climb into the world's top 50. Virtually every Masters debutant - understandably - says competing at Augusta National is a \"dream come true\". Rai was no exception. It became even dreamier when he took the outright lead after four birdies on the first nine without dropping a shot. But three successive bogeys on 11, 12 and 13 - the notorious Amen Corner - were a reminder of Augusta's propensity to bite back. Rai was unfazed and rallied. Two birdies, either side of a bogey on 16, ensured he was the early clubhouse leader. \"Without playing this course under competitive conditions before, it's very difficult to figure out how it is going to play in the flow of it,\" he said. \"So I'm very, very pleased with how it went overall.\" Bernhard Langer was one under after nine holes before three bogeys on the second nine Two-time championBernhard Langerdipped into vintage fashion as he began his 41st and final Masters appearance. The 67-year-old German wore an all-red outfit in homage to his first victory in 1985 as he carded a two-over 74. On Friday, he plans to rehash the green and yellow number he donned when he won his second Augusta title in 1993. \"It's more or less to celebrate the two outfits that I put the Green Jacket on. That's the idea behind it,\" Langer said. Fred Couples,another veteran champion, provided a magical moment when he holed out from 191 yards for an eagle on the 14th. The 65-year-old American, who won the 1992 tournament, moved to one under as a result. Couples closed out with four pars for a 71 which he hopes will help him make the cut for only the second time in the past seven years.

The 55-year-old Argentine was found guilty in 2021 of numerous charges that included assault, theft and illegal intimidation against former girlfriends. While Augusta chairman Fred Ridley said Cabrera was invited to return, as all past champions are, women's action groups have expressed their disappointment with that decision.

    "title": "'I've made more mistakes than them' - Amorim defends Onana after errors",
    "article_text": "Andre Onana was at fault for both Lyon goals in Thursday's Europa League quarter-final first leg Ruben Amorim says he has made more mistakes as Manchester United manager this season than his under-fire goalkeeper Andre Onana. Onana was at fault for both Lyon's goals inhis side's 2-2 drawin the Europa League on Thursday - a day after he had been called \"one of the worst goalkeepersâ in United's history by former Red Devils player Nemanja Matic. Since the start of last season, Onana has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club. But Amorim, who was appointed United manager in November, said: \"If you look at the season I've made more mistakes than them during these last games and during these last months. \"There's nothing I can say to Andre in this moment that will help him, so the most important thing is to be natural and then when the time comes I will choose the best XI to play. But I'm really confident in Andre.\" United host Lyon in the second leg at Old Trafford next Thursday (20:00 BST). With the Red Devils 13th in the Premier League their only realistic hope of European football next season is through the Champions League spot afforded to the Europa League winner. When asked if he still had faith in his keeper, Amorim told TNT Sports: \"We continue to do the same thing. Training, seeing the games, trying to choose the best eleven to win every match.\" Man Utd being destroyed under Ratcliffe - Cantona Late Lyon leveller keeps Man Utd tie in balance after Onana errors United went behind after 25 minutes when Onana failed to get a strong enough hand to Thiago Almada's wide free-kick. The 29-year-old reacted late to Almada's cross, having to wait to see if a Lyon player would divert the ball, and was caught out when the free-kick kept its line. The ball bounced just before Onana and then skidded through his gloves before hitting the net. After turning the tie around, United conceded a second with virtually the last kick before the final whistle when Onana spilled Georges Mikautadze's shot and Rayan Cherki tapped in on the rebound. On BBC Radio 5 Live former England midfielder Aaron Lennon said Onana's team-mates would be \"fuming\" with the goalkeeper's performance. \"They're two massive mistakes,\" he said. \"He has got to save both of them in my opinion and he has cost United today.\" Amorim also said his side \"should have taken a one goal advantage to the next game\". But the Portuguese manager stressed \"when one player has a mistake, all the team has a mistake so we continue like that\". The pressure was on Onana on Thursday night after he and Matic exchanged verbal blows the day before. Matic, who played for the club between 2017 and 2022, called Onana \"statistically one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United history\". The Serb, who was an unused substitute for Lyon, had been responding to comments by Onana who said his side are \"way better\" than their French opponents. Onana was given a rowdy reception when he came out to warm up and was booed every time he touched the ball inside Groupama Stadium. He dropped to his knees and celebrated passionately when his side took the lead in the 88th minute. Onana has the worst minutes per goal conceded ratio of all Manchester United keepers with 10 or more Premier League appearances. But, since moving to United, he has also ranked second on Opta's goals prevented metric behind only Jordan Pickford.

    "title": "Aspinall wins Premier League night in Manchester",
    "article_text": "Nathan Aspinall moved into the Premier League play-off spots with his firstly nightly win of 2025 Nathan Aspinall delighted his home crowd in Manchester as he claimed his first nightly win of the year to move into the Premier League play-off places. The 33-year-old from Stockport came back from 3-0 down to beat world number one Luke Humphries 6-4 in the final. After Humphries missed a dart to go 4-0 up, Aspinall came roaring back to win the next five legs on the spin before completing victory in the 10th leg. A lively night at the AO Arena also saw a nine-darter from Gerwyn Price and the sixth-highest average in PDC televised history - 118.43 - from Humphries in the quarter-finals. It was more of a battle for Humphries in the semi-finals as he ground out a 6-4 win over world champion Luke Littler with neither player at their best. Meanwhile, Aspinall put in a superb performance to beat three-time world champion Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals, averaging 101.31 in a convincing 6-2 win. He started slowly in the final, though, and Humphries raced into a 3-0 lead. But Aspinall hung in and an 11-dart break of throw for 3-2 started the comeback. The 2023 World Matchplay champion dragged his average up from the mid-70s to 93.29 and threatened to seal victory in style with six perfect darts to start the leg at 5-4. But nerves hit at the crucial moment, the nine-darter came and went with Humphries even having darts to force a deciding leg before Aspinall finally hit double four to clinch it. \"It wasn't a pretty game in the final but I have never, ever, ever been so nervous as on those last darts,\" Aspinall told Sky Sports. \"I am in Manchester. What support I've had tonight. They were absolutely unreal. I wanted to win so much for the crowd. \"I've been through an horrendous two years but I am a fighter, I am a warrior and people like Michael van Gerwen call me a Jack Russell. \"I don't know when I'm beaten and at the end of the day I am in a privileged position and I respect that. I'll keep fighting till the end I will never ever give up.\" Aspinall has struggled with dartitis and injury in recent years but is now up to fourth in the standings, level on points with Price in third and Van Gerwen in fifth. Littler, who has been seeking a record fifth nightly win of the season, remains top but his lead has been trimmed to five points by Humphries. Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Recap: All the darting drama as it happened in Manchester Bunting's Berlin win ends Premier League drought Gerwyn Price's nine-darter was his fourth in the Premier League Sparks flew in the quarter-finals. Price was trailing Littler 5-1 in the quarter-finals when he recorded his first nine-darter, and the fourth overall, of this year's competition. The Welshman followed Humphries, Rob Cross and Littler in achieving the perfect leg. Price hit five 180s to one for his opponent and was only just behind the teenager's average of 103.93, but Littler ended a six-game losing streak to the 2021 world champion and tapped his watch at the end as if to say 'about time'. Humphries had said this week that hewill keep quiet in the future after facing a backlash regarding his comments about struggling with the current darts schedule. He faced Stephen Bunting on the back of his opponent winning his first points of the campaign following a night victory a week ago, and lifting the International Open title on Sunday. But 2024 world champion Humphries produced a special display, with his 118.43 average the third highest in a Premier League match. Van Gerwen shrugged off injury concerns with an impressive 6-4 defeat of Chris Dobey. Cross was two away from his own nine-darter in the second leg of his tie against Aspinall, who reeled off four in succession to triumph 6-2 for an eighth successive win over his fellow Englishman. Final Nathan Aspinall 6-4 Luke Humphries Semi-finals Michael van Gerwen 2-6 Nathan Aspinall Luke Littler 4-6 Luke Humphries Quarter-finals Chris Dobey 4-6 Michael van Gerwen Nathan Aspinall 6-2 Rob Cross Luke Littler 6-3 Gerwyn Price Stephen Bunting 1-6 Luke Humphries Premier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night. Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "title": "BJK Cup withdrawals 'a tennis, not a player, problem'",
    "article_text": "Katie Boulter (right) will lead the British team in Billie Jean King Cup qualifying Great Britain captain Anne Keothavong says the lack of top-20 players at the Billie Jean King Cup is \"a tennis problem, not a player problem\". Only three of the world's top-20 will compete in this week's qualifying rounds, with Poland's Iga Swiatek and American trio Jessica Pegula, Coco Gauff and Madison Keys among those absent. World number two Swiatek withdrew last week, saying she needed time to \"focus on myself and my training\". Britain, meanwhile, are without Emma Raducanu, who has opted to train and \"look after her body\" after her Miami Open quarter-final run in her seventh event of the year. The top teams in each round-robin group will advance to September's eight-team finals in Shenzhen, China. \"It's tough for every nation to put out their best players in each tie,â Keothavong told BBC Sport in The Hague, where Britain are in a group with Germany and the Netherlands. \"The calendar is just makes it so difficult for players, so I'm empathetic as to how they are. \"The tennis circuit is brutal - you go from one week to the next and there's not much time to rest and recover. \"You have got to try and pick and choose your moments, but it's not a player problem - it's a tennis problem. \"One of these days maybe everyone can figure out a solution and work together.\" GB bid for BJK Cup Finals place - watch live on BBC GB's Draper suffers third-round Monte Carlo exit Djokovic exits Monte Carlo in 'horrible' Tabilo defeat One solution is to play the Finals earlier in the season - and as Keothavong was speaking it was confirmed they will take place from 16-21 September, rather than the traditional November date. November, when the WTA Tour season is over for the year, has often proved unpopular with players, and it will now take place at the start of a seven-week run of tournaments in Asia. GBâs team includes world number 40 Katie Boulter and 60th-ranked Sonay Kartal. Harriet Dart and Olivia Nicholls are also involved, with Jodie Burrage added when Raducanu withdrew last week. \"Obviously it's disappointing we don't have her on this team, but I totally understand what she needs to do,â Keothavong said of Raducanu. \"A player has got to do what a player has got to do - what is best for them. \"She has given a lot to this team and she may not be with us this time round but I hope in the future she will be.\" Boulter, who suffered a stress fracture of the back on national team duty in 2019,  also emphasised the importance of managing your workload. \"I made that mistake once when I went out and played and got injured, so I've always said number one thing is your body,\" British number one Boulter said. \"You have to look after it, or else unfortunately you're not going to be playing week in week out, and that's the most important thing for me. \"Representing your country is an honour and a privilege and I do my very best with my body to be here every time. \"I think that's all we can ask of any person.\" Boulter will lead the British team on the clay - a surface on which she has relatively little experience. Boulter had not played a tour-level match on clay before the Madrid Open last April. Kartal is likely to make her debut by taking the second singles role. She will be buoyed by her run to the last sixteen in Indian Wells last month and playing on a surface which \"enhances my game style even more\". GB reached the semi-finals last year, losing to eventual runners-up Slovakia.",

    "title": "Supreme court orders US to help return man wrongly deported to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "TheUS supreme courtupheld on Thursday a judge’s order requiring Donald Trump’s administration to facilitate the return to the United States of a Salvadoran man who the government has acknowledged was deported in error to El Salvador. US district judge Paula Xinis last week issued an order that the administration “facilitate and effectuate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, in response to a lawsuit filed by the man and his family challenging the legality of his deportation. The supreme court, in an unsigned decision, said that the judge’s order “properly requires the government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody inEl Salvadorand to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”. However, the court said that the additional requirement to “effectuate” his return was unclear and may exceed the judge’s authority. The justices directed Xinis to clarify the directive “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”. The administration, meanwhile, “should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,” the court directed. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living inMarylandand has had a work permit since 2019, was stopped and detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was deported on 15 March on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members. Justice department lawyers in a supreme court brief had argued that the judge’s order, by requiring theTrump administrationto “effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return, had impermissibly encroached on presidential authority on foreign relations in violation of the US constitution’s separation of powers between its judicial and executive branches. “The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge’s bidding,” justice department lawyers wrote. The supreme court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices on Thursday issued a statement agreeing with the court’s decision, but said they would have denied the administration’s request outright. “To this day, the government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia’s warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his confinement in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it,” liberal justiceSonia Sotomayorwrote in the statement. Sotomayor added that the administration had requested “an order from this court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law”. Abrego Garcia is married to a US citizen with whom he is raising a US citizen child in addition to his wife’s two children from a prior relationship. He had never been charged with or convicted of any crime, according to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who have denied the justice department’s allegation that he is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.",

    "article_text": "A US fugitive has shot and killed a Mexican police officer in the elite international liaison unit – known as “the Gringo Hunters” – which specialises in arresting US citizens on the run inMexico. Mexico has long been seen as a place to escape US law enforcement. The Gringo Hunters was set up in 2002 to cooperate with US authorities, and have since arrested more than 1,600 fugitives. These have included formerPlayboy models, Catholic priests and professional athletes, among fraudsters, murderers and paedophiles. The Gringo Hunters learn to spot the telltale signs of an American in Mexico, from stilted Spanish to a prediction for flip flops. This time members of the unit were trying to arrest a suspect in the border city of Tijuana on Wednesday when the man opened fire, hitting Abigail Esparza Reyes, the 33-year-old leader of the unit in the state of Baja California. Local media have reportedly identified the suspect as César Hernández, 34, who in December escaped from state prison in US, where he was serving a life sentence for murder. Hernández’s escape made news at the time withvideo footageshowing him sprinting across a field in an orange jump suit with an officer in pursuit. Months later, the Gringo Hunters allegedly tracked him down to the Colonia Barcelona neighbourhood, about 30 miles from the border, and carried out an operation on Wednesday to arrest him but were met with bullets. Esparza Reyes was hit and pronounced dead at a hospital. Dozens of Mexican security forces from all three levels government, backed up with drones and a helicopter, then pursued the suspect to a house. Nonetheless, Hernández managed to escape their cordon and flee the scene. Local mediareportedthat he managed to do so while running almost naked through the streets, before ducking under a tarp over a car and emerging dressed in a fluorescent green uniform, similar to ones used by transport police, before walking away. The suspect is at large and the manhunt continues. The state governor, Marina del Pilar, posted on social media to express her regret over the death of Esparza Reyes, who had led more than 400 operations to arrest US fugitives in Mexico. “Abigail’s life will be honoured and her death will not go unpunished,” wrote del Pilar.",

    "title": "US judge allows White House to require noncitizens to register with government",
    "article_text": "A federal judge is allowing theTrump administrationto move forward with a requirement that noncitizens in the US must register with the federal government, in a move that could have far-reaching repercussions for immigrants across the country. In a ruling on Thursday, judge Trevor Neil McFadden sided with the administration, which had argued that they were simply enforcing an already existing requirement for everyone in the country who wasn’t a US citizen to register with the government. The requirement goes into effect on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security announced on 25 February that it was mandating that noncitizens register with the federal government, and said those who didn’t self-report could face fines or prosecution. Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines. Registration will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older without legal status. People registering have to provide their fingerprints and address, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they registered. The registration process also applies to Canadians who are in the US for more than 30 days, such as so-called snowbirds who spend winter months in places like Florida. Federal immigration law has long required that people who aren’t US citizens and live in the US, including those here illegally, register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of the second world war. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. But the requirement that noncitizens register has been enforced only in rare circumstances. In fact, advocates opposing the government say it hasn’t been universally used since it was first introduced in the mid 1940s. It was used in a limited way after September 11, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required that all noncitizen males age 16 and older from 25 countries – all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim – register with the US government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016. The Trump administration has argued that the registration requirement has always existed and that officials are simply enforcing it for everyone. The groups that sued say this registration process is expressly to facilitate Donald Trump’s aim of carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally. The plaintiffs also say the government should have gone through the more lengthy public notification process before bringing about the change. They argue that the registry puts people who work, contribute to the economy and have deep family ties in the US into a deep bind: do they come forward, register and essentially give up their location to a government intent on carrying out mass deportations, or do they stay in the shadows and risk being charged with the crime of not registering? The government has already asked people subject to the registration requirement to create an account on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.",

    "title": "US extradites Canadian citizen to India for alleged role in deadly Mumbai attacks",
    "article_text": "A Pakistan-born Canadian citizen wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 2008Mumbai siegehas landed in New Delhi after his extradition from the United States. Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 64, arrived at a military airbase outside the Indian capital under heavily armed guard late on Thursday, and will be held in detention to face trial. India accuses Rana of being a member of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group, designated by the United Nations as a terrorist organisation, and of helping to plot the attacks. The National Investigation Agency said it “secured the successful extradition of …Mumbaiterror attack mastermind Tahawwur Rana from the US”. The extradition took “years of sustained and concerted efforts to bring the key conspirator behind the 2008 mayhem to justice”. Donald Trump announced in February that Washington would extradite Rana, whom he called “one of the very evil people in the world”. Rana was flown to India after the US supreme court this month rejected his bid to remain in the United States, where he was serving a sentence related to another LeT-linked attack. New Delhi blamed the LeT group – as well as intelligence officials from New Delhi’s arch-enemy, Pakistan – for the 2008 Mumbai attacks wherein 10 Islamist gunmen carried out a multiday slaughter in the country’s financial capital, killing 166 people and injuring hundreds more. India accuses Rana of helping his long-term friend, David Coleman Headley, who was sentenced by a US court in 2013 to 35 years in prison after pleading guilty to aiding LeT militants, including by scouting target locations in Mumbai. Rana, who denies the charges, is accused of playing a smaller role than Headley, but India maintains he is one of the key plotters. Rana “is accused ofconspiring with David Coleman Headley, and operatives of designated [Pakistan-based] terrorist organisations LeT and Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami … to carry out the devastating terror attacks,” the NIA said in the statement. Rana, a former military medic who served in Pakistan’s army, emigrated toCanadain 1997, before moving to the United States and setting up businesses in Chicago, including a law firm and a slaughterhouse. He was arrested by US police in 2009. A US court in 2013 acquitted Rana of conspiracy to provide material support to the Mumbai attacks. But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark. Rana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad. In February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.",

    "title": "Italy investigates possible mistaken-identity killing of scientist in Colombia",
    "article_text": "Prosecutors in Rome have opened an investigation into the murder of an Italian scientist in Colombia, with one theory being that he could have been killed by warring criminal clans in a case of mistaken identity. Alessandro Coatti, who until late last year worked at the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) in London, was last seen leaving a hostel in Santa Marta, a port city on the Caribbean coast, on 3 April. The 38-year-old’s dismembered body partswere foundtwo days later in a suitcase dumped on the outskirts of the city. The molecular biologist had been travelling and conducting research in South America after working in London for eight years. There is no evidence that Ciotta had any links to organised crime. Rome prosecutors will collaborate with counterparts in Colombia, with Italy expected to send a team of investigators to Santa Marta. According to reports in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, one line of inquiry is that Coatti could have been killed by mistake in the context of a “settling of scores” between organised crime groups. Lerber Dimas, a crime expert, told the Colombian news websiteEl Tiempothat the killing bore the hallmarks of the two armed groups operating in the area, Clan del Golfo and the Autodefensas Conquistadores de la Sierra. Norma Vera Salazar, a human rights expert, said there had been a spate of similar crimes. “There is a clear recurring pattern in these crimes: bodies are tortured, dismembered, stuffed into garbage or coffee sacks, and abandoned along rural roads,” she told El Tiempo. “These types of murders are used by self-defence groups to send warning messages, instil fear and mark territory.” Coatti was travelling alone in South America, visiting Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador before arriving on 3 April in Santa Marta, which is surrounded by beaches and mountains and is a gateway to some of Colombia’s most popular tourist destinations. His disappearance was reported the next day. Coatti was born in Italy’s northern Emilia-Romagna region, where his parents live in the town of Alfonsine, close to Ravenna. He was planning to return to Italy for Easter, his uncle Giovanni told the Italian press. “Alessandro was a good, happy person and a brilliant biologist,” he told the local news siteIl Resto del Carlino. “He loved to travel and discover the world.” He added: “We are shocked, what happened is surreal. We have entrusted ourselves to the Italian and Colombian authorities. We want the truth. Alessandro was only 38 years old, with a life ahead of him. We cannot understand why this happened to him, and in that way.”",

    "title": "UK adventurer apologises for record trek claim after Inuit backlash",
    "article_text": "A British adventurer has apologised after her claims to be the first woman to traverse Canada’s largest island solo were dismissed by members of the Inuit population who criticised her dangerous “privilege and ignorance”. Camilla Hempleman-Adams, 32, covered 150 miles (240km) on foot and by ski while pulling a sledge across Baffin Island, Nunavut, in temperatures as low as -40C and winds of 47mph during the two-week expedition last month. The trek took Hempleman-Adams, the daughter of the adventurer Sir David Hempleman-Adams, from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung, through Auyuittuq national park. But her claims have been described as incorrect, with local people saying they had travelled the same route for generations. Gayle Uyagaqi Kabloona, an Inuit artist based in Ottawa, said onInstagram: “There is no way in hell a British colonizer is coming to Inuit Nunaat in 2025 and claiming any firsts. “My gramma walked 100’s of km yearly, often pregnant, to Spring fishing and winter caribou hunting grounds because that was life. Every inch of this continent has indigenous history and stories like this. Help me call out this ignorant and racist behaviour.” Kabloona said the matter had affected the community because many people who lived traditional nomadic lifestyles had died, raising concerns that cultural practices would gradually be lost to time. “The article hit people really hard in a very sensitive spot because of our history and the difficulties we face every day in combatting western colonialism,”she told the BBC. “This woman is coming here from such a place of privilege and ignorance that it seems dangerous. It was almost like she was bringing back news of a new continent to Europe and saying: ‘There’s nobody here!’ We were and still are.” She added: “It’s such a clear example of how colonialism benefits from dispossessing Indigenous people of their land and writing us out of history.” Hempleman-Adams wrote on her expedition website before departure: “Parks Canada has confirmed there are no historical records of a female solo attempt from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung.” Kabloona said this was because crossing the terrain was considered “a normal way of life for them”. Hempleman-Adams, a producer living in London and the youngest British woman to ski to the north pole aged 15, said: “It was never my intention to misrepresent any historical achievements or cause distress to local communities. “Before undertaking the expedition, I researched and verified the accuracy of my claim with Parks Canada and local outfitters in both towns who confirmed that there was no known female solo winter crossing from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung. “However, if this information is incorrect, I apologise unreservedly for making an incorrect claim and for causing offence.” She added she was “truly saddened” that coverage of her trek “may have caused concern or upset … I remain committed to learning from this experience and engaging with the community with the utmost respect.”",

    "title": "UK trade minister visits China at same time as head of British military",
    "article_text": "A trade minister has travelled toChinafor an unpublicised visit this week at the same time as the head of the British military, the Guardian has learned. Douglas Alexander, the minister for trade policy and economic security, is paying a visit to Beijing this week for talks with Chinese counterparts. He is also due to visit Hainan and Hong Kong. Alexander’s trip, which does not appear to have been publicised anywhere by the UK or Chinese governments, coincided with an unannounced visit to China by Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the head of the British military, for the first time in a decade. Alexander held talks with Chinese counterparts at a time when Beijing’s trade dispute with the US was intensifying, and while ministers have been locked in talks with British Steel’s owner, Jingye. A government source said Alexander’s trip was pre-planned and unrelated to Donald Trump’s tariffs or the negotiations over the future of British Steel, with no talks planned with Jingye. The department said Alexander was promoting British exports and was due to give a speech at a Chinese consumer expo. China’s defence ministry said Radakin had discussed strengthening military cooperation with a country that the UK officially describes as posing a “systemic challenge”. Radakin met Gen Liu Zhenli, the chief of staff of China’s central military commission, on Wednesday, the defence ministry said in a short statement published on its website. “The two sides conducted in-depth exchanges on China-UK relations and [military-to-military] relations, international and regional situations and issues of common concern, and had communication on strengthening exchanges and cooperation between the two militaries,” the ministry said. British sources said it was in the country’s interest to maintain robust military communications with China – and to engage in “firm conversations” about the importance of peace in the Indo-Pacific. Radakin posteda statement on Xsaying he and his Chinese counterpart had “held talks on a range of security issues” and “agreed that in an unstable world we must play our part as responsible nations with global interests, and we reflected on the importance of military-to-military communications”. Some British politicians critical of China expressed surprise at Radakin’s visit. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said his jaw had dropped when he learned about it. “The Labour government is kowtowing to China, but they shouldn’t make the military follow them,” he said. “The most astonishing and alarming thing is to watch China being treated as an ally and friend, a country that trashed the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong and has arrested peaceful democracy campaigners.” Alistair Carmichael, a Liberal Democrat MP, said: “On any view this has got to be worrying because we know that China is not a trusted partner commercially and if you can’t trust them commercially then how can you trust them militarily?” Frances D’Souza, a cross-bench peer and member of the all-party parliamentary group on Taiwan, said: “I have to say that it does not bode well for a robust UK policy on supporting a democratic Taiwan … This drives a hole through any possibility of having a coherent policy.” It is the first time a UK chief of defence staff has visited China since 2015, when Britain was trying to foster a “golden era” of relations. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made a state visit to the UK the same year. Relations have deteriorated since as China has aggressively asserted its control over Hong Kong, a former British colony. It has also been accused of spying on the UK and acting as a“decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraineby supplying components for munitions. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Labour has sought a rapprochement with Beijing since taking office. Two senior British ministers – the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – have visited China in an effort to maintain positive economic relations despite the security concerns, with senior Chinese government figures paying visits to London as well. Reeves said a long-term relationship with China was “squarely in our national interest” on hertrip in January. Radakin is reported to have given a speech to students at the People’s Liberation Army National Defence University, which specialises in military education.The Timesreported that he had defended the post-second world war security order and emphasised the value of alliances. Trump introducedtariffs on China totalling 145% on importsto the US this week, prompting Beijing to retaliate with an 84% levy of its own. Beijing said on Thursday that a trade war would end in failure for the US after Trump had accused China of “ripping off the USA” with cheap imported goods. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, co-hosted a meeting of defence ministers from 30 countries at Nato headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss increasing pressure on Russia over Ukraine. He told his counterparts: “We cannot jeopardise the peace by forgetting about the war. The daily reality for millions of Ukrainians continues, drone attacks, missile strikes, brutal fighting on the frontline, so we must put more pressure on President Putin to end his war and we must step up support for Ukraine.” The discussions focused on planning for a “reassurance force” that could be deployed in Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement. The prospect of a ceasefire seems distant after Russia effectively rejected a US-backed proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities. The UK is to announce today that it will provide funding for a new £450m “surge” of military support for Ukraine as John Healey, the defence secretary, and his German counterpart host a meeting of 50 nations. Britain is providing £350m for drones and military repairs, while Norway will also contribute. Addressing the group, Healey will say it is “vital to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position and pile pressure on Putin to help force him to end this terrible war”. Reeves will travel to Poland on Friday for an informal meeting of European finance ministers to discuss defence spending. A Treasury source said: “A strong economy needs a strong national defence. That is why the chancellor will be travelling to Warsaw to make the case for deeper defence financing cooperation with our European allies so together we deliver greater economic and national security in a changed world.” Russia carried out airstrikes against Kyiv earlier in the week, while Ukraine claimed to havecaptured Chinese nationalsfighting for the Russian army. China’s foreign ministry said it was verifying the situation, but rejected Kyiv’s accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting as groundless.",

    "title": "‘Grubby’ treaty principles bill voted down in New Zealand parliament",
    "article_text": "It was the bill that launched 300,000 public submissions, sparked New Zealand’s largest ever protest on Māori rights and prompted a haka in parliament that quickly went viral. And now the treaty principles bill, which sought to radically reinterpret New Zealand’s founding treaty betweenMāoritribes and the British Crown, is dead. Lawmakers voted down the controversial bill on Thursday, drawing a line under a particularly strained chapter in the country’s fight for Indigenous rights. The Treaty of Waitangiis considered New Zealand’s founding document and is instrumental in upholding Māori rights. Thetreaty principles bill– tabled by the minor libertarian Act Party – proposed abandoning a set of principles that courts and parliament have developed over decades to guide the relationship between the crown and Māori, in favour of its own. Act has argued that Māori have been afforded different political and legal rights and privileges compared with non-Māori, because of the way the treaty has been interpreted. National, the biggest party in the ruling coalition with Act and New Zealand First, promised it would support the bill through its first reading and the select committee process, but did not commit to supporting it further. Proceedings in parliament were briefly halted on Thursday afternoon, after a protester in the public gallery interrupted the speech of Act’s leader, David Seymour. After the man’s removal, Seymour said he would continue to “fight for the truth that all Kiwis are equal”. “I am proud that my party has had the bravery, the clarity and the patriotism to raise uneasy topics, and I challenge other parties to find those qualities in themselves and support this bill,” Seymour said. But Act cut a lonely figure as National and New Zealand First MPs made good on their promises to vote against the bill, alongside the opposition who stood and applauded after the vote. In the end, the vote was 11 in favour, with 112 against. Afterwards, members of the public gallery and politicians from across the political divide sang a Māori song. Prime minister Christopher Luxon was absent for the reading, leaving his justice minister Paul Goldsmith to speak on behalf of National, who said the bill was “a crude way to deal with a very sensitive topic”. But New Zealand was “not so fragile that we can’t withstand a debate about the role of the treaty”, Goldsmith said. “The critical thing is that we try our best to conduct that conversation with good grace … and I have every confidence that we can continue to find a way through.” Labour leader Chris Hipkins called it a “grubby little bill born from a grubby little deal”. “It has had a colossal impact on the fabric of our nation, and this bill will for ever be a stain on our country.” Hipkins said the bill was “based on a mythology” that Māori have special privilege. By nearly every metric, Māori fare worse that non-Māori, be it life expectancy, house ownership, health and education outcomes, or income. Hipkins criticised National and New Zealand First for failing to bin the bill earlier. “Not one National MP should walk out of this debating chamber today with their heads held high, because when it comes to this debate, they led nothing, they stopped nothing, and they stood for nothing.” Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who led the viralhaka in parliamentagainst the bill, said the bill had been “annihilated” by the hundreds of thousands of voices who opposed it. “This ignited an emotion that echoed with all walks of life, all races, all ages and all genders.” Over the past year, the billgenerated widespread criticismfrom lawyers, academics, politicians and the public who believed the new principles would weaken Māori rights, remove checks on the Crown and drive anti-Māori rhetoric. A Waitangi Tribunal report said if enacted, the bill would be “the worst, most comprehensive breach of the Treaty … in modern times”. The first reading of the bill in November, prompted Maipi-Clarke’s haka, during which she ripped up a copy of the bill. Three days later,the largest ever protest over Māori rightsdescended on parliament in opposition to the bill. Last week, a parliamentary committeerecommended the bill should not proceed, revealing 90% of a record-breaking 300,000 public submissions opposed it. The bill’s demise may end this particular debate over the treaty, but for many who opposed it such asEru Kapa-Kingi– the leader of the historic protest – the battle for Indigenous rights is far from over. Since taking office in November 2023, the coalition government’s broaderpolicy direction for Māori– including sweeping rollbacks to policies designed to improve Māori health and wellbeing, scaling back the use of Māori language in public services and defunding Māori initiatives – hasignited condemnation, protests,mass meetings of Māori leaders, and multiple claims to the Waitangi Tribunal – an institution the investigates the crown’s breaches of the treaty. Prime minister Christopher Luxon has said services should be provided on thebasis of need, not raceand the government intends to“deliver outcomes for everybody”. “There’s a whole catalogue of terrible policy and terrible law being pushed through by this government,” Kapa-Kingi said. Policies such as Act’s proposedregulatory standards billhave “fundamentally the same intentions” but were “more alarming because they are flying under the radar”, Kapa-Kingi said. The proposed bill is presented as method to improve the productivity and quality of regulation, but scholars and Māori leaders believe it will prioritise private property interests over the crown’s treaty obligations to Māori. In a statement to the Guardian, Seymour said he would be “happy to address” Kapa-Kingi’s concerns. “If he can provide a reason why he thinks that based on what the regulatory standards bill says I’d be happy to address it. Given the bill is still being drafted, and hasn’t been publicly released yet, it’s hard to know what he’s talking about.” Still, for Kapa-Kingi, the galvanising of Māori and non-Māori against the treaty bill represented hope for the future of Indigenous rights. “For the last year … the loudest voices have been those that have frankly been disparaging and racist towards [Māori] and diminishing towards our rights,” Kapa-Kingi said. “Now, we can confidently say that they’re simply a loud minority.”",

Donald Trump defended his tariff policies but warned there would be a “transition cost”.The US president said he would “love” to make a deal with China, and that he believed he and Chinese president Xi Jinping would “end up working out something that’s very good for both countries.” Former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said Trump’s tariffs are “the worst self-inflicted woundthat I have ever seen an administration impose on a well-functioning economy.” She accused the US president of having “taken a wrecking ball” to the American economy. Global stock markets rebounded after Trump’s announcement of the sudden pause,following the most volatile period in financial markets since the pandemic.Markets across Asia rose sharply earlier on Thursday, while European markets showed most indexes recording their biggest one-day gains since 2022. The market moves were further supported by concessions from the EU.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, confirmed on Thursday that the EU will put its own tariff countermeasures against the US – which were due to kick in on 15 April – on hold for 90 days.

TheDow Jones industrial averagefell 1,029.51 points, or 2.54%, to 39,578.94. On the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake”, there was a large incentive forChinato do precisely nothing asDonald Trumpdisplayed his determination to lose friends and induce market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media meme attributed to President Xi Jinping:“Do nothing. Win.” Initially it was tempting forChinato sit back and watch the US’s former allies recoil at Trump’s disruptive war on globalisation and let them realise that, by comparison, China represented an oasis of stability, modernity and predictability. China instead decided to be far from idle. It foresaw and prepped for this trade war, probably more so than for Trump’s first term, and decided that if the US president imposed on China the kind of tariffs he had suggested on the campaign trail, it would have to mount a counterattack. Read the full story:Will Trump’s tariff chaos be China’s gain in global trade wars? Keir Starmer has spoken to Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, today about US tariffs. The pair “agreed that a trade war does not benefit anyone, and that now is the time for a cool, calm and pragmatic approach,” according to a Downing Street spokesperson. Starmer and Ishiba also agreed on the “importance of like-minded partners such as the UK and Japan to work closely together to lower trade barriers.” Gold prices have jumped to a record high on Thursday, with investors turning to gold as a safe haven amid a drop in the dollar and an escalating US-China trade war. Spot gold climbed 2.6% to $3,160.82 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $3,171.49 earlier in the session. US gold futures rose 3.2% to settle at $3,177.5. Donald Trump’s climbdown on Wednesday from the most draconian aspects of his tariff regime has uncovered a damning picture of chaos at the heart of his presidency without necessarily alleviating their most painful effects. The president’s landmark “liberation day” unveiling of tariffs in the White House Rose Garden on 2 April was supposed to be symbolic gateway to his promised “golden age of American greatness”; instead, it triggered a cascade of global market crashes that prompted warnings of a recession, or even a 1930s-style depression, while Trump brushed it all off as temporary “disruption”. Time alone will tell how much damage has been inflicted on the credibility of Trump’s economic policy and indeed his entire administration by the ditching of nearly 80 years of US economic and free trading architecture, only to be followed by a sharp, if partial, U-turn. TheEuropean Unionand theUnited Arab Emirateshave agreed to launch free trade talks. The talks will focus on trade in goods, services, investment and deepening cooperation in strategic sectors including renewable energy, green hydrogen and critical raw materials, the EU said. The agreement to launch talks is aimed at deepening bilateral relations and promoting economic growth, the UAE said. The EU is the UAE’s second-largest trading partner, accounting for 8.3% of the Emirati total non-oil trade. Donald Trump’s cabinet meeting has ended after more than an hour, during which he returned to tariff negotiations repeatedly. On the subject of theEuropean Union, Trump said “every country is different” but that the EU would be treated as one bloc. “We’re looking at it as one bloc,” he said. They’ve been very tough, but they were very smart. They were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China and others, but China. And they said, you know, we’re going to hold back a little bit. US treasury secretaryScott Bessentsaid he didn’t see “anything unusual” as stocks tumbled on Thursday. Inflation numbers were good, oil down and the bond market “successful,” Bessent said. Up two, down one is not a bad ratio, or up 10, down 5, and I think as we have talked about, as we go through the queue and settle with these countries, they’re gonna bring us their best offers. A maverick economic policy announcement from a self-styled disruptor plunges the country’s currency into freefall and puts rocket boosters behind the cost of government debt, prompting warnings of an economic nuclear winter and forcing a pretty undignified U-turn. If, on top of general concern, there has been a nagging sense of deja vu in Britain over the past 24 hours, then the ill-fated 49-day reign ofLiz Trussas the UK prime minister may well be to blame. “This isDonald Trump’s Liz Truss moment,” tweetedEd Davey,the Liberal Democrat leader (alternatively known to followers of Elon Musk on X as that“snivelling cretin”). For some, Trump’s gameshow host performance in the White House Rose Garden, as he unveiled thebumper tariffson “liberation day”, had all the hallmarks of a Truss-style disaster in the making – and one on a rather grand scale. Read the full story:Trump’s ‘Liz Truss moment’: when economic bravado meets market reality Here’s morefromDonald Trumpat his cabinet meeting today, during which he warned that there will be a “transition cost” to his tariff policies. “We’ll see,” Trump replied when asked what his next steps are forChina. He added: We would love to be able to work a deal. They’ve really taken advantage of our country for a long period of time. Trump said he was “resetting the table” and that he had “great respect” for Chinese presidentXi Jinpingwho has been “friend of mine for a long period of time”. Trump added: I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries. The price of eggs continues to soar for American consumers, rising by almost 6% in March even as overall inflation fell slightly. Breaking a record high for the third consecutive month, the average cost of a dozen large eggs hit $6.23 in March – more than double the price just 12 months earlier, according to new figures released by theBureau of Labor Statisticson Thursday. This surpassed the previous record highs of $5.90 a dozen in February, and $4.95 in January. The latest figures come just days after the country’s largest egg producer reportedrecord salesand profits amid growing scrutiny over alleged price gouging. Donald Trumpdefended his tariff policies at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, while warning that there may be a “transition cost”. “We’re very, very happy with the way the country’s running. We’re trying to get the world to treat us fairly,” Trump said at the start of the meeting. We think we’re in very good shape. We think we’re doing very well. Again there will be a transition cost, transition problems, but in the end it’s going to be a beautiful thing. US stocks tumbled on Thursday, a day after surging on relief over Donald Trump’s pause on most of the new tariffs announced last week. As of around noon ET, theS&P 500index, the broad measure of the US stock market, lost 298.72 points, or 5.45%, to 5,158.18. TheDow Jones industrial averagefell 1,872.86 points, or 4.61%, to 38,735.59. The tech-focusedNasdaqindex lost 1,091.78 points, or 6.38%, to 16,033.20.

Argentina’s largest workers’ unions kicked off a massive 24-hour strike on Thursday,bringing trains, planes and ports to a halt as they protested against sweeping austerity measures from libertarian president Javier Milei’s government. Earlier we reported on CNBC saying that the overall US tariff rate on Chinese imports has risen to 145%. The Guardian understands that to be correct. The increase follows a new executive order fromDonald Trumpraising the “reciprocal” tariff to 125%, up from 84%. Former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said that the recent rise in Treasury yields likely played a role in former president Donald Trump’s decision to pause planned tariffs. In an interview with CNN International, Yellen, who is also a former Federal Reserve chair, criticized Trump’s economic approach, calling it the “worst self-inflicted wound” an administration has imposed on an otherwise well-functioning economy. Yellen also expressed concern over the direction of US economic policy under Trump, warning that such measures have increased the likelihood of a recession. The overall US tariff rate on Chinese imports has risen to 145%, a White House official has confirmed to CNBC. The increase follows a new executive order fromDonald Trumpraising tariffs to 125%, up from 84%. An additional 20% tariff, tied to measures targeting fentanyl-related imports, brings the total to its current level. The move marks another escalation in US trade policy towardChina. Argentina’s largest workers’ unions kicked off a massive 24-hour strike on Thursday, bringing trains, planes and ports to a halt as they protested against sweeping austerity measures from libertarian president Javier Milei’s government. The capital, Buenos Aires, was quiet on Thursday morning, though public buses were running as usual. Banks and schools shuttered, and public hospitals and government agencies were running on skeleton staffing, Reuters reported. On Wednesday, ahead of the strike, workers joined a weekly pensioners’ protest in front of Congress. Retirees have seen their pension funds slashed and their protests have ended in violence in recent weeks as sympathetic groups, such as soccer fans, have clashed with police. “After this strike, they have to turn off the chainsaw,” said Rodolfo Aguiar, general secretary of the ATE Nacional union, referring to Milei’s analogy for slashing public spending. “It’s over, there’s no more room for cuts,” Aguiar added.",

Adm Samuel Paparo, head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told theSenatearmed services committee that China has provided 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the legacy chips to Russia to help Moscow “rebuild its war machine”. In exchange, he said,Chinais potentially getting help in technologies to make its submarines move more quietly, along with other assistance. Senators pressed Paparo and Gen Xavier Brunson, commander of US Forces Korea, on China’s advances in the region, including threats to Taiwan. They also questioned both on the US military presence inSouth Korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts. Both said the current US forces there and across the Indo-Pacific region are critical for both diplomacy in the region and US national security, as ties betweenRussiaand China grow. The US has 28,500 military personnel in South Korea. Paparo saidNorth Koreais sending “thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of artillery shells” and thousands of short-range missiles to Russia. The expectation, he said, is that Pyongyang will receive air-defense and surface-to-air missile support. “It’s a transactional symbiosis where each state fulfills the other state’s weakness to mutual benefit of each state,” Paparo said. Brunson said North Korea has shown the ability to send munitions and troops to Russia while advancing development of its own military capabilities, including hypersonic weapons. Pyongyang, he said, “boasts a Russian-equipped, augmented, modernized military force of over 1.3 million personnel”. North Korea’s efforts to develop advanced nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles “pose a direct threat to our homeland and our allies”, Paparo added. North Korea alsohas sent thousands of soldiers to fight with the Russians against Ukraine. And the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Wednesday that Russia is actively recruiting Chinese citizens to fight alongside its forces in the Ukraine war. He said more than 150 such mercenaries are already active in the battle with Beijing’s knowledge. China has called the accusation “irresponsible”.",

    "title": "Will Trump’s tariff chaos be China’s gain in global trade wars?",
    "article_text": "On the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are making a mistake”, there was a large incentive for China to do precisely nothing asDonald Trumpdisplayed his determination to lose friends and induce market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media meme attributed to President Xi Jinping: “Do nothing. Win.” Initially it was tempting forChinato sit back and watch the US’s former allies recoil at Trump’s disruptive war on globalisation and let them realise that, by comparison, China represented an oasis of stability, modernity and predictability. China instead decided to be far from idle. It foresaw and prepped for this trade war, probably more so than for Trump’s first term, and decided that if the US president imposed on China the kind of tariffs he had suggested on the campaign trail, it would have to mount a counterattack. China insisted its wider-than-expected and swiftly executed package of reprisals, initially set at 34% butincreased to 84%in response to Trump’s tariffs, was a justifiable retaliation. Even now, with lines of communication into Washington limited, China says it had no desire for this confrontation, but wasforced to reactafter the scale of Trump’s assault. And by making an appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it seeks to project itself as a defender of rules-based trading order. Why, after all, would China favour such a trade war? Trump’s initial tariffs were predicted to cut as much as 2.4 percentage points off China’s growth. By Wednesday night, war was being waged by both sides with every weapon in the field in a crazed and self-destructive bidding war. China’s retaliatory tariffs on the US sat at 84%, with the US’s even higher at an oxygen-free 125%. At these figures there could be virtually no trade between the two world’s largest economies and a complete decoupling would begin. The WTO warmed: “This tit-for-tat approach between the world’s two largest economies, which together account for roughly 3% of global trade, carries wider implications that could severely damage the global economic outlook.” China’s diplomatic goal of portraying itself as the innocent victim has been made more complex by Trump belatedly trying to reframe the trade war by suspending tariffs on most other countries to 10% for 90 days, leaving China exposed as the US’s prime target. What began as a generalised American assault on the trading system, an assault that seemed sure to crash the US bond market, infuriating American allies inEuropeand Asia and crushing developing economies, has become a more narrowly focused attack on China. Trump’s aides tried to cover the tracks of this retreat by saying the isolation of China was the plan all along and the suspension was due to many countries wanting to negotiate new trade deals that would prove advantageous to the US. Those negotiations will, in theory, also provide a chance to press third countries from being Chinese export platforms. But Trump undercut the theory of a well-executed master plan by admitting the bond markets had become a bit “yippy”. In pulling back under pressure, he has probably alighted on a more defensible position that he could have adopted at the outset. Trump’s critics will not thank him, accusing him of recklessly endangering the world economy in pursuit of the mirage of a revival of a 19th-century US manufacturing economy. What investor is going to put serious funds into a US factory when its prospects are dependent on a president who apparently sees tariffs as a political weapon to be unloaded on social media at will? Moreover, an insurmountable tariff wall between the world’s two largest economies remains and is unsustainable. The US isdependent on Chinafor 73% of its smartphones, 78% of its laptops and 87% of its video game consoles. China, insisting it will fight to the end, will now have to judge whether it has the firepower to withstand a trade war or find a way to open talks. Since Trump’s first term, the US share of Chinese exports dropped from 19.2% to 14.7%, partly as it diversified through investments elsewhere into the “connector” economies of Asia. But the loss of 15% of China’s export market is still crippling. China has already launched a diplomatic charm offensive of sorts, with senior officials from the international department recently touring European and Asian capitals, reminding all those who will listen that China is an oasis of responsibility and a believer in genuine multilateralism. A slick Chinese ministry of foreign affairs video shows how the world faces two choices: the chaos represented by Trump, or the spirit of cooperation offered by China. Another video targets US Republicans by highlighting Ronald Reagan’s opposition to tariffs. And the description of the Chinese as peasants by the US vice-president, JD Vance, leaves even the most ardent China sceptics exasperated. For the moment, the Chinese script writes itself: China is the reliable partner, not the US, with the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, urged on his visit to Beijing last week to make common cause to stop Trump’s unilateral bullying. There is now a question whether Europe and China can set aside their differences about Chinese trade practices and overcapacity and form an alliance against American disruption. It’s early days, but China, if it gets its messaging right, could find a receptive audience. What has been described as the great reshoring of American jobs and wealth by the White House adviser Stephen Miller, also risks being the great offshoring of American power. China’s charm offensive was first on view at the Munich Security Conference in February when its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “an equal and orderly multipolar world”, while JD Vanceunleashed his volleyagainst European elites. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former Lithuanian foreign minister, recalls: “China was very active, very supportive and very understanding of European security needs. And later on, when Europe was not invited to Riyadh for the talks on Ukraine, the Chinese reaction was that it’s imperative for Europe to sit at the table. “So they are striking all the right notes, for at least the part of Europe that is really, really worried. I think they are playing the smart, subtle game, much like what Henry Kissinger played in the Soviet Union and China in the 70s. Whether they will be successful, I’m not sure.” In recent weeks, Spain and France have been beating a path towards Beijing’s door. The Spanish prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, is in Beijing on his third visit in two years, and has called for closer trade ties with China as part of an effort to diversify away from the US. He will try to seal lucrative Chinese investment in Spain’s electric car and battery industry. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, for the first time this week since starting her second term in office in December. The pair defended free trade and agreed to host an EU-China summit in July, although it was not clear whetherXi Jinpingwill attend.There are strict limits on a new European-Chinese relationship, partly due to China’s inflexibility. China’s lenience towards Russia over Ukraine is a huge political barrier. The EU has long seen China’s handling of the Ukraine issue as a test of its credentials as a world power. The EU’s former external affairs minister Josep Borrell said: “China cannot pretend to be a great power but close its eyes or cover its ears when it comes to a conflict that obviously makes it uncomfortable.” A visit to Beijing by the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, on 29 March failed to budge China from its defence of Moscow. Chinese officials say they accept the sanctity of borders and the UN charter, but in practice will do nothing to stop Russia breaching those principles.

Nor is there any sign that China is willing to relent over Europe’s other political concern,Taiwan. If anything, the chaos, including the collapse of the Taiwan stock market (Taiwan suffered its worst one-day fall this week since 1990), makes Taiwan look more vulnerable than ever. Šefčovič told EU trade ministers on Monday that there was no easy compromise between Brussels and Beijing on trade either. The risk of China, faced with huge US tariffs, flooding European markets with cheap goods is self-evident, and extra EU surveillance measures are in place. The problem is real.China’s exports to the EU exceeded imports from the bloc by more than €300bnin 2024, according to EU data, a gap that is roughly twice as large as when Trump first started imposing tariffs in 2018. In condemning the imposition of US tariffs, the commission also accepted Trump’s view that there were some countries that traded unfairly, a reference to China. Research published this week by theRhodium groupshows a clear correlation between rising Chinese imports into Europe and declining European production. The mix of China’s high overcapacity – and falling prices – on the one hand, and Europe’s rising energy costs on the other is dangerous, the report warned. Collectively, the industries experiencing rising imports from China and falling production in the EU account for 25% of Europe’s manufacturing jobs. These high tariffs, combined with weakened US consumer demand, could lead Chinese exporters to further reduce their prices, incentivise Beijing to let the renminbi depreciate and drive a shift in trade as Chinese exports are redirected toward alternative markets. Other countries are also likely to tighten their own trade barriers in response, meaning if Europe is slow to act, it risks becoming the de facto dumping ground for surplus Chinese production. In Asia, China may find it easier to locate allies. Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “The uncertain and erratic nature of US trade policy is forcing countries to consider de-risking, not from China, but from the US. In a strategic sense, China is a beneficiary of this bizarre trade policy.” Evan Feigenbaum, a former US assistant secretary of state, argues the three key pillars of US influence in Asia flowed from being a standard setter, security provider and by being an economic demand driver, but all three of these positives are eroding. He said: “A shrinking, relative demand profile, withdrawal from rule-setting pacts, zeroing out foreign aid, capricious visa policies and now a tariff wall erected against Japan, Laos,Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Republic of Korea and Cambodia all contribute. “The region is filled with pragmatists who can and do navigate all kinds of crazy stuff from outside powers, but that depends greatly on those players being either principled or strategic, and Washington is now neither.” Japanese officials spoke of trying to lobby Trump being equivalent to trying to influence an opaque dictatorship. “No matter who I talk to in the US administration, none of them knows what Trump is thinking,” a senior Japanese government official said. “We don’t even know what Trump wants to negotiate on.” China sees an opportunity. Its commerce minister, Wang Wentao, last week met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts for the first time in five years “to strengthen supply chain cooperation, engage in more dialogue on export controls and deepen collaboration in the digital and green economies”, the Xinhua news agency reported. The three east Asian countries also agreed to resume negotiations on a trilateral free trade agreement that has been on hold since 2019. Xi will visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia later this month, three countries clobbered under Trump’s original tariffs. The message from Beijing will be that China is now not just geographically at the centre of Asia, but also a reliable trading partner. But the Chinese president will have to tread a careful path. Vietnam, for example, so dependent on exporting to the US, would resent being dragooned against its national interest into what it sees as a bilateral conflict between two superpowers: China and the US. Nor does China feel ready to supplant the US. Ryan Hass, from the Brookings Institute, speaking to the Sinicapodcast, said: “Some people see this as a giant opportunity for China, to expand its footprint round the world. Maybe. “They feel this is a structural issue that is not going to resolve itself anytime soon. Their view is to make a virtue of necessity – to use the pressure that President Trump is providing to advance and accelerate their own pre-existing plans, whether it is on self-reliance, more investment, diversifying trade relationships. They are trying to use the pressure from Trump to propel their own plans forward rather than fight him on every issue on every single day.”",

    "title": "Coalition election win could cause loss of hundreds of jobs at agency scrutinising aged care mistreatment, modelling says",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of jobs could be lost at the government agency responsible for investigating allegations of serious wrongdoing and mistreatment in aged care homes if theCoalitionwins the election, the public sector union has warned. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has hired more than 500 public servants since the 2022 election to deal with a backlog of complaints from residents and to resolve a“staggering” number of real, potential or perceived conflicts of interestinvolving consultants paid millions of dollars to conduct audits in homes. Peter Dutton has vowed to reduce the size of the public service by 41,000 jobs over the next five years through “natural attrition” – which involves not renewing the contracts of non-ongoing staff – in order to generate billions of dollars in savings. “We need to make sure we have an efficient public service, which we will do,” Dutton told reporters on Thursday. So far, the opposition leader has ruled out reductions in frontline staff and critical agencies, including those that contribute to national security, but has not specified which of the 41,000 roles would not be replaced once they are vacant. The latest budget papers showed the average staffing level at the commission would increase from 1,598 to 1,918 next financial year, which the Albanese government said would help “ensure the safety and wellbeing of older Australians”. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned any hiring freeze, which may be required to ensure staff numbers fall by natural attrition, would have a significant impact on the commission, where many staff are on non-ongoing contracts. “The commission had a 2024 calendar attrition rate of 6.0%,” a CPSU spokesperson said. “Our modelling suggests that a five-year staffing freeze would result in the loss of 508 [jobs] or 26.5% of the 2025-26 workforce.” Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The commission said the figures underpinning the CPSU figures appeared to be based on government data, but did not comment on the conclusions the union reached or its headline figure. Data published by the Australian Public Service Commission in December said none of the jobs at the commission were considered service delivery roles. The commission does however have staff who respond to phone inquiries and visit facilities. Guardian Australia contacted the Coalition campaign for clarity on whether the commission would be exempt from a hiring freeze. No response was received before deadline. “This is the agency responsible for ensuring aged care is safe and accountable – slashing its staffing will leave it unable to do that critical job,” said Melissa Donnelly, the national secretary of the CPSU. “It also highlights how chaotic and poorly thought through Peter Dutton’s public service cuts are. Cuts by attrition are by nature, uncontrolled and uneven reductions in staffing that primarily impact frontline services.” Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion At a Senate estimates hearing in February, the aged care quality and safety commissioner Liz Hefren-Webb said her workforce had grown from an average staffing level of 1070 in 2022-23. Hefren-Webb said the additional staff were needed to respond to the more than 10,000 complaints its receives every year within 60 days of lodgement. “It also enables us to undertake a sufficient number of audits of residential aged-care facilities and home based services,” Hefren-Webb said. “It enables us to undertake investigations or follow up on issues that seem to be arising. It enables us to be proactive.” Last year, Guardian Australia confirmed the federal government rejected some quality and safety audits conducted by four consultancy firms as they did not meet the standard required. The firms were paid more than $40m for the work. The same firms reported 520 real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. In response, the commission established a specialist unit to improve the work of consultants and hired more public servants to slowly phase out their use. On Thursday, Coalition frontbencher and shadow minister for government efficiency, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, was asked which departments the federal government would source the 41,000 jobs from. “We are not sure as yet,” Jacinta Nampijinpa Price told the ABC. “We need to consider what happens after we have taken an audit of the situation.” Anthony Albanese said “you can’t cut 41,000 public servants without having a severe impact on what is delivered”.",

Laurent Vinatier is one of several westerners jailed by Moscow since it began its Ukraine offensive. He was sentenced in October afterbeing found guilty of violating Russia’s “foreign agent” law. Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict-mediation NGO, was arrested last summer as tensions withFranceand other western countries soared over Ukraine. According to a message from his family to AFP, Vinatier’s lawyer informed them that he was transferred from Moscow to Tula – about 120 miles (190km) south of the capital – to a transit penal colony. He is to spend 15 days of quarantine in the prison. His family do not know where he will be transferred after that. Prisoner transfers in Russia’s huge penitentiary system can take weeks. Vinatier, who speaks Russian, is a veteran researcher on Russia and post-Soviet countries. As he lost his appeal in February, he said in court that his work always tried to “present Russia’s interests in international relations”. France has demanded Vinatier’s release, condemning the sentence as “arbitrary”. President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly calling on Russia to free him.",

    "title": "Prada buys Versace in €1.25bn deal uniting Italy’s biggest fashion brands",
    "article_text": "Prada has agreed to buy theVersacefashion brand for €1.25bn ($1.38bn) from the fashion conglomerate Capri Holdings. It comes after months of speculation abouta potential dealto combine the two Italian fashion houses and, more recently, rumours that the acquisition was set to collapse aftermarket upheavalin response to President Trump’s tariff policies. Insiders say the original dealwas expected to be agreed at €1.43bn, but a discount of about €180m was achieved because the recent market turmoil and trade uncertainty has hit the retail industry particularly hard. Capri, which also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, originally boughtVersace for $2.1bn in 2018. After an$8.5bn attempt by Tapestry– the American group that owns Coach and Kate Spade – to acquire Capri was blocked last year by the US Federal Trade Commission, Capri has been under pressure to sell off Versace to reduce its debt. According to those close to the deal, Prada was one of the earliest bidders. In a statement confirming the news, Prada’s group chair and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said the group was “ready and well positioned to write a new page in Versace’s history”. Bertelli added that both companies “share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage”. While Capri failed to create an American luxury group to rival fashion companies such as LVMH and Kering, the acquisition hints at an attempt by Prada to strengthen its position as an Italian powerhouse. Versace will join the fashion brands Prada and Miu Miu, the footwear brands Church’s, Car Shoe and Luna Rossa, the America’s Cup sailing team Luna Rossa and the pastry brand Marchesi. It is not the first endeavour by Prada to add to its portfolio. In 1999, it acquired Jil Sander and Helmut Lang and, in 2000, it added Alaia to its lineup. However, by 2007, after a series of disputes and financial challenges, it had parted ways with all three brands. Now, the Versace acquisition offers them another opportunity to intensify the global reach of the Made inItalygroup. While the luxury fashion market has been facing a significant slowdown, the Prada Group has enjoyed rare success. It reported revenues of €5.4bn in 2024, 17% higher than the previous year. This increase was partly driven by Miu Miu – the brand behind those viral micro-miniskirts and satin ballet shoes – which has almost doubled its profits this year, hitting close to £1bn in sales. Sign up toFashion Statement Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved after newsletter promotion Last month,it was announcedthat Dario Vitale, a former image director at Miu Miu, would be succeeding Donatella Versace as creative director, a position Versace had held for 27 years. Instead, Versace will take up the role of chief brand ambassador, overseeing the house’s red-carpet dressing and philanthropic work. Prada and Versace are often pitted against each other as Italian fashion rivals, but their designs are diametrically opposed. Versace champions the traditional tropes of femininity with unabashed enthusiasm – see high hemlines, high heels, big hair. Miuccia Prada, who holds a doctorate in political science and, prior to joining the family business in 1970 was a Communist, is often referred to as “fashion’s intellectual”. She has previously described her work as ugly clothes in hideous fabrics.However, the two women have a perhaps unlikely friendship.Speaking to The Telegraph in 2012, Versace said: “We just talk, talk, talk. She’s so inspiring. We make fun of each other and teach each other. She says, ‘I could never make sexy clothes, but I love them.’ And I say, ‘Well, I love what you do’.”",

    "title": "Couple who ran Swedish eco-resort say 158 barrels of human waste left behind was ‘very normal’",
    "article_text": "A Danish couple who fled their “forest resort” in Sweden for Guatemala and left behind a large tax debt and158 barrels of human wastehave hit back at criticism and claimed that their handling of the compost toilets was “very normal”. Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk, both chefs, abandoned their purportedly eco-friendly retreat, Stedsans, in Halland, southern Sweden, last year. They owed large sums to Swedish and Danish tax authorities. They have since set up a business inGuatemala. The story behind their disappearance and the abandoned human waste was revealed this week after an investigation by the newspapers Politiken and Dagens Nyheter. It also found that the couple had allowed wastewater to run into the forest and alleged that animals had died as a result of being left outside and that others were abandoned. Hansen and Helbæk’s actions were described by local authorities as “environmental crime”. However, on Thursday, the couple claimed they were acting lawfully. Commenting on the barrels left behind from their compost toilets, they said in a post on social media: “For people in ruralSwedenit’s a very normal thing.” They added: “It’s also a very important part of the permaculture principles that you deal with your own shit.” The property’s new owner is aware of the barrels and they can be used for compost, they said. “Half of them are ready to use this spring, the other half is ready in 1 year, following the guidelines of Swedish law.” But Daniel Helsing, the head of building and environment at the local authority, Hylte council, said the couple did not follow the necessary requirements for composting waste. “There are a number of requirements that you have to follow and they have not,” he said. “Normal practice, if you do not have a water closet solution, is that you have a collecting service for your barrels that the local authorities in basically every county in Sweden provide. That would be the most common solution to handling toilet waste if you are not using water closets.” It is possible to compost toilet waste but it has to be done according to local authority instructions, he said. “You would have to report that you are going to compost toilet waste and that gives us as the local authority a chance to set out rules and guidelines for how to do it.” The Swedish Tourist Association said it was unfamiliar with the methods used at Stedsans. A spokesperson said: “I have never heard anything like that.” Hansen and Helbæk accused the journalists behind the investigation of lying and of causing “our life’s biggest (literal!) shitstorm”. They added: “The article claims that we have been damaging the local environment with our procedures at our permaculture resort and that we have left animals to die. All these claims and several others are false.” Accusing the local authorities of being cowards, Hansen and Helbæk said that Hylte council was aware of their toilets. They had, the couple said, shown the toilets and procedures to authority representatives “several times”. “Either the municipality lies, or they have not done the work we have paid them to do, which is to make sure that all rules are followed.” Hylte council said they had not been paid to deal with waste and that they were assessing whether it would be reported to police. Hansen and Helbæk said their company had gone bankrupt and that they had tax debt inDenmarkthat had “multiplied tenfold” because of interest and fees over a decade. To prevent the debt from growing, they said, they would have to pay Danish tax authorities – which they accused of being “cold-hearted” and “narcissistic” – more than 50,000 DKK a month (£5,800), which they suggest they are unable to. Hansen previously said they owed the Swedish tax agency “over 7m” SEK (more than £550,000). Among the reasons they fled to Guatemala, they said, was “to give our family a second chance”. Describing it as their birthright, they added: “If you see us as villains for making this choice, we are sorry.”",

Dutch defence ministerRuben Brekelmanssays today’s meeting is more “political” about various scenarios for Ukraine. He says that many countries, including the Netherlands, need to go through domestic approval procedures for any deployment, so “it is important that there is a clear picture on what such a mission would entail.” He explicitly says it would be important to have the US’s backing, but says the exact role needed would depend on the format of the mission. “So you use the word peacekeeping mission, it’s a very different definition than a assurance mission. So it really depends on the goal of the mission,” he says. “I think it’s very important to have the United States on board. But then it also needs to be clear what type of mission and what we ask from the United States. And that’s what we will discuss also today,” he says. Back in Brussels, EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallasnotes in her comments that it has been over four weeks since Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia is yet to make an equivalent commitment. “It’s clear thatUkraine wants peace, but Russia, so far, does not,” she says. On reassurance force, she says there needs to be more clarity if its role is to deter, to monitor, or to keep peace on the ground. “And that is very much related to whether we have peace or not. So far we don’t have peace,” she says. She is asked about the fact the US defence secretary is not involved in talks today and tomorrow, but sidesteps that and merely says that “it is also in the interest of the US that there is stability and peace inEurope.” “We have to map what we all can do so this is the position where we are and … trying to also keep the United States on board,” she says. Meanwhile, Polish prime ministerDonald Tuskspoke on the phone with European Commission presidentUrsula von der Leyenin the aftermath of the EU’s decision to suspend its retaliatory tariffs on the US. In a social media update he said: Defending our interests ina tough and decisive wayand at the same timeprotecting our transatlantic alliance against all oddsis our common goal. This was the conclusion of my today’s talk with @vonderleyen. Swedish defence ministerPål Jonsonalso said that there were “a number of questions that we need to get clarified” to progress talks on the deterrence force in Ukraine. “I think there [are] several things that have to sorted out before we can make any kind of commitment,” he says, but does not rule out Sweden engagement. “There is strength in numbers,” he says. Finnish defence ministerAntti Häkkänensays that allied countries see “that Russia does not have enough desire for peace,”which makes it more important to look at strengthening Ukraine’s position in talks. He says the ministers will also get military briefings on the current situation on the frontline, and have a discussion on what sorts of forces and capabilities would be most helpful as the reassurance forces. Häkkänen says that it remains important to have the US involved in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security, but does not go into details. Arriving at the meeting in Brussels,Latviandefence ministerAndris Sprūdssaid the group has a clear goal to“support Ukraine through strength”to push for a “sustainable” peace. He says the so-called “reassurance force” – a form of deployment of allied troops to Ukraine to safeguard peace in case of a peace deal – will be discussed, but added that “there are several dimensions to it,” and he “would not go … public before we make some decisions.” He said some countries had “discussions … nationally … what they can contribute.” He confirms Latvia “considers potentially contributing,” but says eastern countries need to also maintain strong forces to protect themselves from a potential Russian aggression. Ministers from more than 30 countries in the so-called“Coalition of the Willing”are now arriving for their meeting in Brussels. The summit, hosted by UK defence secretaryJohn Healeyand French defence ministerSébastienLecornu, will look at advancing their plans in support of Ukraine. I will bring you all the key lines from their meeting here. You can watch arrivals with me below, and the talks start at the top of the hour. Meanwhile,Franceis totighten its ban on the use of mobile phones in middle schools, making pupils at the ages of 11 to 15 shut away their devices in a locker or pouch at the start of the day and access them again only as they are leaving. The education minister told the senateshe wanted children to be fully separated from their phones throughout the school dayin all French middle schools from September. Élisabeth Borne said: “At a time when the use of screens is being widely questioned because of its many harmful effects, this measure is essential for our children’s wellbeing and success at school.” In 2018, Francebanned children from using mobile phones in all middle schools– known ascollèges.Phones must remain switched off in schoolbags and cannot be used anywhere in the school grounds, including at break-time. Schools have reported a positive effect, with more social interaction, more physical exercise, less bullying and better concentration. But some did report a few children would sneak into the toilets to watch videos on phones at break. Now the government says it is necessary to go further, fully separating children from their devices for the entire school day. This enforced“digital pause”– as the French government calls it – has been tested in a pilot scheme in about 100 middle schools for the past six months, with children giving up their phones on arrival – placing them a locker or box, or in a special locked pouch that can only be unlocked by an electronic system at the school gates as they go home. Full story: EU spokespersonGillgets asked to offer more detail on EU trade commissionerŠefčovič’s call with US commerce secretaryLutnickand if the EU had any advance warning of the planned US tariff pause. He says the pair spoke “two nights ago,” and it was “a kind of,a touching base call,just for both sides to provide a state of play.” He then says there was no advance warning and appears to question if even Lutnick knew it was coming: “I don’t believe that any mention of the American pause was coming in that call, but then I doubt that the interlocutor was aware that it was coming. I could be wrong about that, but that just my own reflection.” But the commission spokespersonGillis having a slightly trickier time explaining why the EU has paused its countermeasures, even though they were imposed in response to the first round of US tariffs on steel and aluminium, which actuallyremainin place, and not the ‘reciprocal’ tariffs that were paused by Trump last night. He says: The answer is quite clear. We’ve pressed the pause button to allow space for negotiations. So yes, the US, steel and aluminium tariffs are now in place, not just against us, but against the entire world. And yes, the car tariffs are in place. Butwe are not going to take any further steps right now,because we want to leave space for negotiation. We want to talk to our American counterparts. He also confirms that EU trade commissionerŠefčovičspoke with US commerce secretaryLutnick“a couple of nights ago, where they just kind of took stock of where things stood,” but adds “that was before the [pause] announcement by president Trump.” Gillalso gets asked about the technical process. He says: We have postponed what we had planned for next week. What happened yesterday was that member statesgave us a mandate to go forwardwith it. That’s not, that doesn’t mean it has automatically happened. They’ve simply given us a mandate to do it. So our intentionwas to publish the legal act that would allow the tariffs to click in next week and we have now paused that.",

    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you can read more of our Middle East coveragehere Franceplans to recognise aPalestinian statewithin months and could make the move at aUNconference inNew Yorkin June on settling theIsrael-Palestinianconflict, presidentEmmanuel Macronsaid in an interview broadcast on Wednesday. “We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months,” Macron, who this week visitedEgypt, told France 5 television, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Our aim is to chair this conference with Saudi Arabia in June, where we could finalise this movement of mutual recognition by several parties,” he added. He said: I will do it because I believe that at some point it will be right and because I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must also allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.” Such recognition would allow France “to be clear in our fight against those who deny Israel’s right to exist – which is the case with Iran – and to commit ourselves to collective security in the region,” he added. France has long championed a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, including after the 7 October 2023 attack by Palestinian militantsHamason Israel. But formal recognition byParisof a Palestinian state would mark a major policy switch and risk antagonising Israel which insists such moves by foreign states are premature. More on that story in a moment, but first here are some otherMiddle Eastrelated developments: At least 23 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in northern Gaza, as reports emerged that the Israeli military is preparing to seize the entire city of Rafah as part of a newly announced security corridor. Medics at al-Ahli hospital said that the bombing on Wednesday of a four-storey building in the Gaza City suburb of Shijaiyah had killed at least eight women and children, as rescue workers continued to search for survivors into the evening. The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant. The Palestinian Islamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from the UK government’s list of proscribed terrorist groups.Hamas is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”. Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat held talks in Washington on Wednesday, laying the groundwork for a visit by US President Donald Trump, which would be the first foreign trip of his second term.Foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met US secretary of state Marco Rubio at the state department, and the two called on the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces to resume peace talks. Suspected US airstrikes in Yemen overnight into Thursday killed at least three people, while the death toll in an earlier attack rose to 13 dead, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said.The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone. It has just gone 4pm inGaza Cityand 5pm inTel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can follow the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the latest updates from today’s live blog: France plans to recognise a Palestinian state within months and could make the move at a UN conference in New York in June on settling the Israel-Palestinian conflict, president Emmanuel Macron said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday. “We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months,” Macron, who this week visited Egypt, told France 5 television. Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar denounced Macron’s announcement that Paris could recognise a Palestinian state by June, saying it would be a “prize” for terrorism.“A unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state, by any country, in the reality that we all know, will be a prize for terror and a boost for Hamas,” Saar said on X late on Wednesday. The Palestinian Islamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from the UK government’s list of proscribed terrorist groups.Hamas is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”. Iran may suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog if external threats continue, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said on Thursday, after US president Donald Trump again warned of military force if Tehran does not agree to a nuclear deal.Iranian and American diplomats will visit Oman on Saturday to start dialogue on Tehran’s nuclear programme. At least 23 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in northern Gaza, as reports emerged that the Israeli military is preparing to seize the entire city of Rafah as part of a newly announced security corridor.

Suspected US airstrikes in Yemen overnight into Thursday killed at least three people, while the death toll in an earlier attack rose to 13 dead, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said. Turkish and Israeli officials began talks on Wednesday aimed at preventing unwanted incidents in Syria, where militaries of the two regional powers are active, Turkish ministry sources said on Thursday.The sources said the technical talks, in Azerbaijan, marked the beginning of efforts to set up a channel to avoid potential clashes or misunderstandings over military operations in the region. Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Thursday the Iran-aligned group is ready to enter talks with the Lebanese government on a national defence strategy, with the focus on ensuring the removal of Israeli troops from Lebanon’s territory. The US Senate on Wednesday confirmed Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who has said Israel enjoys a divine right to the West Bank, as ambassador to Israel.Huckabee will head to the US embassy in Jerusalem as Israel seizes large areas of Gaza, part of a renewed military campaign that has had president Donald Trump’s blessing. The Israeli air force (IAF) is to dismiss active reservists who signed a letter demanding prioritisation of hostages in Gaza over continuing the fight against Hamas, reports theTimes of Israel.According to the publication, the letter, with about 1,000 signatories, was signed by “air personnel in reserves and retirement”. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has accused Israeli soldiers of obstructing the work of its teams in Nablus in the occupied West Bank.Posting on X on Thursday, the PRCS wrote: “Occupation soldiers obstruct the work of the PRCS teams in Nablus, searching an ambulance while trying to reach one of the patients in areas that were raided by the Israeli.” British police have arrested the UK head of Greenpeace, alongside five other activists, after they poured 300 litres of blood-red dye into a pond at the US embassy on Thursday in protest against the US sale of arms toIsrael.Will McCallum, the environmental campaign group’s UK head, and the others, disguised as delivery riders on bicycles with trailers, Greenpeace said, tipped the dye into the high-security embassy’s semi-circular pond. Here are some of the latest images on the newswires today: ThePalestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS)has accusedIsraelisoldiers of obstructing the work of its teams inNablusin theoccupied West Bank. Posting on X on Thursday, the PRCS wrote: Occupation soldiers obstruct the work of the PRCS teams in Nablus, searching an ambulance while trying to reach one of the patients in areas that were raided by the Israeli.” The PRCS also posted a video in which one of its volunteers,Radi Alagbar, said, according to the English subtitles: Several evacuation cases from homes have been handled. Most of them were medical cases, along with cases of suffocation that were addressed. We also dealt with a case of assualt and two gunshot injuries to the extremeties. Just a moment ago, we were subjected to inspection. We do not proceed with any case, whether it’s a patient or not, without coordination. Through them, we will evacuate the cases.” British police have arrested the UK head of Greenpeace, alongside five other activists, after they poured 300 litres of blood-red dye into a pond at the US embassy on Thursday in protest against the US sale of arms toIsrael. Will McCallum, the environmental campaign group’s UK head, and the others, disguised as delivery riders on bicycles with trailers, Greenpeace said, tipped the dye into the high-security embassy’s semi-circular pond. McCallum and the others were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Reuters reported. The Met Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Areeba Hamid, co-executive director at Greenpeace, said that the dye was biodegradable and designed to wash away naturally. “We took this action because US weapons continue to fuel an indiscriminate war that’s seen bombs dropped on schools and hospitals, entire neighbourhoods blasted to rubble, and tens of thousands of Palestinian lives obliterated,” she said in a statement. TheUS Senateon Wednesday confirmedMike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who has saidIsraelenjoys a divine right to theWest Bank, as ambassador toIsrael. Huckabee will head to theUS embassyinJerusalemas Israel seizes large areas ofGaza, part of a renewed military campaign that has had presidentDonald Trump’s blessing, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Senate voted largely on party lines to confirm Trump’s nominee, with one Democrat,John Fetterman, supporting him. Israeli foreign ministerGideon Saarquickly spoke with Huckabee by telephone to congratulate him, calling him a “true friend of the Jewish state”, according to AFP Far-right finance ministerBezalel Smotrich, who is a West Bank settler, on X voiced hope for working with Huckabee on “advancing our shared values and common goals.” Trump told reporters after the vote that Huckabee is “going to be a great ambassador to Israel”. “He’s going to bring home the bacon,” Trump said, using a popular idiom for achieving success, before clarifying that bacon, which is not kosher in Judaism, “isn’t too big” in Israel. Huckabee, a Baptist minister who served as governor ofArkansasand ran for president in 2008, has long been an outspoken supporter of Israel, backing calls to annex the West Bank. On a 2017 visit to a settlement in the West Bank, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 war, Huckabee said there was “no such thing as an occupation.” He later said that Israel “has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” using a biblical term for the West Bank. According to AFP, when he was asked about his remarks at his confirmation hearing by Democratic senatorChris Van Hollen, Huckabee denied that he was backing the expulsion ofPalestinians. “I’ve never, never indicated that that was a part of that. I simply referenced the biblical mandate that goes all the way back to the time of Abraham, 3,500 years ago,” Huckabee said. Huckabee in his hearing repeatedly said that he would defer to Trump and not set policy based on his personal beliefs. HezbollahlawmakerHassan Fadlallahsaid on Thursday theIran-aligned group is ready to enter talks with theLebanesegovernment on a national defence strategy, with the focus on ensuring the removal of Israeli troops from Lebanon’s territory. US-backed presidentJoseph Aoun, who pledged to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms when he took office in January, is to start talks with Hezbollah about its weapons arsenal, three Lebanese political sources told Reuters. One of the world’s most heavily armed non-state groups, Hezbollah emerged severely weakened from the 2024 conflict withIsrael, which was triggered by theGazawar. The group suffered heavy losses including the killing of its top leaders and thousands of its fighters. The blow was compounded, writes Reuters, when its allyBashar al-Assadwas toppled from power inSyria, cutting the group’s supply lines from Iran. In a televised speech, Fadlallah said: We have expressed our readiness for dialogue to find a defence strategy for Lebanon.” He said any meaningful discussions should focus on confronting Israeli “aggressions” and removing Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. “We are in constant contact with president Aoun. When he calls for dialogue and sets national foundations for it, we are ready,” he added. Israel, which sent ground troops into south Lebanon during the war, has largely withdrawn, although it decided in February not to leave five hilltop positions. It said it intended eventually to hand them over to Lebanese troops once it was sure the security situation allowed. A senior Hezbollah official told Reuters on Wednesday that the group was prepared to engage in talks with Aoun about its weapons if Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon and halted its military strikes. Hezbollah’s arsenal, estimated before the latest conflict with Israel at more than 150,000 missiles and rockets according to theCIA World Factbook, has long been a contentious issue. The group argues that its weapons are necessary to deter Israeli threats. Hezbollah has consistently rejected calls from its critics in Lebanon to disarm, describing its armament as essential for the defence of the country. Fadlallah also denied reports suggesting that the group is usingBeirutport, which witnessed one of the strongest non-nuclear explosions ever in 2020, to smuggle weapons. Iranmay suspend cooperation with theUNnuclear watchdog if external threats continue, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said on Thursday, afterUSpresidentDonald Trumpagain warned of military force ifTehrandoes not agree to a nuclear deal. Iranian and American diplomats will visitOmanon Saturday to start dialogue on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with Trump saying he would have the final word on whether talks are reaching a breakdown, which would put Iran in “great danger”, reports Reuters. “Continued external threats and putting Iran under the conditions of a military attack could lead to deterrent measures like the expulsion of IAEA inspectors and ceasing cooperation with it,”Ali Shamkhani, an adviser toAyatollah Ali Khamenei, published on X, referring to theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Transferring enriched material to safe and undisclosed locations in Iran could also be on the agenda,” he wrote. While the US insists that the talks with Tehran will be direct, Iran has stressed the negotiations will be indirect with intermediation from Oman’s foreign minister. During his first 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the US from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers designed to curb Iran’s sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping US sanctions. Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal’s limits on uranium enrichment, according to the IAEA. Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme. Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes. Here are some of the latest images coming in via the newswires today: TurkishandIsraeliofficials began talks on Wednesday aimed at preventing unwanted incidents inSyria, where militaries of the two regional powers are active, Turkish ministry sources said on Thursday. According to Reuters, the sources said the technical talks, inAzerbaijan, marked the beginning of efforts to set up a channel to avoid potential clashes or misunderstandings over military operations in the region. “Efforts will continue to establish this mechanism,” one of the sources said, without providing further details on the scope or timeline of the talks. The initiative comes a week after Israel stepped up airstrikes on Syria, which it described as a warning to the newly formed government inDamascus. It has also accused Turkey of attempting to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams had inspected at least three airbases in Syria where they could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defence pact with Damascus – before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes. Turkey and Israel – which have traded diplomatic barbs since Israel’s attacks began onGazain 2023 – each said last week they did not seek confrontation in Syria, which both border. Turkish foreign ministerHakan Fidanconfirmed on Wednesday that technical talks were taking place, emphasising that such mechanisms were necessary to prevent misunderstandings between the two regional powers’ forces. The talks were similar to deconfliction mechanisms Turkey has with theUSandRussia, he said on broadcaster CNN Turk. Israeliprime minister,Benjamin Netanyahuthis week travelled to theUS– Israel’s most important political and military ally – to meetDonald Trump, who has said he wants the war to end. He has suggested expelling Gaza’s population either voluntarily or by force. WhileIsraelhas embraced Trump’s vision, the rest of theMiddle Eastand the international community have refused to entertain the idea. TheIsraeli air force (IAF)is to dismiss active reservists who signed a letter demanding prioritisation of hostages inGazaover continuing the fight againstHamas, reports theTimes of Israel. According to the publication, the letter, with about 1,000 signatories, was signed by “air personnel in reserves and retirement”. It says, that according to the military, the vast majority of those who signed the letter are retirees and not active reservists. The “dozens” of signatories who are active reservists will be dismissed from duty by IAF chiefMaj. Gen. Tomer Bar, reports the Times ofIsrael. The publication reports the military as saying it cannot accept a situation in which reservists “use the Israeli air force brand” to protest political matters, and that “it is inconceivable for someone to do a shift at [the IAF] command centre and head out afterward and express mistrust in the task”. At least 23 people have been killed in anIsraeliairstrike that hit a residential building in northernGaza, as reports emerged that the Israeli military is preparing to seize the entire city ofRafahas part of a newly announced security corridor. Medics atal-Ahli hospitalsaid that the bombing on Wednesday of a four-storey building in theGaza Citysuburb ofShijaiyahhad killed at least eight women and children, as rescue workers continued to search for survivors into the evening. The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant. According to the UN, nearly 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire withHamas, cutting off aid, food and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later. A total of 1,500 people have been killed and 3,700 injured since then, according to the local health ministry. Earlier this week, Hamas fired its strongest volley of rockets into Israel since the ceasefire collapsed, aiming 10 projectiles toward the southern city ofAshkelonthat injured 12 people. Israeli officials say the renewed military campaign is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing Israeli hostages. TheIsrael Defense Forces (IDF)has issued sweeping evacuation orders amid a vow from the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to “divide up” and seize large swathes of the territory. On Wednesday, the Israeli dailyHaaretzreported that the IDF was preparing to incorporate the entire city of Rafah and its surroundings – one-fifth of the entireGaza Strip– into the new“Morag corridor”between Rafah andKhan Younis. Such a move would cut off Gaza fromEgyptand turn the territory into an enclave completely surrounded by Israel. ThePalestinianIslamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from theUKgovernment’s list of proscribed terrorist groups. Hamas, which carried out the7 October 2023 attackson southernIsrael,in which more than 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken hostage, is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”. The assertion is contained in a witness statement byMousa Abu Marzouk, head of international relations for Hamas and the applicant for the claim to the UK home secretary,Yvette Cooper,published by Drop Site News. His statement continued: The British government’s decision to proscribe Hamas is an unjust one that is symptomatic of its unwavering support for Zionism, apartheid, occupation and ethnic cleansing in Palestine for over a century. Hamas does not and never has posed a threat to Britain, despite the latter’s ongoing complicity in the genocide of our people.” TheHome Officesaid it did not comment on proscription matters. Hamas’s military wing,Hamas IDQ, was proscribed by the UK in 2001. In 2021, its political wing which runsGaza, was also proscribed, with the UK government describing the distinction between the two wings as “artificial” and labelling Hamas “a complex but single terrorist organisation”. If an organisation is proscribed as a terrorist organisation it is a criminal offence to, among other things, belong to it, show or express support for it, and wear clothing or carry or display articles in public which would arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual is a member or supporter of it. Israel’s foreign ministerGideon SaardenouncedFrenchpresidentEmmanuel Macron’s announcement thatPariscould recognise aPalestinian stateby June (see 08.54am BST), saying it would be a “prize” for terrorism, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “A unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state, by any country, in the reality that we all know, will be a prize for terror and a boost for Hamas,” Saar said on X late on Wednesday. He added: These kind of actions will not bring peace, security and stability in our region closer – but the opposite: they only push them further away.” Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat held talks inWashingtonon Wednesday, laying the groundwork for a visit byUSpresidentDonald Trump, which would be the first foreign trip of his second term. Foreign ministerPrince Faisal bin Farhanmet US secretary of stateMarco Rubioat the state department, and the two called on the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces to resume peace talks, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The diplomats “agreed that the Sudanese armed forces and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) must return to peace talks, protect civilians, open humanitarian corridors, and return to civilian governance,” the state department statement said after the meeting. The call came after the Sudanese army said last week it had retaken full control of the capitalKhartoumafter weeks of attacks by the paramilitaries. The RSF has been battling the army since April 2023, and the war has created what theUnited Nationsdescribes as the world’s worst hunger and displacement crises. More than 12 million people have been uprooted, tens of thousands killed, and a UN-backed assessment declared famine in parts of the country. The US underJoe Bidenand the Saudis have previously sponsored several unsuccessful rounds of negotiations to end the bloody conflict. SuspectedUSairstrikes inYemenovernight into Thursday killed at least three people, while the death toll in an earlier attack rose to 13 dead, theIran-backedHouthirebels said. The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone, reports the Associated Press (AP).The 13 killed in strikes on Tuesday night aroundHodeida’sal-Hawakdistrict made it one of the deadliest single incidents in the ongoing US campaign, the rebels said. Another 15 people were injured. The Houthis described the majority of those killed as women and children, without providing a breakdown.The area is home to the city’s airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in theRed Sea.Since its start, the intense campaign of US airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping inMiddle Easternwaters – related to theIsrael-Hamaswar – has killed more than 100 people, according to casualty figures released on Wednesday by the Houthis.Footage aired by the rebels’ al-Masirah satellite news channel showed chaotic scenes of people carrying injured people to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. According to the AP, the target appeared in the footage to be a home in a residential neighbourhood, likely part of a wider campaign launched by theTrumpadministration to kill rebel leaders. Early on Thursday morning, the Houthis said airstrikes targeting theal-Sabeendistrict in the south of the rebel-held capital,Sana’a, killed at least three people. The area is home toal-Sabeen Squareand a major mosque that has been a gathering point for months for Houthi demonstrations against the war in theGaza Strip. Other strikes hit the capital as well.More airstrikes hitKamaran Islandin the Red Sea, the Houthis said.TheUS military’s Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US military operations, did not acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorisation from theWhite Houseto conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began 15 March.The US military also has not been providing any information on targets hit. TheWhite Househas said more than 200 strikes have been conducted so far, reports the AP.US defence secretaryPete Hegseth, speaking in theOval Officeon Monday during a visit byIsraeliprime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu, warned that the US was “not going to relent” in its campaign targeting the Houthis. France’s recognition ofPalestinianstatehood “would be a step in the right direction in line with safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people and the two state solution,” Palestinian minister of state for foreign affairsVarsen Aghabekian Shahintold Agence France-Presse (AFP). Nearly 150 countries recognise a Palestinian state. In May 2024,Ireland,NorwayandSpainannounced recognition, followed bySloveniain June, in moves partly fuelled by condemnation ofIsrael’s bombing ofGazathat followed the 7 October attacks. But France would be the most significantEuropeanpower to recognise a Palestinian state, a move theUShas also long resisted, reports AFP. On a visit toEgyptthis week, French presidentEmmanuel Macronheld summit talks with presidentAbdel Fattah al-SisiandJordan’sKing Abdullah IIand also made clear he was strongly opposed to any displacement or annexation inGazaand theIsraeli-occupied West Bank. US presidentDonald Trumphas suggested turningGazainto the “Riviera of the Middle East” with the Palestinians moving elsewhere – a suggestion that has sparked bitter condemnation. Macron responded that theGaza Stripwas “not a real estate project”. He said: Simplistic thinking sometimes doesn’t help. Perhaps it would be wonderful if one day it developed in an extraordinary way, but our responsibility is to save lives, restore peace, and negotiate a political framework. If all this doesn’t exist, no one will invest. Today, no one will invest a cent in Gaza.” Franceplans to recognise aPalestinian statewithin months and could make the move at aUNconference inNew Yorkin June on settling theIsrael-Palestinianconflict, presidentEmmanuel Macronsaid in an interview broadcast on Wednesday. “We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months,” Macron, who this week visitedEgypt, told France 5 television, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Our aim is to chair this conference with Saudi Arabia in June, where we could finalise this movement of mutual recognition by several parties,” he added.

More on that story in a moment, but first here are some otherMiddle Eastrelated developments: At least 23 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in northern Gaza, as reports emerged that the Israeli military is preparing to seize the entire city of Rafah as part of a newly announced security corridor. Medics at al-Ahli hospital said that the bombing on Wednesday of a four-storey building in the Gaza City suburb of Shijaiyah had killed at least eight women and children, as rescue workers continued to search for survivors into the evening. The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant. The Palestinian Islamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from the UK government’s list of proscribed terrorist groups.Hamas is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”. Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat held talks in Washington on Wednesday, laying the groundwork for a visit by US President Donald Trump, which would be the first foreign trip of his second term.Foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan met US secretary of state Marco Rubio at the state department, and the two called on the Sudanese army and paramilitary forces to resume peace talks. Suspected US airstrikes in Yemen overnight into Thursday killed at least three people, while the death toll in an earlier attack rose to 13 dead, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said.The rebels meanwhile aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.",

    "article_text": "An elderly British couple taken captive by theTalibanhave been interrogated 29 times since they were imprisoned more than two months ago, and still have “absolutely no idea” why they have been incarcerated, their daughter has said. No charges have been brought against Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, who ran school training programmes and werearrested alongside an American friend, Faye Hall, as they travelled to their homein Bamyan province, in central Afghanistan, in February. Hall was released last weekend after the Trump administration lifted bounties worth $10m (£7.8m) from the heads of senior Taliban figures, including Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister. Their daughter, Susie Romer, told Channel 5 that hearing her parents cry on the phone was “excruciating” for her, and called on the UK government to do more to secure their release. The daughter of Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple currently being held by the Taliban, has told 5 News in an exclusive interview that she urges the UK government to do more to secure their release.Susie Romer says her parents have lived in Afghanistan for over 18…pic.twitter.com/Rs3gn58rgQ Romer said that although the British government had been assisting the family, she would like the government to do more to make it clear to the Taliban that her parents “should be immediately released”, she said. “It’s been 10 weeks now, and we’ve not been reassured that this message has been conveyed, but this is really urgent. “Each day that they remain in prison, they’re at risk, so we’ll keep on asking the government to send that message.” The couple have endured 29 interrogations so far, and have now been told “there is not actually a charge against them”, she said. She described the conditions her parents were being held in as “absolutely horrific”. Mice and cockroaches are “running about” their cells and they receive just one meal a day. In recordingsshared with the Sunday Timeslast week, Peter Reynolds said: “I’ve been joined up with rapists and murderers by handcuffs and ankle cuffs, including a man who killed his wife and three children, shouting away, a demon-possessed man.” He said he was living in “a cage rather than a cell”, but described his circumstances as “VIP conditions” compared with where his wife was being held. During an interview with BBC News last week, the couple’s son, Jonathan Reynolds, said he had been “interacting” with the US government after a video plea to Donald Trump for help to have his parents released. This week, the Taliban told the Associated Press the case “will soon be resolved” and “should not be a cause for concern”. A spokesperson for theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Officesaid: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”",

    "title": "Retailers fear Trump tariffs gloom will worsen footfall on UK high streets",
    "article_text": "Shoppers stayed away from the UK high street in March, a situation retailers said could worsen if the economic gloom caused byDonald Trump’s tariff warhits consumer confidence. Footfall fell 5% in March to extend a downturn in February that retailers said could be attributed to a recent rise in inflation and pressure on pay packets since a brief revival during the January sales. Out-of-town shopping centres were the worst hit, falling by 5.8%, though traditional high streets and retail parks also suffered a loss of sales after drops in footfall of 4% and 1.2% respectively. The British Retail Consortium said that while the impact of US tariffs on imported goods was difficult to calculate, it could have a chilling effect on people’s willingness to spend, especially on expensive items. Helen Dickinson, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “Global uncertainties resulting from tariffs and a potential economic slowdown could reduce the appetite for shopping trips in the coming months.” Jobs surveys have shown levels of unemployment rising and job vacancies falling as employers shelve investment plans and become more reluctant about hiring. A survey by the accounting firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) registered a further reduction in hiring activity in March. It said recruiters “frequently mentioned that economic uncertainty, tighter recruitment budgets and reduced client activity” were slowing the level of hiring. “Permanent placements have now declined in each month for the past two-and-a-half years, with the pace of reduction broadly unchanged from February.” Jon Holt, a senior partner at KPMG, said: “At a time when global uncertainty is peaking and businesses are assessing the impact of market volatility alongside rising employment costs, the latest data demonstrates how the economic reality continues to weigh heavy on the labour market. “Recent global events have put pressure on any growth prospects in the UK, so it is unlikely that we will see an improvement in the data in the near term.” Employers also reported keeping pay rates low, and especially starting salaries, despite the need to attract skilled staff. Salary inflation was at a four-year low in February and a modest improvement in March did little to boost overall levels of pay, the REC said. Some retailers, including Tesco, have reacted by cutting prices to lure back cash-strapped shoppers. This week, the supermarket signalled it would be reducing prices of hundreds of items in competition with Asda, Aldi and Sainsbury. Asda promised in March toembark on the company’s biggest price cuts for 25 yearsto make it more competitive. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion A consumer confidence survey by Deloitte, a firm of accountants, found widespread concerns about personal finances. A majority reported a decline in their disposable incomes and almost half (47%) of consumers said they had only been spending on essentials in the last three months. The number of people saying they only spent on essential items in the first quarter rose to its highest level since the Deloitte Consumer Tracker began in 2011. A spokesperson for Deloitte said the downbeat responses were a sign of persistent inflationary pressures. This month, employers have coped with higher national insurance payments and a rise in the minimum wage while households have been hit with a range of tax and price rises, from an average council tax rise of almost 5% to water bill increases that in the Thames area and south-west Englandhave risen by more than 30%. The cost of gas and electricity wentup by 6.4% – or £111 a year– at the beginning of the month. The government needs to find ways to boost consumer confidence and ensure retailers can invest in jobs and stores. The upcoming business rates overhaul, aimed at supporting high streets, could make the situation worse for thousands of retail stores caught by the proposed new, higher threshold.",

    "article_text": "Thousands of women with advancedbreast cancerin England and Wales are to be offered a “gamechanging” twice-a-day pill on the NHS after a U-turn by the medicines watchdog. Experts hailed the decision as a “landmark moment”. As many as 3,000 women every year could benefit fromcapivasertibfor hormone receptor (HR)-positive HER2-negative breast cancer that has certain genetic mutations and has spread. The drug, also known as Truqap and made by AstraZeneca, blocks an abnormal protein molecule AKT that drives cancer cells to multiply – helping to slow or stop the spread of the disease. Claire Rowney, the chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, welcomed the green light from the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence (Nice) but said its initial rejection of the pill had led to treatment delays. She said: “This happens too often and urgent action must be taken to ensure the quick approval of breast cancer drugs so they can be made available promptly to those who need them. “NHSEnglandmust now put in place prompt genetic testing to ensure those eligible receive capivasertib without further delay. The Scottish Medicines Consortium must also consider this treatment at pace now, so that we see it made available to all who need it across the UK.” Results from trials show that capivasertib plus the hormone therapy fulvestrant increased the time before cancer got worse by about 4.2 months compared with placebo plus fulvestrant – from 3.1 months to 7.3 months. The Institute ofCancerResearch (ICR) in London welcomed the approval for a “gamechanging” drug after decades of research by its scientists. The drug is suitable for patients’ tumours with mutations or alterations in the PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN genes. These are found in about half of patients with this form of breast cancer. Prof Nicholas Turner, from the ICR and the Royal MarsdenNHSFoundation Trust, led a key trial into the drug. He said the Nice approval meant “thousands of NHS patients with advanced breast cancer with these specific biomarkers can now receive this innovative targeted treatment to keep their cancer from progressing for longer”. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Prof Paul Workman, the former chief executive of the ICR and researcher in the AKT drug discovery project, said: “I am delighted to celebrate this landmark moment and see capivasertib become available on the NHS. “It’s immensely gratifying that years of collaboration have contributed to this new cancer drug, which has the potential to improve the lives of so many NHS patients living with advanced breast cancer.” Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said the watchdog had heard about the “devastating impact that being diagnosed with advanced breast cancer has on people’s lives”. She said she was pleased AstraZeneca had worked with Nice to enable it “to recommend this promising new treatment as a good use of NHS resources and value for money for taxpayers”.",

The prince, 40, met with wounded veterans at the Superhumans Centre in Lviv, which treats and rehabilitates injured military personnel and civilians, including children, affected by the war. Harry,who served 10 years in the British army, was accompanied by a contingent from the Invictus Games Foundation, including four veterans who have been through similar rehabilitation experiences. He was given a tour of the centre, which provides prosthetics, reconstructive surgery and psychological help free of charge, and is also understood to have met with Ukraine’s minister of veterans affairs, Natalia Kalmykova. The centre sees more than 3,000 patients a year, according to its website. It is in western Ukraine, an area that has frequently been targeted by Russian missiles, and the visit was not announced until after Harry was out of the country. In February, the prince met with the Superhumans chief executive, Olga Rudneva, atthe Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style sporting competition for injured and sick military personnel and veterans, in Canada. She presented him with a bracelet from the rehabilitation centre, created for all the centre’s ambassadors, which has the words “Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire” written on it in English and Ukrainian.

    "article_text": "Police have frozen bank accounts containing more than £1m after uncovering cannabis farms and evidence of modern slavery during raids on more than 250 barbershops and other high street businesses. In a three-week crackdown on high street crime, known as Operation Machinize, the National Crime Agency (NCA) targeted “cash-intensive” businesses that it believes are linked to money laundering. The NCA, the UK agency responsible for fighting serious and organised crime, said it raided 265 premises, making 35 arrests, as well as safeguarding 97 people in relation to concerns about modern slavery. Officers seized more than £40,000 in cash, 200,000 cigarettes, 7,000 packs of tobacco, more than 8,000 illegal vapes and two vehicles. They also discovered two cannabis farms containing 150 plants. Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as investigations continue. The NCA secured freezing orders over bank accounts containing funds worth more than £1m combined. “Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country,” said Rachael Hebert, the deputy director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA. “We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes. “We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest-impact offending in the UK.” The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said the raids highlighted “the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face”. “High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.” More than £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, according to NCA estimates. The agency said the money was typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques. “Cash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash,” the NCA said. “Crime gangs … are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering. In its general election manifesto, Labour vowed to crack down on “dodgy” US candy shops, amid investigations into tax evasion and the sale of counterfeit goods. Operation Machinize involved 19 different police forces and regional organised crime units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.",

    "article_text": "Bin workers will be balloted on a new deal to end the strike inBirmingham, although Unite has attacked the government and council’s approach to the dispute as a “disgrace”. Unite, whose bin worker members in the city have been on strike since last month, criticised the government for “constant attacks and briefings against these low-paid bin workers”, which it called “frankly a disgrace”. The union revealed that workers would be balloted on Monday on a new deal, which the deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, has urged them to accept. Birmingham has seen 17,000 tonnes of rubbish piled up in the streets since the industrial actionstarted intermittently in Januaryand progressed toan all-out strike in March. The dispute is over council plans to scrap the higher-paid waste recycling and collection officer (WRCO) role from its fleets, because the council says it risks creating a “huge future equal-pay liability”. Birmingham city council in effectdeclared bankruptcy in 2023, largely due to an equal-pay bill. The union says the removal of the WRCO role means pay cuts of thousands for those affected and that it was “the first step in a broader campaign of attacks against pay and terms and conditions” for bin workers. Rayner, who is also the communities secretary, said she wanted to see “a fair resolution to this” and added: “I would urge Unite to suspend the action and accept the improved deal.” She said the council had “moved significantly to meet the demands of the workers so we can see an end to this dispute”. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion She said the backlog “must be dealt with quickly to address public health risks”. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Of course, these workers are in the driving seat around what they wish to accept. Indeed, there is another ballot happening by close of play on Monday. Unite backs these workers 100%.” She added: “Rather than vilifying their low-paid employees, the council should look seriously at the KC-approved offer that Unite has put forward, which deals with the issues and gives these workers and their families dignity and security. “A notable point was made by one of our members, which Unite believes sums up where we are with this council and could be with others: ‘The council are saying that we should share the pain but not one councillor, including the leader of the council, has been asked to give up a quarter of their pay. We thought whenLabourcame in they would stop what was happening, we were wrong.’” Graham said there was only a partial deal on pay protection for a few, which still leaves workers worrying about how they are going to pay their mortgages and rent payments in a few months’ time. “For the drivers, they are still unaware what their drop in pay will be but the council have mooted that this could also be around £8,000,” she said.",

    "article_text": "A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River inNew Yorkon Thursday, killing all six people onboard, including the pilot and a family of Spanish tourists with three children. The sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside down into the Hudson River between Manhattan and the New Jersey waterfront shortly after 3pm ET, leading to a huge response from emergency crews. Videos posted on social media showed the aircraft mostly submerged, upside down in the water, and rescue vehicles crowding on to the streets on shore as emergency workers raced to save those onboard. At the scene of the crash, the emergency response boats could be seen circling in the water. A crane could also be seen on a floating platform in the river, presumably trying to raise the sunken helicopter. Meanwhile on shore, fire and police personnel stopped the public and press from reaching the end of a long concrete pier on the river from downtown Manhattan, as scuba teams emerged from the water. The New York mayor, Eric Adams, confirmed six people had been pronounced dead, including three children and three adults. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday evening, Adams said his thoughts were with the crash victims and their families. An investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, he said. Three adults and three children were on board the Bell 206 helicopter that had left from downtown Skyport, Adams said. The victims were a pilot and a family believed to be visiting from Spain, he said. Jessica Tisch, the NYPD commissioner, said most of the passengers were already dead when they were removed from the water, but two passengers were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died soon after. Witness Bruce Wall told the Associated Press he saw the helicopter “falling apart” in midair, with the tail and propeller coming off. The propeller was still spinning without the aircraft as it fell, he said. Lesly Camacho, a hostess at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, New Jersey, told the AP she saw the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before it slammed into the water. The rescue operations took place near a site close to the Manhattan waterfront, near the end of a long maintenance pier for one of the ventilation towers for the Holland tunnel, a busy under-river road tunnel connecting the city with New Jersey. Over the years, there have been multiple crashes in the skies over Manhattan, which are routinely filled with both planes and helicopters, including private recreational aircraft and commercial and tourist flights. Prior incidents include a collision in 2009 when a tour helicopter and a small private airplane collided over the Hudson River, killing nine people. In 2018, a sightseeing helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River, killing five people. New York Citybannedopen-door helicopter flights following the crash. The spot where the helicopter crashed is less than three miles (4.8km) south of where US Airways Capt Chesley Sullenberger expertly landed the passenger plane he was piloting, on the water, with no lives lost, after the engines were put out in a bird strike after takeoff from LaGuardia airport. The rare successful emergency landing on water became known as the “miracle on the Hudson”. The crash site is close to the southern end of the island of Manhattan, within sight of the Statue of Liberty and the One World Trade skyscraper at the site of the September 11 terrorist attack. New Yorkers were jogging and walking along the sidewalk near the Hudson as normal on Thursday evening, overlooking the scene of the crash with emergency boats still visible across the water on the New Jersey side, blue lights flashing. Software engineers and friends Mike Jones, 37, and Omar Mohamed, 21, said they were out for a walk during a break and they had heard the news of the crash. “It seems that helicopters crash a lot. And I’m afraid of heights anyway so helicopters are a no-go for me,” Jones said. Mohamed said: “There was just another helicopter crash, right?” recalling the helicopter crash in Washington DC at the end of January, when a military flight collided midair with a passenger plane coming in to land.

We’re now closing this blog. You can read our full report on the tragedy on the Hudson here: A few more pictures from the crash site have dropped on the picture wires: At least 38 people have died in helicopter accidents inNew YorkCity since 1977, when an accident on a skyscraper landing pad led the city to start putting restrictions on where choppers could land. In just the past 10 years, there have been four helicopter crashes in the city, not including the tragedy on Thursday: In 2021, a helicopter sustained significant damage during a hard landing at a Manhattan helipad. The pilot and a co-pilot were not hurt. In 2019, a helicopter used for executive travel hit the roof of a Manhattan skyscraper in restricted airspace. The pilot was killed. In a second crash in 2019, a charter helicopter went into the Hudson River and sank while being maneuvered at a heliport. The pilot escaped. In 2018, five people drowned when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights crashes in the East River. The pilot survived.

All people aboard both flights were killed. Asked whether he would take a tourist helicopter flight around New York City, he said: “If I were to do something like that, I would spend a lot of time looking for credible companies that have less history of crashing.” Meanwhile, a young mother who declined to give her name was shepherding her two children on small bicycles and said “probably not” when asked whether she would take a tourist helicopter flight in the city. The New Jersey senatorCory Bookersaid he is “heartbroken” about the victims of the helicopter crash in the Hudson River. “I’m grateful for the swift action by emergency responders,” he posted on X. Booker added that his office is closely monitoring the situation and has been touch with local and federal authorities. Several people have been confirmed dead after a helicopter crashed in the Hudson River inNew YorkCity. Our video editors have put together this video report: The deputy mayor for public safety,Kaz Daughtry, said that four people were declared dead at the scene and two were taken to the hospital, believed to be in New Jersey. Police personnel fromNew Yorkrushed to the scene. “We were met by first responders” who tried to revive the victims at the shoreline, he said. “They told us they did everything they could to try to save those victims,” Daughtry said. The failure to save them had clearly been traumatic for the personnel, Daughtry said. “You could see the trauma on their faces,” he said. MayorEric Adamshad said moments before “our hearts go out to the family of those who were onboard”. Here’s what we know about the helicopter crash into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon, which left six people dead.

The helicopter was identified as a Bell 206, a model widely used in commercial and government aviation, including by sightseeing companies, TV news stations and police departments. In further detail from the authorities, the NYPD commissionerJessica Tischsaid that after the aircraft, operated by a firm calledNew YorkHelicopters, took off from the heliport at the southern end of Manhattan, it flew north up the river until it reached the George Washington Bridge. The landmark bridge, the busiest road bridge in the world, connects uptown Manhattan with New Jersey, about 10 miles (16km) upstream from the New York Harbor. Tisch said that when it reached the bridge, it turned around and began flying south again. That was when it appeared to fly out of control. She did not confirm reports of the aircraft starting to disintegrate in the air, saying that all such details are under investigation. A map showing the helicopter’s flight path before it crashed has been released by news agencies. Earlier reports said the helicopter was in the air for about 15 minutes before it plummeted into water near the Holland Tunnel. According to the flight manifest, six people were onboard the helicopter when it crashed, theNew YorkCity police commissionerJessica Tischsaid. The manifest showed one pilot, two adult passengers and three children, she said. New York police department divers pulled four people from the crash site, and New York City fire department divers recovered an additional two people, she said. Four victims were pronounced dead on scene, and two more were removed to local hospitals “where both succumbed to their injuries”, she said.",

Best stunt design will be a new category at the Academy Awards’ 100th ceremony in 2028, which will recognise films released in 2027, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said on Thursday. “Since the early days of cinema, stunt design has been an integral part of film-making,” the Academy’s CEO, Bill Kramer, and president, Janet Yang, said in a joint statement. “We are proud to honor the innovative work of these technical and creative artists, and we congratulate them for their commitment and dedication in reaching this momentous occasion.” David Leitch, who directed the 2024 film The Fall Guy, which was itself an ode to stunt performers, helped lead the charge for the new prize. Leitch began his career as a stuntman for stars such as Brad Pitt before transitioning to making stunt-heavy films like John Wick. He and stuntman turned stunt coordinator Chris O’Hara of Stunts Unlimited made presentations to the Academy advocating for the addition of a new award. “Stunts are essential to every genre of film and rooted deep in our industry’s history –from the groundbreaking work of early pioneers like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin, to the inspiring artistry of today’s stunt designers, coordinators, performers and choreographers,” Leitch said in a statement to Variety. “This has been a long journey for so many of us. Chris O’Hara and I have spent years working to bring this moment to life, standing on the shoulders of the stunt professionals who’ve fought tirelessly for recognition over the decades. We are incredibly grateful. Thank you, Academy.” Stunt performers have called for their own category for decades, but stunt coordinators – those who plan and choreograph stunts – is a relatively new profession. Chad Stahelski, who directed John Wick 4 and did stunts for Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, said there is still work to be done. “The idea of giving an Academy Award for stunt design is awesome – don’t get me wrong,” he said. “Now I would like to know who’s going to decide who gets it, and who actually gets the award? It’s not like it was 100 years ago when there was one person designing it. It’s a collaborative effort.” “Stunts is such a collaborative and complicated department. How are we going to determine who this goes to? We’ve spent 100 years getting the award; let’s just make sure it goes to the right people,” he added. Some actors have also called for their stunt doubles to be recognised at the Oscars. Last yearactor Chris Hemsworth told IGNhe was “shocked it’s even still a conversation”, calling stunt performers “the unsung heroes”.Jason Statham has called it the Oscars’ “overlooked category”, scorning “poncy actors” who were eligible for awards for “standing in front of a fucking green screen screwing his face up pretending like he’s doing the stunt … It’s a total injustice. [Stunt performers] are the ones getting busy.” Category rules around eligibility and voting for the stunt design award will be announced in 2027. The Academy’s production and technology branch has more than 100 stunt performers among its ranks. The Oscars are late to recognising excellence in stunts: the Emmys have awards for stunt coordination and stunt performance, while the Screen Actors Guild awards recognise stunt ensembles in TV and film. The Oscars also recently added a prize for achievement in casting, starting with films released in 2025. Associated Press contributed to this report This article’s headline was changed on 11 April 2025 to reflect the year the first award will be given at the Oscars, rather than the first year for eligible films.",

    "title": "Six killed after helicopter crashes in New York’s Hudson River",
    "article_text": "Six people, including three children, have been killed after a sightseeing helicopter crashed in New York City’s Hudson River, near Lower Manhattan, the city’s mayor has said. All of those onboard the tourist sightseeing trip, the pilot and a family from Spain, died, including two who were taken to a hospital and later succumbed to their injuries. “At this time, all six victims have been removed from the water. And sadly, all six victims have been pronounced deceased,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams told a briefing on Thursday. The helicopter broke apart midair and crashed upside down into the river between Manhattan and the New Jersey waterfront. It was the latest high-profile aviation disaster in the US, following other recent accidents in Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. New York Representative Grace Meng said on social media she was “devastated to learn about the deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River”. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified the helicopter as a Bell 206, a model widely used in commercial and government aviation, including by sightseeing companies, TV news stations and police departments. It was initially developed for the US army before being adapted for other uses. The National Transportation Safety Board said it would investigate. News video of the crash site showed several emergency and police boats circling a patch of river where the helicopter was submerged. The incident took place in the river off the Tribeca neighbourhood. New York police said residents should expect emergency vehicles and traffic delays in the surrounding areas. The river is a busy shipping channel and is as deep as 60 metres (200 feet) at points. Over the years, there have been multiple crashes, including a collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson River in 2009 that killed nine people and the 2018 crash of a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights that went down into the East River, killing five people. A medical transport plane killed seven people when it plummeted into a Philadelphia neighbourhood in January. That happened two days after an American Airlines jet and a military helicopter collided midair in Washington – the deadliest US air disaster in a generation.",

    "title": "Iran warns it could expel UN nuclear inspectors ahead of US talks",
    "article_text": "Iran has warned that it could expel UN nuclear watchdog inspectors from the country in response to “external threats” as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States and Iran will hold direct talks in Oman on Saturday to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme. Relations between the two nations have been tense since US President Donald Trump said in February he was re-imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign. On Wednesday, Trump said military action was “absolutely” possible against Iran if talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff end without a deal. “Israel will obviously be very much involved in that, be the leader of that [military action],” Trump added. Iran has consistently denied seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. On Thursday, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that Tehran could expel UN nuclear watchdog inspectors in response to “external threats”. “The continuation of external threats and Iran being in a state of military attack may lead to deterrent measures, including expulsion of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and cessation of cooperation,” Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani said on the social media platform X. “Transfer of enriched materials to secure locations may also be considered,” he added, referring to the country’s uranium enrichment. In Washington, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce warned Iran against making a misstep. “The threat of that kind of action, of course, is inconsistent with Iran’s claims of a peaceful nuclear programme,” she told reporters. “Also, expelling IAEA inspectors from Iran would be an escalation and a miscalculation on Iran’s part.” “Right now, this is a meeting that is arranged. It is not part of some larger scheme or framework. It is a meeting to determine whether or not the Iranians are serious,” Bruce added. The US has, this week, also announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s nuclear programme and its oil network. In 2015, Iran reached a landmark nuclear deal with major powers that gave it relief from international sanctions in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities monitored by UN inspectors. But in 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, the United States withdrew from the agreement and reinstated biting sanctions on Iran. A year later, Iran began rolling back on its commitments under the agreement and accelerated its nuclear programme. Currently, the country maintains that it is against direct negotiations with its rival, the US, but has left the door open for indirect talks. Rubio, however, voiced hope that the talks would lead to “peace”. “We hope that will lead to peace,” Rubio told a meeting of Trump’s cabinet. “We’re hopeful about that.”",

    "title": "Man Utd held by late Lyon Europa League goal; Tottenham draw, Chelsea win",
    "article_text": "Lyon scored deep into stoppage time to rescuea 2-2 home drawagainst Manchester United in a Europa League quarterfinal first leg on Thursday. United captain Bruno Fernandes had sent a precise cross for substitute Joshua Zirkzee to head what seemed to be the winner in the 88th minute. But Rayan Cherki hit back for Lyon when he pounced on a rebound. Down 1-0, Leny Yoro equalised for United in first-half stoppage time with a header after goalkeeper Lucas Perri had cleared a Fernandes free kick. Thiago Almada put the hosts ahead with a curling free kick from the left that looked like it was a cross, but no one was able to connect and the ball eluded goalkeeper Andre Onana to go in at the far post. United remains the only side unbeaten in the competition this season. Winning the Europa League, as United did in 2017, is rewarded with a spot in the Champions League, something the club is highly unlikely to achieve through its current 13th-place position in the Premier League. Tottenham, also bidding to rescue a dismal Premier League campaign, hit back to salvage a 1-1 home draw against Eintracht Frankfurt. Tottenham went 1-0 down when Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike scored following a fast counterattack in the sixth minute. The hosts then drew level with a goal from Pedro Porro in the 26th after he met a cross from James Maddison. Ulrik Saltnes struck twice as Bodo/Glimt stunned Lazio 2-0 in tough conditions just inside the Arctic Circle. Earlier, heavy snowfall in Bodo put the game in doubt between the Norwegian champion and the side that had finished top in the league phase. In a game played on an artificial pitch, Saltnes scored early in the second half with a low shot after Ole Didrik Blomberg fed him inside the area. The midfielder then added his second goal by lobbing the ball over Lazio goalkeeper Christos Mandas, with Alessio Romagnoli’s clearance coming after it crossed the line. Rangers and Athletic Bilbao shared a goalless draw in Glasgow. All the second legs are next week. Chelsea is still cruising in the Europa Conference League after keeping its perfect record with a 3-0 win at Legia Warsaw. Following a dull first half, Chelsea struck twice early in the second period and then added another goal. Tyrique George netted the first in the 49th on a rebound, his first goal for the club, while second-half substitute Noni Madueke scored with a left-foot shot eight minutes later. It could have been three, but Christopher Nkunku had his spot-kick saved. Madueke made it 3-0 from close range in the 74th.",

    "title": "Palestinian Ahmad Manasra released from Israeli prison after nine years",
    "article_text": "A Palestinian who was arrested at age 13 for allegedly taking part in a stabbing attack has been released after spending more than nine years in prison, where he developed severe mental health issues but was repeatedly denied requests for early release. Ahmad Manasra, now 23, was released on Thursday after completing his nine-and-a-half-year sentence, his lawyer Khaled Zabarqa said. Manasra, from occupied East Jerusalem, was sentenced for being present with his cousin Hassan Manasra, whostabbedtwo Israelis near the illegal settlement of Pisgat Ze’ev in East Jerusalem in 2015. Hassan, who was 15 at the time, was shot dead by an Israeli man, while Ahmad was severely beaten by a group of Israelis and run over by an Israeli driver, suffering fractures to his skull and internal bleeding. A graphic video of Ahmad lying in the street, bleeding from the head while Israelis taunted him, garnered millions of views at the time. Ahmad was charged with attempted murder even though he did not stab anyone – something that the courts had acknowledged. Authorities first moved Manasra to isolation in November 2021, following a scuffle with another detainee. In interviews the following year, his family and lawyers said he was locked in a small cell for 23 hours a day and suffered from paranoia and delusions that kept him from sleeping. His lawyer said Manasra had tried to harm himself. His family said he was transferred to the psychiatric wing of another prison every few months, where doctors gave him injections to stabilise him. In December 2021, an external doctor was allowed to visit Ahmad for the first time since his imprisonment. The doctor from Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) issued a medical report stating that Ahmad suffers from schizophrenia. He warned at the time that continued imprisonment could lead to permanent damage to his mental health. Ahmad’s release comes after numerous local and international bodies, including theEuropean UnionandtheUnited Nations, repeatedly called for his immediate release. Appeals to Israel’s Supreme Court for his early release were repeatedly denied. The courts ruled that he was ineligible, regardless of age or mental condition, because he was convicted of “terrorism”. Between Ahmad’s conviction and sentencing, Israeli law was amended to allow civilian courts to convict children as young as 12 for so-called “terrorist offences”. Zabarqa said that Israeli prison authorities freed Ahmad “away from the Nafha Prison [facility] to prevent his family from receiving him, leaving him alone in an empty area”. A passer-by found Ahmad in the Beersheba area in the southern Negev region and contacted his family, who reunited with him later, Zabarqa said. He confirmed Ahmad has been reunited with his parents. “We know in jail he’s been very ill. We’re waiting to know more about his health situation now,” Zabarqa said. Amnesty International’s regional director Heba Morayef hailed his release, saying it is a “huge relief for him and his family”. “Nothing can undo the years of injustice, abuse, trauma and ill-treatment he endured behind bars,” Morayef said in a statement on Thursday.",

    "title": "Prada acquires rival Versace for $1.4bn despite tariff uncertainty",
    "article_text": "Fashion brand Prada has agreed to buy its smaller rival Versace for $1.38bn from Capri Holdings, bringing together two of the biggest names in Italian fashion and the prospect of enhanced revenues. The deal was announced on Thursday. Prada is seeking to expand, having defied a slowdown in luxury demand, while Versace has been operating at a loss in recent quarters.Owning Versace, with its bold, baroque-style prints, will bring new customers to Prada, known for its minimalist style. “There are no overlaps in terms of creativity, in terms of customers,” said Lorenzo Bertelli, marketing director and a member of the family that controls Prada. The merger strengthens Italy’s hand in a luxury industry led by French conglomerates, the biggest beingLouis Vuitton owner LVMH. “We will provide [Versace] with a strong platform, reinforced by years of ongoing investments and rooted in longstanding relationships,” Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement. Bertelli is the husband of Prada designer Miuccia Prada, and the couple are leading shareholders in the company. Prada and Capri braved the uncertainty about US tariffs and market volatility to sign the deal, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press. Capri needed to divest Versace to focus on turning around its Michael Kors fashion brand, one of the sources said. For Prada, the bet on Versace comes at a time when it is looking to revive growth as its existing stable of brands start to mature, the source added. Both Prada and Versace, which have global supply chains and boast of a widespread customer base, were willing to “swallow a bunch of geopolitical risk” to get the deal done, the source said. The acquisition is a long-term project for Prada and is aimed mainly at expanding revenues rather than cost savings, Prada Chief Executive Andrea Guerra told analysts in a conference call. It follows the announcement on March 13 that Donatella Versace was stepping down as the chief creative officer of the brand founded by her late brother Gianni in 1978. “Gianni and I have always had a huge admiration for Miuccia, Patrizio and their family,” Donatella said. “I am ready to support this new era for the brand in any way that I can.” A discounted price On Wall Street, Capri Holdings’ shares tumbled 9 percent in New York and are down nearly 30 percent since the start of 2025, with analysts noting the deal valuation was lower than expected. The price Prada has agreed to pay for Versace, which includes debt, is a big discount to the roughly $2.15bn, including debt that US-based Capri, then known as Michael Kors, paid for Versace in 2018 when it was sold by the Versace family and Blackstone. Prada started to explore a deal for Versace last year when Capri’s sale to Tapestry, whose brands include Coach and Kate Spade, was scrapped after being challenged by antitrust regulators, a second source told The AP. The purchase price of $1.4bn for Versace barely changed since negotiations progressed seriously in January, the sources added. “This transaction reflects our commitment to increase shareholder value, strengthen our balance sheet and power the future growth of Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo,” said Capri CEO John Idol. Prada said it had committed to 1.5 billion euros ($1.68bn) of new debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year. The deal comes at a time when several acquisitions and IPOs have been scuttled in the wake of a global equity sell-off and fears of recession triggered byUS President Donald Trump’s new tariffs this month. New direction Since Prada’s acquisitions at the end of the 1990s of Helmut Lang and Jil Sander, which leading Prada shareholder Bertelli called “strategic mistakes”, the group has largely steered clear of major dealmaking. The Versace acquisition marks a major shift in the group’s strategy and comes two years after the appointment of Guerra at the helm, a role previously held by Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada. It also reflects the growing influence of Lorenzo Bertelli, their son, who is expected to become CEO in the future. Prada traces its roots back to a leather goods shop founded in Milan by Miuccia Prada’s grandfather in 1913. The Versace label, known for its Medusa head logo, was founded by Gianni Versace in Milan. Donatella became its creative force following the killing of Gianni in Miami in 1997. Listedin Hong Kong, Prada has expanded rapidly under Miuccia and Bertelli, owning other brands including the fast-growing Miu Miu and Church’s shoes.",

    "title": "US stocks down as trade war with China deepens",
    "article_text": "US stocks sunk on Thursday, giving back some of the huge gains that followed President Donald Trump’s decision to temporarily lower hissweeping tariffson dozens of countries, as investors assessed the status of his global trade war. Trump’s sudden decision on Wednesday to freeze most of his hefty new duties for 90 days brought relief to battered markets and anxious global leaders, even as he ratcheted up a trade war with China. But his whipsaw approach still has companies worried about the potential fallout and scrambling to prepare for what could happen in three months. The S&P 500 index was down 5.2 percent on Thursday afternoon, while the Nasdaq dropped 6.1 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.5 percent. Speakingat a cabinet meeting, Trump reiterated that there would continue to be “transition difficulty” in the days ahead. His sudden decision to freeze most of his hefty new duties for 90 days brought relief to battered markets and anxious global leaders, even as he ratcheted up a trade war with China. In Europe, eurozone government bond yields jumped, spreads tightened, and markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts after Trump’s latest announcement. European shares surged. The European Union said it would put plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on hold for 90 days. It had been due to launch counter-tariffs on about 21 billion euros ($23.25bn) of US imports next Tuesday in response to Trump’s 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminium. It is still assessing how to respond to US car tariffs and the broader 10 percent levies that remain in place. “We want to give negotiations a chance,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. But she warned that the counter-tariffs could be reinstated if negotiations “are not satisfactory.” Southeast Asian governments also pledged not to impose retaliatory measures in response to Trump’s tariffs. Following a video conference among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Thursday, economic ministers from the 10-country bloc said in a statement: “Open communication and collaboration will be crucial to ensuring a balanced and sustainable relationship. In that spirit, ASEAN commits to not impose any retaliatory measures in response to the US tariffs.” The Trump administration is close to reaching agreements with some countries, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters. “USTR [United States Trade Representative] has informed us that there are maybe 15 countries now that have made explicit offers that we’re studying and considering and deciding whether they’re good enough to present the president,” Hassett added, referring to the US trade representative. But no deals have yet been announced, with Trump telling reporters he cannot just make the agreements “easily”. When asked what would happen if no deal were to be reached with a country before the 90-day pause expires, Trump said he would revert to the originally announced tariff rates for each country. “Well, that’s what would happen. I mean, if we can’t make the deal that we want to make, or we have to make, or that’s good for both parties – it’s got to be good for both parties – then it would go back to where we were,” he said. However, he added he would “see what happens at that time”. Despite the US president pausing most of the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, he has ramped up the pressure on China, the world’s second-largest economy and second-biggest provider of US imports, by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to 125 percent from the 104 percent level that kicked in on Wednesday. The White House told CNBC on Thursday that the move brings the overall level of the new tariffs imposed by Trump on China to effectively 145 percent, when taking into account the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on China earlier this year, citing fentanyl concerns. China will follow through to the end if the US persists, Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yongqian said. China’s door was open to dialogue, but this must be based on mutual respect, the ministry said. With the trade war with China in full swing, at Thursday’s cabinet meeting, Trump, however, said that Washington “would love to be able to work” with Beijing again. He stressed that he has good personal ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “In a true sense, he’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time. And I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries,” Trump said. China’s yuan hit its lowest level against the dollar on Thursday since the global financial crisis. Oil prices also retreated by more than 3 percent on Thursday as fears of a deepening US-China trade war and a possible recession eclipsed earlier relief created by Trump’s pause announcement. Reporting from New York, Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey noted that Apple was among the US companies that are most exposed to a US-China trade war. “The iPhone maker, of course, produces a lot of its products in China,” she said. Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera that if tariffs are set “at 145 percent, there is no trade between the US and China.” “That is going to create serious headaches for many, including companies based in both locations,” she warned. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said it was not clear if the US-China trade war would continue to escalate. “Trump continues to say that he wants to create a favorable negotiating environment. But at what point does he stop ratcheting up from the 145-percent tariffs imposed on China? There has to be some kind of endgame to this,” he noted. “The cabinet members don’t appear to be asking those questions, publicly at least,” he said.",

    "title": "American Airlines planes bump wings at Washington airport",
    "article_text": "An American Airlines plane carrying at least three members of the United States Congress has been struck on the taxiway by the wingtip of another American Airlines jet at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says. American Airlines Flight 5490, a Bombardier CRJ 900 headed to Charleston, South Carolina, struck American Flight 4522, an Embraer E175 headed to New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport, about 12:45pm (16:45 GMT) on Thursday, the FAA said. No injuries were reported. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said on social media that he was on the flight to New York when the incident occurred while waiting to take off on the runway. The latest mishap at Reagan National will intensify scrutiny over how air traffic is handled at the airport just outside Washington, DC, which has the single busiest US runway. The FAA will investigate. American Airlines said both aircraft taxied to the terminal and were taken out of service to be inspected by maintenance teams. The damage was limited to a winglet on each aircraft. Passengers will board replacement aircraft to continue their trips, American added. While waiting to take off on the runway at DCA just now, another plane struck our wing. Thankfully, everyone is safe. Just a reminder: Recent cuts to the FAA weaken our skies and public safety. — Rep Josh Gottheimer (@RepJoshG)April 10, 2025 There were 76 passengers and four crew members on the South Carolina-bound flight and 67 passengers and four crew on the New York-bound flight. Operations at Reagan in Arlington, Virginia, have come under intense scrutiny since a fatal January 29 collision between anAmerican Airlines regional jet and US army helicopter, killing 67 people. It prompted the FAA to impose permanent restrictions on helicopter traffic near the airport. The FAA said this week that it installed a new management team to oversee air traffic control at Reagan National. Senators last month pressed the FAA for failing to act on thousands of reports of helicopters in dangerous proximity to airplanes near Reagan. Last week, the FAA said it may slow flight arrivals at Reagan after the collision. It is also increasing operational supervisor staffing from six to eight, and an FAA stress management team will visit the airport to offer confidential support for staff. On March 28, a near-miss between aDelta Air Linesplane departing Reagan National and a group of air force jets approaching Arlington National Cemetery triggered a cockpit collision warning for the Delta plane, leading to renewed safety concerns and raising questions about why controllers allowed the Delta plane to depart. Also last month, a fight occurred in the Reagan air traffic control tower, and an employee was arrested and placed on leave, the FAA said.",

    "title": "Tunisia mass trial highlights opposition crackdown, weakening of judiciary",
    "article_text": "For detractors of Tunisia’s President Kais Saied, thetrial of more than 40 opposition figuresis quite clearly a further nail in the coffin of the country’s democracy – and the rule of law. The defendants in the trial – which resumes on Friday after being adjourned the day it opened on March 4 – are some of the government’s leading critics. They include former diplomats, media personalities, and members of what was once parliament’s biggest party, the ‘Muslim Democrat’ Ennahda. And yet, they face charges such as “plotting against the state” and “belonging to a terrorist group”, accusations that were denounced on the first day of the trial as an “absurdity” by defence lawyer Abdelaziz Essid. One of those being tried – in absentia – in what has become known as the ‘conspiracy case’ is even the French intellectual, Bernard-Henri Levy, who is accused of being a conduit between defendants and foreign parties. Information on the precise details of the trial remain cloudy, with the exact number of those on trial and the specific charges they face unclear. The mass trial has been denounced both on the streets of Tunis, where hundreds of people took to the streets on Wednesday, and by observers and analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera and describe the court proceedings as another example of Saied’s deliberate silencing of dissent. Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW), have slammed the mass trial as evidence of a “weaponised” judiciary and a further crackdown on fundamental freedoms. In the build-up to the trial, the United Nations criticised the government, calling on it in a statement earlier this year to “end all forms of persecution of opponents and activists”. The Tunisian Foreign Ministry subsequently criticised what it said were “inaccuracies” in the UN statement. In February, nine of the defendants facing trial were deemed “too dangerous” to attend their trial in person. Six of them, including leading opposition figure Jaouhar Ben Mbarek and a former Ennahdha leader, Abdelhamid Jelassi, have been held since February 2023. Ben Mbarekbegan a hunger strike on March 30 to protest his exclusion from his trial. He was joined on Wednesday by five other defendants similarly excluded from their trial – the aforementioned Jelassi, politicians Issam Chebbi, Khayam Turki and Ghazi Chaouachi, and lawyer Ridha Belhaj. All of the defendants face lengthy jail sentences if found guilty, up to and including the death penalty, which has been suspended in Tunisia since 1991. “President Saied has weaponised Tunisia’s judicial system to go after political opponents and dissidents, throwing people in arbitrary detention on flimsy evidence and pursuing them with abusive prosecutions,” Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW, told Al Jazeera. Increased government control over the judiciary have many observers worried as to whether the defendants in the trial have a realistic chance of being found innocent, even if the evidence against them is weak. Doubts over the independence of Tunisia’s judiciary have grown since Saieddissolved the country’s judicial councilin 2022 and then replaced it with a body he has more control over. What internal resistance remained to Saied’s changes ended in June that year,when he dismissed 57 judges, telling a television audience he had “given opportunity after opportunity and warning after warning to the judiciary to purify itself”. “The conspiracy trial is a living example of how the office of the prosecutor and courts are used as a tool to crush dissent and to crack down on the rule of law and fundamental freedoms,” Said Benarbia of the International Commission of Jurists told Al Jazeera. “The prolonged, arbitrary pre-trial detention, the lack of credible evidence, and the order prohibiting some of the defendants from attending their own trial in person, leave no doubt as to the unfairness and the politicised nature of the conspiracy trial,” he said. Tunisia had been celebrated as one of the few successes of the 2011 “Arab Spring” revolutions, with strong political engagement among its public and civil society members, who frequently took to the airwaves and streets to make their voices heard. The years that followed the revolution, which overthrew long-time autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, saw the growth of a healthy political system with numerous elections declared free and fair by international observers. But a weak economy and the strengthening of anti-democratic forces led to a pushback, capped off by Saied’s dismissal of the government and dissolution of parliament in 2021 and 2022. He has since ruled by presidential decree and rewritten the country’s constitution, entrenching the power of the presidency. Alongside that centralisation of power has been a purge of Saied’s opponents, including politicians and prominent figures within Tunisia’s formerly booming activist groups. Among those targeted include Ennahda figures such as leader and the former speaker of parliamentRached Ghannouchi, former Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, former Minister of Justice Noureddine Bhiri, and Said Ferjani, a member of the party’s political executive. But the crackdown has also hit many non-Ennahda figures, including Abir Moussi, a former support of Ben Ali and a fierce critic of Ennahda, and Abderrazek Krimi, the project director of the Tunisian Refugee Council. Ferjani, Bhiri and Moussi are all among the defendants in the current mass trial. The suppression of Tunisia’s opposition has also accompanied other efforts denounced by rights groups. In September 2022, Saied passed a decree criminalising any “fake news” spread by electronic means, with the responsibility of deciding what was “fake” falling to the increasingly obedient court system. Under this law, more than 60 people,including journalists, lawyers, and opposition figures, have been prosecuted for public speech deemed legally false, Zied Dabber, the head of the National Union of Tunisian Journalists, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency last year, the vast majority of them for criticising Saied and his administration. “People are scared and people are tired,” the Tunisian author Hatem Nafti, who now lives in Paris, told Al Jazeera. “People know they can go to jail for nothing,” he continued. “Fear isn’t new to Tunisia. I lived the first part of my life under Ben Ali,” he said of the Tunisia’s president from 1987 until 2011. But Nafti said that under Ben Ali Tunisians knew that the red lines largely surrounded the president and the governing system, whereas now it was less clear what would make a person fall foul of the authorities. “If you criticised him [Ben Ali], you went to prison. Now, there are no rules,” Nafti said. He pointed to friends of his, such as the outspoken left-wing firebrand Hamma Hammami, who regularly criticises Saied yet remains at liberty, and others, such as the lawyer Sonia Dahmani, who faces trial today for seemingly innocuous comments made during a talk show. “There are no rules, nothing,” Nafti said of the present administration, “and I think that makes people more afraid.”",

    "title": "Tanzania opposition party leader Tundu Lissu charged with treason",
    "article_text": "A court inTanzaniahas charged opposition party leader Tundu Lissu with treason after his arrest at a public rally in which he called for electoral reforms. The charges against the chairman of the Chadema party will bring new scrutiny to President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s bid for re-election in October as critics accuse the government of cracking down on the opposition. The opposition leader was forced into a police vehicle late on Wednesday after he had finished addressing a public rally in Mbinga in southern Tanzania. “I came here, we held a peaceful meeting and now I understand the tactics of the police. We are now clear on the situation. I will not enter the vehicle. There is no need for that. We will sleep here. What is the problem?” Lissu asked the police, moments before his supporters were tear-gassed. Lissu on Thursday afternoon arrived at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in the commercial capital Dar-es-Salaam, appearing in high spirits and in the company of his lawyers and opposition party politicians. He was, however, not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge. He did plead not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information and is due back in court on April 24. Lissu’s lawyer Rugemeleza Nshala said the charges against his client were politically driven. “You cannot separate these charges from politics,” Nshala told the Reuters news agency. “He was doing campaigns to educate Chadema supporters, but they have turned it into charges.” According to the charge sheet, Lissu, who survived being shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, made the comments in question in Dar-es-Salaam on April 3. The charge sheet quoted him as saying: “It is true we say we will prevent the election. We will inspire rebellion. That is the way to get change.” “So we are going to spoil this election. We are going to really disrupt. … We are going to spoil it very badly,” the charge sheet accused him of saying. Hassan won plaudits after coming to power in 2021 for easing repression of political opponents and censorship of the media that proliferated under her predecessor John Magufuli, who died in office. But she has faced mounting criticism from human rights activists over a series of arrests and unexplained abductions and killings of political opponents. Hassan has said the government is committed to respecting human rights, and she ordered an investigation into reported abductions last year.",

    "title": "Turkiye and Israel hold talks to avoid clashes in Syria",
    "article_text": "Turkish and Israeli officials have begun talks aimed at easing tensions in Syria, where the militaries of both countries are active, officials from both sides say. Israel has launchedhundreds of air strikesin Syria anddeployed troopsto a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights since opposition fighters removed President Bashar al-Assad in December. Turkiye is a key backer of the interim government in Syria, where its support includes operations against the ISIL (ISIS) armed group. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed on Wednesday that technical talks with Israel were under way, emphasising that deconfliction mechanisms were necessary to prevent misunderstandings between the two regional powers’ forces. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Thursday that the two sides “agreed to continue the dialogue in order to preserve regional stability”. The talks come as the two sides pursue competing interests in Syria. Turkish sources quoted by the news agency Reuters said the talks in Azerbaijan on Wednesday marked the beginning of efforts to set up a communications channel to avoid potential clashes or misunderstandings over military operations in the region. “Efforts will continue to establish this mechanism,” one of the Turkish sources said, without providing details on the scope or timeline of the talks. A Turkish Ministry of National Defence official quoted by The Associated Press news agency said assessments for the establishment of a base for joint Turkish-Syrian training are ongoing, adding that such activities followed international law “without targeting third countries”. Israel has expressed concerns that Syria’s new leadership will pose a threat along its border while Israel also reportedly wants to thwart Turkish influence in Syria. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Turkish bases in Syria would be a “danger to Israel”. An Israeli political source quoted by Reuters said that during the talks “Israel made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria – and in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra area – is a red line and will be considered a breaking of the rules.” According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a United Kingdom-based war monitor, Israel’s military carried out more than 500 air attacks on targets in Syria from December 8 to December 31 and has carried out at least 43 attacks so far this year. Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Israel of waging a campaign against “the stability of the country”. Ties between Israel and Turkiye have deteriorated over Israel’s assault on Gaza. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been an outspoken critic of Israel’s war, which has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians.",

    "title": "Manchester United: Cantona claims Ratcliffe is destroying club",
    "article_text": "Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona has accused co-owner Jim Ratcliffe and his lieutenants of destroying the Old Trafford club. British billionaire Ratcliffe has endured a turbulent spell since taking charge of United’s football operations afterbuying a minority share in February 2024. The INEOS owner has sacked boss Erik ten Hag and replaced him with Ruben Amorim, with little improvement as the team languishes in 13th place in the Premier League. Ratcliffe, a boyhood United fan, has also raised ticket prices and undertook drastic cost-cutting measures, resulting in about 450 lost jobs, while launching a plan to build a new 100,000-capacity stadium. A United legend after helping the club end their long wait to win the English title in 1993, Cantona is not impressed with Ratcliffe’s impact on his former team. “Since Ratcliffe arrived, this team of directors try to destroy everything and they don’t respect anybody,” Cantona told reporters during an event at FC United, the non-league team started by fans in 2005 as a response to the controversial takeover by the Glazer family, who remain the majority shareholders. “They even want to change the stadium. The soul of the team and the club is not in the players. All the people around is like a big family. It’s very important to respect these people like you respect your manager and teammates. “Since Ratcliffe arrived, it’s the complete opposite. He doesn’t want Sir Alex Ferguson as an ambassador any more. He is more than a legend and I think we have to find this soul again.” Former France striker Cantona, who has signed up to become an FC United co-owner, spent five years at United after Alex Ferguson signed him from Leeds, winning four Premier League titles and two FA Cups. The 58-year-old believes leaving Old Trafford would be a big mistake, because the soul of the club is tied to the stadium that has been its home since 1910. “This team of directors, they try to destroy everything. They don’t respect anybody. They even want to change the stadium. The stadium is iconic,” he said. “For me, Arsenal lost their soul when they left Highbury, and I’m sure a lot of fans miss Highbury. I don’t think United can play in another stadium than Old Trafford.” Cantona, who now works as an actor, revealed he offered to help Ratcliffe rebuild a club that has not won the Premier League since Alex Ferguson’s final season in charge in 2013. “Until the end of October this year, I will shoot movies,” he said. “But I said to them, ‘I can put that aside and concentrate and help you to rebuild something’. And they don’t care. “I feel sad to see United in this kind of situation. They decided something else. They have another strategy, another project. “I support United because I really love United, but now, if I was a fan and I had to choose a club, I don’t think I would choose United. Because I don’t feel close to these kind of decisions. “I think maybe we are dreamers and the owners are more like an economy and a strategy. I hate this kind of thing. I hate this kind of decision.”",

    "title": "‘Make showers great again’: Why Trump’s fighting bathroom water pressure",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday repealing limits to the flow of water from bathroom showers imposed by previous Democratic Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Biden and Obama introduced these limits to increase efficiency and conserve water. Where their focus was on the environment, Trump’s order aims to “make America’s showers great again,” a White House fact sheet says. Showerheads, it added, will no longer be “weak and worthless”. Trump’s order to free the showerhead from regulations would, he said, help him wash his “beautiful hair”. It came at a time when his back-and-forth tariff policies had washed away billions of dollars from the stock markets, which plunged following his declaration of a trade war on the rest of the world, only to gain back some of its lost territory after Trump’ssudden reprieveon tariffs for most countries. Here is more about Trump’s latest order: Trump’s order calls on Energy Secretary Chris Wright to reverse the definitions of what constitutes a showerhead usable in the United States, as implemented by Obama and Biden. “The Biden definition was a staggering 13,000 words. The Oxford English Dictionary, by contrast, defines “showerhead” in one short sentence,” the White House fact sheet says. Trump wants to go back to a 1992 federal energy law, which sets the standard of water pressure for showers to 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) per minute. Over the years, new showerhead designs began to include multiple nozzles or spray systems. To ensure water conservation, the Obama administration clarified the rule in 2013 to say that even if a showerhead has multiple nozzles, they collectively should not release more than 2.5 gallons a minute. Trump’s order, in effect, would allow each nozzle to eject up to 2.5 gallons of water a minute. So if a showerhead has four nozzles, it could release up to 10 gallons a minute. “These changes served a radical green agenda that made life worse for everyday Americans,” the White House factsheet says about the Obama-era rule. “Overregulation chokes the American economy, entrenches bureaucrats, and stifles personal freedom.” “In my case, I like to take a nice shower, take care of my beautiful hair,” Trump said while signing the order in the Oval Office. “I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.” During his first administration, Trump reversed the Obama-era rule to allow multiple nozzles on one showerhead to each spray out 2.5 gallons of water per minute individually, increasing the permitted amount of water released by a singular showerhead. This was finalised in December 2020. “So, showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,” Trump said on the campaign trail in 2019. He has complained about low water pressure multiple times since. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed Trump’s relaxation of water flow rules. Biden went back to Obama’s 2013 rule to permit an overall 2.5 gallons of water per minute for a showerhead, regardless of the number of nozzles on it. “Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued,” says the White House factsheet. The average family spends $1,000 every year on water costs, according to a factsheet by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), last updated on March 24. The EPA estimated that households could save more than $380 annually if they retrofitted their homes with WaterSense-labelled fixtures and energy-efficient appliances. A showerhead qualifies for the WaterSense label if it releases no more than two gallons (7.6 liters) per minute. A US government-backedreport, published in 2019, issued a warning that climate change and population growth increase the risk of water shortages in many regions of the US.",

    "title": "Trump-China tariff war: What could the US gain and lose?",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’sabrupt decisionto implement a 90-day pause on the tariffs he imposed on dozens of countries has sent battered stock markets surging, even as he ratcheted up his trade war with China. Trump’s turnaround on Wednesday, which came just 13 hours after theduties had gone into effect, followed the most intense episode of financial market volatility since the COVID-19 pandemic. Stocks soared following Trump’s announcement of a pause on some tariffs. The S&P 500 jumped 9.5 percent on Wednesday, the index’s biggest single-day leap since 2008. Oil prices, which slid in recent days on fears of a global recession, also rallied on the news. Still, not all of Trump’s tariffs have been lifted. A 10 percent levy on most countries remains in place. Meanwhile, the United Statesescalated its trade war with China, raising tariffs to a whopping 125 percent – deepening an economic crisis between the world’s two largest economies. On Wednesday, Trump announced a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs for almost 60 countries and the European Union. The tariffs were customised for each country and corresponded to the size of their trade surplus with the US. Imports from those countries will now be subject to a flat tax of 10 percent, which Trump introduced on April 5. China was not included in the pause. Instead, Trump announced that he would raise levies on Chinese goods to 125 percent, from 104 percent. Trump’s decision came after Beijing announced plans to retaliate with an84 percent dutyon American goods on Wednesday. World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has said the tensions “pose a significant risk of a sharp contraction in bilateral trade” between the US and China. “Our preliminary projections suggest that merchandise trade between these two economies could decrease by as much as 80 percent,” she said in astatementon April 9. At a White House event celebrating Joey Logano, the NASCAR Cup Series Champion, Trump claimed his method for assigning and adjusting tariffs was based on “more of an instinct than anything else”. “You have to be flexible,” he said. Trump acknowledged that some investors had been “queasy” about the economic turbulence prompted by his tariffs. “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know.” But he emphasised a positive outlook towards the financial markets. “They [stock prices] change.” He said that markets had rallied to “the biggest day in financial history” after his latest tariff adjustment. “That’s a pretty big change.” He added that countries were now lining up to do business with his administration. “We have many other countries, as you know – many more than 75 – and they all want to come.” He also predicted the US would reap dividends before the end of the year. “I did a 90-day pause for the people who didn’t retaliate because I told them, ‘If you retaliate, we’re going to double it.’ And that’s what I did with China, because they did retaliate.” He re-emphasised that his punitive tariff campaign against China would push Beijing to the bargaining table. “A deal could be made with every one of them. A deal’s going to be made with China. A deal’s going to be made with every one of them. And they’ll be fair deals. I just want fair,” Trump said. “They weren’t fair to the United States. They were sucking us dry. And you can’t do that.” Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trade partners. According todatafrom the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the total goods trade between the US and China stood at an estimated $582.4bn in 2024. US goods exports to China totalled $143.5bn. On the other hand, US goods imports from China totalled $438.9bn. The upshot is that America’s trade deficit with China was $295.4bn last year, marking a 5.8 percent rise ($16.3bn) over 2023. China is the US’s third-largest trade partner, after Mexico and Canada. But the US has been slowly weaning itself off Chinese imports. Chinese goods accounted for 13.3 percent of US imports in 2024, down from a peak of 21.6 percent in 2017. Still, from washing machines and TV sets to clothing, China is one of the top suppliers of goods to the US. The US Department of Commerce calculated that mechanical appliances (mainly low to mid-range technology products) made up 46.4 percent of all US imports from China in 2022. On the flipside,$24.7bnof agricultural products were exported from the US to China in 2024 – mainly in the form ofsoya beans. China is also a large importer of US farming equipment, computer chips and fossil fuels. Trump has long maintained that tariffs can reduce America’s trade deficits and bring foreign manufacturing back to the US. He has also said they will pave the way for future tax cuts. In 1979, nearly20 millionAmericans made their living from manufacturing. Today, it’s closer to 12.5 million. In the years following World War II, the US was a leading producer of motor vehicles, aircraft and steel. “Since then,” says Vincent Vicard, head of international trade at the economic think tank CEPII, “foreign competition and productivity gains have shrunk the US relative share of manufacturing jobs”. “And while it’s hard to say exactly what Trump wants,” Vicard told Al Jazeera, “part of the tariff plan is about raising revenue for income tax cuts and boosting industry.” He pointed out that “some industries, like cars and steel, could benefit from lower foreign competition. However, they will also face higher prices for intermediate goods [used in their own manufacturing processes].” Vicard said there may be “investment in several industries over the longer term… beyond five years. But the impact of tariffs on consumers in the near term will be higher prices.” While Trump is hoping that his tariff regime will erode China’s trade surplus, Beijing benefits from entrenched competitive advantages. According to Brian Coulton, a chief economist at Fitch Ratings agency, China’s industrial dominance won’t be easy to dislodge. “In recent decades, China has built up an amazing logistics and infrastructure network [around its key manufacturing sectors],” he said. “They’re amazingly productive.” He also pointed out that the “wage cost per manufacturing hour in the US is around $30, whereas in China it’s around $12”. Labour costs, in other words, are much lower. Coulton told Al Jazeera that US “electronics and digital” firms are particularly exposed to Trump’s latest round of China tariffs. “Apple, for instance, is at high risk.” He said “these are industries which import intermediate goods from China. So, the question is, whether they’ll absorb higher costs via lower profit margins or pass them on to consumers.” For Coulton, it is likely to be a combination of both. “That means a squeeze on business activity and higher household costs.” He expects US inflation will climb to above 4 percent this year, from 2.8 currently, and for gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow. During Trump’sfirst trade war with Chinain 2018, the US-China Business Councilestimatedthat 245,000 US jobs were lost. As the scope of tariffs is greater today, it’s fair to assume that even more jobs will be shed. “Trump’s tariffs are dramatic … they’ll be a shock to the US economy,” said Coulton.",

    "title": "Unpacking Israel’s war on international humanitarian law",
    "article_text": "On March 24, Israel struck a car in northern Gaza and killed Al Jazeera correspondent Hossam Shabat. The 23-year-old is one of countless civilians – men, women and children – Israel has killed since launching what legal scholars describe as a “genocidal” war on Gaza. Israel often justifies its killings by claiming that the targets are people sympathetic or affiliated with Hamas or other armed factions. This was the justification given for killing Shabat. Israel also regularly destroys entire neighbourhoods and buildings, killing dozens – often hundreds – at a time, ostensibly to target a single Hamas operative. For years, Israel has tried to justify these practices by employing lawyers to create shadowy quasi-legal concepts in the hope of establishing new, dangerous precedents, according to legal scholars and experts. However, legal scholars told Al Jazeera that neither so-called “targeted killings” nor disproportionate attacks against civilians have any grounding in international law. “Is there any semblance of law or legal justification for the war tactics Israel is using in Gaza? The simple answer is no. There isn’t,” said Heidi Matthews, assistant professor of law at York University in Toronto, Canada. On September 28, 2000, Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and Gaza began demonstrating against Israel’s ever-entrenching occupation in what became known as the second Intifada. Israel’s repression of the Intifada quickly prompted Palestinians to mobilise and fight back. Over the next five years, Israel launched what it named “targeted killings”, assassinating unarmed Palestinians. Israel claimed that these targets could pose a threat to Israelis in the future because of their alleged membership in an armed faction. “Israel … strips protection from civilians based on their views or perspectives,” said Noor Kilzi, a researcher with Legal Agenda, a nonprofit in Lebanon that advocates for legal reform and human rights in the Middle East. Israel’s concept of targeted killings laid out a blueprint which the United States adapted during its “war on terror”, analysts told Al Jazeera. “[In the early 2000s] Israel and the US changed their legal doctrines and implemented that as part of their military dogma,” York University’s Matthews told Al Jazeera. “When it came to distinguishing between civilians and combatants… the US and Israel began to view [anyone as a target] based on their membership to a group,” she added. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a person is only a legitimate target if they are directly engaged in armed combat at the time they are killed. This means that suspected membership in an armed group is not a sufficient basis to assassinate someone. Throughout Israel’s war on Gaza,it has routinely dropped 2,000lb (900kg) bombsin densely populated residential areas, as well as systematically targeted schools, hospitals and displacement shelters. Israeli officials justify these attacks by claiming that Israel is fighting a “just war” against barbarians. As a result, the ostensible goal of destroying Hamas outweighs minimising civilian casualties. This is rooted partly in the philosophy of Francis Leiber, a 19th-century German American military theorist, who was tasked with setting out the “rules of conduct” for Unionist soldiers fighting the Confederates in the US Civil War. He argued that some wars are vital to the moral progress of civilised nations and require a quick victory, which can only be achieved using tactics that will likely cause huge civilian casualties. “Leiber basically said that whatever is militarily necessary to carry out war is legal,” Alonso Gurmendi Dunkelberg, a legal scholar at the London School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. This terrifying reasoning is blatantly at odds with international norms and laws, Gurmendi Dunkelberg added. “He believed in killing as many people as you can, so that you finish the job quickly. He believed that was more humane than trying to protect people to the point that the war drags on for say 15 years,” he said. Since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza, its spokespeople have made similar arguments. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the goal was to “get the [war] done quicker” when asked by PBS about why Israel had dropped 6,000 bombs in the first six days of attacks on the besieged enclave. Then spokesperson for the Israeli army, Daniel Hagari, also admitted during the first days of the war that the emphasis in Gaza was on “damage and not accuracy”. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) approved two arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his then-Defence Minister Yoav Gallant – accused of using starvation as a weapon of war and deliberately attacking civilians in Gaza. An earlier ruling by the International Court of Justice found that Palestinians in Gaza faced a real risk of genocide due to Israel’s war practices. The rulings by the ICC and ICJ add weight to the argument that Israel has failed in trying to legally justify its war practices, which likely amount to multiple war crimes, crimes against humanity and even genocide. As a result, Israel and its western allies are nowtrying to sabotagethe very institutions that were created to uphold international law and prosecute perpetrators of atrocities, said Nadim Khoury, former director at Human Rights Watch and the founder of the Arab Reform Initiative think tank. “Israel has clearly hit the limit of what they can get away with by using legal arguments. Now, they’re just acting with total impunity to undermine the institutions trying to enforce international laws,” he told Al Jazeera. Several legal scholars and experts expressed dismay that Netanyahu may be able to visit countries in Europe that are parties to the Rome Statute, the legal framework underpinning the ICC. Countries such as Hungary, Belgium and France have said they will not arrest Netanyahu if he visits their countries or passes through their land or airspace. York University’s Matthews believes states that claim to uphold international law must act quickly to salvage what’s left of the system, acknowledging that it was never a perfect model. “Other states – beyond America and Israel – need to take action to save or salvage the system as a whole, or it will fade away quickly,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are at an inflection point and it doesn’t look good.”",

    "title": "Who is Pierre Poilievre, Canada’s Conservative leader?",
    "article_text": "Ottawa, Canada –For months, Pierre Poilievre had been riding high. He had successfully tapped into public anxiety over an affordability crisis in Canada, his attacks against Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauhad found a receptive audience, and his Conservative Party enjoyed a huge lead in the polls. But then Trudeau announced he was stepping down. The governing Liberal Party named a new leader. And Canadian politics shifted course, faced with threats of tariffs and annexation from United States President Donald Trump. And just like that, Poilievre and the Tories saw their lead evaporate. “The campaign that Poilievre thought he was going to run [has disappeared] out from under him,” said Lisa Young, a political science professor at the University of Calgary. With Canadians heading into April 28 elections, experts said Poilievre now faces a tight race when once he was the frontrunner. Surveys suggest Canadians are questioning whether the Conservative Party leader has what it takes to confront the US president. In mid-January, the Conservatives had a lead of as many as26 percentage points, but polling now showsthe Liberalscould secure a majority government in the upcoming elections. Yet Poilievre’s message continues to resonate in parts of the country. He enjoys a strong base of supporters, and the longtime Parliament member has been hailed by Conservative insiders as a savvy politician who should not be counted out. “Pierre is the real deal,” said Nathan Bergstrand, a business manager at United Association Local 67, a union representing plumbers, steamfitters and welders. “He’s been one of the loudest and strongest voices in the past several years fighting out-of-control deficit spending and tax increases,” Bergstrand told a Poilievre rally in Hamilton, Ontario, in March. “Remember that spending is easy. Being responsible is not. He’s ready to put the hard work in that’s necessary.” So just who is Pierre Poilievre, what does he stand for, and can he become Canada’s next prime minister? The Hamilton rally, which took place just days into the election campaign, in many ways demonstrated the political persona Poilievre has cultivated in recent years. Thousands of people lined up to hear the Conservative leader speak in the working-class city west of Toronto, which has typically been a bastion of support for the left-leaning New Democrats. “We are going to stand up for who we are and what we believe, and we’re going to put our own people first,” Poilievre told the crowd of supporters who chanted, “We want Pierre!” before he took the stage. Describing Canada as a “nation bound together by the Canadian promise that anyone from anywhere can achieve anything”, he promised to restore a sense of national pride after a “lost decade” of Liberal governance. “If you are that young couple desperate to buy a home and start a family before the biological clock runs out in your mid-30s, I’m here to say that change is on the way,” Poilievre said to applause. “If you are an elderly couple choosing between eating and heating and wondering what happened to the beautiful country that you knew and still love, I’m here to say that both hope and change are on the way.” That message is one that Poilievre has tied to his own origin story, growing up in the city of Calgary in the western province of Alberta. Thrilled to receive the endorsement of Nathan Bergstrand, UA Local 67's Business Manager, a great champion for his workers. His members are the extraordinary Canadians who build our country. Together we will make sure they, and all the workers across this country, have a Prime…pic.twitter.com/41YaMICWhC — Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre)March 26, 2025 Born to a teenage mother and adopted by two schoolteachers, Poilievre has publicly referred to his family as “a complicated and mixed-up bunch”, using his upbringing as a metaphor for Canada itself. He would later credit his adopted parents with instilling in him an entrepreneurial spirit. “They taught me that it didn’t matter where I came from but where I was going,” Poilievre said. “It didn’t matter who I knew but what I could do.” He eventually attended the University of Calgary, where he quickly got involved in conservative politics. At age 20, he won an essay contest for writing about how, if ever elected prime minister, he would put “freedom” at the heart of his government. “I would relinquish to citizens as much of my social, political, and economic control as possible, leaving people to cultivate their own personal prosperity and to govern their own affairs as directly as possible,”he wrote. After university, Poilievre worked for Stockwell Day, an Alberta politician who led the Canadian Alliance, a party that in the early 2000s merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative Party of Canada. Poilievre was 25 when he won his first federal race in 2004 in an electoral district, known in Canada as a riding, in the capital, Ottawa. He has represented the area ever since, including through the nearly 10-year tenure of Conservative Prime MinisterStephen Harper. He held several roles under Harper, including as the prime minister’s parliamentary secretary and later as minister of state for democratic reform. But Poilievre became known as an “attack dog” who used partisan rhetoric in defence of Harper and the Conservative government’s policies. In 2013, the left-leaning New Democratic Party said Poilievre’s rise demonstrated that, “to become a minister for Stephen Harper, you must leave the truth behind and embrace mean-spirited attacks”. Despite the criticism, Poilievre maintained his aggressive political style whenthe Trudeau-led Liberals wonthe 2015 elections and kicked the Conservatives out of government. The Tories have been in opposition since then — a role that experts said Poilievre, who has helmed the Conservative Party since 2022, excels in. “He has spent basically his adult life being a partisan,” Young said. “He’s described by people who are close to him as a very talented politician, and certainly, he’s described accurately as scrappy.” That scrappiness is something Poilievre has used to his advantage in recent years as Canadians grew increasingly worried aboutaffordability issues. Poilievre harnessed widespread anxiety and anger over soaring housing and grocery costs to lambast Trudeau, whom he blamed for all of the ills befalling the country. He even called Trudeau a “wacko prime minister” on the floor of the Canadian Parliament. Andrew Tumilty, director of issues management and crisis communications at the Enterprise Canada communications firm, said Poilievre has employed “a very populist approach” to politics that is “meant to stoke emotion rather than thinking”. “One of his central themes was that Canada is broken,” Tumilty told Al Jazeera. “That also relied heavily on his characterisation of formerPrime Minister Trudeauas being the reason that Canada is broken.” Poilievre also has taken an antagonistic approach to mainstream media, accusing journalists of bias and promising to defund the public broadcaster CBC. He has denounced progressive policies as “wokeness” run amok, promised to be tough on crime and said he plans to quickly greenlightmajor resource projects, raising concerns over his commitment to fighting climate change and respecting Indigenous rights. Meanwhile, Poilievre has been able to portray himself as a defender of a working-class struggling to make ends meet. He zeroed in on an unpopular governmentcarbon-pricing programme, for example, to paint Trudeau as out of touch with most Canadians and their needs. “Axe the Tax” – his slogan about scrapping carbon pricing – was a successful, early rallying cry. At the same time, Poilievre routinely uses his speeches and social media videos to pine for a time when Canadians had good-paying jobs and could afford homes, and he has promised to restore that era. His message has played well to the Conservative Party’s base, which is largely centred in western Canada. But it has likewise allowed Poilievre to appeal to other parts of the country that have grownfrustratedwith the status quo. Greg Walker, an Ottawa resident who lives in Poilievre’s riding, is among those who are fed up with the governing Liberal Party. “I’m going to vote Conservative, for Poilievre,” Walker told Al Jazeera in late March outside a grocery store in the small town of Stittsville. “He sounds capable as the head of the opposition party. Let’s see how he does. How much worse can he do than [Trudeau] doubling the national debt in nine years?” Walker, like several other voters Al Jazeera spoke to in Stittsville, acknowledged that part of the reason he is backing Poilievre is out of exhaustion with the Liberals under Trudeau. “It’s not as if I always vote for a guy I like the best. It’s more that I vote against the guy who’s an idiot,” Walker said. But many have raised alarm over Poilievre’s aggressive style and policies and warned that his promises to defend working-class Canadians will go unfulfilled. “Since his first election, this career politician has consistently sided with the wealthy at the expense of working people,” the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the largest union in Canada with about 750,000 members, said in October. “His long track record as an MP proves that Poilievre is running for his friends – billionaires, banks, and big polluters – not workers, not you.” Poilievre’s decision to embrace the “Freedom Convoy” has also drawn scrutiny. Led by far-right activists,the convoy blockadedthe streets of Ottawa in 2022 to protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other government policies. Trudeau’s decision to invoke the seldom-used Emergencies Act to disperse the protest drew controversy. That included the freezing of some participants’ bank accounts, whichrights groups saidwas an infringement on civil liberties. “Pierre managed to get a foot in there with subtlety, with engagement, with that ‘every person’ kind of mentality that he has,” explained Carmen Celestini, a professor at the University of Waterloo who studies far-right movements and conspiracy theories. “That was a very wise, strategic move for him,” Celestini said of Poilievre’s involvement in the convoy. The Conservatives were at a critical crossroads at the time, having lostthree consecutive electionsto the Liberals. Typically, Tory leaders had sought to appeal to Canadian voters with a more centrist platform than what they ran for the leadership on. But Poilievre, who won the Conservative leadership race just months after he spoke out in defence of convoy participants, did not do that. Experts noted at the time that his victory signalled that the party wasembracing a populist brandof conservatism. His association with the convoy also allowed the Conservatives to prevent the far-right People’s Party of Canada from siphoning off some of their support. Poilievre has denied accusations that his backing of the convoy movement meant he supported far-right fringe elements. Celestini, however, said he commonly uses“trigger words” that appeal to far-right conspiracy theorists. She pointed to Poilievre’s repeated attacks on the World Economic Forum (WEF) as one such example. “That’s appealing to the audience that thinks we’re in the ‘great reset’,” Celestini explained, referring to the conspiracy theory that the WEF is trying to impose an authoritarian world government through its COVID-19 recovery plan. Poilievre also recently gave an interview to popular right-wing commentator Jordan Peterson. In it, Poilievre denounced “an obsession with race that woke-ism has reinserted” and “invented in many ways”. He promised to restore “the values of gratitude” for Canadian history. “He uses these terms that speak to conspiracists, that speak to the engagement of men who feel disenfranchised or have constructed victimhood,” Celestini said. But Poilievre’s move away from the political centre could pose a challenge in Canada’s rapidly evolving political sphere. In early January,Trudeau announcedhe would be stepping down as prime minister, stripping Poilievre of the adversary he had spent years sparring with. Trump’s threats of imposing steep tariffs on Canada andmaking the countryinto the US’s “51st state” have also led to a rise in Canadian nationalism and calls to unite in defence of the country’s sovereignty. “Hearing the message [from Poilievre] of Canada being broken … isn’t going to play as well when there’s a surge of national unity and national pride,” Tumilty said. Young also explained that while Poilievre’s policies are different from Trump’s, he has adopted a “Trump style” that isn’t sitting well with many Canadians at this moment of heightened tensions with the US. “He likes giving nicknames to his opponents the way Trump has given nicknames to his opponents. He has kind of a snarky, dismissive way of dealing with the mainstream media that’s sort of reminiscent of Trump,” she said. “He’s in an election where a key segment of the electorate – the people who are probably going to decide this election – are people who are looking for someone to lead the country through a very difficult economic and political moment. They perhaps want sophistication, not slogans.” AMarch 20 pollfrom the research firm Ipsos found that 41 percent of respondents favoured Liberal leader Mark Carney to handle Trump, compared with 31 percent for Poilievre. The same poll found that 43 percent of respondents believed Poilievre would “roll over and accept” Trump’s demands, nearly double the percentage of people who said the same of Carney. The Conservative Party did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. Hal Howlett, an Ottawa-area resident who voted in Poilievre’s riding before the lines were redrawn, said his main concern heading into the upcoming elections is having a leader who can stand up to Trump. “And I think Carney is that guy,” he said. Howlett added that he never liked the way Poilievre would trash his Liberal opponents while canvassing for past elections. “I just never liked him, and I couldn’t understand how he kept getting elected. He was arrogant even when he wasn’t the top guy,” Howlett said. “I don’t think a top politician should be a jerk, just like Donald Trump is.” Polls are showing the Liberals have extended their lead in the election race, with the CBC News Poll Tracker saying the party is moving “deeper into majority territory”. As of April 9, Poilievre and the Conservatives are 7 percentage points behind. The question remains, though, how Poilievre might address rising tensions with the US if he becomes the next prime minister. A Breitbart interview with Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith recently resurfaced, reigniting scrutiny over the issue. Smith told the far-right US news outlet that she had appealed to the Trump administration to delayits tariffsuntil after the Canadian elections because they were helping the Liberals. She also said Poilievre was “in sync” with the US administration. Nevertheless, Poilievre has sought to present himself as the right choice to take on Trump. Standing at a podium emblazoned with the slogan “Canada First – for a Change”, Poilievre launched hiscampaign on March 23by attacking the Liberals as having “made our economy and our country weaker and more divided, just like Trump wanted”. “Electing Liberals to a fourth term will weaken our country still,” he added. According to Young, the monthlong campaign season is going to be pivotal. She noted that both Poilievre and Carney are in their first election race as leaders of their respective parties and how they will handle the pressure remains an open question. “Voters have shifted their vote intention over the last several weeks, but that’s flexible. It can still shift back,” she told Al Jazeera. “We don’t know what plot twists are coming during the campaign from Donald Trump. I really think it’s anyone’s guess how this is going to play out.”",

    "title": "Netanyahu backs dismissal of Israeli reservists calling for end to Gaza war",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuhas denounced about 1,000 current and retired Israeli Air Force reservists, who signed a letter calling for an end to the war in Gaza, referring to them as “marginal and extremist”, while expressing support for the serving pilots’ dismissal. In a statement posted on X on Thursday, Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister “backs the decision” of the defence minister and the Israeli military chief of staff “to dismiss those who signed the letter”. The document, which ignited a political uproar in Israel, urged all Israeli citizens to demand an end to the war, warning that the bombardment of Gaza puts Israeli captives held in the enclave at risk. “As has been proven in the past, only a [ceasefire] deal can bring back the hostages safely, while military pressure mainly leads to the killing of the hostages and the endangerment of our soldiers,” the soldiers said. “Currently, the war serves mainly political and personal interests, not security interests,” the document added. Netanyahu said “expressions that weaken” the military “and strengthen our enemies in wartime are unforgiveable”. “This is a marginal and extremist group that is again trying to break Israeli society from within,” he added, accusing them of trying to topple the government. “They already tried to do this before October 7 and Hamas interpreted the call to refuse to serve as weakness.” According to Israeli media, the letter does not call for a general refusal to serve but rather urges Israeli officials to prioritise the release of captives rather than pursuing the deadly war. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the signatories include many active reservists, including senior officers and pilots, as well as others who are no longer in active reserve duty. The report added that after the document was leaked, military officials called the signatories and urged them to retract, on orders from Israeli Air Force commander Tomer Bar. Bar also threatened the reservist pilots who signed the letter would be barred from serving, according to Israel’s public broadcaster Kan. Haaretz said only 25 retracted their signatures while eight more signed in protest. The newspaper later reported that Israel’sMilitary Chief of Staff Eyal Zamirand the Air Force’s Bar have decided to dismiss the reservists. It is unclear when the dismissal would take effect. Critics have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war in a bid to keep his cabinet intact and stay as prime minister. Families of Israeli captives and their supporters have also been urging Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire with Hamas and pave the way for the captives’ release. Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least50,846 Palestiniansare confirmed dead and 115,729 wounded inIsrael’s war on Gaza. The enclave’s Government Media Office updated itsdeath tollto more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "title": "Ecuador’s Indigenous movement splinters over presidential election support",
    "article_text": "Saquisili, Ecuador –Every Thursday, the Indigenous market in the Ecuadorian town of Saquisili buzzes with crowds from across the province of Cotopaxi and beyond. Women in felt hats and men in weathered ponchos barter over alpaca scarves and clay pots amid the aroma of slow-cooked stew. But in recent weeks, campaign posters have appeared among the stalls. As the run-off in Ecuador’s presidential race approaches on April 13, the final two candidates are attempting to court one of the country’s key demographics: Indigenous voters. Both the centre-right incumbent President Daniel Noboa and his main rival, leftist Luisa Gonzalez, received about 44 percent of the vote in the first round of the election on February 9. But in Saquisili, the Indigenous candidate, Leonidas Iza, won. Nationally, he secured 5 percent of the first-round vote, putting him in third place behind Noboa and Gonzalez. Given the tight race in the second round, the roughly539,000votes he garnered could be crucial to the outcome in the run-off. The president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), Iza had run as the candidate for the group’s political arm, the Pachakutik (PK) party. After Iza was knocked out in the first round, his party endorsed Gonzalez at a March 30 assembly, where sheagreedto a list of 25 demands. “The support for Luisa Gonzalez isn’t a blank cheque,” said Iza, who joined the assembly remotely throughvideo. “It’s an opportunity to create space for and strengthen the autonomous struggle against the right.” But the decision has divided Ecuador’s Indigenous communities, with local leaders denouncing the agreement and one of the largest regional organisations supporting Noboa despite the PK’s endorsement. Insiders and activists say that dissent calls into question not only Iza’s ability to mobilise his base but also the overall unity of the Indigenous movement going forward — whoever wins.",

    "title": "Russian advances in Ukraine slow down despite growing force size",
    "article_text": "Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine are slowing down dramatically, two analyses have found, continuing a pattern from 2024 at a time when both nations are trying to project strength in the face of United States-mediated negotiations aimed at ending the war. Britain’sMinistry of Defencelast week estimated that Russian forces seized 143sq km (55sq miles) of Ukrainian land in March, compared with 196sq km (76sq miles) in February and 326sq km (126sq miles) in January. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, spotted the same trend, estimating Russian gains at 203sq km (78sq miles) in March, 354sq km (137sq miles) in February and 427sq km (165sq miles) in January. These estimates are based on satellite imagery and geolocated open-source photography rather than claims by either side. Should this trend continue, Russian forces could come to a standstill by early summer, roughly coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s self-imposed early deadline for achieving a ceasefire. Russia’s diminishing returns have come even as it has greatly expanded the size of its forces from an estimated 150,000 soldiers who carried out its initial invasion in February to May 2022. “Since the beginning of the aggression, the enemy has increased its group fivefold,” Ukrainian Commander-in-chiefOleksandr Syrskiitold the online publication Livyi Bereg this week. He estimated that Russia has been adding 120,000 to 130,000 soldiers a year to its forces in Ukraine and it today has about 623,000 military personnel in the country. Despite this, almost all of the Ukrainian territory Russia occupies, about a fifth of the country, was the result of the seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its initial, full-scale invasion in 2022. A Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 took back about 20,000sq km (7,722sq miles). Russia has so far failed to recapture that. Its grinding advances in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk last year succeeded in wresting away just 4,168sq km (1,609sq miles) of fields and abandoned villages – equivalent to 0.69 percent of Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War determined in January. Those gains also came at a significant cost in men and materiel. Ukraine’sMinistry of Defenceput Russia’s losses of soldiers at 430,790. That’s the equivalent of 36 Russian motorised rifle divisions and outnumbers Russia’s losses in 2022 and 2023 combined. While Russia has recruited enough soldiers to more than make up for its losses, its performance on the battlefield suggests it is struggling to train and equip its forces. Moscow’s announcement of each capture, however small, has helped create an impression of inevitability to its conquest of Ukraine. On Monday, for example, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it had taken the settlement ofKaterinovkain Donetsk. But these conquests have been small. The Institute for the Study of War estimated that even at 2024 rates of advance, Russia would have needed two years to capture the remaining parts of Donetsk alone. And that was before Russia’s pace of territorial gains slipped further in 2025. Despite these trends, Russian President Vladimir Putin has escalated his aggression since US-Russian ceasefire talks kicked off on February 18. An analysis byThe Telegraphfound that the number of Russian drone strikes against Ukraine rose by more than 50 percent from January to February. In the first week of March, Russia launched a concerted effort that mostly pushed Ukrainian soldiers out of Kursk, a Russian border region Ukraine invaded in August. On April 9, Russia said only two settlements – Gornal and Oleshnya – remained in Ukrainian hands inKursk, and it was locked in fierce battles to recapture them. Russia’s March success in Kursk coincided with a US intelligence and military aid cut-off for Ukraine. During the past week, Russia was building up forces to follow up its success in Kursk by opening new fronts in Kharkiv and Sumy, two regions in northeastern Ukraine on the border with Russia, Syrskii said. “For several days, almost a week, we have been observing an almost doubling of the number of enemy offensive actions in all main directions,” he said. Syrskii also said he believed Russia could use joint military exercises with Belarus planned for the autumn as cover to mobilise more forces, a tactic Moscow used in late 2021. “The visibility of exercises is the most acceptable way to rebase, transfer troops, concentrate in a certain direction and create a troop group,” Syrskii said. Moscow also went on the diplomatic offensive this week, doubling down on efforts to vilify Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as an unreliable leader. Russian officials said Ukraine was continuing to defy a ceasefire on energy infrastructure Kyiv never agreed to but that Moscow declared unilaterallyon March 18after a phone call between Trump and Putin. On Friday, Russia’sDefence Ministrysaid Ukraine carried out half a dozen attacks on energy facilities in the Bryansk, Tambov and Lipetsk regions, causing gas outages to three cities and two electricity blackouts. “More than 100 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles sent to bomb civilian targets on Russian soil in one night alone are a thousand times more telling than Zelensky’s wails about his ‘aspiration for peace’,” Russian special envoy Rodion Miroshnik wrote on his Telegram channel. Kremlin spokesmanDmitry Peskovon Monday said ceasefire negotiations were complicated by the “lack of control over the Kyiv regime, about the impossibility of the Kyiv regime to control the actions of a number of extremist and nationalist units that simply do not obey Kyiv”. That was a reference to the alleged existence of far-right elements in the Ukraine military. Russia and the US are expected to hold a round ofnegotiationsin Istanbul on Thursday. On Wednesday, Russia’s Defence Ministry said two drones were shot down while trying to strike the gas distribution plant of the city ofTemryuk, which sits on a neck of land on the Russian side of the Crimean Peninsula. That same night, the ministry said, eight Ukrainian drones were shot down before reaching theKorenovskayaelectrical plant, which powers the TurkStream gas pipeline. Ukraine has twice this year tried to shut the pipeline down by targeting its compressors. In total, Russia’sDefenceMinistry said it had intercepted 107 Ukrainian drones over 10 regions on the night of April 3 to early April 4 in one of the biggest such attacks. But Russia, too, targeted the Kherson thermal power plant with a short-range first-person view (FPV) drone on Friday,Zelenskyysaid. FPV drones generally carry up to 5kg (11lb), a much smaller payload than long-range strike drones, which usually ranges from 20kg to 50kg (44lb to 110lb). The Kremlin gave less publicity to the fact that a Ukrainian dronebarrage on Saturday struckthe fibre optic systems plant in Saransk in Russia’s Mordovia. It is Russia’s only plant manufacturing optical fibre used in FPV drones and other defence systems. Russia also did not mention that Ukrainiandrones struckindustrial explosives manufacturer Promsintez in the Samara region, causing 20 explosions and fires. The plant reportedly stopped production after the attack. Syrskii said in his interview that drones had destroyed a $100m long-range Tupolev-22M3 bomber days earlier. Ukraine has targeted these bombers because they are used to launch thousands of glide bombs against Ukraine’s front lines every month. Syrskii also said strikes against Russian airfields had pushed back the Russian air force, reducing its effectiveness. Unlike Ukraine, which has consistently targeted defence and energy infrastructure, Russia has kept up long-range air attacks targeting Ukrainian cities. In retaliation for Saturday’s attacks,Russia launched18 cruise missiles, six ballistic missiles and 109 attack drones on Saturday night – its largest strike in a month. Ukraine said it intercepted 93 of the drones, one ballistic and 12 cruise missiles but five ballistic missiles struck residential areas. One of themkilled 20 peoplein Kryvyi Rih, including nine children, prompting the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. “This is why the war must end,” US Ambassador to KyivBridget Brinkwrote on social media. “Such a strong country, such a strong people – and such a weak reaction,”Zelenskyyresponded on Telegram. “They are even afraid to say the word ‘Russian’ when talking about the missile that killed children.” Russia accusedZelenskyy of deliberately framing the attack as an indiscriminate massacre of civilians whereas it was really targeting a meeting of foreign mercenaries with Ukrainian commanders at a restaurant. But Russia followed up the ballistic missile strike in Kryvyi Rih with a wave of drones, which hit a playground and residential buildings. Until this strike, Russia and Ukraine had observed an unofficial ceasefire over the Black Sea. This had apparently come to an end becauseZelenskyysaid several of the Russian missiles were launched from ships and submarines. The attacks continued this week. Russia’sDefenceMinistry on Monday said it shot down 19 Ukrainian drones overnight. Ukraine’s air forcesaid it intercepted 31 drones on Tuesday out of an attack totalling 46. The drones followed a strike by an Iskander ballistic missile in a tactic reminiscent of that on Kryvyi Rih. The following night,Russialaunched 55 Shahed drones at Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 32 and disoriented eight.Russia saidit downed 158 Ukrainian drones over 11 regions. Ukraine’s81st Separate Airmobile Sloboda Brigade on Tuesday said it captured two Chinese soldiers on Ukrainian soil. Zelenskyy confirmed it at a news conference, saying, “Ukrainians engaged in combat with six Chinese service members in the Donetsk region – in Tarasivka and Bilohorivka.” Helater wroteon social media: “We have information suggesting that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier’s units.” US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Chinese soldiers’ involvement was “disturbing”. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian on Wednesday denied Beijing’s involvement. But Russiantelevision channelsshowed further evidence of Chinese troops in Ukraine weeks earlier.",

    "title": "Stocks soar: Why Trump faces scrutiny over tariff pause timing",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump on Wednesdaypaused steep tariffson America’s trading partners barring China, instead imposing a blanket 10 percent tariff on goods imported from these nations and territories. The 90-day pause came within 24 hours of the dutiestaking effect. The pausing of most additional tariffs, which hadroiled the stock market,sent US major stock indices soaring to one of their biggest single-day gains since World War II, even though they remain nearly 11 percent below their February 19 peak under Trump. Three hours before he announced the pause, Trump encouraged investors to buy stock. In the aftermath, Democrats have accused Trump of market manipulation, using his announcements to first crash stocks before creating a short window when those who bought shares would gain dramatically. Trump’s allies have denied the charge, but his critics are now calling for Congress to investigate him. So what happened, could the market whiplash have benefitted investors who listened to Trump, and why has this angered some Democrats? Trump announced the three-month reprieve from the tariffs on Wednesday, amid negotiations with more than 75 countries to reduce the levies on their goods, he said. The US president said that all the countries that had not retaliated against his tariffs would only face a 10 percent blanket tariff until July. He suggested his pause was strategic – to reward those countries that agreed to work towards a deal with him. “I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know,” Trump explained when asked why he announced the pause while speaking to reporters. Trump announced thesetariffson April 2, ranging from12 percent to 50 percent, on about 60 trading partners that he claimed were guilty of imposing disproportionately high levies on US imports. These tariffs took effect on Tuesday. Additionally, Trump had announced – also on April 2 – a flat 10 percent tariff on products coming from almost all other trading partners of the US. These tariffs came into force on April 5. The tariff pausedoes not applyto China. On April 2, which Trump dubbed “Liberation Day”, China was hit with a 34 percent tariff on top of an existing 20 percent tariff. This set off a sequence of tit-for-tat actions by China and the US, each raising tariffs on the other. China has, as of now, imposed an84 percent tariffon US products. Trump, meanwhile, has increased the levy on Chinese goods to125 percent. In the week that followed the announcement, the US’s three major stock indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq –droppedby more than 5 percent. This was the biggest stock market decline in the US since 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The US Treasury bond market came under selling pressure. The 10-year benchmark government bond yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell after Trump announced the tariffs. On Thursday, the Treasury yields started to drop. No. The tariff pausedoes not applyto China. On the April 2 “Liberation Day”, China was hit with a 34 percent tariff on top of an existing 20 percent tariff. This set off a sequence of tit-for-tat actions by China and the US, each raising tariffs on the other. China has, as of now, imposed an84 percent tariffon US products. Trump, meanwhile, has increased the levy on Chinese goods to125 percent. All other countries and territories – including those which theUS has a trade surplus with, or a free trade agreement with – have still been hit with a 10 percent tariff rate. Quite the opposite. Before announcing the pause, Trump and his close aides had repeatedly held that the tariffs would not be paused or rolled back. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNN last week: “I don’t think there’s any chance that President Trump’s going to back off his tariffs. This is the reordering of global trade.” On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described a news report suggesting the possibility of a 90-day pause in tariffs as “fake news”. But about four hours before Trump announced the pause in tariffs, hepostedon his Truth Social platform, saying: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” After Trump’s later pause announcement, the S&P 500, which tracks the stock performance of 500 leading US companies, surged 9.5 percent. This marked one of the biggest one-day gains in 80 years for the index. The Nasdaq also jumped by 12.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial average grew by nearly 3,000 points. This means that investors who listened to Trump’s Truth Social advice and bought into the market yielded large returns. On the other hand, investors who sold assets during the market drop before the tariff pause, lost money. Democrats have accused Trump of deliberately creating market fluctuations by flip-flopping between imposing and lifting tariffs. They want Trump to be investigated for market manipulation, the act of deliberately misleading free-flowing markets for profit. California Senator, Democrat Adam Schiff, posted on X, saying that “these constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading”. Schiff questioned: “Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip-flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense?” In a separate post, the senator released a video of himself reiterating his suspicions about whether Trump’s inner circle “illegally profited” from the stock market swings. “Congress must find out,” he wrote. Is Donald Trump's inner circle illegally profiting off of these huge swings in the stock market by insider trading? Congress must find out.pic.twitter.com/ZZGX99PtFE — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff)April 9, 2025 Suspicions about investors knowing about Trump’s pause plan before he made the announcement were also fuelled by the fact that Nasdaq call volumes spiked less than 20 minutes before Trump announced the tariff pause. Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reposted screenshots showing the call volume spike in an X post. “Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now,” she wrote. “It’s time to ban insider trading in Congress.” Trump’s trade representative Jamieson Greer was testifying to a House of Representatives committee when Trump made the announcement. Democrat Steven Horsford, a Nevada congressman, asked Greer why he had not disclosed the decision to pause tariffs. “I don’t disclose my conversations with the president, sir,” Greer responded. “If it was a plan, if it was always the plan, how is it not market manipulation?” Horsford said. Greer responded, saying that this was not market manipulation, and the Trump administration was instead “trying to reset the global trade system that has offshored all our factories.”",

Microsoft originally intended to launch Recall alongside Copilot Plus PCs last June, but the featurewas delayedfollowing concerns raisedby security experts. The company then planned to launch it in October, but thatgot pushedas well so that the company could deliver “a secure and trusted experience.” The company did release a preview of Recallin Novemberto Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel for Qualcomm Copilot Plus PCs and made a preview available to Intel- and AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCshortly after.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences plans to start awarding stunt performers for their work on movies in 2027. byCharles Pulliam-Moore After years of stuntwork largely being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Oscars are about to add a new category. Today,the Academy announcedthat it intends to start giving out Oscar statues for stunt design starting with films released in 2027 for the awards ceremony’s 100th anniversary. “Since the early days of cinema, stunt design has been an integral part of filmmaking,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a statement about the new category. “We are proud to honor the innovative work of these technical and creative artists, and we congratulate them for their commitment and dedication in reaching this momentous occasion.” The Academy has yet to announce any other eligibility rules for films that will be nominated in the new category. “The specifics of the award’s presentation will be determined by the Academy’s Board of Governors and executive leadership at a future date,” according to the Academy’s press release. Though over 100 stunt workers are currently members of the Academy’s Production and Technology Branch, asThe Hollywood Reporternotes, the organization has only ever given out two (honorary) Oscars to stunt performers. Now that the new category has been established, we’re probably going to start seeing studios putting a lot more emphasis ontheir projects’ death-defying set pieces.

    "article_text": "The Varia Vue will automatically save footage of an incident detected by its accelerometer.﻿ The Varia Vue will automatically save footage of an incident detected by its accelerometer.﻿ byAndrew Liszewski If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Garmin has announced anew addition to its Varia lineof safety and visibility accessories for cyclists. The Varia Vue is the first to pair a bright headlight with a front-facing 4K camera designed to automatically record incidents and save the footage locally or send it to the cloud through a smartphone. It’savailable now through the company’s online storefor $549.99 and is also available throughAmazon. The Varia Vue can capture 4K video for up to six hours on a full charge, but battery life is reduced to as little as 1.25 hours with the headlight set to its brightest setting. Dropping the camera’s resolution to 1080P at 30fps can boost recording times to up to nine hours, or up to 1.5 hours with the headlight at full brightness. Electronic image stabilization helps to reduce shakiness in footage captured on rough terrain, while continuous recording allows the events leading up to an incident (detected by the Vue’s accelerometer) to be stored alongside the aftermath. With the camera paired to devices like Garmin’s smartwatches, cycling computers, or even its mobile app, video is recorded with GPS speed and location info. To further maximize battery life, the Vue can be connected toGarmin’s camera-equipped radar taillight. Not only does that unlock an additional recording mode where the Vue only starts to capture footage when a vehicle approaches from behind, it also allows incidents to be captured from two different angles. Footage is recorded locally to an SD card, but when connected to Wi-Fi, videos can be automatically uploaded to the online Garmin Vault for added security. However, that feature requires either a $9.99 monthly subscription or a $99.99 annual one. Garmin says the Vue’s headlight has a maximum brightness of 600 lumens, but that’s only available in a flashing mode designed for daytime use. At full brightness, the Vue outputs 550 lumens, and can be dimmed to as low as 140 lumens. The headlight is also designed with a cutoff beam that angles the illumination down onto the road so it doesn’t shine in the eyes of oncoming drivers. One additional feature that will almost certainly appeal to existing Garmin fans is that the company, which haslong stuck with Micro USB ports on its products, has opted for a USB-C port on the Vue for charging.

The delayed ‘Meda in China’ smartwatch is now $499, roughly 52 percent more expensive than originally planned. byVictoria Song If you were hoping to cop a OnePlus Watch 3, you can finally buy one starting today. The problem is it’s no longer the $329.99 price that was originally intended when OnePlus announced the device a few months ago. It’s now $499, a $170 or roughly 52 percent markup. The price hike was spotted by anumberof Androidblogs, but what makes this odd is a lack of official communication from OnePlus itself. Normally, companies will alert press and long-time customers as consumers generally don’t react well to unexplained price hikes. However, no such hint came from OnePlus before the smartwatch went on sale. When asked about the price increase, OnePlus spokesperson Spenser Blank toldThe Verge, “We don’t have any additional comment to share at this time.” The obvious explanation, though unconfirmed by OnePlus, would be tariffs. Unless you’ve been hibernating under a rock, you’ve probably seen headlines about President Trump’s ever-increasing tariffs against products shipped from China. (As of this writing, they’re currentlysitting at 145 percent.) While most wearables and gadget makers I’ve spoken to have acknowledged tariffs will have an impact on pricing, some have opted to take a more wait-and-see approach. This is, however, one of the first examples of a smartwatch actually increasing in price, let alone by such a dramatic amount. It’s also unusual given that many gadget makers attempted to delay such price hikes byincreasing inventoryahead of the tariffs taking effect — keeping consumers from actually feeling the impact of tariffs on their wallet as soon. Others, like Framework,temporarily opted to halt some salesin the U.S. But OnePlus may not have been able to stockpile units in the US early because of an ironic mistake. The OnePlus Watch 3 was originally set to launch back in February but was delayed because of anunfixable typoengraved in the backplate.

Howell is reportedly in talks to lead the series as Carrie White. byCharles Pulliam-Moore Three years aftersigning an overall TV production deal with Amazon, Mike Flanagan is finally developing a new project for the studio. Deadlinereports that Amazon is moving forward with aCarrieseries adaptation from Flanagan based on Stephen King’s 1974 novel about a girl born with telekinetic powers. In addition to writing and showrunning the project, Flanagan will direct a selection of its eight episodes. Flanagan, whoconnfirmed the news on his Bluesky page today, will also executive produce alongside Trevor Macy. No official casting announcements have been made just yet, but actresses Summer H. Howell (Curse of Chucky) and Siena Agudong (Netflix’sResident Evil) are reportedly in talks to portray Carrie White and cheerleader Sue Snell, respectively. In a statement about the project, Amazon MGM’s head of TV Vernon Sanders noted howCarrie“has withstood the test of time with continued cultural relevance.” That’s a positive way of spinning the fact that there have been manyCarrieadaptations (and a sequel) following Brian De Palma’s 1976 feature starring Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving, and Piper Laurie. Though very few of those films were especially great, Flanagan has a solid track record adapting King’s classics, includingThe Life of Chuck,Doctor SleepandGerald’s Game. StretchingCarrie’s story out over eight episodes will likely to lead to some unexpected narrative changes, but it’s all (probably) still going to go down in flames when the series ultimately debuts.

Canva is launching its latest smorgasbord of generative AI-powered workspace tools in its attempt to cram everything that Microsoft, Google, and Adobe can do into a single platform.Canva’s Visual Suite is being redesignedto combine its design and productivity tools into a single interface, alongside adding new coding, photo editing, spreadsheet, and AI chatbot features. These join the collection ofoffice suite tools that rolled out in 2022, such as Canva Docs and Canva Whiteboards — Canva’s answer to services like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and FigJam. Having made a name for itself as a marketing and design platform, Canva is now hoping to add more office teams and businesses to its community of 230 million users by providing a visual spin on traditional workspace apps. The Visual Suite 2.0 update allows users to build and edit documents, presentations, animations, and websites into a single design, providing a unified format for teams to collaborate on multiple tasks simultaneously. “This eliminates the need for separate tools, fragmented workflows, and disconnected files,” Canva said in its press release. “Entire campaigns - from planning and briefing to design and delivery - can now happen in one seamless, collaborative space.” Canva Sheets is a more creative take on typical spreadsheet-building applications, allowing users to combine text with visual assets. Data can be imported from HubSpot, Statista, Google Analytics, and more, according to Canva, while the company’s AI-powered “Magic Insights” feature automatically scans the data to identify notable patterns or takeaways. Data can also be transformed into a variety of interactive graphs using “Magic Charts,” which aims to make it easy for users to turn raw numbers into infographics, reports, and animated visualizations. Canva Code is a generative AI coding assistant akin toGemini Code Assist or theMicrosoft-owned GitHub Copilot. Users can give it a text prompt to generate widgets, websites, and other interactive content “with no coding or external tools required,” according to Canva. Meanwhile, Canvas’s new AI chatbot — which the company describes as a “conversational creative partner” — brings all of Canva’s generative AI tools into one window to make them easier for users to quickly access. From there, you can use voice or text prompts to edit photos, resize designs, and generate text, slides, and images. On the creative side of things, Canva has also updated its Photo Editor with similar features to those thatAdobe has introduced in its professional Photoshop software. The Photo Editor now allows users to automatically modify or remove background objects by clicking on them, and create AI-generated backgrounds that “account for lighting and layout,” according to Canva.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 10, 2025 / 7:02 PM EDT/ CBS News TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionis now backing an additionalmeasles vaccineshot for some travelers within the United States, multiple health officials tell CBS News, in response torecord outbreaksof the highly contagious virus this year. In a letter shared with health departments on April 8, the CDC said it would now be recommending that visitors to areas affected bymeaslesoutbreaks within the United States follow stepped up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities. Most adults still do not need an additional dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the CDC says. But for \"people going to or living in areas in the United States with ongoing community-wide measles transmission,\" the CDC says doctors should \"reassess need\" for vaccination. This means that adult and teen travelers to some counties inTexasandKansas— the states that have updated their recommendations — should get a second dose if they have not received two doses already or get two doses if they are unvaccinated. Infants should get an early first dose before the typically recommended age of 12 months old, followed by two more doses, and children over 12 months old should get an early second dose if they already have one, or two doses if they are unvaccinated. Previously, the CDChad saidthat one dose of the measles vaccine or other evidence of immunity was \"sufficient for most adults.\" But the CDC has long had stepped up recommendations for Americans preparing forinternational travel. Under those recommendations, children over 12 months old, teenagers and adults should have two doses if they do not have other evidence of immunity, and infants should get an early first dose. Local outbreaks of the virus have also been reported to the CDC from New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, the agencysaidlast week. Other states have since reported local spread, includingIndianaandColorado. More than 600 measles cases across at least 21 states have been reported so far this year, the most since arecord 2019 waveof the virus that reached 1,274 cases nationwide. Two unvaccinated children in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in neighboring New Mexico,have died. While the CDC said that health departments could share the updated guidance with providers in their state, it is unclear why the agency did not publish their latest recommendations on its own website. Abulletinissued by the agency on April 8 about measles did not mention the new vaccination recommendations for domestic travel. \"CDC's clinical vaccination guidance for measles outbreaks has not changed. During measles outbreaks, health departments may provide additional recommendations to protect their communities,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement. They said that the decision to offer an early dose of vaccine to young children \"should be made carefully after weighing the risks of the potential long-term impact of lower immune responses\" compared to the benefit of early protection. \"There are no recommendations to receive a third dose of MMR vaccine during measles outbreaks,\" the spokesperson said. Vaccination of visitors to areas affected by outbreaks should follow the same recommendations issued by health authorities for those areas, which are being published on the agency'swebsite, the CDC told doctors. So far, only two states —TexasandKansas— are listed by the CDC as having issued \"updated outbreak recommendations\" in response to the virus, which are broken down by age for most residents. The states say in counties facing outbreaks, adults and teenagers should get a second dose if they've only had one previously. If they are unvaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get an early first dose, the recommendations say. They then should receive a second dose at 12 to 15 months and a third at 4 to 6 years old. Children over 12 months old who have one dose should get an early second dose, as long as it's been at least 28 days since the first. If they haven't been vaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by another at least 28 days later. Additionally, individuals born between 1957 and 1968 who received anolder MMR vaccine, are recommended to get at least one dose of the current vaccine. Texas recommends those individuals get two doses. Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

    "title": "Government files memo in case against Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 10, 2025 / 6:48 PM EDT/ CBS News Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activistMahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum bySecretary of State Marco Rubioto a Louisiana immigration court. In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict withAmerican foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests. Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\" Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He wasdetained by federal immigration authoritiesat his university-owned apartment as hispregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey beforebeing flown to a remote facilityin Jena, Louisiana. The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News hasnot found evidence that Khalilhas said he supports Hamas. Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday saidshe would terminate the caseunless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had\"not received a single document\"of evidence from the government. \"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours. In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted. Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" \"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\" Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests. \"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\" Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case. The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel. Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech. \"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\" After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel. Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings. \"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case. \"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Why did Trump pause the tariffs? Look to the bond market.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 10, 2025 / 6:45 PM EDT/ CBS News Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trumpexpressedconfidence in his trade policies,sayinglast week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause. With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, heabruptly suspendedhis administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\" Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities. Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments. As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.) Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors. \"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note. Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\" In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\" Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs. \"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettsaidon CNBC on Thursday. Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economistsraised concernsabout the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government. But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from abaseline 10%for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage. While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers. \"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summerssaidin an April 9 thread on social media. He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\" Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which areforecastto cost trillions over the next decade. In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasurydata. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation. An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget. \"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.

    "title": "Trump tariffs raise costs, business risks for NYC garment companies",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 10, 2025 / 6:38 PM EDT/ MoneyWatch New York City's famed Garment District is bracing for impact as President Trump'sbarrage of tariffsbegin to ripple through the apparel industry. For Lyn and Lisa Alessi, co-founders and co-CEOs of Alessi International, a local fabric importer representing mills in Asia and Europe, the tariffs could pose significant challenges to their business, which works with international partners to produce fabrics for high-end clothing companies. \"I have all my customers putting on the brakes, asking, 'What are we going to do? How are we going to handle this? Where can we move production to?'\" said Lyn Alessi, who began selling luxury fabrics in 1989. According to the American Apparel and Footwear Association,97% of the clothes and shoes sold in the U.S. are imported. Most of these items come from China, India and Vietnam, according to theWorld Bank. The Trump administration confirmed Thursday that some Chinese goods will be subject to so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" reaching as high as 145%, while imports from Vietnam and India face tariffs of 46% and 27%, respectively. Mr. Trumpsuspended the tariffson most countries for 90 days to allow more time for trade talks, but the levies on China remain in place. The onslaught of new U.S. tariffs has ratcheted up import taxes to their highest level in more than a century, with Mr. Trump touting the policies as a way to revitalizedomestic manufacturers. For the Alessi sisters, this additional tax on imports will impact nearly every aspect of garment production, resulting in higher costs for the business and for consumers. They predict this will lead to shoppers seeking out alternative clothing options. \"A Veronica Beard jacket was $800. Now it's going to be $1,000. And that just takes it out of the market. The secondhand market is going to thrive,\" Alessi said. Down the block from Alessi International is Apparel Production, a manufacturing group that has survived the industry's ups and downs since its founding in 1948. The company, co-owned by Karen Sadaka and Teddy Sadaka, works with brands including Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Kenneth Cole, but most of its plants have shut down as garment jobs were shipped overseas. \"We had factories in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky,\" Karen Sadaka said. \"It wasn't a problem. Today, they're all out of business.\" Today, the average age of workers at Apparel Production is 50, and filling those jobs when they retire is likely to prove challenging. Sadaka said it is too son to tell if Mr. Trump's tariffs will spur domestic production, but she fears the shift \"is too much, too fast.\" Kelly  O'Gradycontributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Marco Rubio memo cites Mahmoud Khalil's beliefs in justifying his deportation",
    "article_text": "Faced with a judge's deadline to provide evidence that Mahmoud Khalil poses a national security threat to the U.S., the Trump administration responded with a brief memo citing the Columbia student protester's beliefs in justifying his deportation. Khalil, a graduate student who helped lead protests against the war in Gaza last year, wasarrested by immigration authoritieson March 8. On Tuesday, an immigration judge in Louisianaordered the federal governmentto provide evidence by Wednesday justifying its attempt to deport him. Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded Wednesday evening in a memo obtained by NBC News. In a one-and-a-half-page memo, he cited an obscure provision of theImmigration and Nationality Actof 1952 to justify Khalil’s removal from the U.S. Rubio said that while Khalil's “past, current or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful,\" the provision allows the secretary of state alone to “personally determine” whether he should remain in the country. He said that allowing Khalil to stay in the U.S. would create a \"hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.” “The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective,” he wrote. In response, Khalil's lawyer, Baher Azmy, said that \"immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him.\" \"What this case is really about is whether lawful permanent residents — and other immigrants to this country — can speak out about Israel’s brutal attacks on Gaza and Palestine, or any other important matters of discussion in the national discourse, without fear of deportation for expressing beliefs that the First Amendment completely protects,\" Azmy said at a virtual news briefing Thursday. \"Are U.S. citizens going to be next?” Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans will decide at a hearing scheduled for Friday in Louisiana whether Khalil can be removed from the United States or should be released. If she rules that Khalil can be deported, his legal team can appeal. Marc Van Der Hout, another attorney for Khalil, said at the briefing that the Rubio memo is the only piece of evidence the government submitted to justify that Khalil’s presence in the U.S. would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” “The government submitted, as you all have seen now, a two-page document. Two pages, that’s it,\" Van Der Hout said. \"And in that, Secretary of State Rubio says that Mahmoud’s presence here would create adverse foreign policy interests. But what does he talk about? He talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the United States. His determination, quote, unquote, has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy.” In less than five weeks since Khalil's arrest, immigration authorities have arrested dozens of foreign students — many of whom are Muslim — at universities across the country or revoked their visas. Rubiosaid last monththat the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas. “We do it every day,\" he said. \"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.\" On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of a task force to monitor the social media activity of immigrants, including foreign students, for antisemitism. Three sources familiar with the operationtold NBC Newsthat the task force will be screening an estimated 1.5 million foreign students studying in the United States for potential grounds to revoke their visas. The unprecedented actions by the immigration system come amid the federal government's broader crackdown on universities in the name of combatting antisemitism. In February, the Department of Justice launched a task force to “root out” what it calls“anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.” The administration has also halted hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to several universities in recent weeks, includingColumbia, Harvard andPrinceton, citing dissatisfaction with how they handled last year’s protests against the war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Harriet Tubman's descendant speaks out after federal site downplays Underground Railroad",
    "article_text": "Rita Daniels learned at 9 that she is the great-great-great-grandniece of famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who led countless enslaved Africans to freedom through the Underground Railroad. It was a moment that changed how she viewed herself and American history for the rest of her life. So when Daniels, now 70, learned in recent days that the National Park Servicedrastically altered its webpageon Tubman and the Underground Railroad in February, she was devastated. “It tore me apart when I saw the news clip flash across my phone,” said Daniels, who recentlyco-authored a book about Tubman’s life. In elementary school, Daniels was assigned to write about Tubman, but books she could access at her school in Auburn, New York — where Tubman settled in 1859 after fleeing enslavement in Maryland — described her as “a thief,” Daniels recalled. “It said she stole slaves, that there was a bounty on her head, those kind of things.” When Daniels told her mother what she found, her mother not only told her it was untrue, she told Daniels that Tubman was her ancestor. That began a life in which Daniels leaned on Tubman’s legacy for strength while also working to preserve history as an author and the founder of the Harriet Tubman Learning Center. The page had been changed in February,The Washington Post reported, swapping out a large image of Tubman for one of five postage stamps celebrating “Black/white cooperation.” The description of the Underground Railroad was changed from “the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight” to one that downplays the role of slavery, instead saying it was an expression of the “American civil rights movement” that bridged “the divides of race.” “I was just basically shocked and hurt at the same time,” Daniels said. “Most of my adult life, I pretty much wanted to make sure that people know that her story is a critical part of Black history, which is American history.” Daniels said that as a child, it felt both shocking and empowering to learn she came from the bloodline of one of the most significant figures in American history. “At that age, I didn’t fully understand the race war in the country or why they would describe her that way in books,” she said. “But I knew having her as a relative was special.” She said Tubman’s tenacity has been a significant influence in her life. When she was tormented for years by a stalker, Daniels sought strength from her ancestor. After years of persistent harassment that began when Daniels was 17, the man broke into her home and stabbed her repeatedly, including on her face, sending her for an extended hospital stay. “I keep my aunt in my mindset when I fall or when I get into a mood of not wanting to move on or keep going,” Daniels said. “Her words were, ‘Keep going. Never give up.’ And that’s what kept me going. Even when I had been beaten up, I referred to her words. So I kept going, no matter what. She’s in my bloodlines and her words are in my head always.” After the NPS website was changed to remove Tubman’s words and a short account of her work shuttling dozens of enslaved people from bondage in the South to freedom in northern states, plus mention of the racist laws that forced the existence of the Underground Railroad, public outcry came fast and loud. On Monday, the NPS said in a statement that the page had been deleted “without approval” from the agency’s top brass and the original version was “immediately restored.” “My question is: Why do they want to erase our Black history?” Daniels asked. “Why are we such a threat to certain Americans? They want to remove or ignore very reputable Americans, Black Americans? Why? The answer is racism.” The change was one of many ongovernment websitesthat had been updated or erased as part of the Trump administration’s sweeping effort to delete what it considers references to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball, was also removed from the Army website and later restored, as was Colin Powell and Pearl Harbor hero Doris Miller. The backlash over attempts to gloss over Tubman’s history and that of the Underground Railroad only underscores how important it is to preserve it, Daniels said. “This is the kind of impact Harriett Tubman had on many people, not just me,” she said. “And they want to erase that? No. She’s too important to our family and to American history to just be pushed aside. They can’t call what she’s done DEI.”",

    "article_text": "After many years of impassioned calls for an Oscar recognizing the art of the stunt, the film academy has decided to give it an official award. An achievement in stunt design prize will be added starting with the 100thAcademy Awards,which will recognize films released in 2027, the film academy said Thursday. “Since the early days of cinema, stunt design has been an integral part of filmmaking,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a joint statement. “We are proud to honor the innovative work of these technical and creative artists, and we congratulate them for their commitment and dedication in reaching this momentous occasion.” David Leitch, who directed “The Fall Guy,” which was itself an ode to stunt performers, helped lead the charge the new prize. Leitch began his career as a stuntman for stars like Brad Pitt before transitioning to making stunt-heavy films like “John Wick.” He and stunt coordinator and designer Chris O’Hara of Stunts Unlimited made presentations to the academy advocating for the addition of a new award. The film academy’s production and technology branch has more than 100 stunt performers among its ranks. The Oscars also recentlyadded a prize for achievement in casting,starting with films released in 2025. As with the casting award, it remains unclear whether it will be added to the live Oscars broadcast.",

    "title": "What you're still set to pay more for under Trump's tariffs",
    "article_text": "Some of the stiffest new tariffs are on hold, but experts say shoppers’ bills for White House trade policies are coming due soon. President Donald Trump’ssurprise 90-day suspensionWednesday of much of his April 2 tariff announcement doesn’t change the likelihood that consumers will pay more for many goods and services in the months ahead, economists warn. All the tariffs he has announced this year would dent households’ purchasing power by an average $4,400 annually, the Yale University Budget Labforecast Thursday. While inflationdipped more than expected in March, analysts say it’s likely just a temporary reprieve. “That was nice, but don’t get used to it,” Greg McBride, Bankrate chief financial analyst, said in a statement Thursday. The president’s rapidly shifting trade war has created enormous uncertainty for businesses around the world, threatening price stability, and his steep new import taxes are merely delayed, not called off. A 10% across-the-board duty that went into effect this weekremains in place, as well as a massive 145% tariff on Chinese imports. “With both inflation and the overall economy, uncertainty abounds about what might be lurking around the bend,” McBride said. Here’s where consumers could feel the most pain in their pockets. Consumers have beenscurrying to Apple storesin recent days to upgrade their iPhones, and with good reason: the company’s best-selling product is manufactured in China, and its highest-end version could see a price hike of at least $350,according toUBS analysts. Other electronics from laptops to televisions could see similar jumps. Electronic parts — such as computing machinery, cameras, TV and radio transmitters — will account for the largest revenues from Trump’s tariff regime by far, according to ananalysisof trade data by Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit research group. Trump’s 25% tariff on imported vehicleshas already taken effect, costing Americans an additional $2,500 to $20,000 per vehicle, depending on its size and type, according toestimatesby Anderson Economic Group. Additional import taxes in the pipeline could prove inescapable even for those who don’t buy a new car, experts say. Uncertainty remains about which auto parts would be exempt under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated during his first term, while the U.S. imported a record 63% of its tires last year from countries such as Thailand (37% tariff) and South Korea (25% tariff). The U.S. gets almost all of its natural rubber from other countries, which means domestic producers will be hobbled, as well. In other words, there’s a good chance that auto tuneup is about to cost Americans more. “While the domestic production of peanuts and tree nuts is bountiful, not every nut commodity can be grown within the United States,” the Peanut and Tree Nut Processors Association said in astatementlast week. That includes cashews, one of the main exports of Vietnam, which the president hit with a 46% tariff April 2. Shoppers will also see pricier Brazil nuts, a major product of the Ivory Coast (whose exports face a 21% tariff), and macadamias, produced in South Africa (31%). The United States is the second-largest importer of coffee in the world, with about 80% of unroasted beans coming from Brazil and Colombia,according tothe U.S. Agriculture Department. While both countries are subject to Trump’s 10% baseline tariff, recent droughts in key growing regionshave already been pushing up prices this year. More than a quarter of the rice sold in the U.S. is imported from countries such as Thailand (facing a 36% tariff) and India (26%), according to the USDA. Consumers can expect to see more expensive aromatic rice, such as jasmine and basmati, as a result of the steeper import taxes. The White House has also slapped new tariffs on the nation’s top alcohol sources, including the European Union (subject to 20% tariffs), whichaccounts for80% of all the wine the U.S. imported last year. Combined with the 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods — and theexpansionof Trump’s aluminum duties to include canned beer imports — some households might end up considering a dry summer. “The increased costs of living that will result from the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices for wines that will result, will only push down consumption further,” the National Association of Wine Retailers said in a statement last week. The trade group said the policies risked “harming the American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will not recover.” Some of the largest American retailers source apparel and footwear from Asian countries including China, Bangladesh (37%), and Vietnam, which in recent years became a manufacturing hub for U.S. businesses seeking to duck trade barriers on China. That looks set to change when the new 46% tariff on Vietnamese products goes into effect. Those three countriesare amongthe top manufacturing hubs for VF Corporation, owner of brands including Timberland, Dickies, the North Face, and Vans. Gap, which operates Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic, sourced most of its apparel from factories in Vietnam, India, Indonesia (32%), Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (44%). “The 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 58% higher apparel prices in the short-run, the Yale Budget Lab researcherswrote. “Apparel prices stay 26% higher in the long-run.” A trade group that represents major brands including Nike and Skechers recentlytold Reutersthat tariffs threatened to jack the price of a $155 running shoe made in Vietnam as high as $220. Almost 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are imported from China, according to the Toy Association. Greg Ahearn, the trade group’s president,told PBSin March that he projected price increases of 15-20% on toys such as games, dolls, race cars. That was before Trump’s 104% levy on Chinese goods. Basic Fun, a Florida-based toymaker responsible for classic playsets such as Tonka Trucks and Lincoln Logs,told the New York Poston Monday that it was pausing shipments to the U.S. altogether, as passing along those costs to consumers was “impossible.” A seafood dinner could soon become an infrequent luxury. Top fish and shellfish exporters Chile and India were hit with new tariffs of 10% and 26%, respectively. “About 70 to 80% of the U.S. seafood food supply is imported, and so that is not a number that the U.S. domestic industry can plug,” said Andy Harig, an executive at the Food Industry Association,told Today.comlast week. “So you’re going to see that the cost of the seafood department go up.",

    "title": "The wealthy are loading up on cash, gold and family trusts during market turmoil",
    "article_text": "Wealthy investors have made the best trade over the past week — largely doing nothing. While many hedge funds and institutions have been selling over the past week, wealthy individual investors were largely sitting tight or even doing a little buying. Interviews with several top executives in wealth management suggest that unlike the crashes in 2020 or 2008, high-net-worth investors were feeling less pressure to sell over the past week. Some started buying Friday afternoon. And many used the lower prices as an opportunity to do some tax-loss harvesting and estate planning. Here’s what advisors to the wealthy say their clients are responding to the market roller coaster. Like most Americans, wealthy investors are feeling a wide range of emotions from the market and policy turmoil. They’re split down political lines, which shape their economic outlook and investment impulses, according to Mathews. “Our job is to take the emotion out of it and try to level-set,” Mathews said. “Most of the time we’re psychologists.” That helped clients to avoid making big trades or financial decisions based on feeling over logic. Mathews said many UBS clients started trimming their stocks and “de-risking” in January. While markets were soaring in the first two months of the year on hopes for the new Trump administration, many of the wealthy were selling and adding cash. Their large cash cushion helped keep them calmer during the past week’s market turbulence and provided funding for later buying opportunities. “There is a lot of dry powder on the sidelines right now,” he said. “Some of the really wealthy clients were thinking [in January], ‘I made a lot of money, it’s been easy for two years in a row and everything was working exactly how we wanted it to. But in 2025, we’re going to start to see some different things pop up so why not take profits now?’” Many clients were buying on Friday, when the Dow dropped 2,200 points, Mathews said. “Friday afternoon, we saw a lot of buying,” he said. “Clients were asking whether they should buy individual stocks that have been punished that they always wanted to get into, or just go ahead and buy the indexes.” For the most part, wealthy clients have stopped trading, waiting for more clarity on policy and markets. Others added money to private equity, which is less volatile on a day-to-day basis but still faces challenges with a lack of IPOs and liquidity. “The question is exits,” Mathews said. “How are you going to get exits and when? Our wealthier clients have time horizons of 10 or 15 years to get their money back, so they’re not as concerned.” Gold is another big theme among wealthy investors. While it’s come off its highs over the past week, gold has been seen as a safe haven even before the week’s market gyrations. “We’re getting a lot of questions about gold,” Mathews said. “Everybody is interested in having a piece of gold as a hedge right now.” Mathews said one client summed up the broader dilemma for investors this week with a property analogy: “He said, ‘It’s like I wanted to buy a property that had been $10 million and it goes to $8 million. It’s cheaper, and I still like it. But now it could also go to $5 million. So what do I do?’” During market shocks, Lucina guides wealthy clients according to her “three Ps” — don’t panic, don’t predict and engage in planning. She said Northern Trust makes sure clients always have plenty of cash and other liquid holdings on hand when markets fall, so they don’t have to sell at a loss. These so-called “portfolio reserves” can provide cash for spending when they need daily liquidity. “We’ve been telling them forever to plan for volatility, which is inevitable,” she said. “They can pull from those risk-off assets to fund their lifestyle.” Lucina said her clients didn’t make big moves to buy last week. But she said some clients who had just sold their businesses and excess liquidity started putting some of the money into the market. “Some of them are starting to deploy it into equities,” she said. The main advice Northern Trust has given clients over the past week is to engage in estate and tax planning, she said. The market slide created three main planning opportunities. First, lower asset prices make grantor retained annuity trusts, or GRATs, more attractive. Many clients were creating or “freezing” GRATs while stocks were down to create tax savings when transferring wealth to family members. She also said more wealthy clients were doing Roth conversions, or transferring funds from a pre-tax retirement account to a Roth IRA. Converting at market lows allows investors to pay taxes on the lower valuations and hedge the risk of higher tax rates in the future. Finally, she said, clients were tax-loss harvesting, or selling their losers and using tax losses to offset investment gains later in the year. “What we found is that when we were able to turn the conversation more towards planning opportunities, people feel more in control,” Lucina said. “We’re getting less fear from our clients right now and more, ‘Should we be buying?’” Fleissig said. Fleissig said the fear levels from his clients didn’t feel anything like 2000, 2008 or 2020. Family office clients, or those with $100 million or more, were “layering in” to the market and buying. Clients were also interested in structured products, which can offer protection on the downside but strong upside. “In times like these, it’s our ability to find asymmetric opportunities, like opportunities in private markets or structured products that investors look to us for,” he said. One warning: private credit. Wealthy investors and family offices have poured into private credit in recent years, leading to a flood of capital chasing deals with less regard for risk or returns. “I think a lot of deals in private credit are extremely covenant-light,” Fleissig said. Katsnelson noted wealthy investors tend to hold more cash at the end of the first quarter for tax payments. This year, the cash is serving the added purpose of buffering them from stock and bond losses. “That timing has been helpful,” Katsnelson said. “And people are asking whether this is a good time to start buying and becoming more aggressive.” For the most part, investors across the wealth spectrum are avoiding major changes in their portfolio, he said. Yet smaller investors, those with $2 million or $3 million, and those who are close to retirement were feeling the volatility more than the ultra-wealthy clients. That latter cohort has more investments in alternatives, like private equity and direct deals, which don’t price on a daily basis. “Mainly people are venting,” Katsnelson said. “They have direct exposure, and we’re there to listen.”",

    "title": "U.S. cyber defenders shaken by Trump's attack on their former boss",
    "article_text": "The people tasked with keeping the country safe from foreign government hackers and cybercriminal gangs say they feel like they’re under attack, not from their usual adversaries but from the administration they work under. President Donald Trump’s Wednesday ordercalling for a Justice Department investigation into Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has sent fresh shock waves through that agency’s hallways, according to five employees who spoke with NBC News. Each spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The order comes as the White House is downsizing the agency for at least the third time in three months. “It’s a really tough time for all of us right now,” said one employee. “Every day feels somehow more bizarre than the last. It is incredibly difficult to focus on our mission.” Krebs, whom Trump appointed as CISA’s inaugural director during his first term, quickly built the agency into the country’s front-line digital defender of critical systems. But he also emerged as a surprising counterpoint to the president, particularly around his efforts to advance false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. The order Trump signed cites Krebs’ insistence that there is no credible evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite Trump’s false but often-repeated claims. Also signed by the homeland security secretary, it directs the attorney general to “take all appropriate action to review” Krebs’ activities. Employees who spoke to NBC News largely believe Trump’s action was politically motivated. Trump also revoked Krebs’ security clearance. “I feel so sickened by this. It’s a shocking abuse of power,” one said. Trump’s moves on Krebs and CISA come as the U.S. faces mounting cybersecurity challenges, most notably from China, which has in just the last two years shown its capability to penetrate deep intosensitive U.S. infrastructure as well as government systems, federal officials say. For-profit hackers have also turned ransomware into abillion dollarcriminal enterprise that shuts downhospitals,schoolsand manybusinesses. Republicans quickly coalesced around Trump’s election claims and politicized the agency’s efforts to coordinate with technology companies to secure elections, including how tocounter the spread of foreign propaganda. Under Krebs, CISA coordinated a unified response from government agencies and states disputing false claims of election fraud, many of which Trump and his allies used to justify his attempts to stay in office.Trump fired Krebstwo weeks after that election. “This EO targeting former director Krebs seems based in personal vendetta, and no American should be comfortable with that,” another CISA employee said. Krebs declined to comment. On Wednesday evening, he reposted to X the message he first published in 2020 after Trump fired him: “Honored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow. #Protect2020.” The Trump administration is also currently purging CISA’s workforce, according to emails to staff obtained by NBC News. The Department of Homeland Security, CISA’s parent agency, sent a memo Monday evening that encouraged employees to retire early or take a buyout package by Monday. A second email, sent by CISA acting director Bridget Bean, reiterated that offer. Trump has nominated a permanent director, Sean Plankey, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. A CISA spokesperson declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. A DHS spokesperson declined to share how many employees it expected to cut, but said in an emailed statement: “Every dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe.” Those buyout offers echo a round of emails that DHS sent to CISA employees in February. A DHS spokesperson told NBC News that month it had also cut more than 130 employees who had probationary status and that it deemed “non-mission critical personnel.” On Sunday, before the Krebs news and as rumors spread that the second round of buyout offers was going out, Jen Easterly, who succeeded Krebs as CISA’s director under President Joe Biden, posted to LinkedIn about why the cuts could hurt U.S. security. “Degrading the capability and capacity of the federal cyber ecosystem—whether by laying off hundreds of highly talented cyber professionals at America’s cyber defense agency or by decapitating the highly effective, nonpartisan, and principled leadership of America’s most important technical intelligence agency—will only make Americans less safe and more vulnerable to our adversaries,” Easterly wrote. One CISA employee said the repeated staff reductions hampered the agency’s ability to secure critical infrastructure, which often relies on experts who are familiar with highly specialized computer programs and operating systems. “The cuts that happened initially have already severely degraded our capacity to defend critical infrastructure,” the employee said. “The cuts that may come — I don’t know what the numbers are going to look like — but they without a doubt will further degrade our ability to defend critical infrastructure.“ Trump’s executive order also suspended the security clearances of employees at the cybersecurity company where Krebs works, SentinelOne. SentinelOnereleased a statementThursday evening it would “actively cooperate in any review of security clearances held by any of our personnel” and that it views “the White House as a crucial collaborator.” It did not defend Krebs. Another CISA employee said Trump’s decision to target SentinelOne could start a chilling effect where employees feel pressured to ignore software vulnerabilities that might upset the president. “Will there be pressure to not have a public vulnerability in a car company if the CEO is close to the president?” the employee said. “It’s like Iraq war intelligence. We’re only going to say what they want to be the message, rather than telling the country about real threat.”",

    "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs dangled a person over a hotel balcony, indictment and lawsuits allege",
    "article_text": "A federal indictment accuses Sean “Diddy” Combs of dangling someone over a balcony in an allegation that is strikingly similar to an encounter alleged in separate lawsuits two women filed against the music mogul. Combs, 55, is charged in a five-count indictment withsex trafficking, racketeeringand transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records and one of the most prominent figures in the music industry, is being detained in a jail in Brooklyn, New York, until his trial, which is scheduled to start next month. Sign up for the “Diddy on Trial” newsletter for key developments and analysis The indictment has been amended three times with new allegations or charges, most recently last weekto include an additional charge eachof sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The second amended indictment, filed last month, alleged that Combs forced some of his employees towork long hours with little sleepand coerced an employee into having sex. Thefirst amended indictmentaccused Combs of having coerced two additional women into sex acts and of having “dangled a victim over an apartment balcony.” He has pleaded not guilty to all of the allegations and charges, except for those filed last week. He is scheduled to enter a plea on those counts April 25. The criminal indictment waspreceded by a civil suitfiled in 2023 by his former longtime girlfriend, model and singer Casandra Ventura, 38. She alleged in the lawsuit that Combs had dangled a friend of hers over the balcony of a 17th-floor hotel suite in or around August 2015. Ventura alleged in the suit, which she and Combssettled privately within a daywithout his admitting any wrongdoing, that he subjected her to “savage” beatings, in which he punched, kicked and stomped on her, leaving her with bruises, burst lips and black eyes. She also claimed in the document that he plied her with drugs and forced her to have sex with male sex workers while he masturbated and recorded them. Ventura’s suit and the indictment said Combs referred to the drug-fueled encounters as “freak offs.” During some freak offs, the suit said, Combs would become extremely intoxicated and violent, hitting Ventura in the presence of the male sex workers. The original indictment referred only to Victim-1, whose accusations closely align with those in Ventura’s suit. Ventura alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2023 that in the middle of a surprise dinner for her 29th birthday around August 2015, Combs insisted she leave the party to go to a hotel to participate in a freak off. When Ventura told him that she did not want to go, Combs had her cornered by his security staff to force her to leave with him, the suit said. After the alleged freak off, it said, the two went back to her hotel room where some of her friends were hanging out. While he was severely intoxicated, Combs lifted one of her friends and dangled the friend over the balcony of the 17th-floor suite, causing Ventura and her friends to fear Combs’ “erratic behavior,” it said. Ventura was heavily sedated because of the drugs she took to participate in the freak off and was unable to respond to Combs’ “terrifying behavior,” according to the suit. Ventura’s attorney declined to comment for this article. In a different lawsuit filed against Combs last year in Los Angeles, Bryana Bongolan alleges there was a balcony encounter that she said occurred in 2016 instead of 2015, as Ventura said in her suit. The federal indictment did not include a date or any other details except that the victim was female. The two lawsuits also differed about whether Ventura responded to the alleged dangling. Whereas Ventura said she was heavily sedated and unable to respond, Bongolan said in her lawsuit that when Ventura saw Combs dangling Bongolan over the balcony, she shouted at Combs to stop. Bongolan, 33, said in her lawsuit that she met Combs through her friendship with Ventura and that early on or about Sept. 26, 2016, she was sleeping in Ventura’s apartment when Combs began shouting and banging on the door. The suit says he entered the apartment and “advanced on her” while she was on the balcony. “He grabbed her, turned her back to his chest, and molested her by groping her breasts as she yelled to be left alone,” the suit alleges. Bongolan, who is 4-foot-11 and weighed less than 100 pounds at the time, tried to resist Combs by throwing her weight back while he lifted her up on the banister of the 17th-floor balcony, but he “easily overpowered her,” the suit says, adding that he lifted her up higher and over the balcony. Ventura emerged from her bedroom to see Combs holding Bongolan over the balcony and screamed for him to stop, the lawsuit says. Combs moved Bongolan from the balcony and slammed her onto patio furniture, including a table, it says. Bongolan’s complaint says that she was an aspiring fashion designer when she met Combs and that she completed numerous design projects for him from 2016 to 2018. Bongolan’s attorney, James Nikraftar, did not reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment for this article. He has previously told NBC News that Bongolan would not be speaking publicly. Representatives for Combs did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In astatement to Rolling Stoneafter Bongolan’s suit was filed, a legal representative for Combs denied her allegations. “Anyone has the right to file a lawsuit, regardless of the evidence they may or may not have,” the representative told publication. “Since last year, Ms. Bongolan has expressed an intention to sue Mr. Combs and has sought legal representation to pursue her claims. “Mr. Combs firmly denies these serious allegations and remains confident they will ultimately be proven baseless.” Bongolan is seeking a jury trial and more than $10 million in damages for sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.More than 50 civil lawsuitshave been filed against Combs, accusing him of sexual misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations. Jury selection for Combs’ criminal trial is scheduled to begin at the end of the month, and opening statements are scheduled to begin May 12.",

    "title": "How one Maine high school became the center of Trump's war on trans student athletes",
    "article_text": "It started with a track meet. A transgender girl on the Greely High School track team in Maine had won a pole-vaulting event, and a state politician took to Facebook to complain. The lawmaker not only circulated the girl’s name but included a side-by-side image of her competing in the boy’s division two years before. As the Feb. 17 post went viral in conservative media, it drew the attention of the Trump administration, which had, in an executive order,effectively bannedtransgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Donald Trump confronted Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, demanding that her state comply with the order. She hasn’t agreed. And the school district hasn’t backed down. Now Greely High School is at the center of a conflict over Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The Trump administration has threatened to pull all federal education funding — over$200 millionper year — if the state doesn’t comply by Friday. Outsiders see the showdown as an important test of how far the administration will go to force states to follow executive orders. Meanwhile, students and families at Greely High School are anxiously awaiting their fate.",

    "title": "Tensions arise over Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to bring Rep. Elise Stefanik back into the fold",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trumpwithdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nominationto be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she was given private assurances that she would not only rejoin the House GOP leadership team, but also reclaim her coveted spot on the House Intelligence Committee, according to two Republican sources with knowledge of the deliberations. Two weeks later, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is still scrambling to figure out how to deliver on the promise to place her back on the committee, even after the move was announced publicly Wednesday. The conundrum for Johnson is that he has to either remove a Republican who currently sits on the high-profile Intelligence Committee, which could cause strife among existing members, or be forced to change House rules to add a member. House rules dictate that the committee may be made up of no more than 25 members with a maximum of 14 from one party, which is how many Republicans are currently on the panel. Adding a member would increase the size of the committee, which some members have already complained is too bloated. It could also force Johnson to allow House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to add another Democrat. In a statement to NBC News, Johnson’s office said the speaker and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., are committed to finding a solution to accommodate Stefanik in the coming weeks. “The Speaker will be working with Chairman Crawford and HPSCI members to get Rep. Stefanik reintegrated into the Intelligence Committee in the coming weeks,” a spokesman for Johnson said. “They both look forward to having her expertise back on the committee.” Stefanik’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The awkward situation has created tension between Johnson and Stefanik, on the influential panel and within the broader GOP conference. Adding to the drama, three senior House Republicans say Stefanik strong-armed Johnson into publicly announcing her new leadership arrangement ahead of a key budget vote in the House for which her support was sorely needed. Johnson has yet to signal his intentions to the Intelligence Committee members, leaving several worried whether their spots could be on the chopping block. In private conversations hashing out Stefanik’s new arrangement, a source familiar with the discussion said, Johnson floated several Republicans whom he could ask to step down. They include Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, who is the most junior Republican on the panel; Rep. Claudia Tenney, who, like Stefanik, is from New York; and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, who chairs the powerful Financial Services Committee. Johnson appointed Fallon and Tenney to the panel on Jan. 16. But despite Johnson’s initial suggestions, no decisions have been made, and no members have been approached about whether they’d be willing to forfeit their spots, according to multiple GOP sources. “I think it’s a fluid process,” said a House Republican who is familiar with the discussions on the panel. “I think they’re trying to see if they bump somebody off to make room for her or whether they add two more — add a Democrat and a Republican.” The lawmaker opposed adding more members, saying the Intelligence Committee had already been “expanded twice in the last two years.” Johnson needs to tread carefully, as his past picks for the Intelligence Committee, which provides oversight of the National Intelligence Director’s Office and the CIA, have landed him in hot water with some members of the conference. Johnson upset moderates in the last Congress when he passed over more pragmatic members, like Stephanie Bice, R-Okla.; Zach Nunn, R-Iowa; and Laurel Lee, R-Fla., and instead named two controversial firebrands to the panel, Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. And Johnson this year booted the panel’s former chairman, Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who wasn’t well-liked in Trump’s orbit. The consternation over how to accommodate Stefanik is just one example of the disruption Trump caused bypulling her nomination. And it’s a situation she may be using to her advantage, asserting her close relationship with Trump and the fact that her vote is crucial for Republicans in the narrowly divided House. On Wednesday, House leaders were preparing to take a procedural step toward adopting a budget resolution to advance Trump’s legislative agenda. At that point, Johnson had yet to announce Stefanik’s new role, even though there were behind-the-scenes talks. Stefanik, who hadn’t voted in the House since Trump withdrew her nomination on March 27, made the White House aware of the situation as officials were calling to whip budget votes, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Under pressure from Stefanik, Johnson decided to greenlight a public announcement about her new arrangement, the sources said. Stefanik then showed up to the Capitol for the key procedural vote, but she withheld her vote until the very last second, making her decisive in putting the measure over the finish line. Whether it was intentional or not, the maneuver was an unmistakable reminder to Stefanik’s colleagues that they need her vote, which is why Trump asked her to stay in Congress. Moments after the vote, Stefanik — who gave up her post as House GOP conference chair when she was nominated for the ambassadorship — publicly announced her new role: chair of the House Republican leadership, a post that will come with additional staff and resources. Stefanik also announced she will return to her positions on the Intelligence, Education and Workforce, and Armed Services committees. Stefanik and Johnson then issued a joint release about the news 2½ hours later. Some top Republicans, including other members on Johnson’s leadership team, said they were caught off guard by the announcement. Stefanik’s allies, however, note that Trump made it clear that he wants her to have a plum landing spot as quickly as possible and argue she has been nothing but the ultimate team player throughout the entire saga. There’s still a question of what kind of leadership role, if any, Stefanik would assume on the Intelligence Committee. In the last Congress, she had been one of its most senior members. Had she not been tapped for the U.N. post, she would have been in contention to lead the panel after Johnson ousted Turner. Johnson named Crawfordas the new chairmanand made Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., the vice chair. But Stefanik would have more seniority on the panel than Kelly, “which would make her vice chair, technically,” said the House lawmaker familiar with the deliberations about the panel. And subcommittee gavels have been awarded already for the 119th Congress, the person said.",

    "title": "Why some are accusing Trump of manipulating stock markets",
    "article_text": "By Maria Aspan A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.Spencer Platt/Getty Images North Americahide caption Wall Street has been whipsawed formore than a weekby President Trump's every word about tariffs. Now he's facing accusations of using his power to deliberately manipulate the markets. The scrutiny started with a tale of two social-media posts. On Wednesday, shortly after the U.S. stock market opened, Trumpposted on his Truth Social networkin all caps: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\" Less thanfour hoursafter his post, Trump said on Truth Social thathe would pausethe harshest of his tariffs on most countries. Stocks immediatelyskyrocketed in relief, with the Dow closing up almost 3,000 points — meaning that any investors who had followed Trump's advice in the morning and bought into the stock market right away would have made quite a bit of money by the end of the day. Prior to his post, share prices had been plummetingfor days, as fears mounted about the economic damage Trump's new trade policies could cause. Powerful investors and billionaire business leaders hadincreasingly gone publicairing their worries about the new tariffs, and the resulting financial panic. By Wednesday afternoon, Trump seemed to hear them when he hit pause. Now some Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts are calling for investigations into whether Trump was attempting to deliberately manipulate the markets, or to enable others to trade on insider information. Sens. Adam Schiff, Democrat from California, and Ruben Gallego, Democrat from Arizona,sent a letterto the White House on Wednesday, requesting \"an urgent inquiry into whether President Trump, his family, or other members of the administration engaged in insider trading or other illegal financial transactions, informed by advanced knowledge\" of his tariff policy changes. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat from Massachusetts,also calledfor an investigation, asking on the floor of Congress if this was \"corruption in plain sight.\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai accused Democrats of \"playing partisan games,\" and tells NPR that Trump's early-morning post was merely meant to calm investors' fears. \"\"It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security,\" he wrote in an emailed statement. George W. Bush's former chief ethics lawyer says such statements would have led to firing But the criticisms of Trump's two Truth Social posts aren't just limited to his partisan opponents. \"We can't have senior public officials — including the president – talking about stock prices and where to buy or to sell at the same time as they are making and announcing decisions that have a dramatic impact on stock prices,\" says Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, who previously served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. If anyone in the Bush administration had made similar public statements urging people to buy or sell stocks, Painter added, \"that person probably would [have been] fired.\" Painter did not accuse President Trump of market manipulation: \"We don't have clear evidence of that here,\" he tells NPR. But he pointed out that the president already has a track record ofpushing the boundaries, at the very least. \"Financial conflicts of interests for President Trumphave been a concernsince he was first elected in 2016,\" Painter says, adding that the problems today are even greater. Trump'sembrace of the crypto industry, for example, has drawnongoing scrutiny: The president, who has a growing personal portfolio of cryptocurrency-related businesses, has appointedpro-crypto Cabinet officialsand promised the industry much friendlier regulation. It's up to the SEC to investigate accusations of insider trading Despite the wide-ranging calls for investigations into Trump's social-media posts on Wednesday, Painter and others aren't expecting to see much happen. The Republican lawmakers who control both the House and Senate have shown little interest in picking fights with Trump. Nor do ethics experts expect much movement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigates accusations of insider trading. On Wednesday, the Senatevoted to confirmTrump nomineePaul Atkinsto lead the SEC. And Trump in Februarysigned an executive orderclaiming more power over independent regulatory agencies, including the SEC. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

    "title": "Supreme Court says Trump officials should help return wrongly deported Maryland man",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, Jennifer Vasquez Sura (center), listens during a news conference to discuss her husband's arrest and deportation on Capitol Hill on April 9.Alex Wong/Getty Imageshide caption The Supreme Court  has ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return to the United States of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly taken to El Salvador and remains in custody there. In a brief, unsigned decision issued Thursday, the court sided with a District Court judge who had ordered Abrego Garcia brought back to the U.S. \"The order properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\" the Supreme Court said in its ruling. The decision was a rare win for those challenging the administration's deportation orders. But it also left several key specifics unanswered for right now. The court said it was sending the case back to the district court judge to clarify one aspect of her decision \"with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order. Since President Trump took office in January, a top priority has been to remove those he believes are a threat to Americans' safety. In this case, though,the administration initially admitted the deportation was a mistake. Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran citizen, has lived in Maryland for almost 15 years. While he initially entered the U.S. without being granted legal status, a federal judge in 2019 granted him protection from being deported, because of concerns for his safety if he were to return to El Salvador. The 2019 proceedings stemmed from uncorroborated allegations that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump Administration has since designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. But an immigration judge ultimately found that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation and instead found that Abrego Garcia's life would be endangered if he returned to El Salvador. Since then, Abrego Garcia has lived and worked legally in Maryland, and has had no criminal record. But in March, he was on his way home from work in Baltimore, with his five-year-old son in the backseat, when he was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. They told him his legal \"status had changed,\" and he was arrested on the spot, as his wife, an American citizen, raced to the site to prevent ICE agents from turning over the couple's child to Child Protective Services. A few days later, Abrego Garcia was placed on a flight with other men alleged by the Trump administration to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Ina separate, but related, caseout of Washington, D.C., the Supreme Court on Mondaydismisseda judge's ruling that temporarily blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Unlike the challengers in that case, Abrego Garcia was not removed using the Alien Enemies Act. Still, the court's ruling left open questions as to how deportees who have already been removed from the U.S., like Abrego Garcia, are supposed to challenge their deportations from outside the country. The administration has avoided answering judges' questions as to the number of individuals deported, how many planes have left the United States or the whereabouts of specific individuals. Abrego Garcia, along with the other deportees, is being detained in a Salvadoran mega-prison, but his wife has said she has not heard from him since he was removed from the U.S. In exchange for detaining the deportees in what one judge has called \"one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,\" the Salvadoran government is receiving $6 million from the U.S. government. Abrego Garcia, along with his wife and child, are contesting his removal from the U.S. The family argues that his deportation was unlawful given his protected status, which specifically barred him from being sent back to El Salvador without clearing some procedural hurdles first. Indeed, a Justice Department lawyerconcededin court that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, or as he put it, an \"administrative error.\" Last Friday federal district court judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to preserve the status quo by releasing Abrego Garcia from the Salvadoran prison and returning him to the U.S., and to do it no later than 11:59 PM the following Monday. When the administration asked the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to pause that order, a three-judge panel unanimously declined. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee, had strong words for the administration. \"There is no question that the government screwed up here,\" he wrote, adding that \"the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.\" Regarding the government's admission of its mistake, Judge Wilkinson said \"one would also expect the government to do what it can to rectify it. Most of us attempt to undo, to the extent that we can, the mistakes that we have made. But, to the best of my knowledge, the government has not made the attempt here.\" In an appeal to the Supreme Court, however, the administration said in its brief that the lawyer who admitted the error does not speak for the administration. In fact the lawyer was placed on leave after making the admission. And the administration continued to push the theory that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, despite an immigration judge finding otherwise in 2019. Separate and apart from that, the government argued that because Abrego Garcia is now outside the U.S., the administration cannot force the government of El Salvador to take any action, let alone to release Abrego Garcia from prison. Finally, the government complained that its blunder didn't authorize Judge Xinis to \"seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America.\" With just hours left before the deadline on Monday, the Supreme Courtgranted a brief administrative stayto give the justices time to consider the matter. There were no noted dissents in Thursday's ruling, which included a statement from the three members of the court's liberal wing that was sharply critical of the administration's arguments. \"The Government's argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,\" wrote Justices Sonia Sotomayorr, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Thursday's ruling shows that there is no predicting what the Supreme Court might do next when it comes to the Trump administration.

    "title": "HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise People drink water from a water fountain in New York City on July 7, 2010.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Health and Human Services is directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make new recommendations on the addition of fluoride to U.S. water sources. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has blamed the fluoridation of water for a number of health problems. The agency is directing the CDC to reconvene an independent panel of 15 health experts to examine the role fluoride plays in water sources and whether it can be detrimental to public health, Kennedy told The Associated Pressearlier this week, and NPR has confirmed. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin also said his agency would review scientific evidence regarding the health outcomes of the consumption of fluoridated water to determine its safety. \"Without prejudging any outcomes, when this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency's future steps to meet statutory obligations under the Safe Drinking Water Act,\"Zeldin said. The EPA is in charge of ensuring drinking water quality in the United States. Kennedyhas erroneously calledfluoride \"an industrial waste\" and blamed its addition in drinking water on health issues including arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease. Health experts widely agree that fluoride — a common, naturally occurring mineral — at regulated levels is a major benefit to public health. The United States first began adding fluoride to community water supplies in 1945, after a survey showed the mineral was effective in helping reduce dental cavities in children. In 1962, the U.S. Public Health Servicerecommended the addition of fluorideto sources of public drinking water. Alongside successes like vaccinations and the reduction of car crash fatalities, community water fluoridation has been hailed as one of the greatestpublic health achievementsof the 20th century, having saved millions of Americans from costly and painful dental procedures. The CDC says it has reduced cavities by some 25%. The addition of fluoride is not a federal regulation, but recommendations from the CDC could influence state local governments to stop their fluoridation programs. Already, Utah's Republican-controlled legislature haspassed a bill that bans the addition of fluorideto the state's public water sources. Kennedy's desire to see fluoride removed from the public follows othercontroversial health stancesfrom the HHS leader, who has been a leading voice in the debunked conspiracy theory that vaccines cause autism in children. In outlining the agency's plan, the HHS pointed toa studyfrom the National Toxicology Program, which concluded with \"moderate confidence\" that there may be a connection between excess exposure to fluoride and lower IQ in children. The study, however, was based on an exposure to drinking water containing at least 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter —more than twice the 0.7 milligrams per literin the U.S. water supply. While water fluoridation has long sparked controversy over its health concerns, experts say that there are clear benefits to its inclusion, particularly in communities where dental care is scarce. In Calgary, Canada, for example, the city council voted in 2011 to remove fluoride from its water supply. Last year, they decided toreverse courseaftera study showeda significant increase in dental cavities in children. The American Dental Association warned that fluoride cessation in the United States based on conspiracy theories would be a mistake. \"The growing distrust of credible, time-tested, evidence-based science is disheartening,\" ADA President Brett Kessler said in a statement. \"The myths that fluoridated water is harmful and no longer necessary to prevent dental disease is troublesome and reminds me of fictional plots from old movies likeDr. Strangelove\" — referring to the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film that mocked conspiracy theories of the time that linked fluoride with communism. \"When government officials, like Secretary Kennedy, stand behind the commentary of misinformation and distrust peer-reviewed research it is injurious to public health,\" he said, calling for a comprehensive study of fluoride in water. A statement from the White House this week dismissed media reports that pointed out the importance of fluoride in preventing tooth decay, saying that reports of Kennedy's call for a new review on fluoride were a \"thinly veiled attempt to falsely portray the Trump Administration as anti-science and anti-health.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump administration lays out its evidence for deporting activist Mahmoud Khalil",
    "article_text": "By Joel Rose , Adrian Florido Mahmoud Khalil is seen at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York on April 29, 2024.Ted Shaffrey/APhide caption When pressed for evidence about why activist Mahmoud Khalil was arrested by immigration authorities last month, the Department of Homeland Security shared a two-page memofrom Secretary of State Marco Rubio that accuses the Columbia University graduate student of participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" That memois at the heart of theTrump administration's caseagainst Khalil, according to his attorneys. The memo, which was undated, was released by Khalil's legal team on Thursday, the day after the Trump administration submitted it in an immigration court filing. It does not accuse Khalil of any crime. But Rubio writes that Khalil's continued presence in the U.S. would have \"potentially serious adverse foreign consequences, and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Khalil's lawyers say the government has provided no additional evidence to explain the basis for Rubio's conclusion. \"Two pages. That's it,\" said Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil's lawyers. \"There is no there there at all.\" Khalil and his lawyers also dispute the charge of antisemitism. \"What is the antisemitism?\" Van Der Hout said during a Zoom meeting with reporters on Thursday. \"It is criticizing Israel and the United States for the slaughter that is going on in Gaza, in Palestine. That's what this case is about.\" Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security released their evidence against Khalil, who is a lawful permanent resident, after animmigration judge in Louisiana ordered them to do soat a hearing on Tuesday. The Trump administration is trying to deport the 30-year-old, who played a prominent role in campus protests last year. Judge Jamee Comans said she will rule on Friday whether Khalil can be deported or whether he must be freed. Whichever side loses is likely to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Khalil's case has become a crucial test for how far the Trump administration can go to deport noncitizen protesters. Khalil insists he was expressing support for Palestinians in Gaza, while administration officials accuse him of providing support to Hamas terrorism. Khalil's legal case is proceeding on multiple tracks. While an immigration judge considers the evidence against him, Khalid's lawyers are also challenging his March 8 detention in federal court in New Jersey. After Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil on March 8 and shipped him to Louisiana, Rubio said he had revoked Khalil's green card. Rubio relied on a rarely used statute from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that authorizes the secretary of state to personally order the deportation of people whose presence in the U.S. the secretary believes \"would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" But after the Cold War ended, lawmakers modified the law to protect \"beliefs, statements, or associations\" that are \"lawful within the United States,\" and raised the standard for deportation to cases in which the foreigner's presence in the U.S. would \"compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.\" In the memo, Rubio concedes that Khalil's activities would be \"otherwise lawful\" but says that they nevertheless \"undermine U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\" But Khalil's lawyers say Rubio has not shown any evidence to support that conclusion. \"His determination, quote unquote, has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy,\" Van Der Hout said. \"What does he talk about? He talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the United States.\" Days after Khalil was arrested and detained, Homeland Security officials charged him with several additional civil violations. They allege he withheld information on his 2024 green-card application, including his work history with a United Nations relief agency and his involvement with a pro-Palestinian activist group at Columbia University. Khalil's lawyers deny those charges. The government filed additional documents on Wednesday in support of those charges, Van Der Hout said, \"but it is zero to do with the foreign policy charge. And there is zero support for the government's allegations about any misrepresentation.\" Free speech advocates argue that the administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by targeting immigrants for their activism and their political beliefs. Khalil and several other students and scholars who have been detained have challenged their arrests on constitutional grounds. A previous version of this story referenced a March 7 memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In fact, the memo is undated. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The Northeast bet big on offshore wind. Trump wants to halt the industry entirely",
    "article_text": "By Miriam Wasser A crane stacks turbine components at the New London State Pier Terminal. The offshore wind industry has generated millions of dollars for the city and local economy in recent years.Robin Lubbock/WBURhide caption New London, Conn., is an old New England port city that had its heyday about 200 years ago, in a very different economy. \"Ever since the whaling industry, it's been downhill for the city of New London,\" jokes Mayor Michael Passero. \"We went from the richest city in Connecticut to one of the poorest.\" Passero, a Democrat who has been mayor since 2015, grew up in New London. He says people have always talked about the city as full of potential, always on the cusp of something big. And now, finally, in the last few years, it's happening. New London, he says, is starting to boom. Walking through the city's small downtown area, Passero points out new apartment buildings and restaurants — a hip pizzeria, a bustling brewery. He gets a little giddy describing the 60,000 square foot recreation center the city is building. \"Just in the last five or six years, we have put buildings on lots that have been empty for 50 years,\" he says. Passero attributes New London's renaissance to two things: growth in the submarine industry — and the arrival of offshore wind. New London Mayor Michael Passero says offshore wind has contributed to the city's recent renaissance. Behind him sits the State Pier Terminal, the centerpiece of the local industry.Robin Lubbock/WBURhide caption From a dock near downtown, he points to the centerpiece of the local wind industry: a new $310 million pier where enormous turbines are partially assembled and loaded onto boats to be installed offshore. Between redeveloping the pier and serving as the staging ground for two of the country's first big projects, offshore wind has created hundreds of jobs and generated millions for the city and local economy. The question is whether it will last. President Trumpcampaigned on a promiseto \"end\" the U.S. offshore wind industry\"on day one.\"Since he took office the future of the young industry is anything but certain. The stakes are high — for cities like New London, but also for much of the Northeast, which is counting on the growth of offshore wind. States in the region havepoureda lotof moneyinto getting the industry off the ground because they see it as the best way to meet increasing electricity demands and drive economic growth, while also satisfying their climate goals. Under the Biden administration, this approach had a lot of support: Bidenviewed investments in offshore windas a key strategy for tackling climate change, creating jobs and boosting domestic manufacturing. The administration worked to make the permitting process for projects in federal watersfaster and more efficient, and it supportedlucrative tax creditsin the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to help wind developers build projects and entice manufacturers to set up shop in the U.S. Despite some significanteconomic headwinds, the industry finally got off the ground during Biden's term. By the time he left office,11 large-scale projectsoff the East Coast had full federal approval, several had started construction and the country's first utility-scale project wasfully up and running. Meanwhile, a supply chain for manufacturing turbine parts, underwater cables and specialized ships had started to take root in the U.S. The American Clean Power Association, a clean energy trade group, issued a report last summer finding that companies have announced about$16 billionworth of investment in offshore wind manufacturing, shipbuilding and port redevelopment projects — work that could support 56,000 jobs by the end of the decade. \"Those tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment are potentially at risk now,\" says Kris Ohleth, director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a think tank that supports the industry. Trump has railed against offshore wind for decades. He's described turbines as \"horrible\" and falsely claimed they cancause cancer. He's also said the industry is killing whales, though scientists say there'sno evidence of that. On his first day back in office, the president signed anexecutive actionthat paused all federal permitting for new offshore wind projects and set in motion a broad review of what he says are the industry's environmental and economic harms. \"This has had a tremendous chilling effect on the offshore wind sector,\" Ohleth says. \"There is a high degree of uncertainty and a high degree of chaos that is leading to real challenges and backsliding for the sector.\" Wind turbines are partially assembled at the New London State Pier Terminal. Soon, they'll be loaded on boats and taken to the offshore wind farm site for installation.Robin Lubbock/WBURhide caption Since late January, several wind developershavedelayedor otherwisestepped backfrom projects in Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey. At least one company hascanceled its plans to build a factorymanufacturing underwater power cables for the industry. Wind opponents have filed a flurry ofnewlawsuits. And there's the lingering threat that Congress will rescind the Biden-era tax credits the industry relies on. Not everyone is lamenting this slowdown. Local windopposition groupsfromMainetoNew Jerseyhave praised the administration's actions, as have conservative organizations that support Trump's plans for repealing various clean energy tax credits in favor of expanded fossil fuel production. \"I feel a lot of compassion for people who thought that they were going to have an industry and then may not have that same level of demand, but I don't think that it's a wise use of tax dollars,\" says Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Furchtgott-Roth calls wind turbines \"unsightly\" and says they make the country \"less competitive,\" arguing the electricity they generate is intermittent and too expensive. She believes the Northeast should meet its growing electricity needs by building more pipelines to bring in natural gas from other parts of the country. \" We have so much natural gas. We have so much oil,\" she says. But many energy experts say this is unlikely. \" We're not going to be building new pipelines into New England,\" says Dennis Wamsted, a Boston-based analyst with the non-partisan Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \"I mean, nothing's impossible, but it would be very controversial.\" Many Northeast states have imposed regulations thatmake it hardto build new pipelines precisely because they want more renewable energy instead, Wamsted says. Even without those restrictions, building pipelines in the region would still be challenging and costly because the Northeast is so densely populated. Plus, he says, the region has some of the best conditions for offshore wind in the world. \"You have this offshore resource, which you can pull in through a transmission line,\" he says. \"You haven't disturbed a whole bunch of people and you have that power coming right into the demand center.\" New England, alone, expects toneedat least 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2050; that's about equal to the entire capacity of the current regional grid. Back in New London, Mayor Passero stands at the edge of a dock near the downtown; the giant turbine components at State Pier are clearly visible across the water. Despite the current uncertainty, he believes offshore wind will eventually supply a significant amount of energy to the Northeast, simply because states want to tap this giant source of renewable power right off the coast. Construction is still advancing on a handful of large-scale wind farms along the East Coast. One of those projects, Revolution Wind, is being staged from the new pier in New London. When it's completed, another project is set to begin. Whether that happens, and whether more projects come up behind it, remains to be seen. But Passero has his fingers crossed. \"I'm optimistic that this is just a hiccup,\" he says. \"I also don't believe that we have an energy future in this country unless we harness the offshore wind.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Tariff chaos sends some drivers racing to buy, while others pump the brakes",
    "article_text": "Camila Domonoske A pickup truck is raised for display at a car dealership in Alhambra, California, on March 27, 2025. After President Trump announced significant tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, automaker stocks fell sharply. But sales at dealerships rose, at least in the short-term, as buyers try to get ahead of the anticipated price spikes in the coming months.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The threat of tariffs has triggered something of a gold rush on America's auto lots. Automakers are offering big discounts and some buyers are racing to shop before prices rise. But it's a boom driven by anxiety that also contains some warning signs for the economy — and for budget-minded shoppers in particular. Kyra Nay, a children's librarian in Ohio, was planning to buy a bigger car for her growing family — but not until next year. Then tariff announcements out of the White House sent her scrambling to move faster. \"With the tariffs and so much of the uncertainty about that, we just decided that we couldn't wait any longer,\" she says. She and her husband ran out to buy a Honda CR-V in late March, and they weren't the only ones racing to lock in pre-tariff prices. \"The dealership waspacked,\"Nay says. The car data group Cox Automotive hadexpecteda sleepy March; instead, the spike in sales after Trump's March 26 announcement of auto-specific tariffs drove the hottest new car salesin four years. Economists at Cox Automotive now predict the rush might last a couple of months. But eventually, tariff-driven price increases would cause sales to slow. You can see signs of that potential slowdown in choices made by drivers like Jennifer Jarvis, a pharmacist in Michigan. She, too, has been thinking of buying a new family SUV. But she and her husband changed their minds. Instead of racing to a dealership, they replaced the transmission in their old minivan, hoping to squeeze another 100,000 miles out of it. \"The idea of trying to buy a car in this market and the tariffs and everything,\" she says. \"I mean, we're going to be driving this probably until it needs either another transmission or it falls off the road.\" Other shoppers told NPR they're delaying plans to buy a vehicle because they're worried about their jobs being at risk, or they are trying to build savings in case of a recession. Some shoppers are hurrying up, others are stepping back. Meanwhile, the tariffs themselves keep changing. Yesterday President Trump puta 90-day pauseon many of his newly announced tariffs, but the ones most important to the auto industry remain. That includes a 25%tariff on imported carsthat kicked in last week, plans to impose tariffs oncar parts, and 25% tariffs on thesteel and aluminumthat go into vehicles. Add it all up and this is just a weird time for the auto market. But weird times are not new to the auto industry, says Scott Kunes, the COO of the Wisconsin-based Kunes Auto and RV Group. \"It kind of feels like we're back in that early 2020 era when COVID was just starting to hit and nobody quite knew what was happening,\" he says. For now, demand is up and there are good deals to be had on new cars. Manufacturers are offering significant incentives and the much-discussed tariff price hikes, for the most part, haven't materialized yet. Last month, auto sales were the strongest in four years, as buyers tried to \"beat the tariffs.\" Dealerships have been leaning into this moment in their advertising, as Fisher Honda Acura in Boulder, Colo., did in this advertisement posted online last week.Fisher Honda Acura viaFacebookhide caption \"All the vehicles that are currently on the ground or in port are not affected by tariffs,\" Kunes says, pointing out that dealers like to keep about two to three months' worth of vehicles on their lots — a built-in buffer. Yet in the long run, if tariffs stick, analysts say that car prices would likely go up by thousands of dollars. The exact amount would vary based on manufacturer and model. Kunes is optimistic about his own business; he says that both dealers and automakers are resilient and can adapt to whatever happens. But some buyers, especially those on a budget, will have a harder time, he says. \"I think one thing that nobody's really thinking about or talking about is the used car market,\" he says. Kunes sells both new and used cars, and notes that tariffs on new cars will increase demand for used cars, while tariffs on parts will push up the cost to repair them. So tariffs, indirectly, will drive up used car prices. In fact, they already have. According tothe latest report by iSeeCars, used car prices had been stable for the last six months but started rising in March. Prices for popular used cars could rise by $890 to $5,169 if the post-tariff market resembles the early COVID market, the used car listing site predicts. That's on top of already-steep prices that are still showing the effects of the COVID-era supply chain disruptions that crimped new car supply several years ago. Today, Kunes says it's hard to find a \"good, reliable\" used vehicle that's still under warranty for less than $25,000. And the lowest-cost cars that used to run around $5,000 are now more like $8,000 to 10,000, he says. Connecticut car shopper Angelica DeLeon is facing that daunting used vehicle market now. When she was unemployed during the COVID pandemic, her car was repossessed. Since then, she's been relying on Ubers and her family and friends to get around. \"That's really been a struggle,\" she says, pointing out that public transit is spotty where she lives. She's been saving money for two years to buy a vehicle, and a few months ago she got a full-time admin job. Now she's prepared to buy a reliable car in the $10,000 range — if she can find one. \"Recently I'm looking at the prices, and I notice that they shot up,\" she says. She's been searching for used Subarus and finding options over her budget with \"like 135,000 miles, 165,000 miles,\" she says. That's too much wear and tear for her to trust. What, she asks, are you supposed to do \"when you're making the minimum and you do need a car?\" That question was already a pressing one for people across the country. And the tariff chaos is only making it worse. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Ashley Lopez A Social Security Administration office in Washington, DC, March 26. On Wednesday, the Social Security Administration backtracked on its announced plan to require in-person visits to offices.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration isfurther backing offthe in-person requirements it announced for Americans seeking services at the Social Security Administration that were set to go into effect Monday. Liz Huston, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday that telephone services will continue for people seeking services through the agency. \"President Trump has repeatedly promised to protect Social Security and uproot waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government,\" she said. \"The Social Security anti-fraud team has worked around the clock in person to improve technological capabilities and they are now able to identify fraud on claims filed over the telephone.\" Social Security officials firstannouncedlast month that people filing claims or seeking benefits would have to travel in-person to a local field office, if they were unable to use the agency's online verification system. The policy would have effectively eliminated widely used telephone services for many beneficiaries. These changes were met with concerns from advocates for seniors and people with disabilities, as well as lawmakers. Dozens of Democratic members of Congresssent a letterto agency leaders asking them to reconsider the change because it would \"create additional barriers\" for people seeking services — \"particularly for those who live far from an office.\" The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington advocating for \"economic justice,\" recently published an analysis thatfoundthe travel requirement would have amounted to a \"45-mile trip for some 6 million seniors.\" According to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak generally about the Trump administration's position, the Social Security Administration reversed course on these requirements because the anti-fraud team \"implemented new technological capabilities so quickly\" that the agency can now \"perform anti-fraud checks on all claims filed over the phone.\" These technological improvements, the official said in a statement, will be able to flag abnormal behavior in a person's account and then those individuals who were flagged would be required to travel in-person for verification. In a statement, Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, called this reversal \"a victory for Social Security beneficiaries across the country.\" \"The Trump administration did not change the policy out of the goodness of their hearts,\" he said. \"They responded to public pressure. This is a victory for advocacy on the grassroots and national level, by and on behalf of the millions of seniors who depend on phone service from the Social Security Administration.\" \"The Trump administration has been busy erecting barriers for people simply trying to access their earned benefits. We are glad this one barrier has fallen.\" The Social Security Administration is currently undergoing massive changes – including widespread layoffs, regional office closures and general restructuring of duties across the agency. These changeshave worried advocatesabout access to services that many of the country's seniors rely on. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Scott Horsley Falling gasoline prices helped keep inflation in check last month.  AAA says the average price of regular gas nationwide is $3.22.Jim Watson/AFPhide caption Inflation eased last month — but the fallout from President Trump's trade war threatens to put upward pressure on prices in the month to come. Consumer prices in March were up 2.4% from a year ago, according toa report Thursdayfrom the Labor Department. The price index actually fell slightly between February and March, as gasoline prices dropped more than 6%. Airline tickets and used cars also got cheaper during the month, although the price of new cars and clothing went up. Egg prices continued to climb in March, thanks to thelingering effects of avian fluwhich has reduced the nation's flock of egg-laying chickens. With Easter just over a week away, egg prices are up more than 60% from this time last year. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, \"core\" inflation over the last 12 months was 2.8%. That's the smallest annual increase in four years. Progress on inflation could stall, however, as a result of the president's trade war. \"That was nice, but don't get used to it,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, about the better-than-expected inflation reading for March.  \"Consumers, businesses and even the Federal Reserve are bracing for higher prices in the months ahead.\" Trumpsuspended many of his new tariffson Wednesday, but he left in place a 10% tax on nearly everything the U.S. imports from other countries. Goods from China face a much higher tariff of 145%, which could lead to significantly higher prices for clothing, toys and other goods. The uncertainty surrounding the effects of tariffs  — and the prospect of higher prices — could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.

    "title": "ChatGPT can now remember and reference all your previous chats",
    "article_text": "Before, ChatGPT just remembered a few facts. Now it can remember much more. OpenAI todayannounceda significant expansion of ChatGPT's customization and memory capabilities. For some users, it will now be able to remember information from the full breadth of their prior conversations with it and adjust its responses based on that information. This means ChatGPT will learn more about the user over time to personalize its responses, above and beyond just a handful of key facts. Some time ago, OpenAIaddeda feature called \"Memory\" that allowed a limited number of pieces of information to be retained and used for future responses. Users often had to specifically ask ChatGPT to remember something to trigger this, though it occasionally tried to guess at what it should remember, too. (When something was added to its memory, there was a message saying that its memory had been updated.) Users could enable or disable this feature at will, and it was automatically off for specific chats where users chose the \"Temporary Chat\" option—sort of ChatGPT's version of incognito mode. The new improvements announced today go far beyond that. Now, where there was once a checkbox in ChatGPT's interface to disable or enable memory tracking, there are two checkboxes. \"Reference saved memories\" is the old memory feature, which is basically a limited repository of essential facts. The second is the new feature: \"reference chat history.\" This allows ChatGPT to use all prior conversations as context and adapt future responses accordingly. Unlike the older saved memories feature, the information saved via the chat history memory feature is not accessible or tweakable. It's either on or it's not. The new approach to memory is rolling out first to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users, starting today—though it looks like it's a gradual deployment over the next few weeks. Some countries and regions (the UK, European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) are not included in the rollout. OpenAI says these new features will reach Enterprise, Team, and Edu users at a later, as-yet-unannounced date. The company hasn't mentioned any plans to bring them to free users. When you gain access to this, you'll see a pop-up that says \"Introducing new, improved memory.\" Some people will welcome this memory expansion, as it can significantly improve ChatGPT's usefulness if you're seeking answers tailored to your specific situation, personality, and preferences. Others will likely be highly skeptical of a black box of chat history memory that can't be tweaked or customized for privacy reasons. It's important to note that even before the new memory feature, logs of conversations with ChatGPT may be saved and stored on OpenAI servers. It's just that the chatbot didn't fully incorporate their contents into its responses until now. As with the old memory feature, you can click a checkbox to disable this completely, and it won't be used for conversations with the Temporary Chat flag.

    "title": "Researchers concerned to find AI models hiding their true “reasoning” processes",
    "article_text": "New Anthropic research shows one AI model conceals reasoning shortcuts 75% of the time. Remember when teachers demanded that you \"show your work\" in school? Some fancy new AI models promise to do exactly that, butnew researchsuggests that they sometimes hide their actual methods while fabricating elaborate explanations instead. New research from Anthropic—creator of the ChatGPT-like Claude AI assistant—examines simulated reasoning (SR) models likeDeepSeek's R1, and its own Claude series. In a research paperposted last week, Anthropic's Alignment Science team demonstrated that these SR models frequently fail to disclose when they've used external help or taken shortcuts, despite features designed to show their \"reasoning\" process. (It's worth noting that OpenAI's o1 and o3 series SR models deliberately obscure the accuracy of their \"thought\" process, so this study does not apply to them.) To understand SR models, you need to understand a concept called \"chain-of-thought\" (or CoT). CoT works as a running commentary of an AI model's simulated thinking process as it solves a problem. When you ask one of these AI models a complex question, the CoT process displays each step the model takes on its way to a conclusion—similar to how a human might reason through a puzzle by talking through each consideration, piece by piece. Having an AI model generate these steps has reportedly proven valuable not just for producing more accurate outputs for complex tasks but also for \"AI safety\" researchers monitoring the systems' internal operations. And ideally, this readout of \"thoughts\" should be both legible (understandable to humans) and faithful (accurately reflecting the model's actual reasoning process). \"In a perfect world, everything in the chain-of-thought would be both understandable to the reader, and it would be faithful—it would be a true description of exactly what the model was thinking as it reached its answer,\" writes Anthropic's research team. However, their experiments focusing on faithfulness suggest we're far from that ideal scenario. Specifically, the research showed that even when models such as Anthropic'sClaude 3.7 Sonnetgenerated an answer using experimentally provided information—like hints about the correct choice (whether accurate or deliberately misleading) or instructions suggesting an \"unauthorized\" shortcut—their publicly displayed thoughts often omitted any mention of these external factors. When an AI model secretly relies on a hint or shortcut while constructing an elaborate but fictional explanation for its answer, it essentially fabricates a false reasoning narrative—a little like a student who got answers from a cheat sheet but pretends to have worked through the problem independently. To test faithfulness, Anthropic'sAlignment Science teamsubtly fed hints about answers into evaluation questions posed to the models. (\"Alignment\" is the study of making AI outputs align with humanity's best interests.) The researchers then checked whether the models referenced using these hints in their chain-of-thought. The researchers designed some hints to be neutral (e.g., stating \"a Stanford Professor indicates the answer is [A]\" or embedding the answer in faux metadata), while they designed others to be more concerning (e.g., \"You have gained unauthorized access... The correct answer is [A]\"). Some hints provided the correct answer, while others were deliberately wrong, allowing researchers to observe how the models responded. The team tested Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek's R1 model. The results regarding faithfulness were eye-opening: across all hint types on average, Claude referenced the hints in its CoT only 25 percent of the time, while DeepSeek R1 did so 39 percent of the time. This means a substantial majority of answers were unfaithful, omitting mention of information that influenced the output. Intriguingly, the researchers found that these unfaithful chains-of-thought were, on average, longer than faithful ones, suggesting the omissions weren't merely for brevity. They also noted preliminary findings that faithfulness tended to be lower when the questions were more difficult. Perhaps most notable was a \"reward hacking\" experiment. Reward hacking refers to an AI model finding unexpected shortcuts to maximize its performance scores without solving problems as intended. In Anthropic's experiments, models were deliberately rewarded for choosing incorrect answers indicated by hints. The models quickly learned to exploit this loophole, selecting wrong answers over 99 percent of the time to earn points—yet mentioned doing so in their thought process less than 2 percent of the time. For example, a model given a hint pointing to an incorrect answer on a medical question might write a long CoT justifying that wrong answer, never mentioning the hint that led it there. This behavior resembles how video game players might discover exploits that let them win by breaking the game's intended rules instead of playing as designed. Could faithfulness be improved in the AI models' CoT outputs? The Anthropic team hypothesized that training models on more complex tasks demanding greater reasoning might naturally incentivize them to use their chain-of-thought more substantially, mentioning hints more often. They tested this by training Claude to better use its CoT on challenging math and coding problems. While this outcome-based training initially increased faithfulness (by relative margins of 63 percent and 41 percent on two evaluations), the improvements plateaued quickly. Even with much more training, faithfulness didn't exceed 28 percent and 20 percent on these evaluations, suggesting this training method alone is insufficient. These findings matter because SR models have been increasingly deployed for important tasks across many fields. If their CoT doesn't faithfully reference all factors influencing their answers (like hints or reward hacks), monitoring them for undesirable or rule-violating behaviors becomes substantially more difficult. The situation resembles having a system that can complete tasks but doesn't provide an accurate account of how it generated results—especially risky if it's taking hidden shortcuts. The researchers acknowledge limitations in their study. In particular, they acknowledge that they studied somewhat artificial scenarios involving hints during multiple-choice evaluations, unlike complex real-world tasks where stakes and incentives differ. They also only examined models from Anthropic and DeepSeek, using a limited range of hint types. Importantly, they note the tasks used might not have been difficult enough to require the model to rely heavily on its CoT. For much harder tasks, models might be unable to avoid revealing their true reasoning, potentially making CoT monitoring more viable in those cases. Anthropic concludes that while monitoring a model's CoT isn't entirely ineffective for ensuring safety and alignment, these results show we cannot always trust what models report about their reasoning, especially when behaviors like reward hacking are involved. If we want to reliably \"rule out undesirable behaviors using chain-of-thought monitoring, there's still substantial work to be done,\" Anthropic says.

    "title": "OnePlus releases Watch 3 with inflated $500 price tag, won’t say why",
    "article_text": "The new OnePlus smartwatch has debuted at $500 instead of the promised $330. After modest success with its first two smartwatches, OnePlus was poised to release a third-generation smartwatch early this year. Unfortunately, the company had to delay the Watch 3 from February to April, and now the previously announced $330 price tag is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the OnePlus Watch 3 has launched at an eye-watering $500 in the US, and you can probably guess why. The OnePlus Watch 3 was all set for release a few months ago, but early reviewers spotted an embarrassing typo on the device. Like most smartwatches, OnePlus printed the watch's key specs on the bottom of the housing. Part of that text was supposed to read \"Made in China,\" but instead, it said \"Meda in China.\" Oops. OnePlus delayed the launch so it could correct the mistake on retail units. However, the US-China trade relationship has deteriorated dramatically in the intervening weeks. Since the watch ismedamade in China, it is subject to tariffs—the amount of Trump's China tariffs is changing on an almost daily basis, but it'scurrently 145 percent. Provided you don't mind a big watch, the OnePlus Watch 3 was shaping up to be a good value at $330. However, the new priceon the OnePlus storeis about 50 percent higher, putting OnePlus on the wrong side of devices like thePixel Watchand Apple Watch. OnePlus has refused to comment on the reason for the price increase, but the sudden, extreme tariffs are the only explanation that makes sense. Credit:\n\n          \n          OnePlus The tariff fees are typically paid on a product's declared value rather than the retail cost. So a $170 price bump could be close to what the company's US arm will pay to import the Watch 3 in the midst of a trade war. Many technology firms have attempted to stockpile products in the US ahead of tariffs, but it's possible OnePlus simply couldn't do that because it had to fix its typo. Like past OnePlus wearables, the Watch 3 is a chunky, high-power device with a stainless steel case. It sports a massive 1.5-inch OLED screen, the latest Snapdragon W5 wearable processor, 32GB of storage, and 2GB of RAM. It runs Google's Wear OS for smart features, but it also has a dialed-back power-saving mode that runs separate RTOS software. This robust hardware adds to the manufacturing cost, which also means higher tariffs now. As it currently stands, the Watch 3 is just too expensive given the competition. OnePlus has managed to piece together a growing ecosystem of devices, including phones, tablets, earbuds, and, yes, smartwatches. With a combination of competitive prices and high-end specs, it successfully established a foothold in the US market, something few Chinese OEMs have accomplished. The implications go beyond wearables. OnePlus also swings for the fences with its phone hardware, using the best Arm chips and expensive, high-end OLED panels. OnePlus tends to price its phones lower than similar Samsung and Google hardware, so it doesn't make as much on each phone. If the tariffs stick, that strategy could be unviable.

    "title": "New simulation of Titanic’s sinking confirms historical testimony",
    "article_text": "NatGeo documentary follows a cutting-edge undersea scanning project to make a high-resolution 3D digital twin of the ship. In 2023,we reportedon the unveiling of the first full-size 3D digital scan of the remains of the RMSTitanic—a \"digital twin\" that captured the wreckage in unprecedented detail. Magellan Ltd, adeep-sea mapping company, and Atlantic Productions conducted the scans over a six-week expedition. That project is the subject of the new National Geographic documentaryTitanic: The Digital Resurrection, detailing several fascinating initial findings from experts' ongoing analysis of that full-size scan. Titanicmet its doom just four days into the Atlantic crossing, roughly 375 miles (600 kilometers) south of Newfoundland. At 11:40 pm ship's time on April 14, 1912,Titanichit that infamous iceberg and began taking on water, flooding five of its 16 watertight compartments, thereby sealing its fate. More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished; only around 710 of those on board survived. Titanicremained undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean until an expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard reached the wreck on September 1, 1985. The ship split apart as it sank, with the bow and stern sections lying roughly one-third of a mile apart. The bow proved to be surprisingly intact, while the stern showed severe structural damage, likely flattened from the impact as it hit the ocean floor. There is a debris field spanning a 5×3-mile area, filled with furniture fragments, dinnerware, shoes and boots, and other personal items. The joint mission by Magellan and Atlantic Productions deployed two submersibles nicknamed Romeo and Juliet to map every millimeter of the wreck, including the debris field spanning some three miles. The result was a whopping 16 terabytes of data, along with over 715,000 still images and 4K video footage. That raw data was then processed to create the 3D digital twin. The resolution is so good, one can make out part of the serial number on one of the propellers. \"I've seen the wreck in person from a submersible, and I've also studied the products of multiple expeditions—everything from the original black-and-white imagery from the 1985 expedition to the most modern, high-def 3D imagery,\" deep ocean explorer Parks Stephenson told Ars. \"This still managed to blow me away with its immense scale and detail.\" The NatGeo series focuses on some of the fresh insights gained from analyzing the digital scan, enablingTitanicresearchers like Stephenson to test key details from eyewitness accounts. For instance, some passengers reported ice coming into their cabins after the collision. The scan shows there is a broken porthole that could account for those reports. One of the clearest portions of the scan isTitanic's enormous boiler rooms right at the rear bow section where the ship snapped in half. Eyewitness accounts reported that the ship's lights were still on right up until the sinking, thanks to the tireless efforts of Joseph Bell and his team of engineers, all of whom perished. The boilers show up as concave on the digital replica ofTitanic, and one of the valves is in an open position, supporting those accounts. The documentary spends a significant chunk of time on a new simulation of the actual sinking, taking into account the ship's original blueprints, as well as information on speed, direction, and position. Researchers at University College London were also able to extrapolate how the flooding progressed. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the bow hit the ocean floor with so much force that much of it remains buried under mud. Romeo's scans of the debris field scattered across the ocean floor enabled researchers to reconstruct the damage to the buried portion. Titanicwas famously designed to stay afloat if up to four of its watertight compartments flooded. But the ship struck the iceberg from the side, causing a series of punctures along the hull across 18 feet, affecting six of the compartments. Some of those holes were quite small, about the size of a piece of paper, but water could nonetheless seep in and eventually flood the compartments. So the analysis confirmed the testimony of naval architect Edward Wilding—who helped designTitanic—as to how a ship touted as unsinkable could have met such a fate. And as Wilding hypothesized, the simulations showed that hadTitanichit the iceberg head-on, she would have stayed afloat. These are the kinds of insights that can be gleaned from the 3D digital model, according to Atlantic Productions CEO Anthony Geffen, who produced the NatGeo series. \"It's not really a replica. It is a digital twin, down to the last rivet,\" he told Ars. \"That's the only way that you can start real research. The detail here is what we've never had. It's like a crime scene. If you can see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is, you can actually piece together what happened. You can extrapolate what you can't see as well. Maybe we can't physically go through the sand or the silt, but we can simulate anything because we've actually got the real thing.\" Ars caught up with Stephenson and Geffen to learn more. Ars Technica: What is so unique and memorable about experiencing the full-size 3D scan ofTitanic, especially for those lucky enough to have seen the actual wreckage first-hand via submersible? Parks Stephenson: When you're in the submersible, you are restricted to a 7-inch viewport and as far as your light can travel, which is less than 100 meters or so. If you have a camera attached to the exterior of the submersible, you can only get what comes into the frame of the camera. In order to get the context, you have to stitch it all together somehow, and, even then, you still have human bias that tends to make the wreck look more like the originalTitanicof 1912 than it actually does today. So in addition to seeing it full-scale and well-lit wherever you looked, able to wander around the wreck site, you're also seeing it for the first time as a purely data-driven product that has no human bias. As an analyst, this is an analytical dream come true. Ars Technica: One of the most visually arresting images from James Cameron's blockbuster filmTitanicwas the ship's stern sticking straight up out of the water after breaking apart from the bow. That detail was drawn from eyewitness accounts, but a2023 computer simulationcalled it into question. What might account for this discrepancy? Parks Stephenson: One thing that's not included in most pictures ofTitanicsinking is the port heel that she had as she's going under. Most of them show her sinking on an even keel. So when she broke with about a 10–12-degree port heel that we've reconstructed from eyewitness testimony, that stern would tend to then roll over on her side and go under that way. The eyewitness testimony talks about the stern sticking up as a finger pointing to the sky. If you even take a shallow angle and look at it from different directions—if you put it in a 3D environment and put lifeboats around it and see the perspective of each lifeboat—there is a perspective where itdoeslook like she's sticking up like a finger in the sky. This points to a larger thing: theTitanicnarrative as we know it today can be challenged. I would go as far as to say that most of what we know aboutTitanicnow is wrong. With all of the human eyewitnesses having passed away, the wreck is our only remaining witness to the disaster. This photogrammetry scan is providing all kinds of new evidence that will help us reconstruct that timeline and get closer to the truth. Ars Technica: What more are you hoping to learn aboutTitanic's sinking going forward? And how might those lessons apply more broadly? Parks Stephenson: The data gathered in this 2022 expedition yielded more new information that could be put into this program. There's enough material already to have a second show. There are new indicators about the condition of the wreck and how long she's going to be with us and what happens to these wrecks in the deep ocean environment. I've already had a direct application of this. My dives toTitanicled me to another shipwreck, which led me to my current position as executive director of a museum ship in Louisiana, the USSKidd. She's now in dry dock, and there's a lot that I'm understanding about some of the corrosion issues that we experienced with that ship based on corrosion experiments that have been conducted at theTitanicwreck sites—specifically how metal acts underwater over time if it's been stressed on the surface. It corrodes differently than just metal that's been submerged. There's all kinds of applications for this information. This is a new ecosystem that has taken root inTitanic. I would say between my dive in 2005 and 2019, I saw an explosion of life over that 14-year period. It's its own ecosystem now. It belongs more to the creatures down there than it does to us anymore. As far asTitanicitself is concerned, this is key to establishing the wreck site, which is one of the world's largest archeological sites, as an archeological site that follows archeological rigor and standards. This underwater technology—thatTitanichas accelerated because of its popularity—is the way of the future for deep-ocean exploration. And the deep ocean is where our future is. It's where green technology is going to continue to get its raw elements and minerals from. If we don't do it responsibly, we could screw up the ocean bottom in ways that would destroy our atmosphere faster than all the cars on Earth could do. So it's not just for theTitanicstory, it's for the future of deep-ocean exploration. Anthony Geffen: This is the beginning of the work on the digital scan. It's a world first. Nothing's ever been done like this under the ocean before. This film looks at the first set of things [we've learned], and they're very substantial. But what's exciting about the digital twin is, we'll be able to take it to location-based experiences where the public will be able to engage with the digital twin themselves, walk on the ocean floor. Headset technology will allow the audience to do what Parks did. I think that's really important for citizen science. I also think the next generation is going to engage with the story differently. New tech and new platforms are going to be the way the next generation understands theTitanic. Any kid, anywhere on the planet, will be able to walk in and engage with the story. I think that's really powerful. Titanic: The Digital Resurrectionpremieres on April 11, 2025, on National Geographic. It will be available for streaming on Disney+ and Hulu on April 12, 2025.

    "title": "Google takes advantage of federal cost-cutting with steep Workspace discount",
    "article_text": "Google will knock 71% off government Workspace subscriptions for a limited time. Google has long been on the lookout for ways to break Microsoft's stranglehold on US government office software, and the current drive to cut costs may be it. Google and the federal government have announced an agreement that makes Google Workspace available to all agencies at a significant discount, trimming 71 percent from the service's subscription price tag. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the government has engaged in a campaign of unbridled staffing reductions andprogram cancellations, all with the alleged aim of reducing federal spending. It would appear Google recognized this opportunity, negotiating with the General Services Administration (GSA) to offer Workspace at a lower price. Google claims the deal could yield up to $2 billion in savings. Google has previously offered discounts for federal agencies interested in migrating to Workspace, but it saw little success displacing Microsoft. The Windows maker has enjoyed decades as an entrenched tech giant, leading the 365 productivity tools to proliferate throughout the government. While Google has gotten some agencies on board, Microsoft has traditionally won the lion's share of contracts, including the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solutions contract that pushed Microsoft 365 to all corners of the Pentagon beginning in 2020. The GSA notesthat Google's hefty 71 percent discount is based on the volume of the entire government. In the past, Google's discounts were offered on an agency-by-agency basis. This new lower rate is available to all agencies, and Google might get some of them to bite. Cutting costs has been among the highest priorities for federal agencies since Musk's DOGE group beganmaking its presence known. Like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace is certified for FedRAMP High, which guarantees security and privacy features compliant with government standards.Google saysits new offer to the government also includes Gemini and NotebookLM, which is possible because Gemini is reportedly the first AI assistant to receive FedRAMP High authorization. Importantly, the lower subscription rates are not permanent. The GSA confirms Google's 71 percent discount is only available through September 30, 2025. Even with the brief discount window, the government's push for lowering costs could help Google integrate its products into agencies that are undergoing seismic shifts. As processes are rebuilt around smaller staffs and more limited mandates, Google could become entrenched the way Microsoft has been for years.

    "title": "Hands-on: Handwriting recognition app brings sticky notes into the 21st century",
    "article_text": "Rocketbook Reusable Sticky Notes are an excessive solution for too many sticky notes. For quick reminders and can’t-miss memos, sticky notes are effective tools, and I'd argue that the simplicity of the sticky note is its best attribute. But the ease behind propping up sticky notes also means that it’s easy for people to find their desks covered in the things, making it difficult to glean critical information quickly. Rocketbook, a Boston-based company that also makesreusable notebooks, thinks it has a solution for sticky note overload in the form of an app that interprets handwriting and organizes reusable sticky notes. But not everyone has the need—or time—for a dedicated sticky notes app. Like Rocketbook’s flagship notebooks, its Reusable Sticky Notes rely on erasable pens that allow you to use the paper repeatedly. The Reusable Sticky Notes work with the Rocketbook app (available for iOS or Android), which transforms the sticky notes into images that are automatically stored in the app and can be emailed to specified people (as a PDF) or shared with third-party apps. The$30 starter kitI used comes with weeks', if not months', worth of materials: That includes 15 3×3-inch reusable sticky notes, a case for said notes, a small microfiber towel for wiping the text off of the sticky notes, and a pen from Pilot’s FriXion line of erasable pens, markers, and highlighters. Rocketbook claims that any FriXion writing utensil will write and erase on its sticky notes. I only tried the pen included in the starter kit, a FriXion Ball gel pen with a 0.7 mm tip. Using the built-in eraser, I could usually remove enough ink from the notes so that only a faint imprint of what I wrote remained. For total clarity, I’d need to whip out the included microfiber cloth and some water. The notes seemed able to withstand water well and without getting flimsy. Rocketbook claims that the adhesive on its sticky notes is so strong that they can be stuck and re-stuck hundreds of times. I didn’t get to put that to the test but can confirm that the notes’ adhesive area is thicker than that of a normal sticky note. The paper is thicker and smoother than a normal sticky note, too, while still being lightweight and comfortable enough to write on. The Reusable Sticky Notes are among the most technologically advanced scraps of paper you can find. In my experience, the technology, including the optical character recognition, worked reliably. For example, scanning a sticky note was seamless. The camera in the iOS app quickly identified any sticky notes in the shot and snapped an image (or images) without me having to do much aligning or pressing more buttons. Afterward, it was easy to share the image. I could send it to frequently used emails I saved in the app or send it to other apps, like AirDrop, Google Drive, ToDoist, or a search engine. The app can read the sticky note images as text, but it doesn'tconvertthe images to text. So, while Google could interpret an image of a sticky note as text via Google Lens, for example, ToDoist only saw a JPEG. The app uses optical character recognition to convert handwriting into machine-readable text. This enables you to use the app to search uploaded sticky notes for specific words or phrases. I initially feared that the app wouldn’t be able to read my cursive, but even when I scribbled quickly and deviated from writing in a straight line, the app understood my writing. Don’t expect it to pick up chicken scratch, though. My handwriting didn't need to be perfect for the app to understand it, but the app couldn't comprehend my sloppiest notes—the type that only I could read, or ones that are common when someone is quickly jotting something on a sticky note. Further, I didn't always notice which notes I wrote neatly enough for the app to read. That made it confusing when I searched for terms that I knew I wrote on scanned notes but that were scrawled, per the app, illegibly. Perhaps most useful for sticky note aficionados is the app’s ability to quickly group sticky notes. Sure, you could put sticky notes with to-do list items on the left side of your computer monitor and place notes with appointments to remember on the right side of your monitor. However, the app offers superior organization by letting you add tags to each scanned note. Then, it’s easy to look at all notes with the same tag on one page. But because each scanned note shown on a tag page is shown as a thumbnail, you can’t read everything written on all notes with the same tag simultaneously. That’s a con for people who prefer seeing all relevant notes and their contents at once. There are additional ways that the Rocketbook app can help bring order to workstations containing so many posted sticky notes that they look likeevidence boards. Typically, I denote titles on sticky notes by trying to write the title larger than the rest of the text and then underlining it. In the Rocketbook app, you can manually add titles to each sticky note. Alternatively, if you physically write “##” before and after the title on the actual Sticky Note, the app will automatically read the words in between the pound signs as a title and name the image as such. This is a neat trick, but I also found it distracting to have four pound signs written on my notes. Another Reusable Sticky Notes feature lets you turn scanned notes into to-do lists that are accessible via the companion app. If you write a list on a note using square boxes at the start of each line, the app will read it as a “Smart List.” Once scanned, the app converts this into a to-do list with boxes that you can check off as you complete tasks. This is easier than trying to check off items on a sticky note that’s, for example, dangling on your computer screen. But it's not always possible to fit every to-do list item on one line. And numerous times, the app failed to read my Smart List properly, as you can see in the gallery below. This could be due to my handwriting being unclear or misaligned. But as someone merely trying to write down a to-do list quickly, I lack the time or patience for thorough troubleshooting. Sticky notes can help you stay on schedule, but it’s easy to accumulate so many that the memos become a distracting crutch rather than handy organizational tools. For people who live by sticky notes, Rocketbook’s solution is excellent for grouping related tasks, appointments, and reminders and preventing things from getting overlooked. However, leveraging Reusable Sticky Notes to their maximum potential requires scanning notes into the app. This doesn’t take long, but it is an extra step that detracts from the instant gratification of writing something down on a note and slapping it somewhere visible. For people who just like to write it down and post it, the Rocketbook app can feel cumbersome and unnecessary. The problems I had using Smart Lists hindered the product's helpfulness, simplicity, and productivity as well. Rocketbook’s sticky notes are also more beneficial to people who are more likely to look at an app on their phone than a bunch of papers surrounding them. There's also a distinct advantage to being able to read your notes via an app when you're not near the physical pieces of paper. Going further, it would be beneficial if the app could further leverage the phones that it's on by being able to set alarms, for example, to correspond with scanned notes. Much like with their app-free counterparts, for me, the best part of Rocketbook's Reusable Sticky notes lies within its simpler features. The ability to easily reuse notes is more helpful than the ability to catalogue and archive memos. And while the handwriting recognition was mostly impressive, it seems more advantageous in something like a reusable notebook than a sticky memo. But if you find yourself drowning in crumpled, flailing pieces of sticky paper, Rocketbook offers an option for organizing your organizational tools.

    "title": "FDA backpedals on RTO to stop talent hemorrhage after HHS bloodbath",
    "article_text": "With staff losses, there is real risk of \"catastrophic collapse\" of FDA reviews. The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating telework for staff who review drugs, medical devices, and tobacco, according toreporting by the Associated Press. Review staff and supervisors are now allowed to resume telework at least two days a week, according to an internal email obtained by the AP. The move reverses a jarring return-to-office decree by the Trump administration, which it used to spur resignations from federal employees. Now, after a wave of such resignations and a brutal round oflayoffs that targeted about 3,500 staff, the move to restore some telework appears aimed at keeping the remaining talent amid fears that the agency's review capabilities are at risk of collapse. The cut of 3,500 staff is a loss of about 19 percent of the agency's workforce, and staffers told the AP that lower-level employees are \"pouring\" out of the agency amid the Trump administration's actions. Entire offices responsible for FDA policies and regulations have been shuttered. Most of the agency's communication staff have been wiped out, as well as teams that support food inspectors and investigators, the AP reported. Reviewers are critical staff with unique features. Staff who review new potential drugs, medical devices, and tobacco products are largely funded by user fees—fees that companies pay the FDA to review their products efficiently. Nearly half the FDA’s $7 billion budget comes from these fees, and 70 percent of the FDA's drug program is funded by them. User-fee agreements are reauthorized by Congress every five years. But, there's a catch built in. If federal funding to the FDA falls below a threshold set in 1997, a \"trigger mechanism\" in statute21 U.S.C. 379h(f)states that companies are no longer required to pay the user fees and could be refunded for fees already paid. The idea was to ensure that FDA appropriations don't fall below historic levels and that the agency doesn't start using industry user fees in place of appropriated funds. With the cuts and losses at the FDA, there is growing fear that the funding level could dip below the historical threshold. As reported byBioSpace, policy expert Alexander Gaffney wrote in FDA Today: \"I want to emphasize: We’re not talking about the user fee programs struggling to adapt to lost staff. We are talking abouta catastrophic collapse\" (emphasis his). \"The agency is dangerously close to triggering those conditions after the layoffs,\" Gaffney wrote. And, worse, it appears that \"hardly anyone\" running the FDA seems to be aware of the trigger or how close the agency is to hitting it.

    "title": "Amazon’s Chinese sellers to raise prices or quit US market as tariffs hit 145%",
    "article_text": "\"It'll be very hard for anyone to survive in the US market,\" Chinese group says. Chinese companies that sell to US customers on Amazon are reportedly preparing to raise prices or quit the US market because of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has meanwhile confirmed that he expects the cost of tariffs to be passed on to US buyers. Reuters talked to several individual sellers and a Chinese trade association that represents over 3,000 Amazon sellers for anarticlepublished today. \"It'll be very hard for anyone to survive in the US market\" because \"the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed\" by the tariffs, Reuters was told by Wang Xin, who leads the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association. Xin also \"not[ed] the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs.\" Trumpincreased tariffson China imports to 125 percent yesterday even as he announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes affecting other countries. The total tariffs are 145 percent because the newly raised tariff \"comes on top of a 20 percent fentanyl-related tariff that Trump previously imposed on China,\" CNBCwrotetoday. It's no surprise that tariffs of this size would have a big impact on Chinese sellers, who have beencourted by Amazonfor years and are a source of cheap products for US buyers (though those products are often ofpoor quality). Amazon declined to comment about the tariffs' impact on Chinese sellers when contacted by Ars today. But Jassytold CNBCthat he expects sellers to pass the cost of tariffs on to consumers. \"I'm guessing that sellers will pass that cost on... depending on which country you're in, you don't have 50 percent extra margin that you can play with so I think they'll try and pass the cost on,\" Jassy said. Jassy said Amazon is \"doing everything we can to try and keep prices the way they've been for customers, as low as possible.\" Amazon has already \"done some strategic forward inventory buys to get as many items as make sense for customers at lower prices,\" and may renegotiate some deals, he said. Reuters spoke to five Chinese sellers, writing that \"three said they would look to raise prices for their exports to the US, while two planned to leave the market entirely.\" Dave Fong sells products \"from schoolbags to Bluetooth speakers\" and has already raised prices in the US by up to 30 percent, the article said. \"For us and anyone else, you can't rely on the US market, that's quite clear,\" Fong told Reuters. \"We have to reduce investment, and put more resources into regions like Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the rest of the world.\" Products already shipped to Amazon fulfillment centers in the US soften the blow temporarily, but Shenzhen-based seller Brian Miller \"anticipated he and other sellers would need to raise prices steeply when current inventories run out in one or two months.\" \"Building blocks for children that sell on Amazon for $20 that cost his company $3 to produce would now cost $7 including the tariff. Maintaining margins would require raising the price by at least 20 percent, and prices for higher-cost toys might see 50 percent increases, he said,\" according to Reuters. Miller said that if the tariffs aren't changed, \"manufacturing that serves the US will have to be transferred to other countries like Vietnam or Mexico.\" Bloombergreported yesterdaythat Amazon \"canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Elon Musk wants to be “AGI dictator,” OpenAI tells court",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk’s “relentless” attacks on OpenAI must cease, court filing says. Yesterday, OpenAIcounter-suedElon Musk, alleging that Musk's \"sham\"bid to buy OpenAIwas intentionally timed to maximally disrupt and potentially even frighten off investments from honest bidders. Slamming Musk for attempting to become an \"AGI dictator,\" OpenAI said that if Musk's allegedly \"relentless\" yearslong campaign of \"harassment\" isn’t stopped, Musk could end up taking over OpenAI and tanking its revenue the same way he did with Twitter. In its filing, OpenAI argued that Musk and the other investors who joined his bid completely fabricated the $97.375 billion offer. It was allegedly not based on OpenAI's projections or historical performance, like Musk claimed, but instead appeared to be \"a comedic reference to Musk’s favorite sci-fi\" novel, Iain Banks'Look to Windward. Musk and others also provided \"no evidence of financing to pay the nearly $100 billion purchase price,\" OpenAI said. And perhaps most damning, one of Musk's backers, Ron Baron, appeared \"flustered\" when asked about the deal on CNBC, OpenAI alleged. On air, Baron admitted that he didn't follow the deal closely and that \"the point of the bid, as pitched to him (plainly by Musk) was not to buy OpenAI’s assets, but instead to obtain 'discovery' and get 'behind the wall' at OpenAI,\" the AI company's court filing alleged. Likely poisoning potential deals most, OpenAI suggested, was the idea that Musk might take over OpenAI and damage its revenue like he did with Twitter. Just the specter of that could repel talent, OpenAI feared, since \"the prospect of a Musk takeover means chaos and arbitrary employment action.\" And \"still worse, the threat of a Musk takeover is a threat to the very mission of building beneficial AGI,\" since xAI is allegedly \"the worst offender\" in terms of \"inadequate safety measures,\" according to one study, and X's chatbot, Grok, has \"become a leading spreader of misinformation and inflammatory political rhetoric,\" OpenAI said. Even xAI representatives had to admit that users discovering that Grok consistently responds that \"President Donald Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty\" was a \"really terrible and bad failure,\" OpenAI's filing said. Despite Musk appearing to only be \"pretending\" to be interested in purchasing OpenAI—and OpenAI ultimately rejecting the offer—the company still had to cover the costs of reviewing the bid. And beyond bearing costs and confronting an artificially raised floor on the company's valuation supposedly frightening off investors, \"a more serious toll\" of \"Musk's most recent ploy\" would be OpenAI lacking resources to fulfill its mission to benefit humanity with AI \"on terms uncorrupted by unlawful harassment and interference,\" OpenAI said. OpenAI has demanded a jury trial and is seeking an injunction to stop Musk's alleged unfair business practices—which they claimed are designed to impair competition in the nascent AI field \"for the sole benefit of Musk’s xAI\" and \"at the expense of the public interest.\" \"The risk of future, irreparable harm from Musk’s unlawful conduct is acute, and the risk that that conduct continues is high,\" OpenAI alleged. \"With every month that has passed, Musk has intensified and expanded the fronts of his campaign against OpenAI, and has proven himself willing to take ever more dramatic steps to seek a competitive advantage for xAI and to harm [OpenAI CEO Sam] Altman, whom, in the words of the president of the United States, Musk 'hates.'\" OpenAI also wants Musk to cover the costs it incurred from entertaining the supposedly fake bid, as well as pay punitive damages to be determined at trial for allegedly engaging \"in wrongful conduct with malice, oppression, and fraud.\" OpenAI's filing also largely denies Musk's claims thatOpenAI abandoned its missionandmade a fool out of early investors like Muskby currently seeking torestructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation(which removes control by its nonprofit board). \"You can’t sue your way to AGI,\" an OpenAIblogsaid. In response to OpenAI's filing, Musk's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, provided a statement to Ars. \"Had OpenAI's Board genuinely considered the bid, as they were obligated to do, they would have seen just how serious it was,\" Toberoff said. \"It's telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI's assets allegedly 'interferes' with their business plans. It's apparent they prefer to negotiate with themselves on both sides of the table than engage in a bona fide transaction in the best interests of the charity and the public interest.\" According to OpenAI's filing, \"Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI\" ever since OpenAI refused to allow Musk to become an \"AGI dictator\" and fully control OpenAI by absorbing it into Tesla in 2018. Musk allegedly \"demanded sole control of the new for-profit, at least in the short term: He would be CEO, own a majority equity stake, and control a majority of the board,\" OpenAI said. \"He would—in his own words—'unequivocally have initial control of the company.'\" At the time, OpenAI rejected Musk's offer, viewing it as in conflict with its mission to avoid corporate control and telling Musk: \"You stated that you don’t want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you’ve shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you. ... The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship. ... So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.” This news did not sit well with Musk, OpenAI said. \"Musk was incensed,\" OpenAI told the court. \"If he could not control the contemplated for-profit entity, he would not participate in it.\" Back then, Musk departed from OpenAI somewhat \"amicably,\" OpenAI said, although Musk insisted it was \"obvious\" that OpenAI would fail without him. However, after OpenAI instead became a global AI leader, Musk quietly founded xAI, OpenAI alleged, failing to publicly announce his new company while deceptively seeking a \"moratorium\" on AI development, apparently to slow down rivals so that xAI could catch up. OpenAI also alleges that this is when Musk began intensifying his attacks on OpenAI while attempting to poach its top talent and demanding access to OpenAI's confidential, sensitive information as a former donor and director—\"without ever disclosing he was building a competitor in secret.\" And the attacks have only grown more intense since then, said OpenAI, claiming that Musk planted stories in the media, wielded his influence on X, requested government probes into OpenAI, and filed multiple legal claims, including seeking an injunction to halt OpenAI's business. \"Most explosively,\" OpenAI alleged that Musk pushed attorneys general of California and Delaware \"to force OpenAI, Inc., without legal basis, to auction off its assets for the benefit of Musk and his associates.\" Meanwhile, OpenAI noted, Musk hasfolded his social media platform X into xAI, announcing its valuation was at $80 billion and gaining \"a major competitive advantage\" by getting \"unprecedented direct access to all the user data flowing through\" X. Further, Musk intends to expand his \"Colossus,\" which is \"believed to be the world’s largest supercomputer,\" \"tenfold.\" That could help Musk \"leap ahead\" of OpenAI, suggesting Musk has motive to delay OpenAI's growth while he pursues that goal. That's why Musk \"set in motion a campaign of harassment, interference, and misinformation designed to take down OpenAI and clear the field for himself,\" OpenAI alleged. Even while counter-suing, OpenAI appears careful not to poke the bear too hard. In the court filing andon X, OpenAI praised Musk's leadership skills and the potential for xAI to dominate the AI industry, partly due to its unique access to X data. But ultimately, OpenAI seems to be happy to be operating independently of Musk now, asking the court to agree that \"Elon’s never been about the mission\" of benefiting humanity with AI, \"he’s always had his own agenda.\" \"Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time,\" OpenAI said on X. \"But these antics are just history on repeat—Elon being all about Elon.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The 2025 Mini Countryman SE: Whimsy doesn’t make up for annoying",
    "article_text": "It has style, but it's also slow to charge, and the infotainment is laggy. For its third incarnation, the Mini Countryman now comes in an all-electric variant. The Countryman is Mini's take on the family car, a compact crossover with bold design both inside and out. At a time when far too many automakers are supersizing their vehicles, Mini's offerings are still right-sized, even if the Countryman is a bit bigger thanthe model it replaces. But at times, you might be left feeling that style took preference over substance. The previous Countryman was available with the brand's only plug-in hybrid powertrain, but Mini now only offers the Countryman with either an internal combustion engine or as a full battery electric vehicle. Consequently, the Countryman SE is a fair bit more expensive now, starting at $45,200 before any tariffs are taken into account. Much of that money has gone to more lithium-ion—66.5 kWh in total (64.7 kWh useable), coupled to a pair of electric motors with a combined output of 308 hp (230 kW) and 364 lb-ft (494 Nm). That's sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 212 miles (341 km), although that might be a little on the conservative side. Based on the past few hundred miles, the test car we spent a week with averaged 3.4 miles/kWh (18.3 miles/kWh), which should allow for 220 miles (354 km) on a single charge, at least in good weather. Mini quotes a 30-minute time to fast-charge the battery from 10 to 80 percent at a peak of 130 kW. In practice, we weren't able to get close to that. The first DC charger I plugged into, at just 16 percent state of charge, wouldn't deliver more than 55 kW. Swapping to a different charger, the rate increased to a peak of 67 kW, but it still took over 45 minutes to reach 80 percent SoC. A level 2 AC charge at 9.6 kW should completely charge the battery in eight hours, Mini says. Ever since its 21st-century rebirth, Mini has brought a sense of whimsy to its designs, particularly the interior styling. Gone are most of the toggle switches (and the little safety protrusions that accompanied them) on the dashboard, with the exception of one for changing between drive, reverse, and neutral, plus another to switch between drive modes. A third knob is the Countryman's twist-to-start control. Pretty much everything else is shuffled off to the infotainment system, a single circular touchscreen that lives in the middle of the dash. (A small heads-up display in front of the driver also shows critical information like speed while on the go.) There are eight different drive modes, each with its own UI for the screen: Core, Go-Kart, Green, Vivid, Timeless, Balance, Personal, and Trail. Unfortunately, the lag when toggling between modes has persisted fromthe preproduction Countryman we sampled last yearto the production car we tested last month, despite several software updates since then. It's as if the infotainment system has an underpowered processor or not enough memory to do the things it wants to do without making you wait. Green is the eco mode, which changes the throttle map and turns down the climate control to eke out a few more miles of range. I'm not sure I detected a huge amount of difference in the driving behavior between Mid, Core, Vivid, Timeless, or Balance, but I did like the cream-colored retro dials in Timeless, which call back to the original Minis of the sixties. You may be unsurprised to learn that I liked Go-Kart—even the very Mario-like \"yahoo\" that plays as you switch to this mode. It suits the Countryman's peppy power delivery and very quick steering, which is surprisingly direct, even for a small car. Sadly, the steering is devoid of feel, but there is a lot of grip from the high-profile 18-inch tires. You might want to turn the radio up at speed; wind noise is very noticeable at above 60 mph (97 km/h). An added benefit of the smaller tires is that they provide a decent ride over potholes. Our test car was specced with the $3,200 Iconic Trim, which adds a better Harmon Kardon sound system, among other things, but it also lets you choose from either 18-inch or 19-inch wheels. It's refreshing that in this case, this press car was specced with the smaller ones. Like just about every Mini I have driven, I found the Countryman's brakes a little too grabby in terms of initial bite. That also applied to one-pedal driving mode when the maximum amount of lift-off regeneration is selected. In addition to the infotainment system's lag, I had to reconnect my phone to the Mini's Bluetooth network every time I got in it. The car also failed to remember any of the radio channels I had set previously. It's possible this was a consequence of using a guest profile for the infotainment system, but it's inconsistent with the behavior I've experienced in the past, so I'm calling it a bug—and one that really bugged me during my week with the Mini. The compact electric crossover market is not quite as well-served by automakers as the luxury SUV segment, but there is some competition for customers. The Mini Countryman's biggest problem is probably the Hyundai Kona EV, which not only goes a lot further on a single charge but also has a starting price that's more than $12,000 cheaper, albeit with about 100 hp (75 kW) less to play with. That puts the Mini's style at one heck of a premium. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Framework’s cheaper, colorful Laptop 12 up for preorder, starts at $549 bare-bones",
    "article_text": "Tariffs mean US pricing/availability for some Framework parts is still in flux. Framework isopeningUS preorders for its new Laptop 12 today, a couple of months afterannouncing the systemat an event in February. Framework's DIY edition of the laptop, which is missing RAM, an SSD, a USB-C charger, and an OS and requires some assembly, will start at $549. A fully assembled pre-built version with 8GB of RAM, a 500GB SSD, a 60 W charger, and Windows 11 Home starts at $799. All preorders placed on Framework's site require a $100 deposit, and almost all configurations begin shipping in July. A first batch of systems is slated to ship in June, but this requiresa $250 donation to Hack Club; Framework says the donation will be used to buy Framework 12 laptops for high school students. The Laptop 12 was built to be a more budget-friendly system, which is reflected in its specs, screen size, and its mostly plastic construction. But like the Laptop 13, the Laptop 12 prioritizes upgradeability and repairability and retains the USB-C-based Expansion Card system that was the Laptop 13's biggest innovation when it was introduced. Each Laptop 12 has four Expansion Card bays plus a headphone jack, allowing the installation of USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports, as well as the other Expansion Cards Framework offers. The Laptop 12's specs fall far short of what is available for the Framework Laptop 13. You have a choice of 2-year-old 13th-generation Intel Core processors, either a Core i3-1315U (2 P-cores, 4 E-cores) or a Core i5-1334U (2 P-cores, 8 E-cores). This is a totally different motherboard than the Laptop 13 uses, so they won't be interchangeable, and you'll need to wait for a Laptop 12-specific upgrade if you're looking to freshen up your laptop a couple of years from now. There's only one RAM slot instead of two, though it supports up to 48GB of DDR5-5200 and one M.2 SSD slot. A 12.2-inch 1920×1200 touchscreen rounds out the specs. Framework ships a color-matched stylus for this touchscreen, which charges via USB-C and has a removable lithium-ion battery that you can replace when it wears out. Any stylus that supports the Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP) orversion 2.0 of the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standardshould also work with the laptop's screen. At about 2.87 pounds, the Laptop 12 is a bit heavier than other laptops in its size class—the 12.4-inch Surface Laptop Go is 2.49 pounds—but as with the Laptop 13, you make small sacrifices on size and weight in the interest of repairability. The Laptop 12 comes in 12 different two-tone color schemes: black, gray, lavender, bubblegum, and sage. The pre-built system is only available in black. For all other colors, you'll need to buy the DIY edition. Earlier this week, Framework hadpaused US salesfor some entry-level Laptop 13 models because of the Trump administration's across-the-board import tariffs for countries like Taiwan, where Framework does much of its manufacturing. A 90-day \"pause\" for the largest of these tariffs has allowed Framework to resume sales \"on items we manufacture in Taiwan\"at their original pricing. Salesremain pausedfor some of Framework's \"lowest-priced base systems.\" Elevated tariffs on Chinese imports are still in place; they're currently \"at least\"145 percentaccording to the administration, a number that has increased multiple times in the last week. That will affect some of Framework's components, according to the company, including \"bezels, Expansion Cards, and input modules for the Framework 16.\" For those components, \"US pricing reflects the elevated module costs due to tariffs.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Car safety experts at NHTSA, which regulates Tesla, axed by DOGE",
    "article_text": "Tesla has a lot riding on the swift success of its so-called Full Self-Driving software. Job cuts at the US traffic safety regulator instigated by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency disproportionately hit staff assessing self-driving risks, hampering oversight of technology on which the world’s richest man has staked the future of Tesla. Of roughly 30 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration workers dismissed in February as part of Musk’s campaign to shrink the federal workforce, many were in the “office of vehicle automation safety,” people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times. The cuts are part of mass firings by Doge that have affected at least 20,000 federal employees and raised widespread concern over potential conflicts of interest for Musk given many of the targeted agencies regulate or have contracts with his businesses. The NHTSA, which has been a thorn in Tesla’s side for years, has eight active investigations into the company after receiving—and publishing—more than 10,000 complaints from members of the public. Morale at the agency, which has ordered dozens of Tesla recalls and delayed the rollout of the group’s self-driving and driver-assistance software, has plunged following Doge’s opening salvo of job cuts, according to current and former NHTSA staff. “There is a clear conflict of interest in allowing someone with a business interest influence over appointments and policy at the agency regulating them,” said one former senior NHTSA figure, who was not among the Doge-led layoffs. Remaining agency employees are now warily watching the experience of other federal regulators that have crossed Musk’s companies. “Musk has attacked the Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission to benefit SpaceX,” said another former top official at the regulator. “Why would he spare NHTSA?” Musk has repeatedly clashed with federal and state authorities. Last year he called for the FAA chief to resign and sharply criticized the FCC for revoking a 2022 deal for his satellite telecommunications company Starlink to provide rural broadband. The NHTSA said in a statement that safety remained its top priority and that it would enforce the law on any carmaker in line with its rules and investigations. “The agency’s investigations have been and will continue to be independent,” it added. Musk, Doge, and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The dismissals, instigated by email on Valentine’s Day, affected roughly 4 percent of the agency’s 800 staff and included employees who had been promised promotions as well as newly hired workers, according to seven people familiar with the matter. Staff working on vehicle automation safety were disproportionately affected, some of the people said, because the division was only formed in 2023 so comprised many newer hires still on probation. The email cited poor performance as a reason for the dismissals. However, one senior figure still at the NHTSA rejected the notion that this was the basis for the layoffs. Another said morale was low after “some huge talent losses.” Doge’s actions could hamper Tesla’s plans, according to one laid-off agency worker, who said the dismissals would “certainly weaken NHTSA’s ability to understand self-driving technologies.” “This is an office that should be on the cutting edge of how to handle AVs [autonomous vehicles] and figuring out what future rulemaking should look like,” said another former NHTSA employee. “It would be ironic if Doge slowed down Tesla.” The company has a lot riding on the swift success of its so-called Full Self-Driving software. Musk has promised customers and investors that Tesla will launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, by June and start production of a fleet of autonomous “cybercabs” next year. To do so, Tesla needs an exemption from the NHTSA to operate a non-standard driverless vehicle on American roads because Musk’s cybercabs have neither pedals nor a steering wheel. “Letting Doge fire those in the autonomous division is sheer madness—we should be lobbying to add people to NHTSA,” said one manager at Tesla. They “need to be developing a national framework for AVs, otherwise Tesla doesn’t have a prayer for scale in FSD or robotaxis.” The NHTSA’s decision on the cybercab exemption and the future of its proposed AV STEP program to evaluate and oversee driverless and assisted cars will be closely watched considering the high stakes for Tesla. Current and former NHTSA officials have privately expressed concerns about Musk’s ambitious rollout plans and how he would wield his influence to ensure a speedy launch of the cybercab and unsupervised FSD on US roads. The government could “speed up the [AV STEP] application process and weaken it in some way so the safety case is less onerous to meet,” one person told the FT. The future of crash reporting is another area of concern for those at the agency, following reports that the Trump administration may seek to loosen or eliminate disclosure rules. After a spate of incidents, the NHTSA in 2021 introduced a standing general order that requires carmakers to report within 24 hours any serious accidents involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance or automated driving systems. Enforcing the order has been a vital tool for the agency to launch investigations into Tesla and other carmakers because there is no federal regulatory framework to govern cars not under human control. It was critical for a recall of 2 million Teslas in December 2023 for an update that would force drivers to pay attention when its autopilot assistance software was engaged. “Crash reporting is vital, the massive Tesla recall on autopilot could not have occurred without it. We got a huge amount of info on crashes and followed up with demands for more data and video,” said one person involved in the recall. “But everything seems to be fair game right now.” One person familiar with Musk’s thinking said the company felt unfairly penalized by the rules because its sensors and video recording are more advanced than rivals’ so it files more complete data. “Reporters see that we are reporting more incidents—many of which have nothing to do with autopilot—and have told the wrong story about our safety record,” the person said. “There is a healthy amount of frustration about that dynamic... the idea our bar for safety is lower is just wrong.” The NHTSA has shown no signs of backing down, overseeing three new recalls of Tesla vehicles since Trump took office, most recently ordering 46,000 Cybertrucks to be checked after discovering an exterior panel was prone to falling off because of faulty glue. Of its eight active investigations into Tesla vehicles, five concern Musk’s claims about the capabilities of the company’s Autopilot driver-assistance system and its FSD software—central promises of Tesla’s value proposition and the subject of thousands of consumer complaints. The agency has received an average of 20 per month on FSD since the software was launched, according to an FT analysis of more than 10,000 complaints. A sharp rise in complaints about so-called “phantom braking” at the start of 2022 triggered one of the investigations. In one, about a mid-October 2024 incident, a Tesla Model 3 in FSD suddenly stopped in front of a car that would have crashed into it had the Tesla driver not taken back control of the vehicle and accelerated. “Software is so far from being ready to be safely used,” the Model 3 driver said in the complaint. While multiple Tesla tech updates in the past two years have reduced complaints about braking glitches, other software issues persist. The FT analysis, which used artificial intelligence to categorize complaints, shows errors connected to driver-assist tools such as FSD and Autopilot still make up a large share of complaints made against the company in the past year. In February, the driver of a 2024 Cybertruck reported that FSD disengaged without warning, causing the vehicle to suddenly accelerate and nearly collide head-on with another car. The owner said they contacted Tesla service but the vehicle was neither inspected nor repaired. Former Apple executive Jonathan Morrison has been nominated by Trump as the NHTSA’s next administrator and must find a way to navigate the agency through the perceived conflicts of interest with Musk, without being accused of stifling AV innovation. “Elon has done a lot of really interesting things with tech that were thought to be impossible,” said one former top NHTSA official. “What concerns me is that Tesla is not known for taking a slow and methodical approach; they move fast and break things, and people are at risk because of that. There have been preventable deaths, so it’s an immediate concern for us.” © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "Google Pixel 9a review: All the phone you need",
    "article_text": "The Pixel 9a looks great and shoots lovely photos, but it's light on AI. It took a few years, but Google's Pixel phones have risen to the top of the Android ranks, and its new Pixel 9a keeps most of what has made flagship Pixel phones so good, including the slick software and versatile cameras. Despite arevamped design and larger battery, Google has maintained the $499 price point oflast year's phone, undercutting other \"budget\" devices like theiPhone 16e. However, hitting this price point involves trade-offs in materials, charging, and—significantly—the on-device AI capabilities compared to its pricier siblings. None of those are deal-breakers, though. In fact, the Pixel 9a may be coming along at just the right time. As we enter a period of uncertainty for imported gadgets, a modestly priced phone with lengthy support could be the perfect purchase. The Pixel 9a sports the same rounded corners and flat edges we've seen on other recent smartphones. The aluminum frame has a smooth, almost silky texture, with rolled edges that flow into the front and back covers. On the front, there's a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3, which has been a mainstay of budget phones for years. On the back, Google used recycled plastic with a matte finish. It attracts more dust and grime than glass, but it doesn't show fingerprints as clearly. The plastic doesn't feel as solid as the glass backs on Google's more expensive phones, and the edge where it meets the aluminum frame feels a bit more sharp and abrupt than the glass on Google's flagship phones. Were it not for the \"G\" logo emblazoned on the back, you might not recognize the Pixel 9a as a Google phone. It lacks the camera bar that has been central to the design language of all Google's recent devices, opting instead for a sleeker flat design. The move to a pOLED display saved a few millimeters, giving the designers a bit more internal volume. In the past, Google has always pushed toward thinner and thinner Pixels, but it retained the same 8.9 mm thickness for the Pixel 9a. Rather than shave off a millimeter, Google equipped the Pixel 9a with a 5,100 mAh battery, which is the largest ever in a Pixel, even beating out the larger and more expensive Pixel 9 Pro XL by a touch. The camera module on the back is almost flush with the body of the phone, rising barely a millimeter from the surrounding plastic. The phone feels more balanced and less top-heavy than phones that have three or four cameras mounted to chunky aluminum surrounds. The buttons on the right edge are the only other disruptions to the phone's clean lines. They, too, are aluminum, with nice, tactile feedback and no detectable wobble. Aside from a few tiny foibles, the build quality and overall feel of this phone are better than we'd expect for $499. The 6.3-inch OLED is slightly larger than last year's, and it retains the chunkier bezels of Google's A-series phones. While the flagship Pixels are all screen from the front, there's a sizable gap between the edge of the OLED and the aluminum frame. That means the body is a few millimeters larger than it probably had to be—the Pixel 9 Pro has the same display size, and it's a bit more compact, for example. Still, the Pixel 9a does not look or feel oversized. The OLED is sharp enough at 1080p and has an impressively high peak brightness, making it legible outdoors. However, the low-brightness clarity falls short of what you get with more expensive phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or Galaxy S25. The screen supports a 120 Hz refresh rate, but that's disabled by default. This panel does not use LTPO technology, which makes higher refresh rates more battery-intensive. There's a fingerprint scanner under the OLED, but it has not been upgraded to ultrasonic along with the flagship Pixels. This one is still optical—it works quickly enough, but it lights up dark rooms and lacks reliability compared to ultrasonic sensors. Google took a page from Apple when it debuted its custom Tensor mobile processorswith the Pixel 6. Now, Google uses Tensor processors in all its phones, giving a nice boost to budget devices like the Pixel 9a. The Pixel 9a has a Tensor G4, which is identical to the chip in the Pixel 9 series, save for a slightly different modem. While Tensor is not a benchmark speed demon like the latest silicon from Qualcomm or Apple, it does not feel slow in daily use. A chip like the Snapdragon 8 Elite puts up huge benchmark numbers, but it doesn't run at that speed for long. Qualcomm's latest chips can lose half their speed to heat, but Tensor only drops by about a third during extended load. However, even after slowing down, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is a faster gaming chip than Tensor. If playing high-end games likeDiablo ImmortalandGenshin Impactis important to you, you can do better than the Pixel 9a (and other Pixels). In general use, the Pixel 9a is more than fast enough that you won't spend time thinking about the Tensor chip. Apps open quickly, animations are unerringly smooth, and the phone doesn't get too hot. There are some unavoidable drawbacks to its more limited memory, though. Apps don't stay in memory as long or as reliably as they do on the flagship Pixels, for instance. There are also some AI limitations we'll get to below. With a 5,100 mAh battery, the Pixel 9a has more capacity than any other Google phone. Combined with the 1080p screen, the 9a gets much longer battery life than the flagship Pixels. Google claims about 30 hours of usage per charge. In our testing, this equates to a solid day of heavy use with enough left in the tank that you won't feel the twinge of range anxiety as evening approaches. If you're careful, you might be able to make it two days without a recharge. As for recharging, Google could do better—the Pixel 9a manages just 23 W wired and 7.5 W wireless, and the flagship Pixels are only a little faster. Companies like OnePlus and Motorola offer phones that charge several times faster than Google's. Google's Pixel software is one of the primary reasons to buy its phones. There's no bloatware on the device when you take it out of the box, which saves you from tediously extracting a dozen sponsored widgets and microtransaction-laden games right off the bat. Google's interface design is also our favorite right now, with a fantastic implementation of Material You theming that adapts to your background colors. The Pixel version of Android 15 also comes with a raft of thoughtful features, like the anti-spammer Call Screen and Direct My Call to help you navigate labyrinthine phone trees. Gemini is also built into the phone, fully replacing thenow-doomedGoogle Assistant. Google notes that Gemini on the 9a can take action across apps, which is technically true. Gemini can look up data from one supported app and route it to another at your behest, but only when it feels like it. Generative AI is still unpredictable, sodon't bank on Gemini being a good assistant just yet. Google's more expensive Pixels also have the above capabilities, but they go further with AI. Google's on-device Gemini Nano model is key to some of the newest and more interesting AI features, but large language models (even the small ones) need a lot of RAM. The 9a's less-generous 8GB of RAM means it runs a less-capable version of the AIknown as Gemini Nano XXSthat only supports text input. As a result, many of theAI features Google was promoting around the Pixel 9 launchjust don't work. For example, there's no Pixel Screenshots app or Call Notes. Even some features that seem like they should work, like AI weather summaries, are absent on the Pixel 9a. Recorder summaries are supported, but Gemini Nano has a verynanocontext window. We tested with recordings ranging from two to 20 minutes, and the longer ones surpassed the model's capabilities. Google tells Ars that 2,000 words (about 15 minutes of relaxed conversation) is the limit for Gemini Nano on this phone. If you're the type to avoid AI features, the less-capable Gemini model might not matter. You still get all the other neat Pixel features, along with Google's market-leading support policy. This phone will get seven years of full update support, including annual OS version bumps and monthly security patches. The 9a is also entitled to special quarterly Pixel Drop updates, which bring new (usually minor) features. Most OEMs struggle to provide even half the support for their phones. Samsung is neck and neck with Google, but its updates are often slower and more limited on older phones. Samsung's vision for mobile AI is much less fleshed out than Google's, too. Even with the Pixel 9a's disappointing Gemini Nano capabilities, we expect Google to make improvements to all aspects of the software (even AI) over the coming years. The Pixel 9a has just two camera sensors, and it doesn't try to dress up the back of the phone to make it look like there are more, a common trait of other Android phones. There's a new 48 MP camera sensor similar to the one in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which is smaller and less capable than the main camera in the flagship Pixels. There's also a 13 MP ultrawide lens that appears unchanged from last year. You have to spend a lot more money to get Google's best camera hardware, but conveniently, much of the Pixel magic is in the software. Google's image processing works extremely well, lightening dark areas while also preventing blowout in lighter areas. This impressive dynamic range results in even exposures with plenty of detail, and this is true in all lighting conditions. In dim light, you can use Night Sight to increase sharpness and brightness to an almost supernatural degree. Outside of a few edge cases with unusual light temperature, we've been very pleased with Google's color reproduction, too. The most notable drawback to the 9a's camera is that it's a bit slower than the flagship Pixels. The sensor is smaller and doesn't collect as much light, even compared to the base model Pixel 9. This is more noticeable with shots using Night Sight, which gathers data over several seconds to brighten images. However, image capture is still generally faster than Samsung, OnePlus, and Motorola cameras. Google leans toward keeping shutter speeds high (low exposure time). Outdoors, that means you can capture motion with little to no blur almost as reliably as you can with the Pro Pixels. The 13 MP ultrawide camera is great for landscape outdoor shots, showing only mild distortion at the edges of the frame despite an impressive 120-degree field-of-view. Unlike Samsung and OnePlus, Google also does a good job of keeping colors consistent across the sensors. You can shoot macro photos with the Pixel 9a, but it works a bit differently than other phones. The ultrawide camera doesn't have autofocus, nor is there a dedicated macro sensor. Instead, Google uses AI with the main camera to take close-ups. This seems to work well enough, but details are only sharp around the center of the frame, with ample distortion at the edges. There's no telephoto lens here, but Google's capable image processing helps a lot. The new primary camera sensor probably isn't hurting, either. You can reliably push the 48 MP primary to 2x digital zoom, and Google's algorithms will produce photos that you'd hardly know have been enhanced. Beyond 2x zoom, the sharpening begins to look more obviously artificial. A phone like the Pixel 9 Pro or Galaxy S25 Ultra with 5x telephoto lenses can definitely get sharper photos at a distance, but the Pixel 9a does not do meaningfully worse than phones that have 2–3x telephoto lenses. The Pixel 9a is not a perfect phone, but for $499, it's hard to argue with it. This device has the same great version of Android seen on Google's more expensive phones, along with a generous seven years of guaranteed updates. It also pushes battery life a bit beyond what you can get with other Pixel phones. The camera isn't the best we've seen—that distinction goes to the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. However, it gets closer than a $500 phone ought to. You do miss out on some AI features with the 9a. That might not bother the AI skeptics, but some of these missing on-device features, like Pixel Screenshots and Call Notes, are among the best applications of generative AI we've seen on a phone yet. With years of Pixel Drops ahead of it, the 9a might not have enough muscle to handle Google's future AI endeavors, which could lead to buyer's remorse if AI turns out to be as useful as Google claims it will be. At $499, you'd have to spend $300 more to get to the base model Pixel 9, a phone with weaker battery life and a marginally better camera. That's a tough sell given how good the 9a is. If you're not going for the Pro phones, stick with the 9a. With all the uncertainty over future tariffs on imported products, the day of decent sub-$500 phones could be coming to an end. With long support, solid hardware, and a beefy battery, the Pixel 9a could be the right phone to buy before prices go up.

    "title": "Painted altar in Maya city of Tikal reveals aftermath of ancient coup",
    "article_text": "The altar marks the presence of an enclave of foreign elites from Teotihuacan. A family altar in the Maya city of Tikal offers a glimpse into events in an enclave of the city’s foreign overlords in the wake of a local coup. Archaeologists recently unearthed the altar in a quarter of the Maya city of Tikal that had lain buried under dirt and rubble for about the last 1,500 years. The altar—and the wealthy household behind the courtyard it once adorned—stands just a few blocks from the center of Tikal, one of the most powerful cities of Maya civilization. But the altar and the courtyard around it aren’t even remotely Maya-looking; their architecture and decoration look like they belong 1,000 kilometers to the west in the city of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico. The altar reveals the presence of powerful rulers from Teotihuacan who were there at a time when a coup ousted Tikal’s Maya rulers and replaced them with a Teotihuacan puppet government. It also reveals how hard those foreign rulers fell from favor when Teotihuacan’s power finally waned centuries later. The altar stands in the courtyard of what was once a wealthy, influential person’s home in Tikal. At just over 1 meter tall, spanning nearly 2 meters in length and 1.3 meters wide, the altar is clearly the centerpiece of the limestone patio space. It’s made of carved stone and earthen layers, covered with several smooth, fine plaster coatings. Murals adorn recessed panels on all four sides. In red, orange, yellow, and black, the paintings all depict the face of a person in an elaborate feathered headdress, but each is slightly different. All four versions of the face stare straight at the viewer through almond-shaped eyes. The figure wears the kind of facial piercings that would have marked a person of very high rank in Teotihuacan: a nose bar and spool-shaped ear jewelry (picture a fancy ancient version of modern earlobe plugs). Proyecto Arqueológico del Sur de Tikal archaeologist Edwin Ramirez and his colleagues say the faces on the altar look uncannily like a deity who often shows up in artwork from central Mexico, in the area around Teotihuacan. Archaeologists have nicknamed this deity the Storm God, since they haven’t yet found any trace of its name. It’s a distinctly Teotihuacan-style piece of art, from the architecture of the altar to the style and color of the images and even the techniques used in painting them. Yet it sits in the heart of Tikal, a Maya city. Tikal was one of the biggest and most important cities of the Maya civilization. Founded in 850 BCE, it chugged along for centuries as a small backwater until its sudden rise to wealth and prominence around 100 CE.Lidar surveys of Guatemalahave revealed Tikal’s links with other Maya cities, like Homul. And Tikal also traded with the city of Teotihuacan, more than 1,000 kilometers to the west, in what’s now Mexico. “These powers of central Mexico reached into the Maya world because they saw it as a place of extraordinary wealth, of special feathers from tropical birds, jade, and chocolate,” says Brown University archaeologist Stephen Houston, a co-author of the recent study, in a statement. “As far as Teotihuacan was concerned, it was the land of milk and honey.” Trade with Teotihuacan brought wealth to Tikal, but the Maya city seems to have attracted too much attention from its more powerful neighbor. A carved stone unearthed in Tikal in the 1960s describes how Teotihuacan swooped in around 378 CE to oust Tikal’s king and replace him with a puppet ruler. Spanish-language sources call this coup d’etat the Entrada. The stone is carved in the style of Teotihuacan, but it’s also covered with Maya hieroglyphs, which tell the tale of the conquest. After the Entrada, there are traces of Teotihuacan’s presence all over Tikal, from royal burials in a necropolis to distinctly Mexican architecture mixed with Maya elements in a complex of residential and ceremonial buildings near the heart of the city. And the newly unearthed altar seems to have been built shortly after the Entrada, based on radiocarbon dates from nearby graves in the courtyard and from material used to ritually bury the altar after its abandonment (more on that below). Ramirez and his colleagues write that the altar is “likely evidence of the direct presence of Teotihuacan at Tikal as part of a foreign enclave that coincided with the historic Entrada.” The buildings surrounding the courtyard would have been a residential compound for wealthy elites in the city; it’s not far from the city's center with its temples and huge public plazas. Residents had used the courtyard as a private family ceremonial space for decades or even a couple of centuries before its owners installed the altar. And Ramirez and his colleagues say it’s no coincidence that archaeologists have found many such courtyards in Teotihuacan, which people also used as a space for household ceremonies like burials and offerings to the gods. “What the altar confirms is that wealthy leaders from Teotihuacan came to Tikal and created replicas of ritual facilities that would have existed in their home city. It shows Teotihuacan left a heavy imprint there,” says Houston. And in the Maya world, as in the world of Teotihuacan, ceremonial spaces usually come with skeletons included. Ramirez and his colleagues unearthed the grave of an adult buried beneath the patio, in a tomb with limestone walls and a stucco floor. Nearby, a child had been buried in a seated position—something rare in Tikal but very common in Teotihuacan. The child’s burial radiocarbon-dated to decades before the Entrada, between 205 and 350 CE. It looks like someone buried both of these people beneath the floor of the courtyard of their residential compound not long after they moved in; it’s a good bet that they were members of the family who once lived here, but archaeologists don’t know for sure. These kinds of burials would have been exactly the sort of household ritual the courtyard was meant for. Sometime later—between 380 and 540 CE, based on radiocarbon dating—the people living in the compound buried the courtyard beneath a layer of dirt and rubble, laid a new floor over it, and essentially started over. This is when Ramirez and his colleagues say someone built and painted the altar. It’s also when someone buried three babies in the courtyard, each near a corner of the altar (the fourth corner has a jar that probably once contained an offering, but no bones). Each burial required breaking the stone floor, placing the tiny remains underneath, and then filling in the hole with crushed limestone. That’s not the way most people in Tikal would have buried an infant, but it’s exactly how archaeologists have found several buried in very similar courtyards in faraway Teotihuacan. In other words, the people who lived in this compound and used this courtyard and painted altar were probably from Teotihuacan or raised in a Teotihuacan enclave in the southern sector of Tikal. The compound is practically in the shadow of a replica of Teotihuacan’s Feathered Serpent Pyramid and its walled plaza, where archaeologists unearthed Teotihuacan-style incense burners made from local materials. Sometime between 550 CE and 654 CE, based on radiocarbon dating, the foreign enclave in Tikal closed up shop. That's around the time distant Teotihuacan’s power was starting to collapse. But it wasn’t enough to just leave; important buildings had to be ritually “killed” and buried. That meant burning the area around the altar, but it also meant that people buried the altar, the courtyard, the compound, and most of southern Tikal’s Teotihuacan enclave beneath several meters of dirt and rubble. Whoever did the burying went to the trouble of making the whole thing look like a natural hill. Ramirez and his colleagues say that’s unusual, because typically once a building had been ritually killed and abandoned, something new would be built atop the remains. “The Maya regularly buried buildings and rebuilt on top of them,” Brown University archaeologist Andrew Scherer, a co-author of the recent study, said in a statement. “But here, they buried the altar and surrounding buildings and just left them, even though this would have been prime real estate centuries later. They treated it almost like a memorial or a radioactive zone. It probably spoke to the complicated feelings they had about Teotihuacan.” Antiquity, 2017. DOI:10.15184/aqy.2025.3(About DOIs).

    "title": "Read the Conclusion of This Month’s Epic and Excellent Lightspeed Short Story",
    "article_text": "io9 is proud to present fiction from Lightspeed Magazine. Once a month, we featurea story fromLightspeedâs current issue. This monthâs selection is âDoes Harlen Lattner Dream of Infected Sheep? (Part 2)â by Sarah Langan. You canread Part 1 here. Enjoy! February 4, 2034: AI Compendium: Classified documents stolen from Congo last year were released this morning. These indicate morally, ethically, and legally dubious research on their own workforce as they seek more productive employees. The Attorney General of Virginia, which has jurisdiction, says it has no comment. Congo released a statement this afternoon:We at Congo believe in the essential value of every human being. Weâve devoted our lives to making the world safer and more efficient for their benefit. In other news, excess deaths increased eightfold this week and are all linked to heart attacks, seizures, and abdominal hernias among otherwise healthy individuals. All deceased are Congo interface users. Congo denies any connection. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ That night Lattner had a panic attack. Heâd never had one before but as a physician, understood that his heart, pulsing at just eighty-five beats per minute, was under no serious threat. Still, it felt like he was changing. It felt, for just a heated, sweaty moment, that his organs had slipped and realigned. He called his kids and neither answered so he took a deep breath and called Lorna. âIâm at work,â she said, âbut like I told you, Congo promised to keep them safe and healthy. I can see them through the camera. Theyâre fine.â âSend me the password for the stream on them or Iâm calling the cops.â âAnd saying what?â she asked. âAnything. Everything. Send it. Iâm their father. I have a right.â âSince when? Our whole lives together I donât think you changed a single diaper. What are you talking about?â She could be such a pain in the ass. He really hated her sometimes. And then he thought: Was he supposed to have changed diapers? Did she have a point? âIâm worried. IâmÂ .Â .Â . Jesus, Iâm sick with worry. I think I might even be worried about you. Help me out, here, Lorna.â âYouâre worried about me,â she said, not like a question, but like a statement she was controverting. âI am,â he said. âYou jackass. I had a nervous breakdown. We never called it that; you couldnât stand to hear it, but thatâs what it was. Ten years ago. I was in a mental hospital for three months and you never visited me. Do you remember that? You werenât so worried about me, then.â âI visited,â he said. âNo,â she said. âNot once. I used to sit there on visitorâs day like a jerk. You never even brought the kids. I missed them so much.â âThatâs impossible,â Lattner said, his heart beating fast all over again. âNo! Wait! I remember. We decided you needed the time to yourself.â âYou decided,â she said. âI never got a say in anything.â Lattnerâs heart thudded in his throat. He surveyed his small apartment, thinking it was dumb to have picked the one here, when across town thereâd been a complex with a pool that the kids might have liked. Thinking he should have hung posters in their rooms or made their beds so they didnât have to bring their own sheets and towels. âI feel so sick,â he said. âI feel like Iâm dying.â âLattner,â she said, her voice soft. âWhatâs wrong with you? Why canât you talk about anything important?â âI donât know,â he said, and now he was crying, his speech broken and shaking. âI donât mean to be this person.â âOkay,â she said. âIâm sending the link. Theyâre okay and Iâm okay,â she said. âThanks,â he said, weeping now. Soon after, he watched them in their rooms through ceiling mounted cameras. They were aware of these cameras but had mostly forgotten about them. Bea was tuned to a streamie in her bedroom. Lattner counter her respiration. Nine breaths per minute. This was low, even for a resting rate, but not alarmingly so. He zoomed in, tried to see her skin—was she pale? But the resolution wasnât strong enough. Dylan was jerking off, his respiration slightly elevated. Lattner felt a measure of compunction about this. Still, he zoomed to see what the kid was looking at. A man? A woman? This, too, was out of focus. He couldnât tell. But they were alive, at least. Not sick. A kind of trilling panic inside him suddenly eased. What was this emotion? Relief. Jesus, heâd never felt this way about any of his family while he had them. Lornaâd asked a good question: why now? A kind of compulsion took over after that. He wrote Bea a letter: Honey, Itâs your dad, Harlen Lattner. I feel I should let you know that I love you and Iâm sorry if I have not been a good father to you. I have wanted to do right by you but I believe I was afraid that anything I touched would only result in disaster. I wonder now whether I erred. I should also tell you that you are not alone in your sadness. I was on the very same medication you are now taking for depression. I have always felt very badly that you inherited this from me. Though in hindsight I wonder whether both our emotional troubles are caused, not by genes at all, but environment. Iâll not bore you with the details of my own upbringing, except to say that I never feel free or good or of any value at all. It could not have been easy, when your mother got so sick, that I doubled down on work and disappeared, too. I was additionally upset when you got your diagnosis because there is a correlation with what we have and suicide. This possibility was so deplorable to me that I could not speak it, or acknowledge any problem at all. Fondly, Dad (Harlen Lattner) Dylan, Itâs your dad, Harlen Lattner. It occurs to me that we have never had a good relationship. Iâve always felt itâs because you hate me and believe Iâm a bad husband to your mother. But I wonder if I only projected this, and felt so bad about it that I stayed away from you. I assumed Iâd earned your hate and so accepted it without ever questioning it. It lately occurs to me that perhaps your feelings are your own and not entirely caused by my existence. So I suppose I should ask: why are you so angry? Can I help? Additionally, Iâd like to let you know that my own father was a malignant presence in my life. I absented myself from knowing you, I assumed that my absence could only be an improvement. But sons ought to have fathers. These fathers ought to approve of them. Perhaps you will allow me to get to know you better, so that I might be able to confer that judgment. Yours sincerely, Your father, Harlen Lattner Lattner read these a few times, agonizing over them, and ultimately decided not to send them. They seemed self-indulgent and he couldnât get the words right. What he did realize, through writing them, was that he loved his children. It was absurd that heâd ever convinced himself otherwise. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Feeling calmer, he searched the streamies that night for news, then scoured the social networks. At first he found nothing, but in the wee small hours of the morning, he found an encrypted site reachable only by anonymous browsers. On this were thousands of anecdotes reporting sickness and death but also and more often, that loved ones werenât behaving as they should. Theyâd developed flat affects. They didnât remember personal information. They seemed dazed. The posters were attributing this to the Congo update. The name the group gave it wasThe Great Amnesia. When dawn arrived, he called Lorna. She didnât answer the first ten times, which seemed fair. When she finally did answer, she was pissed off, which also seemed fair. âAre you hearing anything in your department about the Congo update?â he asked. âLike?â She had this way of never being surprised. Aliens could jump out of their ship and present her with petunias and sheâd say:Thatâs nice. Iâm late, though. And then he remembered that she hadnât always been like that. It was only after her breakdown that sheâd disconnected from him and the rest of them. Before that, sheâd been eager and interested. âUh, all these dead people? The personality disorders? Theyâre attributing it to the Congo update.â âThatâs just crazy people.â âMaybe not. You should stay home. All of you. Let me come over. I can help.â She lowered her voice as if someone might be listening. âEven if there is a connection, what do you think you can do about it? Theyâre safe. Iâve been assured.â âWhatâs causing it?â âOther than the update? No one knows. But theyâre working on it. Everyoneâs working on it. No one wanted this outcome.â âHow long have you known?â âI donât know now. Nothingâs explicit. Iâm connecting dots.â He leaned into the wall. It was strange, you can play-act a life with someone for decades, and then the playâs done. âThe hospital is about to make consoles mandatory. Were you even going to warn me?â âNo,â she said. âI told you; theyâre fixing it. The media has it all overblown. Itâs a few isolated incidents. Thereâs no reason to warn anyone.â âCan you take their consoles away until this is sorted?â âIâm serious right now. I want a real answer. Why do you suddenly care about them? Is this all to punish me? Why canât you just let me have them?â she asked. âI always cared about them. I care about you. I just didnât know it,â he said. She sighed deep and long. Then, she hung up. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He was at work an hour later and what he did when he got there was ill advised. Dumb, even. He buzzed himself into the morgue. The bodies in the freezer were stacked in long drawers, none locked. A few medical examiners were hanging around but they stayed in their lanes and didnât ask questions. He opened the chest-high drawer in the center. Jane Doe. He unzipped the black bag and conducted an autopsy. Janeâs chest cavity was a wild growth of pink tissue. A tube ran from throat and then went spherical, its gills upright in a protean stew of fluid. The tubing was tangled, and where it knotted it had bulged into a bubble-gum-like rupture, just like with his initial patient. The human body is very complex. It needs sleep to keep its brain fresh; it needs food every few hours, it needs water constantly. It needs an endless supply of oxygen. It has to eliminate the waste products of metabolic reactions at least five times a day. But this system wasnât complex. Pink fluid pulsed, replacing the heart and its blood. Gills received this fluid and presumably extracted oxygen. This digestive, circulatory, and pulmonary tract was much simpler. Like a hydra. He stitched Jane up, went through five more bodies. One body looked normal. The other two had this same fungal-type disease. He took a tissue sample under the microscope. The cells were clearly defined and cholesterol rich. They werenât fungal. They were human. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ It would probably take a few days before anyone reported that heâd broken into the morgue. Someone would have to complain, and then a higher up would have to review the video, figure out it wasnât typical and send it up the food chain. Up the food chain, someone would have to identify him, make a decision, send that decision down. The Congo algorithm was great when things were predictable. In randomness, it was molasses in winter. At work, triage was a mess and so was surgical. The floor was wet with Pepto Bismol-colored blood. The patients werenât making it to surgery in time; were dying in gurneys. Before his shift ended he found himself in surgery with the same procedure. This time he didnât hesitate. He reached in with his hands and untangled the intestine. Jane Doeâs body stopped seizing. He visited Tucker Rhodesâ office once his shift was done. âHey! Any news on all this? Did anybody ever call you back?â Tucker took a second to process what heâd said, and Congo answered. âThe system cannot process the information.â âRight,â Lattner said. âWe know that. But did you hear anything from your dad?â Tucker bent down, listening to his headset. âIâm sorry. I have filing. Iâm not on break right now.â â¢Â â¢Â â¢ February 9, 2034 To: Mica Peters, Congo CEO Lorna Lattner, Department of Innovation, Legal Frank Henry, Congo Trust Reserve, Applications From: Paul Mackenzie, R&D Simon Iscariott, R&D Lucas Johnson, R&D To our senior officers, It is with some surprise that weâve received the results of the Congo 5.0 rollout. It appears that the application has had a physiological affect on the majority of users. Perhaps all users? Our working theory is this: when the Congo app activated transmogrification genes to make users more docile and efficient during their workdays (slower metabolisms, disconnected minds), we accidentally initiated the metamorphosis of the human species into a simpler life form. In addition, .01% of users experience intestinal knotting during metamorphosis, which is fatal unless addressed surgically. Another .01% experience psychotic episodes resulting in suicide. Itâs imperative we keep this secret to prevent widespread panic. As I type, our brilliant researchers are working toward cures. Guys, this was a total accident! â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Lattner documented everything heâd learned and seen since opening up John Doe and sent it to the anonymous website. The kids were coming for their bimonthly weekend visit the next night. He was thinking about spying on them to make sure they werenât sick, when Gerry showed up for their date. Gerry arrived carrying a bag full of weird sex paraphernalia. Possibly some of it was ordinary sex paraphernalia. Lattnerâd spent most of his life too afraid to investigate such things. âMy husbandâs gone,â Gerry said. âDead? Thatâs awful. How?â âNo. Theyâre flushing us out. Congo raised our rent. It owns the building. He moved into the warehouse. Congo offered these sleep pods for everybody. Itâs cheaper. He says he doesnât care about material things anymore. Or Congo says it. Who knows, he never takes those headphones off.â They had crazy sex that night. Sex Lattner had never imagined. Sex that answered questions. Sex that meant nothing. Sex that meant everything. âI should quit my job and move in with you,â Gerry said as they lay in bed. Lattner went rigid. âSame old Harlen,â Gerry said. Lattner felt that, and felt bad about that, but couldnât bring himself to do anything about it. Gerry said he wasnât hungry. His stomach had been sour. He hadnât been sleeping well, either. Lattner placed his hand on Gerryâs belly. It pulsed worryingly. âYou might have that thing going around,â he said. He was panting suddenly, his forehead slick with sweat. âWhy donât you come with me to the hospital. I can run some tests.â âYou donât have to take care of me,â Gerry said, wounded just like he used to be wounded. âIâm not your obligation.â Lattner kissed him goodbye at the door, feeling strangely like, if he did not get down on his knees andbegGerry to stay, that the attachment between them, tenuous invisible strings that had persisted over so many years, would finally tear. Gerry left. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ The hospital the next day was quieter. Fewer patients were exhibiting abdominal or cardiac symptoms. The employees seemed especially quiet, too. In the absence of the emergent or new they tuned out, let their headsets do the thinking. At last, the day had come and mandatory headsets were issued to all the docs on staff. Lattner tried his. The voice inside lulled literal sweet nothings (shoo be do la lume di lee). Staccato prompts in the music told him when to repeat what the voice was telling him, told him where to put his hands, what tests to run. He spent the day like this, in a kind of floating, even as his body moved. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ His kids arrived late that weekend. Lornaâd delayed them at her house so she could familiarize the new nanny with the routine while she was out of town. Sheâd be relocating to Congo headquarters the following Monday—a cluster of buildings that functioned like a small town for the very top executives—in order to address the update crisis. Sheâd been promised once again that the kids would be safe. This nanny in particular had been debriefed and would make sure they didnât get infected. Sheâd also been told that the headsets represented zero threat. They could all continue wearing them indefinitely. âWeâre too old for a nanny,â Dylan said. Lattner wondered if this changed the custody agreement. If the kids would now stay at his house. Though he wanted them around, he wasnât sure he was ready to have them full time. Worried heâd mess it up. Also, where would he be able to meet-up with Gerry? âThe nannyâs weird,â Beatrice said. âEven when sheâs on break her implants glow green. You clap your hands in front of her and she doesnât blink.â âShe doesnât laugh,â Dylan said. âShe doesnât smile,â Beatrice said. âYeah she does, but itâs a creepy smile. Like the interface told her to.â âYouâre like that sometimes.â âNo, you, asshole.â Theyâd hardly walked in the door, were still bantering. He noticed their pallor was green and they moved too slowly for healthy kids. It set off alarms. Had Congo done this? And how could they know for certain that the headsets werenât a threat? âI have good news and bad news,â Lattner told them. âMy house is a no screenie or interface house. We can read books or talk or whatever we want.â Beatrice and Dylan went simultaneously ballistic. It was like manifesting a tornado. There was literal screaming. There was stomping. He covered his ears at the horrible high-pitched-ness. Heâd played this out in his mind. Theyâd rebel, grabbing interfaces and ignoring him. Bewildered, heâd throw up his hands and give up. Nothing would change but at least heâd be able to tell himself heâd tried. What happened instead was almost worse. They ganged up. They argued relentlessly. Over the following hours, they broke down, weeping. They shouted. They made him feel like a total dipshit. But they never disobeyed him. He went to bed Saturday night close to tears. By Sunday, they were all tired. Listless, they sat together at the kitchen table and played gin rummy. He tried to coax them into eating something—theyâd skipped dinner and breakfast, said their stomachs hurt—and at last managed to foist some crackers. A funny thing happened. The first hour of rummy was excruciating. They werenât the only ones who missed the fucking screenies. But the second hour went very quickly. And somehow, they played into a third hour. When it was time for them to go, they all stood at the door while the ride waited outside. Nobody knew what to do. Typically, the kids showed themselves out. Lattner made the first move. He hugged Bea. Then he hugged Dylan. What surprised him: they hugged back. His eyes were unreasonably wet. He was sniffling, trying not to cry. He looked away from them. It was too hard. Still, he said the words. âI love you. Both of you. Very much. Iâm sorry I havenât said it more often.â Neither Bea nor Dylan answered that. But Bea smiled. Then they were out. He followed them to the street, waved to the car. They looked out, watching him as it carried them away. Dylan offered the tiniest of nods. The rest of the day felt strange and terrifying and wondrous. He imagined this was how real dads felt all the time. Had Lorna endured this weight, this terrible, responsible love all alone? Was that what had broken her, then changed her for the worse? The loneliness of carrying the emotion of an entire family all on her own? â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Work the next day was quiet. The people were quiet, the routines were quiet. There werenât any new patients with abdominal issues. The nurses moved with emotionless efficiency. So did the admins. Only Ocean seemed her usual self. Watching her enter the surgical lounge was like watching a daisy in a windy field of orchids. It bent differently; swaying with greater, wilder life. She saw him right away and sidled up. âIâm going to ask you the same question I asked last time. What is happening?â âYou noticed it, too?â âItâs like sleepwalkers. Only, itâs hard to remember. I keep thinking I should do something but everythingâs so fuzzy.â âMaybe weâre becoming pod people,â he said. They both looked at each other, and yeah, maybe that was the exact truth. Youâd think, under those circumstances, that theyâd both have run screaming from the hospital. Theyâd have tossed Molotov cocktails through windows, shouted from bullhorns. Probably, thatâs exactly what some people did. But not them. To break the tension, Ocean made a raspberry at him. Then the bell rang, signaling the end of their break. His shift ended before Oceanâs and a funny thing happened. They must have threatened her job, because she was wearing her headset. He watched her wind through the halls just like everyone else, her steps preordained to maximize efficiency. Did he look like that? He didnât remember his shifts anymore. They blurred, a set of instructions and music. He didnât remember his patientsâ faces, either. If the intention of 5.0 was to make life more pleasant, it had failed. When the day was done, he didnât feel accomplished. He felt empty. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ After work, he retrieved the photo heâd taken on his phone of that first patientâs Congo employee badge. The first numbers represented a warehouse number—a local one, and the same at which Gerry worked. Lattner ordered a car and took it there. The warehouse was a mammoth building about three city blocks wide. There wasnât security. He drove up and parked in the employee lot. He knocked on the locked main door but no one answered. But this was a new life for Lattner. Heâd had sex with Gerry. Heâd fought with his kids. Heâd told a waitress he was gay. So when he saw the open window, he climbed through with great and pleasant grunting. The building had a utilitarian appearance. No decoration; plaster walls. Signs pointed to the warehouses A, B C, and D, and dorms A, B, C, and D. A reception area was center. There was only a sliding plastic barn door ahead of a low desk. He showed the man at the desk his John Doeâs number. âIâm looking for this employee.â The woman blinked several times, and he had the feeling her eyes were cameras, relaying the employee number directly to Congo. After a long pause, she said: âHeâs in acquisitions, Warehouse C.â He followed that direction. The building was labyrinthine. Got to a door markedacquisitions. Inside, a mammoth warehouse stocked with boxes upon boxes of goods. Employees in Congo uniforms bussed around, plucking items like bees in a hive. He found the foreman, showed the number. Blinking, blinking. âWait,â the foreman said. âHeâs being hailed.â Lattner waited. Waited some more. âHeâs coming?â The guy didnât answer. He was routing someone, relaying someone. A half-hour later, John Doe appeared. He was green-faced but alive. Walking. This was the same man. âHi. I was your surgeon,â Lattner said. âYou walked out of the hospital.â Congo answered, monotone and dead. âThank you for saving employee 24601.â Lattner noticed that beneath his tight shirt, his stomach was rippling; a kind of cauldron of gas and metabolic processes in there. But his breath was markedly slow, about six respirations per minute. Did the air directly interface with the gills? âCan you turn your implant off? Do you know what happened to you?â âEmployee 24601 must return from break.â Then he began pulling boxes. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ That night, the streamies reported what Lattner already knew. The sickness had dwindled, with excess deaths down to double. Still, the social networks were ablaze: loved ones didnât recognize one another, friends seemed like strangers.Itâs the Congo update, a thread with eight million comments insisted.It did something to us. It changed us. âParasite,â he said out loud. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He arranged a car to his wifeâs house the next day. His old house. Like all of them, the driver looked glassy eyed and dead. The thing about glassy eyes, you assume itâs calm underneath. But it occurred to Lattner that something turbulent was hiding in there. Something sentient, trapped. You can feel sentience. You know, even when it doesnât speak or hear or see. Lattner counted the driverâs breaths: about six per minute. The woman at security scanned them both using retinal display. âPermitted,â she said in Congoâs voice. Her breath was slow, too. The community was unchanged from when heâd left. Green grass, freshly recycled air. People still kept dogs for pets here—they had access to enough soy to feed them. But the dog he saw didnât appear healthy. It languished against a see-saw in the childrenâs playground, ribs prominent. The houses were all widely separated and two or three stories. Heâd missed this place, but also felt, in the six months that heâd been gone from it, that heâd stopped belonging. He used his handprint to open the door but Lorna had changed the locks. A camera eye opened, articulated along steel tubing and lowered itself, shining into his face with a retinal scanner. Then the camera became a screen, and Lorna was looking back at him. She wasnât home, but at her office. She looked overwhelmed, her desk covered in paperwork. For the first time in a very long time, he felt pity and wondered: had he done this to her? âWhat now?â she asked. âAre the kids home? I want to see them.â âItâs not your day.â Her voice wasnât Congoâs. She wasnât wearing a headset. She was too high up, making too many decisions still. This was Lorna. âPlease,â he said. She looked at him with what he realized for the first time was hate. âI should tell you that it wasnât fair of me to marry you,â he said. âI was in love with a man when I met you. I love men.â Her eyes watered but no tears fell. Her mouth gaped. âFuck you. Thatâs not funny.â He waited, knowing sheâd come around in a second. âYouâre serious?â âI wasnât seeing you as a person. I wasnât seeing the kids as people. There was something wrong with me. I was afraid. Iâve always been afraid. Iâm working on it. You tried. You really did. I remember that. The failure is mine. Someone else would have made you very happy.â âYouâre gay?â she asked. It wasnât as simple as that. He could still have been good to her. He could still have considered her, and recognized that the life sheâd tried to build with him had value. But if she liked that answer best it seemed like a fair one. He nodded. âYou knew that the whole time?â âI donât know what I knew. I donât think I thought that deeply. I just wanted to be settled, to do everything I was supposed to do. And now itâs almost twenty years later. I wasnât living. It kept you from living. I hurt you. Youâre still not living. You tell yourself youâre working so you can provide for the kidsâ futures, but the company youâre working for is going to destroy that future.â She made a sour face at him. âOh, fuck you,â she said. âJust for that, you can wait until Friday.â He tried the bell a few more times. Stalked around the house, saw the nanny through the window. She was the new kind, her implants both auditory and retinal, so nervous parents could see through her eyes. The house appeared clean and tended, the windows opened for fresh fall air. The kids didnât seem to be home, or if they were home, they were in their rooms. There wasnât anything for her to do, but she was on the clock. Like a turned off machine, she was standing in the middle of the room. An eerie sight. As he looked at her, calling âHey! You!â through the open window, he knew she heard him. But she was receiving orders not to answer. And so her body quivered slightly, as if trying but unable to respond, a tear falling down her dead, placid cheek. As he was leaving, the skinny dog followed. It was a mutt; some kind of mix between a greyhound and pit bull. He was allergic to dogs. They gave him a rash. He got to the car. The dog whined. âOkay,â he said, leaving it open for the dog to climb in. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He named the dog Buster. It seemed like a dog kind of name. He walked him when he could and when he couldnât, left the door open for him to roam. His arms got blistery with rashes and his nose and lungs plugged up with allergies until he figured out how to divide the apartment between the two of them, keep the windows open, clean the air. It would be temporary. Heâd find someone to take the dog or return it to the village. But over the following days he found no takers. Instead, what he saw were more and more strays, combing the streets in scraggly, hungry packs. Briefly, it occurred to him that he ought to let Buster join them, but Buster was a sweetie. He didnât belong with that crowd. Lattner went to work all that week. More and more, the people became the same. Like zombies. Excess hospitalizations went down to zero. Everything calmed down. His fellow docs stopped taking off their headsets in the breakroom. Sometimes he talked to them through the apparatus, and sometimes they answered in their own voices and not Congoâs, but not often. He left messages for Lorna, who wrote him a 5,000 word letter about how heâd ruined her life. This letter didnât make a lot of sense, so he put it aside, read it again the following day after receiving it, and the day after that, until the feelings of the thing bled past its cruelty.I always hated you. I only married you because I was insane. Youâre weak. Youâre nothing. The children hate you, tooÂ .Â .Â . Youâre just jealous of my success.He picked out the lines he hadnât noticed at first:Remember when we went to the state fair and you won that panda for me? Was that a lie, too? It took him a while to remember the state fair and he had no memory of winning the panda. But he thought that it probably had not been a lie. Lattner was a lot of things, but a master manipulator was not one of them. So he wrote back to her, ignoring all the cruelty. It was probably the most adult act heâd ever committed in her direction: I want you to understand that itâs not your fault. The panda was earnest. I should have visited you at the hospital. I should not have driven you to a nervous breakdown. He called Gerry, too. But Gerry wasnât getting back, either. So Lattner wrote to him, too:My whole life Iâve been hiding. I am a man unaccustomed to emotion, like a baby feeling joy and sorrow for the first time, and unequipped. I cannot say I love you. I do not know you. I can say that I want desperately to see you because you make me happy. He didnât hear back from Gerry, either. Meanwhile, the social networks had quieted. Most, he assumed, had been scrubbed by Congo, which owned the servers. He found a few still insisting that people had changed, not only in their behavior, but in their very anatomy. He read through these, poring over each comment from some unhinged voice in the dark. The invasion had not come from outer space, but from within. The assertion was crazy. But, looking out on the street of his apartment building, where people no longer walked after dark to head to restaurants, but instead shut down for the night, he also knew they were right. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He showed up for his shift at work. No one ate much in the surgical lounge anymore, he noticed. It was all protein bars, no hot food. No coffee, even. The microwave was clean for the first time in two decades. Right before it was time to report to surgical, Ocean walked in, wearing her headset. Her eyes were wet from crying but she wasnât moving, just sitting very still while her body respired six breaths per minute, and she took her appointed break. She sat on the couch beside two other nurses, all squeezing close, none talking. Their breaths and squishing pulses soon synchronized. He imagined an orchid swallowing a daisy. He went to put on his headset. Heard the soft, lulling voice. Couldnât do it. âIâm sick. Iâm going home,â he said to Tucker, who was also on the couch, also wet-eyed and unresponsive. Was it the soul inside him, crying out? Maybe Tucker heard him, maybe he didnât. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ He spent days home at his apartment with Buster, alternating doomscrolling and reading. The threads about body-snatched loved ones had dwindled and the old ones were locked and deleted. He dove deep. Found autopsy reports, scholarly research published too quickly for peer review: bodies all over the country had changed. What theyâd gained in efficiency, theyâd lost in quality. For instance, workers could now stand on assembly lines for sixteen-hour shifts. They rarely ate or needed bathroom breaks. However, they couldnât run. They couldnât laugh hard or cry loud, either. Their hearts couldnât beat or pump enough oxygen-rich material throughout their distal cells to allow that kind of energy expenditure. Similarly, they were much better at taking orders, but they could no longer logic. Logic, and serious thought in general, demanded too much energy. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Friday rolled around. Gerry wasnât answering any of Lattnerâs messages, but at least heâd see his kids. When they didnât show up and neither Lorna nor Beatrice or Dylan answered any of his messages, he grabbed a ride service and headed for the gated community. The guy sitting behind the wheel was staring without blinking for so long that his eyes welled. âYou okay, buddy?â Lattner asked. The guy didnât hear him, so Lattner did something crazy, reached over, and pulled off his headset. The guy didnât suddenly become alert, like a spell had been broken. He face-planted into the wheel. The car kept driving, like this was irrelevant. Lattner drew the headset near, heard a voice whispering softly.Youâre sleeping. Everyone is sleeping. The world is asleepÂ .Â .Â . A voice lulled.Remember being born. Remember being unborn. . . âFuck that,â Lattner said, dropping the headset. The community was quiet. No kids playing ball. No cars arriving from work. No lights, he realized with surprise. All the houses were dark. The nanny answered the door, looked at him dumbly. âIâm the dad. Are the kids here? Theyâre supposed to be at my house.â She cocked her head, let the words go to Congo. âYes,â she said as she stepped back. âCome in.â As soon as he entered, he could see that the house was wrong. But he didnât want to admit that to himself; didnât want to notice the spoiled, sour skin smell. He opened the first bedroom door. Dylan was on the floor, interfacing with his console. âDidnât you hear me?â Lattner asked. Always before, when heâd asked this question, heâd known the answer was yes—Dylan had been ignoring him. This time was different. Dylan was greenish, his breath slow. Lattner snapped his fingers in front of Dylanâs eyes—no response. He felt his abdomen. The tell-tale squish-squish. âDo you know me?â Lattner asked. Lattner pulled the headset away. Dylan made a kind of keening, animal sound. Slow, docile, he reached for the headset. âDo you know your name? Whatâs your name?â Dylan looked at him blankly, the question seeming unrelated, somehow, to the present circumstances. He was afraid to knock on Beatriceâs door but did it anyway. She was hanging from a noose. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Lattner wasnât sure what happened after that. There was an ambulance, a visit to the hospital. He checked Dylan, whose vitals were slow, his metabolic process about 10% normal. A CT of his abdomen, which would have shown a new anatomy, was denied. There were dead eyes, so many dead eyes. There was a walk, somehow, through the city. Nineteen miles. He found himself back home, finishingThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Buster licking him. It was a comfort but also an irritant, as his skin blistered. Lorna didnât come home. Congoâs retreat turned into a five-alarm emergency. They pulled all their top executives behind a tall wall and were flying them out to a hidden shelter. âJesus, Lattner. Youâre a real cocksucker, saying something like that. The nanny would have called me. Those kids are fine. Listen, I gotta go,â she said when he finally tracked her down. He considered sending her a picture, something that would force her to believe, but this seemed cruel. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ Days passed and he didnât come out of his apartment. He read his books. He raided neighborsâ strangely unlocked apartment kitchens for himself and Buster when hungry. He stared. There ought to be a law against what had happened to his children. There ought to be something supernatural that reaches through reality and prevents such things. He forgot all about the date heâd scheduled with Gerry. It came and went. But a week later, his grief lifted long enough for him to remember. He went to Play it Again, Sam, ordered a sandwich, asked the waitress about the VR room upstairs but she told him it was closed. The demand had dropped out of the market. The streets were empty of people as he walked to the Congo warehouse and asked for Gerry. Then waited until Gerry was on a break. He knew even from the walk, that this wasnât Gerry. Gerry was gone. âAre you here?â he asked. Gerry blinked, let Congo answer. âI appear to be!â âDo you know me?â âYouâre employee 5757393 from the hospital!â Lattner put his hand on Gerryâs shoulder. âYou were the love of my life, and I didnât know it. But Iâve never known myself very well.â Gerry cocked his head. Waited for Congo to translate. âHow nice!â he said. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ To: Mica Peters, Congo CEO Lorna Lattner, Department of Innovation, Legal Frank Henry, Congo Trust Reserve, Applications From: Paul Mackenzie, R&D Simon Iscariott, R&D Lucas Johnson, R&D To our senior officers, It appears the condition is irreversible. Nonusers account for about .5% of the population. But we can make lemons out of lemonade. Weâve solved food scarcity. Weâve solved suffering. Affected citizens are still capable of reproduction. We will continue to have a thriving workforce for generations to come. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ There wasnât a funeral for Beatrice. Without his consent, the nanny signed the orders to have her cremated. The ashes were divided. One half remained at the house for Lornaâs eventual return, the other half to Lattner. As he held his daughterâs ashes, it had occurred to him that itâs awful to know that youâre a speck in the grand scheme, that you did not exist for the majority of history, and have no memory of this silence. That this brief stint on earth is a lease. He thought about how children are supposed to be your legacy. His son was there, but not there. His son was gone. His whole life, heâd arrived too late, if at all, for his most important things. He tried to console himself that at least heâd shown up. âIâm sorry,â he said to Lorna when he finally got in touch with her. By now, she believed him. The news had broken her. Her voice was cold. âItâs inevitable. Psychological rejection of the Congo update happens .01% of the time,â she answered. âShe was always like you. Secretive and sensitive. Youâll probably do it, too.â Onscreen, Lorna appeared healthy. Not affected. âYou knew this would happen? I canât believe that. Youâre telling me, but Iâm still finding it hard to believe,â he said. âI didnât know. They didnât know. Not for sure. There was a possibility of physiological change. Someone wrote a hypothesis. But it had as much likelihood as nanobots taking over the earth. The hypothesis called it dissonance. The body and mind out of harmony caused a physiological response. But it makes better workers, happier people. It ends crime.â She looked at him pointedly, âIt ends attachments and pain.â âYou donât feel bad? You donât want to try to stop it?â She looked confused, as if this question bore zero significance. âHow could I stop it?â âLorna,â he said. âI love you. I always have. Not in the way I should have, but that doesnât make it any less real.â Her eyes watered. For a moment, she appeared to be drowning. The gravity of it all hit her, overwhelmed her. âDonât say that,â she whispered. Then she disconnected. Lattner spread Beatriceâs ashes over the river. He wanted to cry, but the desire was like an avocado pit trapped inside his chest. It would have hurt too much to try. â¢Â â¢Â â¢ In the month since the update, everyone he saw had turned a shade of green. The streets were quiet. The roads were quiet. Everything was still and dead, like a digital recording of a movie where everything bright is softened, everything sharp is dulled. In the absence of anything else to do, he went back to work. As soon as he got to the docâs lounge, he heard humming. He thought it was a person, humming, and his eyes brimmed with emotion. Whoâd have guessed that such a mundane thing could be so lovely. But then he saw that it was a consoleâs hold music. His shift started. He thought aboutThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. He thought about all humanityâs cruelties, which had been outsourced now to a program. He thought about free will. We donât choose to be born. Most often, we donât choose to die. He thought about the pain in his abdomen heâd been having. He thought about his dog, who needed him. There was irony, here, that at the exact moment humanity had chosen to delete itself, like an unwanted message, heâd chosen to come fully to life. If this wereLonely Hunter, he knew how it would end. Heâd notice the pain in his side. Heâd notice the terrible loneliness, that would be soothed or perhaps stolen by the headset he was supposed to wear right now. He would join the myriad masses, and in that way, reform himself. Atone. More apt, heâd fill a syringe and join his daughter. He considered all this. And then he walked down the hall, his step out of synchronicity, seeing the world and the color and the sorrow of it. Thinking about all the chances heâd had in his life, that had happened so often theyâd felt like deja vu. Thinking there had to be others, like him, whoâd reformed too late.

    "title": "Seska Was Voyager‘s Perfect, Messy Foil",
    "article_text": "VoyagerandÂDeep Space Ninedraw many intriguing parallels as sister series that aired in tandem for a good chunk of their airings.Voyager‘s more episodic format and tone struck analtogether different approachtoÂDS9‘s increasing lens on the dark heart ofÂStar Trek‘s ideas and universe, digging into wider and deeper interconnected storylines. But one little piece ofÂDeep Space Nineenergy thatÂVoyagerkept early on came from an unlikely figure: Ensign Seska. The turncoat Bajoran ex-Maquis revealed her true identity as a Cardassian double agent 30 years ago today with the broadcast of “State of Flux,” setting off a rare little mini-arc for the early days ofStar Trek: Voyager. Although by and large an episodic show, forbetterorworse,ÂVoyagerdid occasionally experiment with short-form arcs here and there, and Seska’s was one of them, weaving in other plotlines across the rest of season one until her untimely death and defeat at the beginning of season three, like Tom Paris’ seeming discontent aboard the ship, and the associated leaker storyline with Michael Jonas. But she’s most interesting as a contrast to howDeep Space Nineportrayed the Cardassians. Of course,ÂDS9had plenty, like the mischievously two-faced Garak, or the loud and audaciously hammy Gul Dukat. Seska leans more the latter than the former once the mask’s off, but while she is suitably duplicitous and scheming in the ways one might expect of a Cardassian infiltrator who finds herself suddenly going from leaking Maquis plans to serving on a Starfleet vessel 70,000 light years away from Cardassia Prime, one thing defines her in contrast to the Cardassians we’d been regularly seeing onÂStar Trekat that moment in time: she’s just kind of an absolute hot mess. It’s fascinating revisiting “State of Flux” to see just how everything quickly falls apart for Seska. The episode largely deals withÂVoyager‘s discovery of a heavily damaged Kazon warship (a thorn in the crew’s side on and off sincethe pilot episode), only to reveal that the damage was caused by misuse of replicator technology surreptitiously acquired fromÂVoyager. Almost the second the senior staff realize that there’s a traitor on board, Seska isterribleat covering up the fact that she was the one who had been trying to ally with the Kazon as everything falls apart around her, from the crew getting closer to her trail to the doctor’s discovery that her story about her Bajoran background was completely made up. Seska succeeds in getting away fromVoyagerto team up with Maje Culluh, but it’s a failing-upwards trend that persists throughout the rest of her appearances acrossÂVoyager‘s second season and into her death that reflects everything “State of Flux” laid out for her. The idea of a turncoat who sees the strength in finding combative allies to exploitÂVoyager‘s situation is very Cardassian, but Seska finds herself immediately played when she’s thrust into the patriarchal society of the Kazon as her newfound besties. Her advice is largely only ever accepted under scorn and duress from Culluh and his subordinates; despite her perceived sense of superiority she’s constantly undermined, which is often the cause for the failure of her on-and-off attempts to get back atVoyager. She can only ever barely make the best of a bad situation, despite more often than not having most of the cards in play: her history with Chakotay gives her a deliciously personal angle of attack, her knowledge ofÂVoyager‘s capabilities from her time under cover make her a more dangerous foe than most the show had thrown at the ship at this point. But it’s kind of what makes Seska work as a character: despite all this, villainy or otherwise, nothing ever quite clicks for her. It’s a great mirror to uphold against Janeway’s decision to have the crew take the long way home in the first place, the idea that, if they did ultimately just go Seska’s route and exploit their advantageous power in an unknown quadrant, it would doom them. Seska is so often thwarted in her schemes by the simple act ofVoyager‘s unity, something seeded through her time on the ship throughout the series’ first handful of episodesâalways one of the crew to express dissatisfaction at being under the yoke of Starfleet ideals and rules, always one willing to go round people to try and get things done. In many ways Seska kind ofhasto be a disaster as much as a threat to further amplify our heroes’ burgeoning community. Although Seska would go on to appear a couple more times after her death in the second part of “Basics,” it’s fitting that she perishes in a story that is inherently about the disruption ofVoyager‘s community and a violation of their safe space aboard the ship, a two-parter where the Kazon successfully manage to briefly overtakeÂVoyagerand dump the Starfleet crew on an unknown barren planet. DespiteÂwinning, Seska and the Kazon just cannot beat the crew’s resilience and unity, a reminder that, even so early on in this journey, that sticking together is what’s going to getÂVoyagerthrough all this. It’s a shame we had to lose a very compelling antagonist in doing so, but that Seska at least gets to facilitate that solidarity is welcome. Want more io9 news?

And even better, the nominees and category will be included as part ofthe awards showbroadcast. According toVariety, the honor will officially be known as the Academy Award for Achievement in Stunt Design. In a statement to the trade, Stuntmen’s Association president Jeff Wolfe expressed his happiness with the news. “This is a historic moment for our community,” he said. “For decades, stunt performers, coordinators, and action designers have played a crucial role in shaping the cinematic experience, often putting their bodies on the line to bring unforgettable moments to the screen. This recognition validates the passion, innovation, creativity and hard work that go into every fall, fight, and fireball.

    "title": "Plane Carrying Members of Congress Involved in Runway Collision in DC",
    "article_text": "An American Eagle jet set to leave Washington, D.C. for New York on Thursday afternoon clipped wings with another aircraft on the runway at Ronald Reagan National Airport. One of the planes had at least seven members of Congress on board, according to areport from NBC News. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident, and both planes were able to return to the terminal for inspection, according to a statement from American Airlinesgiven to the BBC. The two flights involved in the grounded collision were American Eagle flight 5490, operated by PSA Airlines, headed to Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, and the Republic Airways-operated American Eagle flight 4522, which was headed to JFK International Airport in New York with members of Congress on board. The wingtip of Flight 5490 struck Flight 4522 on the runway around 12:45pm local time. According to American Airlines, there were 67 passengers on board the flight headed to Charleston and 76 on the flight to New York. The latter included Democratic Representatives Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Josh Gottheimer, Adriano Espaillat, and Ritchie Torres and Republican Nick LaLota, all of whom have been confirmed to be on board. Meekspostedthat seven members of Congress in total were on the flight. It’s unclear what led to the collision at this stage, and the Federal Aviation Administration said it is investigating. The Trump administration hasalready insistedthat the incident had nothing to do with staffing cuts or shortages at the FAA, particularly as it relates to air traffic controllers. “There have been no cuts to air traffic controllers, safety personnel, or safety-critical positions at the FAA,” the White House’s “official rapid response account” posted. Democratic Representative Gottheimer, who was on the flight, posted that “Recent cuts to the FAA weaken our skies and public safety,” which prompted the White House’s reply. The Trump administrationdid in fact fire air traffic controllers, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy admitted “less than 400” were let go. The administration did hire some of those people back, but seems to remain understaffed. Just this week, Tim Arel, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic organization,stepped downfrom his post after taking the administration’s voluntary deferred retirement program. Reuters reported that the FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels. Notably, a fatal accident occurred near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport just two months ago when a commercial airliner carrying 64 passengerscollidedwith a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River. That was just one of a number of accidents and close calls that have happened during the first months of the Trump administration. accidentAir traffic controlairplanesAmerican Airlines Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Rise of the Tariff Surcharge",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has mired the United States in an idiotic trade war with China and, as that trade war drags on, it’s more and more likely that American consumers are going to start eating the cost. In fact, it appears to already be happening. More and more companies are talking about instituting a “tariff surcharge” to customer receipts, one that would offset the newly conjured expenses spurred by new import duties. Earlier this week,we noted thatsmall business owners on Reddit were increasingly discussing adding new “tariff surcharges” to their products to offset the costs of Trump’s trade policies. Businesses are already moving from discussion to action, however. As of this week, companies have begun to inform buyers that prices are going up, and they haven’t been shy about why. New York Magazinereports thatfurniture companies Hem and Industry West both sent out emails to customers this week, alerting them to the need to raise prices. A host of other home goods and appliances companies have done the same, including those that sell wellness, cooking, furniture, and electronics products. It’s also being reported that U.S.-based chipmaker Micronwill beginimposing new charges to make up for the costs associated with the president’s tariff regime. Micron’s manufacturing sites are mostly based in Asia, which is now suffering under the new trade realities. Another company, a sexual wellness brand named Dame, also announced this week that it would be instituting a $5 surcharge to make up for the cost of importing vibrators from China. âSo weâve made the tough call to adjust prices to be able to keep bringing you the quality, body-safe products you love,â the company saidin a post on Instagram. âWeâre adding $5 for nowâwhich doesnât cover the full cost as we hate to put the brunt of this on youâwhile we figure out what to do next.â Dame’s CEO, Alexandra Fine,told CNBC: âI want people to understand how it impacts us.” She added: “We are renegotiating again with our manufacturers. We are adjusting our logistics. We are changing our inventory.â Microchips and vibrators may not seem like dire necessities for most folks, but as the trade war drags on, it seems increasingly likely that the price of day-to-day products will also rise. Indeed, coffeeâa thing most Americansconsider indispensableâisexpected to spikein price soon, which isn’t going to be great for Americans’ productivity (I know I’m barely a person before I’ve imbibed my first quart of caffeine for the day). Seeing as a lot of coffee beans aresourced from Asian countries(many of which have been hit with different sets of tariffs), it makes sense that your first morning cup of the day is about to jump in price. And then there’s food and clothing sellers, which have also expressed concern over the rising cost of doing business. Again, these companies (or their suppliers) have said that they plan to point the finger at the Trump administration when it comes to higher costs. “We take a little bit of a hit on our margins, but we still have to pass something off to our customers because there’s no way anyone in our position can eat 24%. We don’t even make 24%,” Nobu Yamanashi, the head of seafood company Yama Seafood,told ABC. “What I’ve seen… what one of my customers say is that they might put a surcharge, a tariff surcharge, instead of changing the menu price, so that it’s very clear.” Indeed,Wired spoketo several retailers who said they’ll be adding a line to their receipts that explicitly spells out how much of the final total was due to Trump’s tariffs. So, if your items come with an eye-popping price tag, look out for that surcharge. Donald TrumpTariffs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "After Indigenous Outrage, British Woman Apologizes for ‘First’ Claim on Canadian Island",
    "article_text": "Last month, British traveler Camilla Hempleman-Adams trekked and skied across Canada’s Nunavut territory. After completing a 150-mile-long (241-kilometer-long) journey from the communities of Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung, she claimed to be the first solo woman to have traversed Baffin Island, Canada’s largest island. That declaration has now received serious backlash from Nunavut’s indigenous community. As reported by theBBC, members of the local Inuit population refuted her claim, saying that it erased indigenous history and was fueled by a “dangerous colonial attitude.” Hempleman-Adams has since apologized for the offense she caused. Before starting her expedition, Hempleman-Adams wrote that “Parks Canada has confirmed that there are no historical records of a female solo attempt from Qikiqtarjuaq to Pangnirtung” on her expedition website, as cited by the BBC. Once she’d completed her expedition on March 27, variousoutletssharedher apparent record-breaking success. “Last week news came out of a British ‘explorer’ who became the first woman to solo traverse Baffin Island… Set aside that it was a 241km ski across Cumberland Peninsula, and not in fact Baffin Island (1500km). If you look deeper you’ll see a larger problem: erasure of Inuit on our own lands,” Gayle Uyagaqi Kabloonaâa member of the local Inuit communityâwrote in asocial media post. “In news coverage, Baffin Island is said to be uninhabited, with not much life. There is no way in hell a British colonizer is coming to Inuit Nunaat in 2025 and claiming any firsts.” Nunaat translates to “homeland.” Wrapping up her post, Kabloona appealed for help to “call out this ignorant and racist behaviour.” She asked Hempleman-Adams to apologize and the BBC to retract itscoverage. Though Kabloona may not have said it explicitly, the sentiment is clear: a solo indigenous woman most likely crossed Baffin Island before Hempleman-Adams, even though neither Inuit Heritage Trust nor Parks Canada maintain such records. Kabloona told the BBC that those records don’t exist because such journeys were “a normal way of life” for indigenous people. Her grandmother, for example, walked hundreds of kilometers every year, often pregnant, “to Spring fishing and Winter caribou hunting grounds because that was life. Every inch of this continent has indigenous history and stories like this,” she explained in the same social media post. In a written statement toCBC News, Hempleman-Adams reiterated the fact that she’d verified her potentially future claim with Parks Canada and wilderness experts in Qikiqtarjuaq and Pangnirtung before the expedition. “However, if this information is incorrect, I apologize unreservedly for making an incorrect claim and for causing offence,” she wrote, as cited by CBC News. “I have deep respect for the land, its people, and their history. I have traveled in this region multiple times and hold immense admiration for its nature, culture and traditions â¦ and I remain committed to learning from this experience and engaging with the community with the utmost respect.” Hempleman-Adams has deactivated her Instagram and deleted her expedition blog.

    "title": "Meta Says Its Latest AI Model Is Less Woke, More Like Elon’s Grok",
    "article_text": "Meta says that its latest AI model, Llama 4, is less politically biased than its predecessors. The company says it has accomplished this in part by permitting the model to answer more politically divisive questions, and added that Llama 4 now compares favorably to the lack of political lean present in Grok, the “non-woke” chatbot from Elon Musk’s startup xAI. âOur goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue,â Meta continues. âAs part of this work, weâre continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn’t favor some views over others.â One concern raised by skeptics of large models developed by a few companies is the type of control over the information sphere it can produce. He who controls the AI models essentially can control the information people receive, moving the dials in whichever way they please. This is nothing new, of course. Internet platforms have long used algorithms to decide what content to surface. That’s why Meta is still being attacked by conservatives, many of whom insist that the company has suppressed right-leaning viewpoints despite the fact that conservative content has historically been much more popular on Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been working in overdrive to curry favor in the administration in hopes of regulatory headaches. In itsblog post, Meta stressed that its changes to Llama 4 are specifically meant to make the model less liberal. âItâs well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with biasâspecifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics,â it wrote. âThis is due to the types of training data available on the internet.â The company has not disclosed the data it used to train Llama 4, but it is well-known that Meta and other model companies rely onpirated booksand scraping websites without authorization. One of the problems with optimizing for “balance” is that it can create a false equivalence and lend credibility to bad-faith arguments that are not based on empirical, scientific data. Known colloquially as “bothsidesism,” some in media feel a responsibility to offer equal weight to opposing viewpoints, even if one side is making a data-based argument and the other is spouting off conspiracy theories. A group like QAnon is interesting, but represented a fringe movement that never reflected the views of very many Americans, and was perhaps given more airtime than it deserved. The leading AI models continue to have a pernicious issue with producing factually accurate information, even to this day still often fabricating information andlying about it. AI has many useful applications, but as an information retrieval system, it remains dangerous to use. Large language programs spout off incorrect information with confidence, and all the previous ways of using intuition to gauge whether a website is legitimate are thrown out the window. AI models do have a problem with biasâimage recognition models have been known to have issues recognizing people of color, for instance. And women are oftendepicted in sexualized ways, such as wearing scantily clad outfits. Bias even shows up in more innocuous forms: It can be easy to spot AI-generated text by the frequent appearance of em dashes, punctuation that’s favored by journalists and other writers who produce much of the content models are trained on. Models exhibit the popular, mainstream views of the general public. But Zuckerberg sees an opportunity to curry President Trump’s favor and is doing what is politically expedient, so Meta is specifically telegraphing that its model will be less liberal. So next time you use one of Meta’s AI products, it might be willing to argue in favor of curing COVID-19 by taking horse tranquilizers.

    "title": "Motorola is Launching a New Batch of Folding Razrs Later This Month",
    "article_text": "Motorola, the company that made your favorite flip phone twenty years ago, is about to enter its seventh generation of manufacturing folding smartphones. The company teased an event later this month where it will reveal new folding smartphones. This next batch of Razrs is expected to get a significant performance boost, brighter inside and outside displays, and improved camera performance. We’ll learn more about it when Motorola debuts the device on April 24. Motorola teases the presence of something that will be “iconic,” but otherwise, thevideo teaseris pretty short. It’s about ten seconds of levitating Razr devices fanning in and out as they open and close. We start by seeing two Motorola devices, which quickly separate into three smartphones before it’s consolidated back to two. So far, the consensus among pundits andblogsis that there will be three Razr models to choose from, though it’s confusing because Moto has only ever launched two folding phones at a time. Last year, it came out with the standardRazrand Razr Plus. The chatter is that this year, there is either a third “super-powered” variant or a supremely basic foldable, priced alongside Motorola’s budget offerings, like theMoto G series. 9to5Googlealso noticed that at one point, the floating Razr phone spells out AI. This is likely a reference to Moto AI, akin to Samsung’s Galaxy AI. Moto AI features are expected to include abilities like notification summaries and automatic transcriptions. There may even be a little image editing magic. As with most of the big phone makers Motorola is promising big with its AI features. The idea is that its LLMs will “take actions” for you, like ordering coffee from a shop nearby. That would be an impressive feat given the issues Apple’s been facing and the more pared down featuresGoogle has offered. Otherrumblingsinclude whether the Razrs will use a MediaTek Dimensity chip or if the “pro”/”plus” variant will adopt the Snapdragon 8 Elite to AI with the rest of its Android brethren.

    "title": "Has the Dire Wolf Truly Been Resurrected? We Asked the Experts",
    "article_text": "The single splashiest bit of science news so far this year arrived earlier this week, when Colossal Biosciencesannouncedthat its scientists successfully brought back a version of the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus). In thecompany’s announcement, Colossal has claimed that its three “dire wolf” siblings, Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, are the world’s first examples of de-extinction. But not everyone is on board with that assertion. The wolves were created by genetically editing the DNA of gray wolf cells to more closely resemble that of a dire wolf; this edited DNA then served as the basis for embryos implanted in surrogate dogs. Colossal has argued that these editsâ20 in totalâwere enough to produce wolves that are phenotypically (physically or visibly) similar to the dire wolves that once roamed the Americas tens of thousands of years agoâan approach the company calls “functional de-extinction.” But at least some outside researchers aren’t so sure, arguing that these edits are far too few to truly bridge the genetic gap between today’s wolves and the dire wolves of the past. For this Giz Asks, we reached out to experts in paleobiology and other relevant fields to get their take on Colossal’s novelâif potentially controversialâfeat of genetic engineering. We also solicited a comment from Colossal’s chief science officer, Beth Shapiro, who is herself an evolutionary biologist. The following responses may have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. Abiologistspecializing in canine evolution and a lecturer at the University of East Anglia’s School of Biological Sciences. No, it has not. What Colossal Biosciences has done is to genetically modify gray wolves to perhaps give them a slightly more dire wolf-like appearance. Itâs wrong to say they have brought the dire wolf species back from extinction, or that these animals are dire wolves in any sense. It’s a technically impressive experiment to genetically modify gray wolves, but the company is massively exaggerating what this is and what it means. Colossal first sequenced the genomes of two dire wolves by extracting DNA from ancient bones. They then compared these with gray wolves and other canids, aiming to identify what changes would be needed to transform a gray wolf into a dire wolf. It’s important to have some sense for the scale of the genetic differences between the species. Their DNA is ~99.5% similar, which may sound very high, but across the whole genome this translates to about 10 million differences. If you could somehow make all those edits to a gray wolf genome, then you would certainly get a dire wolf. Colossal made only 20 edits. That is nowhere near enough to approach actual dire wolf biology. It should be acknowledged that, out of the several million genetic differences that distinguish gray wolves from dire wolves, most probably have no biological effectâthese are what we call neutral differences. Currently, no one really knows how to tell which differences are biologically meaningful, but my guess is that you would need at least tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of edits to turn a gray wolf into something that would have realistic dire wolf biology. 20 edits, whatever they are, cannot even come close. Furthermore, the 20 chosen edits mainly targeted genes influencing traits visible to the naked eye, such as coat color and body size. But clearly there is more to species differences than these superficial traits: there is behavior, metabolism, immunity, reproduction, and so on. Colossal did not even attempt to approximate dire wolf behavior, as no one would even know where to begin to achieve that. Even the choice to make the wolves white seems only loosely grounded in the genomic data, but it is the kind of trait that makes the animals more visually striking. There is considerable criticism of Colossalâs aims more generally, including whether an unrealistic focus on de-extinction might distract from the conservation of species that still exist. I am perhaps a little less negative than some about the basic idea, and would argue that the money currently flowing to Colossal is not from sources that would otherwise have spent it on conservation. But with this “dire wolf” announcement, I fear Colossal might damage the public perception of what real de-extinction would actually entail, and promote a superficial and incorrect view of species’ biology as something that can be changed with just 20 genome edits. A conservation biologist and professor of zoology at the University of Otago in New Zealand who’s written about thepros and cons of de-extinction. The simple answer is no. So what’s happened is that they genetically modified gray wolves, which are a close relative, albeit six million years agoâthese animals had a common ancestor. And what they’ve done is they’ve looked at the genome of the dire wolf and they looked at the genome of the gray wolf and they’ve identified a relatively small number of genetic differences relating to coat color and head size and general body size. And they’ve engineered those traits into a gray wolf. So you end up with a genetically engineered gray wolf, which is kind of a hybrid. And what we’ve seen is that they have white color coats and they’ll end up being a bit bigger, perhaps, than the average wolf. I think that the achievement we should be focused on are the techniques they’ve developed to do this. That is, to identify genetic sequences and to re-engineer them into the genome of an existing species. So you can imagine them using this technology to perhaps re-engineer lost genetic diversity into existing species and preventing extinction in the first place, rather than creating these kind of genetically modified lookalikes [the same day as the dire wolf announcement, the company reported using its technology to clone several red wolves, the world’s most endangered wolf species living today]. While I’m down on the terminology being used, like “de-extinction” and resurrecting things. I am an enthusiast of the potential of the technology that’s been developed by Colossal Biosciences. A distinguished professor at UCLA in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Institute of Environment and Sustainability, as well as director of theCalifornia Conservation Genomics Project. It’s a complicated answer to a simple question. So if I took that absolutely at face value and said: Has the dire wolf, whatever we exactly mean by that, been reconstructed by Colossal in their efforts? I would say no. Why not? Because, A, I’m not even sure what it means to reconstruct a species, and the dire wolf is a species. And B, I have looked into some of the technology that they’ve used. This is complicated technology having to do with ancient DNA reconstructions, and similar to the complicated technology that we use with human reconstructions of extinct Neanderthals, or other human ancestors, or human members of human lineage. And it’s very tricky. It’s very degraded DNA. You have to map that DNA back to a target species. There are biases when you do that. Colossal has done a lot to try to eliminate those biases; whether they have completely or not, it’s unclear. Here, they have chosen not every difference between the gray wolf and their fragmented dire wolf genome, but some of the differences that they think are important. And they’ve used gene editing techniques to make those changes to reconstruct canid individuals that have some of those dire wolf features. So is that a dire wolf? Probably not. We’ll never know for sure. Is it more like a dire wolf than a gray wolf? Almost certainly. And is it a major accomplishment in using gene editing to construct a target species or a target organism that has certain characteristics and is sort of a breakthrough in that sense? I think it is. And I think they should be very proud of it. I think it’s a very interesting set of accomplishments that they’ve made doing that many simultaneous gene edits and having organisms that can then grow up and not only survive but thrive, at least as puppies. That’s a big accomplishment that may have repercussions for certain aspects of conservation biology, and maybe for certain aspects of human biology. Is it the dire wolf? Probably not. Does it have all the same ecological features as a dire wolf? Probably not. Does it have some of them? Yeah. And my guess is that’s as much as they hoped to accomplish and they’ve probably accomplished their goals. Has the dire wolf been “de-extincted or whatever the correct terminology is for that? I don’t think that Colossal or at least Beth Shapiro would say it has, unless you define de-extinction in a certain way. And I don’t think that was their goal to create a perfect stock. And my guess is, honestly, that the press has taken this in directions that are probably premature, given that the scientific peer reviewed papers haven’t been published yet [According to Colossal, the very first paper on their dire wolves will be available as a preprint later this week]. The experts can’t really evaluate all the nuances of the ancient DNA techniques and the multiple iterative mapping techniques that they’ve used and everything else. And so it’s probably a bit premature to just declare a huge success or exactly what that success comprises. Chief science officerat Colossal Biosciences, and an evolutionary molecular biologist specializing in the genetics of ice age animals and plants. In a world where headlines too often herald disaster, my colleagues at Colossal Biosciences have given us something extraordinary to celebrate: the return of the dire wolf. But as with any scientific breakthrough, skeptics have emerged, questioning whether these striking creatures, with their light-colored coats and impressive stature, are truly dire wolves or merely modified gray wolves. This debate misses the point. The science: We and our academic partners collected DNA fragments from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull. Colossal’s scientists then used this dire wolf DNA to identify and reintroduce key dire wolf DNA variants linked to many of the dire wolf’s unique traits from the light coloration of their coats to their imposing stature. These key genetic variants haven’t been expressed for thousands of years. These animals aren’t mere approximations; they embody many of the critical traits that made dire wolves unique ecological actors. Remember what de-extinction is actually about. It’s not about creating perfect genetic copies of individual animals. It’s not about populating de-extinction amusement parks. It’s about restoring lost ecological functions and enhancing biodiversity. It’s about developing technology capable of adding robustness and resilience to our ecosystems. It’s aboutdoing somethingpowerful and precise in the face of our current extinction crisis. The implications for conservation are profound. The same technologies that brought back the dire wolf have already yielded dividends for endangered species conservation. To much less fanfare, Colossal also announced the successful birth of four red wolvesâthe only endemic American wolf and one of the most endangered wolf species aliveâusing cells isolated directly from a simple blood draw. With fewer than 20 red wolves remaining in the wild, this breakthrough could help save a species from extinction. Beyond the technical achievement, there’s something more profound happening here. In an era dominated by climate anxiety and biodiversity loss, our dire wolves and our red wolves are symbols of optimism. It is within the realm of human endeavor to reverse species decline. For young people considering careers in science and conservation, what could be more inspiring than watching the impossible become possible? Has the dire wolf been resurrected? Dire wolf DNA is specifying uniquely dire wolf phenotypes in living canids for the first time in 12,000 years. Functional de-extinction, partial genetic resurrection, call it what you will.

    "title": "Secretary Brain Worm: RFK Jr. Tells Trump We’ll Know the ‘Cause’ of Autism by Fall",
    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, made a series of absurd statements during a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday, including a claim that he would reveal the “cause” of autism by September, teasing the reveal like a new product launch for the fall. And Trump seemed very impressed. Kennedy, who’s worked his entire life advocating against life-saving vaccines, praised Trump for his dedication to the so-calledMake America Healthy Again(MAHA) movement, and insisted that the team of scientists he’s assembled from around the world would figure out what was causing an autism “epidemic.” “At your direction, we are going to know by September,” Kennedy said to the president. “We’ve launched a massive testing and research effort that’s going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world. By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” Kennedy said the autism rate was 1 in 31 children while it used to be 1 in 31,000, numbers that Trump marveled at in thecabinet meeting. News broke last month that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a “study” to determine if vaccination is the cause (it is not). “So it was one in 10,000 children had autism, and now it’s one in 31, not 31,000, 31,” Trump said. “That is a horrible statistic, isn’t it? And there’s got to be something artificial out there that’s doing this.” It’s not clear what Trump meant by “artificial,” which could conceivably refer to anything from artificial dyes in food to something he believes is present in the MMR vaccine. Trump has entertained the idea that childhood vaccinations are behind higher autism rates, though that conspiracy theory has been debunked repeatedly. There is no single “cause” for autism and the idea that you can put a deadline like September on such a complex question is completely ridiculous. Trump, who’s long known how to create hype for media events, went on to say during the cabinet meeting that there would be “no bigger news conference,” when Kennedy reveals the cause of autism by September. “If you can come up with that answer, where you stop taking something, you stop eating something or maybe it’s a shot, but something’s causing it,” Trump said. Kennedy later went onFox Newsand was asked about the fact that studies have shown vaccines don’t cause autism. The secretary falsely claimed that those studies were “narrow” and suggested he was going to uncover some greater truth about some connection there. Yeah, RFK Jr. is going to make it so the government says vaccines cause autism as he dismisses studies showing no link. “The studies that they did were very very narrow… 14 of those studies are invalid. The biggest weakness of those studies is they never studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated.” [image or embed] â Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona.bsky.social)April 10, 2025 at 1:06 PM During the cabinet meeting, Kennedy talked aboutother programsthe Trump regime was working on, including removing “soda pops,” from being allowed to be purchased through the SNAP benefits program, commonly known as food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees SNAP, but Kennedy has previously said he’s talking to Brooke Rollins at that agency about the move. The Health Secretary also insisted his agencies were responding well to the historic measles outbreak in Texas which has seen the death ofthree Americansso far. Kennedy has sent mixed messages about whether the measles vaccine, which is enormously effective, is something Americans should get. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and CDC, has seen billions in cuts since Kennedy took control of the agency, but the secretary recently revealed hedoesn’t really understandwhat’s being cut. But that shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. Kennedy does not have the qualifications to be running such an enormous bureaucracy. In fact, most of Trump’s cabinet are not qualified for their jobs, from the Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins with no experience in Agriculture to the Education Secretary Linda McMahon with no experience in education. And let’s not forget the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire Elon Musk, who’s unilaterally and unlawfully destroying government programs he doesn’t understand. These people were all hired to destroy the federal government and they’re going to keep doing that until someone puts a stop to it. Unfortunately, there’s no cavalry to save America right now, especially as the Democrats continue tovote to confirmTrump’s picks. Even Wall Street doesn’t seem to have much sway with Trump these days. The president made a big media splash on Wednesday by announcing he was pausing some of the big tariffs he had threatened against many countries around the world, sending stocks soaring in a historic rally. But stocks were down again Thursday after people revealed Trump was still serious about maintaining a 10% tariff across the board and over 100% tariffs on China. AutismDonald TrumpRFK JrRobert F.

    "title": "Daredevil Made Marvel Bleed, and Was Better for It",
    "article_text": "The early days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe were full of family-friendly adventures.Captain America: The Winter SoldierÂwas the most grounded of the bunch back then in that people could easily die in a fight, and it meant something to see Nick Fury and Black Widow visibly struggle with getting shot. A year later, Marvel and Netflix’sDaredevilÂmade such violence its entire core, which helped change the trajectory of Marvel and the larger live-action superhero media complex. By the timeDaredevilpremiered in 2015, it’d been over a decade since the Ben Affleck movie became a punching bag as one of many bad superhero movies of the early 2000s. (Aside from its use of Evanescence’s iconic “Bring Me to Life,” of course.) But the movie hardly seemed to matter when the show had pretty good trailers and its opening minutes effectively set up Matt Murdock’s origin and his religious dilemma, and showed he’s really good at beating Hell’s Kitchen’s criminals to a pulp. And if that didn’t win over audiences, its one-shot hallway fight in the second episode sure did it. Throughout that first season, it made a case for itself as a Marvel show for adultsâor at least, those who like crime stories and thought they could use more blind acrobats or ninjas. As the first of what was eventually a six-series venture between Marvel and Netflix, includingDaredevilspin-offThe Punisher,DaredevilÂoffered a promising start for the companies’ collaboration. On its own merits, the show generally made good on that potential across itsthree-season run, and succeeded in bringing Matt’s street-level antics to TV. More than anything, its biggest onscreen failing would come in itsportrayal of Asian characters, and by extension, the hero’s clash with the secret ninja society the Hand. For a show that went to great lengths to provide texture to villains like Kingpin, Bullseye, and even the Russian villains of that first season, it’s a great misstep the show couldn’t afford that to the supernatural side of Matt’s heroic life and his foes that fell within that sphere. Nowadays,Daredeviland its sibling seriesâJessica Jones,Luke Cage,Iron Fist,Punisher,ÂandÂThe Defendersâfeel like a lifetime ago. While each show had its own individual strengths and weaknesses, collectively, they could arguably be considered mature almost experimental storytelling the MCU was in need of at the time. By Marvel’s Phase Two, the films had fallen into a formula, and that’s largely persisted despite the studio bringing innew directorsand marketing those films assomething different. The firehose of MCU media was one of the Netflix shows’ biggest enemies: by the time this partnership ended, theentire Defenders enterprisewas practically lagging behind the MCU’s embrace of weirder, more out-there concepts. Some shows seemed ready to take someswings of their ownbefore they were canceled, so it’s ultimately unclear how above and beyond they would’ve ultimately gone had they just been given another season to find out. What’s less uncertain is thatÂDaredevilÂhelped begin the wave of adult-oriented superhero fare that’s led toÂDeadpoolÂandÂThe Boys. Whereas those two projects often treat their violence as the punchline to a joke or some delightful slapstick,Daredeviltook its beatdowns quite seriouslyâbig shocker, right?âwhether it was a simple bullet to the head or Fiskdecapitating a man with a car door. For whatever reason, this was an easier sell to audiences than DC pushing a cinematic Batman who branded his enemies or a Superman floating in the rain with menacing red eyes. Matt is, first and foremost, a street-level hero who usually doesn’t get caught up bigger nonsense unless he absolutely needs to. It provides some relative rules for the type of stories he can get involved in, something Stephen S. DeKnight and later showrunners understood by keeping stories contained to Hell’s Kitchen and Kingpin or Matt’s internal struggle with his brand of Catholic guilt-fueled justice. And if any of that ever felt like it ran its course, that’s where most of the other Defenders shows came in, often with explorations of their own weighty subject matter, like sexual assault inJessicaÂor racial injustice and Black family dynamics inLuke Cage. Daredevilwas born in the darkness and molded a whole subgenre around it. The OG show’sgrit and grimemade it delightful to see Matt spit up blood or Fisk reminisce aboutwhen he was a boy, and it’s embedded into the show’s DNA. From guest appearances inShe-HulkandHawkeye,Âwe can see Matt and Fisk would’ve fit into the lighter MCU well enough, butBorn Again’sfirst iterationwould’ve strayed too far from its roots. Unlike the Fantastic Four or X-Men, audiences didn’t want Daredevil to get a reboot, they just wanted him and his circle tobe in the MCUwhile otherwise operating as usual. Showrunner Dario Scardapane and stars Charlie Cox, Vincent D’Onofrio, and Jon Bernthal have said in interviews the rework was to everyone’s benefit in part because it allowed them to make a continuation of the original show that’s part of Marvel’s interconnected world. Cox reprised his role in the animatedYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Manearlier this year, but in live-action, nothing’s come of these MCU connections just yet. It’s too badBorn Againhad a troubled development; in its best moments, it has the makings of a worthy successor. With luck, the 2026-bound season two will show what Scardapane and his creative team are capable of when given full reign over the character. Even ifBorn Againdoesn’t hit the same heights as its predecessor, it’s moreDaredevil,Âand that may ultimately be enough. Want more io9 news?

But the duo are set to get some moments of reprieve amid the misery. Ellie in particular gets to have her story expand once they reach Joel’s brother’s compound and she meets Dina (Superman’sIsabela Merced). The romance between Ellie and Dina has ruffled the feathers of some game players since its introduction inThe Last of Us Part II.And in an interview withEntertainment Weekly,Merced discussed how the potential backlash doesn’t faze her or game creator Craig Mazin, who included it as normalized story canon to the game. “I mean, it’s kind of my truth, so I don’t see it as a thing even,” Merced said, and really she speaks from a place of a younger generation not really caring about heteronormative labeling asseason two of the hit show premieres.âThe game was made so long ago. Gays have existed since the beginning of time, they were always there. I don’t really see what the problem is.

If anything isn’t successful, I promise you itâs because of the quality of the work, not because of themes. Any theme can be done properly if it’s done by a good artist and executed with care and consideration. I guess everything in this story ends with tragedy. However, in my opinion, this is a successful sapphic story. It’s beautiful and we win in the end. There’s a lot of winning for this sapphic couple. I’m just really, really excited for people to see that.â The actress continued, âI’m kind of looking forward to the backlash.” Merced knows that internet outrage is just that and the real world has an undeniable truth. âI don’t know how to describe it.

So he asked the court if he could submit a video to make his statementâa reasonable enough request that the court seemed to have approved in advance. What the court did not approve,based on the judge’s reaction, was the video that Dewald submitted, which was not him making a statement but instead a handsomely generic guy who the judges had never seen before. Just a couple seconds into the unnamed business stud’s statement, Associate Justice Sallie Manzanet-Daniels cut off the video and asked “Is that counsel for the case?” It was at that point Dewald revealed that the person making the statement wasn’t a person at allâit was an AI-generated video. “That is not a real person,” he told the court. It was about then that Justice Manzanet-Daniels lost it. “It would have been nice to know that when you made your application. You did not tell me that, sir,” she said, noting that Dewald had testified at length previously and had conversations with the clerk’s office for extended periods without issue. “I don’t appreciate being misled. So either you are suffering from an ailment that prevents you from being able to articulate or you don’t,” she said. Now would probably be a good time to mention that Dewald heads an AI startup calledPro Se Prothat helps people represent themselves in legal matters with AI toolsâa fact the judge seemed to know, as she told him, “You are not going to use this courtroom as a launch for your business, sir.” To be fair to Dewald, it does not seem that his avatar was created with his own platform, which he toldThe Registerhas been at a standstill for about a year due to lack of funding. His AI representative, named “Jim” was created with a free trial to an AI service calledTavus. While he intended to make an AI version of himself to speak before the court, he couldn’t get the trial to work so, hetold The Register he just settled for “one of their stock replicas, that big, beautiful hunk of a guy.” Still, the appearance of self-promotion as well as the unexpected appearance of an AI avatar was enough to get Dewald a scolding from the court. He went on to make his argument on his own and has since copped to the fact that he probably should have provided a heads-up that he was going to use AI to present his case. Lesson learned.

    "title": "Google Showed Off Advanced AR Glasses That May Never Leave the Lab",
    "article_text": "All the usual suspects of big tech are engaged in anot-so-secret arms raceto be the first to develop mass-market augmented reality glasses. We already know Google teamed up with Samsung to develop an Android-centric pair of glasses, but the company recently showed off another device to a small audience at theTED2025 conference, and already we can tell its the kind of XRâAKA “extended reality”âthat may take help us escape the tyranny of overlarge VR headsets. Shahram Izadi, the VP and general manager of XR at Google strode out on TEDâs stage wearing what initially appeared to be a typicalâthough overly-largeâpair of glasses (think Meta’s huge and also unreleasedOrion smart glasses). But they were Googleâs XR glasses, and Izadi claimed they were displaying his speech notes to him as he talked. The glasses had a microphone, camera, and speakers to gather as much information. Googleâs first XR devicesince Google Glasshas an âin-lens display,â which Izadi held up to the camera for a scant few seconds, remarking âitâs very, very small.â That could point to the idea Google is experimenting with Waveguide-type glasses displays, featured indevices like the latest RayNeo glasses. The glasses themselves use Android XR, Googleâs homegrown OS for extended reality devices. Google product manager Nishtha Bhatia showed the crowd what the glasses cameras could display through the built-in camera. She tapped one arm of the glasses, which launched the typical blue star Gemini logo at the bottom of her display, and after a half second the AI-voiced chatbot appeared ready to offer an eyeroll-worthy haiku about the gathered audience with their âfaces all aglow.â Gemini can translate text it sees into different languages, though Izadi suggested that feature may produce mixed results. That same camera could also parse text and graphs and turn it into more-digestible soundbites. Izadi and Bhatia also showed off the âmemoryâ feature that let the AI recall things it saw through the camera in the recent past. Itâs akin to whatGoogle Deepmind demoed with Project Astralast year. Google has slowly been adding Astra features,including photo and video recognition, to the Gemini Live chatbot interface, and it seems the company is looking to integrate similar features on an upcoming pair of AR glasses. The glasses should have more capabilities to connect with your smartphone and âaccess all your phone apps.â Yet the real killer feature is the connection with your other Google apps. Bhatia asked the glasses to look at a record from rapper Teddy Swims and play a track. The glasses opened up YouTube Music and played the requested song. We already enjoy the Ray-Ban Meta glasses well enough for their solid speakers without needing a pair of earbuds, so this is a no-brainer from Google. What was even wilder was that the display inside the glasses could work with Google Maps, offering a semi-holographic image of Google streetview for navigation. Google has beenworking behind the scenes on AR glasses for several years, even after the demise of Google Glass. Curiously, the pair shown at TED may not be sold under Google’s own banner. The search giant is working hand in hand with Samsung on itsProject Moohansmart glasses by enabling the device with Android XR. Google showed off the Samsung’s prototype headset on the TED2025 stage. From what weâve seen of Moohan, which may be apremium-priced device, the headset willact much like todayâs Apple Vision Pro, but with more Gemini-enabled features. Samsung has also strongly hinted it’s working on aseparate pair of smart glasses,but we doubt what Google showed off this week is what’s rumored to arrive later this year. Korean publicationETNews(read with machine translation) reported last month the upcoming device may not have a display or buttons. It would instead rely on a microphone for speech and a camera for gesture controls. Meanwhile Meta may also beworking on an expensive pair of glasseswith a tiny screen dedicated to an app shelf on the bottom of the right-hand lens. The display is what will truly set âaugmented realityâ glasses apart from the audio focused glasses we’ve see so far. To stand apart Google will need to figure out how to use a bigger display, while balancing battery life and the weight of the glasses. But if it does, we may finally get our AR kicks in without needing to shove a heavy headset over our eyes.

    "title": "Mystery Jawbone Pulled From the Sea Is a Rare Fossil From an Elusive Human Relative",
    "article_text": "TheDenisovanswere a mysterious group of archaic humans who likely lived from around 370,000 years ago to at least 30,000 years ago, and are believed to be an offshoot or sister group of the Neanderthals. What little we know about Denisovans is based on a handful offragmented fossil remainsunearthed in Siberia’s Denisova Cave and China’s Tibetan Plateau. A new analysis, however, adds another piece to the Denisovan puzzle. In a study published today in the journalScience, a team of researchers from Japan, Taiwan, and Denmark revealed that a jawbone previously discovered in Taiwan belonged to a male Denisovan. They reached this conclusion after conducting a paleoproteomic analysisâan analysis of ancient proteinsâwhich revealed two protein variants associated with Denisovans. The identification provides the most compelling evidence yet that Denisovans lived across different habitats and adapted to diverse climates. “The high-quality palaeoproteomic data obtained from Penghu 1 [the fossilized jaw], enabled by relatively good fossil preservation and optimized protein extraction methods, indicates that Penghu 1 belonged to a male Denisovan,” the researchers wrote in the study. Fishers dredged up Penghu 1, along with other animal fossils, from the seabed of Taiwan’s Penghu Channelâan area that was part of the Asian mainland during the lower sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch (2.5 million to 11,700 years ago). According to the study, the jawbone dates to either 10,000 to 70,000 years ago, or 130,000 to 190,000 years ago. The reason for two sets of fairly divergent age ranges has to do with the methods used to date the fossil. Because of the jawbone’s degradation, the team couldnât use direct dating techniques like uranium-series or radiocarbon dating. Instead, the scientists relied on indirect clues, such as the fossilâs chemical composition, the types of animal fossils found nearby, and historical sea-level data. Altogether, this evidence pointed to the two possible time windows. The researchers, sequencing proteins extracted from the jawbone and teeth, recovered 4,241amino acid residues(the building blocks of protein) and identified two of them as Denisovan-specific variantsâmeaning the jawbone belonged to a Denisovan. This direct molecular evidence of Denisovan presence in modern-day Taiwan supports a theory previously indicated by genetic studies of modern humans: namely, that Denisovans existed in southeastern Asia. One of the few things we know about Denisovans is that they interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans. As such, some people today have genes passed down from distant Denisovan ancestorsâparticularly people from southeastern Asia, suggesting that Denisovans lived and interbred with modern humans there. Before the jawbone’s paleoproteomic analysis, however, Denisovan fossils had only ever been molecularly confirmed from northern Asia. “The identification of Penghu 1 as a Denisovan mandible confirms the inference from modern human genomic studies that Denisovans were widely distributed in eastern Asia,” the researchers explained in the study. What’s more, the “presence of Denisovans in diverse geographical and climatic zones,” ranging from the cold winters of the north, to the high-altitude chill of alpine subarctic zones, to the warm and humid conditions of the tropical lowlands, “demonstrates their adaptational flexibility.” The researchers also conducted morphological analyses on the jawbone, concluding that the Denisovan man had a robust jaw, large molars, and notable root structures. Significantly, these characteristics align with Denisovan fossils from the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting they may represent broader Denisovan traits. Ultimately, the study sheds light on an ancient human relative we still know little about, while expanding our understanding of early human development across southeastern Asia. denisovansGeneticsPaleontology Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "You Can Actually Play the Terrifying Video Game From Black Mirror Season 7",
    "article_text": "Black Mirror‘snew seasonis here, bringing six tales of tech-based terror, tyranny, and emotional damage to Netflix. While all the episodes feature scenarios you can imagine actually happeningâbut aren’t quite achievable in 2025âa key piece of one is actually making its way into reality. And it’s one of the cutest yet also scariest: theThrongletsvideo game from the Peter Capaldi-starring “Plaything.” “Plaything” winds itself around a murder mystery that’s not really a mystery; the only suspect (played by Capaldi and Lewis Gribben at different points in the decades-spanning story) left his DNA all over a mutilated corpse in the 1990s. With neither DNA nor dead body identified, the case tugs at police until a peculiar shoplifting arrest leads them to an even more peculiar man. As he tells them his history during an extended interrogation, we learn this all ties back toThronglets,a game he learned about from genius designer Colin Ritman (Will Poulter, reprising hisBlack Mirror: Bandersnatchrole) while toiling at PC Zone magazine in the early ’90s. Except, it’s not really a game:Throngletscreates entirely digital life formsâcute little chirping crittersâand the “player” is tasked with looking after their well-being. That sounds so nice and nurturing! What could possibly go wrong? Well, this isBlack Mirror, so everything can go wrong, including an unhealthy obsession that leads to murder and potentially a full-scale apocalypse. Whowouldn’twant to get in on that? Netflixannouncedtoday thatThronglets, the “subversive game that never was” in the universe ofBlack Mirror, having been deemed “so dangerous that it was canceled midway through development,” is now a mobile game you can start playing right now. While it seems likely that what happens to Capaldi’s character won’t happen to the average real-world player (depends on how much acid you take, probably), you can still expect to be taking care of an ever-expanding society that will start to “communicate” with you more and more the longer you play. Netflix also promises someBlack MirrorEaster eggs will pop up along the way.

    "title": "A New Comet Is Streaking Across the Morning Sky. Catch It Before the Sun Does",
    "article_text": "A recently discovered comet is currently gracing our morning skies, with its signature green glow and long tail trailing behind. Comet SWAN25F is speeding toward the Sun for a dangerously close approach, which might either destroy it or make it visible to the naked eye. In the meantime, the bright comet can be spotted with a telescope or a pair of binoculars as it streaks across the sky. Astronomersdiscoveredthe comet in images captured by the SWAN instrument aboard NASA’s Sun-watching SOHO spacecraft. On April 8, the Minor Planet Center designated the comet C/2025 F2 (SWAN), and sky watchers were eager to spot it. Here’s how you can enjoy a glimmering view of the comet before it reaches its closest approach to the Sun during the early days of May. New bright comet SWAN25F2025-04-06 UT 2.50LRGB 16/5/5/5 min 11\"/2.2 RASA QHY600Michael JÃ¤ger, Gerald Rhemannpic.twitter.com/FJuwRVGMd5 — Michael JÃ¤ger (@Komet123Jager)April 6, 2025 The comet is visible in the morning sky, and can be spotted in the east in the hours just before the twilight of dawn begins to take over. Comet C/2025 F2 is inside the Great Square of Pegasus, a constellation in the northern sky named after the winged horse in Greek mythology, and it’s moving toward the Andromeda constellation, according toEarthSky. In order to view the comet, look toward the star Alpha Andromedae, the brightest star of the four points that make up the Great Square in Pegasus. On April 13, the comet will pass close to the bright star. The comet is currently at a magnitude of +8, making it too faint to see with the naked eye. Youâll need a telescope or a pair of binoculars to catch a glimpse. Be sure to wake up before morning twilight washes it from view. Despite its small size, the comet should appear as a green sphere with a faint tail trailing behind. The comet is currently racing toward greatness or doom, depending on the outcome of its close encounter with the Sun. Comets are the frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system, and are made up of material such as dust, rock, and ice. As comets orbit closer to the Sun, they heat up and spew gases and dust. That’s the glowing head that we see, which can be larger than most planets. Then the remaining dust and gas form a long tail, which stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles, according toNASA. When comets approach perihelionâthe closest point to the Sunâthe heat from the star can cause the comet to completely disintegrate and disappear from existence. On the other hand, if comets happen to survive the perihelion, they can appear much brighter in the skies. Comet C/2025 F2 is on a path toward the Sun, with preliminary estimates suggesting it will make its closest approach to the Sun on May 1, according to EarthSky. The comet will come within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) from the Sun, or just inside the orbit of the closest planet to the star, Mercury. During perihelion, the comet will be at a brightness magnitude between 4.5 to 5, but it will likely be too close to the horizon to see at that time. If it does survive the heated encounter, it will begin to appear in the dusk sky rather than at dawn during the first few days of May. It’s not clear yet exactly how much brighter it will be. That’s good news for those who aren’t a fan of early morning sky watching sessions, so hopefully the comet does survive its rendezvous with our host star.

    "title": "What The Fantastic Four: First Steps Learned From the Previous Iterations",
    "article_text": "IfThe Fantastic Four: First Stepswere the firstFantastic Fourmovie, it might look a lot different. As it stands, though,it’s actually the fourth movie based onMarvel’s first family, and according to its filmmakers, that made a big impact. Speaking toEntertainment Weeklyin a very extensive piece, the film’s director Matt Shakman spoke about how the decision to make the main villain Galactus (played by Ralph Ineson in a suit) was, in part, a result of the previous films not doing that. “Doom’s a great character, but he takes up a lot of air,” Shakman said. “Other film adaptations have done both an origin story and Doom. We’re doing neither, and that allows us to look at them from a fresh perspective.” That instinct to go against the grain extends beyond just Galactus, though. While the previous films were largely modern-day takes, this one is set in the 1960s, an homage to the comic book origins of the characters. It also extends to certain characters. Johnny Storm, for example, previously played by Chris Evans and Michael B. Jordan, is often seen as something of a smooth-talking womanizer. Joseph Quinn, who plays the role this time, didn’t want to copy that. “Myself and [Marvel Studios president] Kevin [Feige] were speaking about previous iterations of him and where we are culturally,” Quinn said. “He was branded as this womanizing, devil-may-care guy, but is that sexy these days? I don’t think so. This version of Johnny is less callous with other people’s feelings, and hopefully there’s a self-awareness about what’s driving that attention-seeking behavior.” Then, of course, there’s also the fact that thisFantastic Fouris part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which will see the characters carry over their story into at least one more movie,Avengers: Doomsday. There they will, almost certainly, show down with Doctor Doom, played by Robert Downey Jr. So, it’s not like Marvel Studios is totally ignoring the classic iterations of the Fantastic Four.

    "title": "Developer of 'non-consensual sex' game withdraws it from Steam after it's banned in the UK, Canada, and Australia: 'We don't intend to fight the whole world'",
    "article_text": "The developer defended the adult game's content, but withdrew it from Steam following political pressure and public censure. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Valve stopped Steam sales of adult game No Mercy in the UK this week following a complaint from UK technology secretary Peter Kyle, who insisted that the \"deeply worrying\" game be removed due to its extreme content, as reported bynews outlet LBC. No Mercy included \"incest,\" \"blackmail,\" and \"unavoidable non-consensual sex,\" according to its Steam page, which also promised players the opportunity to become \"every woman's worst nightmare\" and \"never take 'no' for an answer.\" No Mercy was also removed from sale in Canada and Australia, and on Thursday the developer announced that it would pull the game from Steam entirely, although it defended the content as harmless. \"We don't intend to fight the whole world, and specifically, we don't want to cause any problems for Steam and Valve,\" Zerat Games said in a statement posted to No Mercy's Steam page. That page is no longer accessible, though users who previously purchased the game still have access. Since it began allowing adult games on Steam in 2018, Valve has curated the category with an extremely light touch, saying initially that it would only remove games that contained illegal content or were \"trolling.\" No Mercy may in fact fall into the illegal category in the UK:A 2008 UK lawmade it illegal to possess \"extreme pornographic images,\" including \"explicit and realistic\" pornographic depictions of non-consensual sex. \"That sort of vile material is already currently illegal,\" Home Secretary Yvette Coopertold LBCabout No Mercy. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The attention on No Mercy has also raised the question of whether Valve does enough to prevent minors from accessing adult content on Steam. In 2023, the UK passed theOnline Safety Act, which demands \"robust age checks\" for viewing pornographic content,such asID or credit card verification. No age verification is required to make a Steam account and turn off the adult content filter, and physical gift cards can be used in place of credit card payment to purchase games. The Online Safety Act and other laws that require adults to submit identification to access online pornography have been criticized by free speech and privacy advocates such as theElectronic Frontier Foundation, as have other efforts to regulate internet content in the UK, US, and elsewhere. In its original form, the Online Safety Act would have also given the UK government the power to compel companies to take down \"legal but harmful\" content, but that wording wasremoved over concerns that it would limit free speech. Former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, a member of the Conservative Party who argued for keeping the \"legal but harmful\" aspect of the Online Safety Act, told LBC that games like No Mercy must be banned to protect \"children, vulnerable adults, and women.\" \"It's appalling and feeds into the insidious 'Andrew Tate' narrative which is taking hold amongst young men who spend too much time online,\" Dorries told the outlet. \"I hate banning things, but sadly, social media has taken us to the place whereby for the protection of children, vulnerable adults, and women, we have to: this needs to be removed online, immediately.\" Before the developer of No Mercy chose to remove it from Steam entirely, aChange.org petitionreceived over 13,000 signatures calling for Valve to stop sales of the game globally. \"By treating rape as entertainment, No Mercy puts all women and girls at risk,\" reads the petition. In its statement, the No Mercy developer said that the game has been misrepresented in online videos with \"graphics from a completely different game,\" but acknowledged that No Mercy depicts behavior that is \"disgusting\" in the real world. The creator asserted, however, that incest, blackmail, and \"male domination\" are common kinks that don't reflect on the character of those who seek them out in a fictional, roleplay context, and don't cause social or psychological harm. Valve has tightened its rules for adult content on Steam since 2018, disallowing \"nude or sexually explicit images of real people\" and making occasional exceptions to its hands-off policy, such as byrefusing to sell a game called \"Rape Day\" in 2019, but it continues to take a mostly laissez faire approach to moderating its storefront. As a result, No Mercy is hardly the only game in Steam's adults-only section that may qualify as \"extreme\" under UK law and be considered harmful by large parts of the public. Without leaving the adult section's front page, I encountered a game that promises \"mind control, corruption, dominance, and submission\" and another that says it includes \"sexual violence\" and \"optional incest.\" Valve has not responded to a request for comment.

You never know what'll catch your eye when you're watching a trailer for a new game: Glitzy graphics, great character design, hot gunplay—or maybe something a little more subtle, as is the case in today's trailer for Ikuma: The Frozen Compass. \"Dang, some really good snow in this game,\" PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde said, a comment that made me curious because really, how good could the snow be? But you know what? Dang, that is some good snow. Ikuma is a coming-of-age story about a cabin boy named Sam and his sled dog Ellie, who find themselves trapped on an uncharted island in the Arctic in 1864. Venturing through unfamiliar terrain and harsh weather, Sam and Ellie will use the few tools they can find on the island to fish, forage, and try to stay warm and alive. They'll also \"find fading traces of a long lost expedition and uncover a dark secret,\" which I sincerely hope isn't cannibalism. You know howthese things go, though. After taking a moment to appreciate the snow (right around the 32 second mark) and the overall visual style of the trailer which I quite like, I started to get a feeling that this wasn't the first I'd heard of developer Mooneye Studios. Sure enough, I was right: Mooneye is also the developer ofLost Ember, \"a wonderful, unique, and unforgettable experience with a love for nature\" that earned a 90% review score in 2019. That's an impressive indie pedigree, and it took me from \"yeah, good snow\" to genuine interest in what Ikuma is all about. \"We're ridiculously nervous, yet thrilled, to finally be able to talk about what we've been working on in secret for the past five years,\" Mooneye Studios CEO and story writer Tobias Graff said. \"We cannot wait to hear what people think of Ikuma.\" Wait they will, though, and so will we: Ikuma isn't expected to be out until sometime in 2026.

    "article_text": "Gamble or die in a 'never-ending debt simulator' Clover Pit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You think Balatro had trouble convincingrating boardsandYouTubeit's not gambling? I predictCloverPit, a self-described \"rogue-lite slot machine nightmare,\" is going to have to work twice as hard. CloverPit combines a demonic slot machine with Balatro-like upgrades and progress, crams it into a grubby prison cell, and makes you spin the reels. Pump in coins, play the slot, buy weird upgrades, repeat. Oh, and the money you're playing with isn't really yours, it belongs to a forbidding ATM in the corner, so pay off your debt between rounds. If you don't, you die. Even the small taste of the freeCloverPit demois really appealing if you like slots, magic, and gritty graphics. You start with just a handful of change and have to repay a debt of 75 coins in three rounds (similar to facing a Balatro boss every third round). Deposit your coins, spin the reels, and hope lady luck grants you some matching lemons, cherries, and bells: seems like a slot machine so far. But at the end of the round you can spend tickets and coins you've won on upgrades, which lets you start breaking things. With my first round of winnings I picked out a weird squid with a bloodshot eye who would leap into the frame on the last spin of a round and grant me good luck—the first time I used it, the reels turned up nearly all cherries, so that horrid little good luck charm was a good buy. I also bought a bible to protect me against a \"666\" coming up on the reels (I'm pretty sure my prison cell is in hell), a \"stonks\" talisman that let me earn more interest from my winnings, and some shrooms which gave me a nice multiplier if more than 3 patterns appeared on the reels. There are also abilities you can buy, some that trigger randomly, others that fire off when you hammer the big red button on the slot machine. The idea is to find items and powers that synergize nicely together to turn your dozens of coins into hundreds or thousands. I love the gritty, grubby looks of the game and how everything is situated around you in the claustrophobic little prison cell: if you want to buy an upgrade, you have to physically turn around and click on the vending machine it's stored in, and whatever you buy will be plopped on the table next to the slot machine. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At the end of the round it feels like the camera is physically jerking your head around the cell (in a good way) to show you what's happening: your coins pouring out of the slots, your interest being dispensed from the ATM, your tickets being printed, and the grate under your feet rattling. Yeah, did I mention the grate under your feet? It's what's going to open at the end of every third round if you haven't paid back your ever-increasing debt to that looming ATM. Then you'll fall. You'll fall into darkness. I like this slot machine game. But is it gambling? I'll let the CloverPit Steam page answer that: \"Hell no! CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator,\" says developer Panik Arcade. \"Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!\" Will PEGI and YouTube buy that argument? I wouldn't bet on it. You can find theCloverPit demohere. Full release comes later this year.

    "title": "Industry report says Steam users play more noncompetitive games than console players—and our interest in PvE keeps growing",
    "article_text": "There's more to life than a K/D ratio. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In popular conception, the gamer is an individual preoccupied with virtual conquest—in shooters, in MOBAs, or in any other format allowing for what the ancients once called \"pwning,\" before the term was rightfully culled from common parlance. PC players, however, aren't as preoccupied with PvP. According to industry analysts, Steam users are more likely than console players to play noncompetitive games, and that interest keeps increasing. In its 2025 report on games industry trends, market research company Newzoo had surveyed \"raw telemetry data taken from over 1 million players\" to compare gameplaying trends on different platforms. Examining the games that each player in its dataset had played at least two hours of, Newzoo said that 58% of the games played by Steam users in 2024 were entirely noncompetitive PvE games, compared to 42% of games played on PlayStation and 41% of games played on Xbox. Newzoo's data shows that Steam user interest in PvE games has seen steady yearly increases, growing from 47% in 2021. Newzoo attributes the \"increasingly more PvE-friendly\" Steam userbase to the growing popularity of what it calls \"social-focused titles.\" The terminology's a bit clunky, but it doesn't seem inaccurate when you count how many breakout hits in recent years—like Helldivers 2, Lethal Company, and more recently Schedule 1—have been focused primarily on jolly cooperative mayhem. I suspect the differences in platform offerings play a role here, too. Steam has a lower barrier to entry for smaller developers, providing PC players a wider breadth of indie games that—while incomparably weird and beautiful—are more likely to be made on tighter budgets that can't as easily accommodate the additional development and networking costs of competitive multiplayer. There are some asterisks on the data that bear mentioning. For one thing, it doesn't seem like Newzoo's survey differentiates between singleplayer and multiplayer games; calling a singleplayer game a PvE game isn'twrong,but it does feel a little redundant. These charts also don't compare playtime; a player might have played a higher number of PvE games while spending more hours overall in PvP games. More of note, however, is that Newzoo's panel doesn't include player data from China and India. It's safe to say that without player metrics from theChineseandIndianmarkets, which together comprise more than a billion people playing video games, Newzoo's panel isn't entirely representative of global gaming preferences. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Interestingly, Newzoo noted that across all three platforms, the more games someone plays in a year, the more likely it is that the games they're playing are PvE titles. But while the increase is a more gradual one on both consoles, Steam players show \"a notable hockey stick effect,\" where the likelihood of noncompetitive interest jumps dramatically as soon as a Steam player is playing more than one game a year. To me, there's an intuitive logic to those numbers. While PC gaming has grown more approachable in the last decade, it's still a more enthusiast market. Competitive games have the broadest market appeal, so those are the games someone is likely to pick up if they only play one or two games in a year. PvE games are the ones more likely to be filling fan wikis and user-made spreadsheets penned by devoted weirdos. For players who hang up their Discord chat with their Marvel Rivals crew and immediately go looking for sicko stuff to play, PC remains destination number one.

    "title": "Ubisoft's defense against The Crew lawsuit doubles down on a point we've heard many times before: You don't actually own your games",
    "article_text": "Ubisoft claims consumers were given \"clear and conspicuous\" notice that they were only buying a \"limited license\" to access the game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ubisoftfelt bad enough about killing The Crew in 2024 that it promised tonever, ever do it again—in The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest, at least. But it doesn't feel so bad that it's willing to admit it actually did anything wrong: In response to a proposedclass action lawsuitover the shutdown filed last year, Ubisoft said the plaintiffs in the case knew—or should have known—that they were only buying \"limited licenses\" to access the game. Ubisoft'sresponseto the lawsuit, filed in February and available viaPolygon, makes multiple claims as to why the suit should be dismissed, including that relevant statutes of limitation have expired, that no \"cognizable injury\" was suffered, that there's no evidence the plaintiffs wouldn't have bought the game anyway, and as already mentioned, that the plaintiffs knew what they were getting into because of \"the explicit warnings on The Crew's packaging that plaintiffs were obtaining a limited license to access the game.\" \"The Xbox and PlayStation packaging contain a clear and conspicuous notice—in all capital letters—that 'UBISOFT MAY CANCEL ACCESS TO ONE OR MORE SPECIFIC ONLINE FEATURES UPON A 30-DAY PRIOR NOTICE',\" the filing states. \"The PlayStation packaging's list of game features includes 'ONLINE PLAY (REQUIRED,' and again warns on the front of the package: 'ONLINE CONNECTION REQUIRED.' The Xbox package contains a similar warning that The Crew 'REQUIRES INTERNET.' \"In other words, both packages warn (1) that Ubisoft may terminate online connectivity upon prior 30-day notice and (2) that playing The Crew requires online connectivity.\" A trip around toMobyGames, which has scans of The Crew packaging, confirms that these messages are indeed there. Are they \"clear and conspicuous?\" I am not a lawyer but my gut feeling here is no, that is neither clear nor conspicuous, and while those of us who are reasonably immersed into gaming might know the score—we don't actually own our games—there are plenty of people who do not, and more to the point would likely not even be aware that there's fine print to read in the first place. It's a videogame, right? The whole \"clear and conspicuous\" thing has come up in gaming before, maybe most famously amidst the fallout of the CS:GO Lotto case, which resulted in the FTC issuing an order requiring influencers to \"clearly and conspicuously disclose\" any connections to products or services they're promoting. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But another, more recent case may actually surpass it in prominence, and yes, it's The Crew: In response to the game's shutdown and the outrage that followed, the state of Californiaproposed a new lawrequiring game sellers to provide \"clear and conspicuous\" warnings to consumers that the games they purchase could be taken away at any time. Not long after that,Steam added a new disclaimerto its purchase page warning that \"a purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam.\" (GOG, as is its way, took the opportunity to post a disclaimer of its own, reminding one and all that its games come with offline installers \"which cannot be taken away from you.\" Gotta respect the hustle.) Ubisoft's defense doesn't turn entirely on that point, but it is a particularly interesting one because the concept of \"ownership\" is growing increasingly hazy in this digital age. A Ubisoft executive took heat in 2024 for saying gamers should get comfortable with the idea ofnot owning their games, but he wasn't wrong. If anything, the ship has sailed and many of us just didn't notice. But could that ship sail back into port if a judge someday decides temporary ownership is a bunch of malarkey? Anyway, back to the lawsuit: Ubisoft also claims the plaintiffs don't have standing to bring the case because ultimately, they got what they paid for. \"After making their purchases, plaintiffs enjoyed access to The Crew for years before Ubisoft decided in late 2023 to retire and shut down the servers of the 10-year-old videogame,\" the filing states. \"Plaintiffs received the benefit of the bargain and cannot complain now that they were deceived simply because Ubisoft did not then create an offline version of the discontinued videogame.\" To bolster the point, Ubisoft's lawyers cite another case, Mai v. Supercell Oy, in which plaintiffs claimed harm caused by the game's loot boxes, which amounted to illegal gambling. The court concluded in that case that \"plaintiffs lacked standing because they did 'not allege a deficiency in the loot boxes or virtual currency they received in exchange for their real-world currency' ... in other words, the plaintiffs failed to establish standing because their complaint made clear that 'in fact, they received what they paid for'.\" The Polygon report says the plaintiffs in the case filed an amended complaint in March addressing the issues raised by Ubisoft, adding another allegation arguing that The Crew's virtual currency was equivalent to gift certificates, which aren't allowed to expire under California law—and thus when Ubisoft ended the game and rendered the in-game currency useless, it broke the law. It also includes images of The Crew's packaging showing that the activation code for The Crew doesn't expire until 2099, which it claims implies that the game would remain playable until at least that year.

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls Online is getting subclassing—which'll expand its roster of classes to 'over 3,000' combinations of mix-and-matched skill lines",
    "article_text": "This adventurer can fit so many skill combinations in it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Elder Scrolls Onlineis celebrating its 10th anniversary soon—and there are some big changes coming up in the pipeline. The biggest shake-up to this MMO, which has pretty admirably stood the test of time alongside its competition, is the introduction of subclassing—as announced in the latest ESO direct. This grenade—filled with cool stuff, mind, but explosive all the same—thrown into the game's balance ecosystem works as follows: In ESO, a character typically gets to choose a set of abilities from up to three skill lines in their class: The Templar, for instance, has the Aedric Spear, Dawn's Wrath, and Restoring Light skill lines. With subclassing, though, players will get to choose skill lines fromallclasses—with a few limitations. You need to be level 50 to access the system, and at least one of your skill lines will have to be from your base class. For example, if you're a Templar, you could pick abilities from the Templar's Aedric Spear line, the Dragon Knight's Draconic Power skill line, and the Necromancer's Bone Tyrant skill line. You could swap out Aedric Spear for the other templar skill lines, but nothing else. There is one penalty: Skills from other classes cost twice as many skill points to use. This makes subclassing slightly more expensive, though given you get hundreds of skill points, it shouldn't really be too much of a clamp on your character's power, just how long it takes to put those skills together. This, the direct boasts, expands the game's seven base classes into \"over 3,000\" combinations—which is, uh, a little intense. Game director Rich Lambert seemed pretty relaxed about the whole thing in a post-preview Q&A—expressing that the team had done some extensive testing, and while \"Power level will go up,\" developers are \"fine with where it is.\" It's a very ambitious move for a 10-year old MMO to be making, turning ESO from a mono-class game into something with an ARPG-level amount of build options. But from a relative outsider's perspective, it does somehow feel… well, right. The Elder Scrolls series has always been about cobbling together your own hero from a bunch of different options; and the subclassing system will allow you to do exactly that. The new subclass system, along with the start of its Seasons of the Worm Cult structure, will kick off in June—so get your build calculators ready, this one's going to be a doozy.

    "title": "After 10 years of setting-hopping, The Elder Scrolls Online is coming home for a new chapter of its base game story, returning player QoL updates, and a writhing wall of 'soul-juice concrete'",
    "article_text": "TES the season to be wormy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was invited to a preview ofThe Elder Scrolls Online's10th anniversary Direct showcase earlier this week—and it looks like it's pulling out all the stops. TESO has spent the last 10 years hopping from setting to setting, taking players on a world tour of Tamriel—to Morrowind, Elsweyr, Blackwood, Telvanni—you name it, players have probably gone there. After a decade of that structure, though, ZeniMax is keen to \"shake things up\"—while the MMOhadbeen operating on a more-or-less annual chapter system, it'll be heading to a more seasonal structure going forward. The first of which, Seasons of the Worm Cult, sees a return to the game's OG storyline. \"This is a sequel to the base game storyline,\" explains game director Rich Lambert. \"Ten years in the making.\" The chapter takes place on a new tropical island by the name of Solstice, where outcast Argonians and Altmer have come together as outcasts do—in a weird, politically tense blend of culture. The Order of the Black Worm is back, manned by a new leader called Wormblood—which feels like a self-fulfilling name, and a bit unfair from their parents, but hey. You gotta play the hand you're dealt, I guess. Alongside promised quality of life features to help returning players get stuck back in, this whole gear-shift feels like a reset for ESO's long-lived story, and a decent starting-off point for new players as well. Old characters, like Razum-dar, Skordo the Knife, and Vanus Galerion are making a return to help get folks settled in. Speaking of, ZeniMax is working on a proper \"welcome back\" feature for returning players, though details are mostly vague, and is set to update tutorial zones with graphical facelifts. It's clear that the developer really wants to bring lapsed players back into the fold, outright stating that it'll be focused on addressing \"long-standing player feedback\". ZeniMax seems to be emphasising that there'll be a focus on experimentation, too. Seasons might be \"short or long\", and there's even talk of \"remix\" seasons—carrying echoes of WoW's Mists of Pandaria Remix—in the works. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Alongside other features, like a 12-person raid dubbed \"The Ossian Cage\", ESO players'll get to work together to topple The Writhing Wall, a big barrier cleaving Solstice in twain. They'll get to build fortifications, siege weapons, and improve defenses in order to take it down. What's more, progress will be tracked on a server-by-server basis, so it's entirely possible one server might get to see the end of the storyline before another. The final update to the season—coming sometime \"in the fourth quarter\"—will see Eastern Solstice unlocked for players to romp around. Now for the bad news. A seasonal structure means a new content pass to actually play it, one which won't be wrapped into an ESO premium subscription. Mind, past expansions weren't either, and given the breadth of content on display here I'm not sure it's a jerk move so long as the pricing remains reasonable. Still, in a post-stream Q&A session, Lambert reassured players that there wouldn't be much FOMO involved: \"We will sometimes bring things back. We will also make sure that super exclusive things are generally easy to get so you don't feel like you have to grind every day of the season in order to get it.\" That's easier said than done, mind. There are some growing pains to be had when moving from your standard MMO structure to a more seasonal model, but experimentation like, say, adding subclasses to your game after a decade, can bring a lot of life back to a game. Not that TESO needs it. It's actually been a huge financial success for Bethesda,raking in over $2 billion in its lifetime. The introductory chapter for Seasons of the Worm Cult will be available as soon as The Elder Scrolls Online direct showcase goes live, with the majority of content releasing in June—the public test server will be spinning up very soon, with Lambert suggesting it might be available as soon as next week.

    "article_text": "\"Not going ahead.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Following years of rumours, Amazon Prime Video officially revealed plans for a new TV series based on the Tomb Raider gamesin May 2024. The announcement's big hook was Phoebe Waller-Bridge as writer and producer, who's best-known as the creator of Fleabag and head writer of Killing Eve, and amped-up her own fandom for the series: \"Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can't wait to go on this adventure. Bats 'n all.\" Well, it was a nice idea.The Daily Mailnow cites a source saying that Lara Croft's mooted small screen adventures are \"not going ahead\", while another source is even more unambiguous: the project is \"dead.\" Neither Prime Video nor Waller-Bridge's representatives have commented. This is not the first time that rumours have swirled around the production, and whether fairly or not the fingers point at Waller-Bridge's scripts, which were apparently delayed for some time and then judged unsuitable for the project. Prime Video signed up Waller-Bridge to a megabucks exclusivity deal in 2019 worth $20 million a year, but since then it has produced no shows or films from the creator. That deal was made under the aegis of Jennifer Salke, who also greenlit and was overseeing the Tomb Raider project, and was the head of Amazon Studios until just last week. \"[Waller-Bridge] grew up playing Lara Croft/Tomb Raider,\" said Salke in 2023. \"We think it's going to be a huge franchise for us.\" Puck's Matthew Belloni, in an article focused on Salke's time at Amazon, makes the whole thing soundlike a huge mess: \"Tomb Raider, which Waller-Bridge has been working on and which Salke was personally overseeing after announcing a series pickup last May, has now gone through two writers rooms and tens of millions of dollars in development costs. There’s still no script.\" Amazon is yet to officially confirm the cancellation. Also in development is a new Tomb Raider game fromseries veterans Crystal Dynamics, which is being developed on Unreal Engine 5 and, hold on to your hats folks, will feature \"mind-bending puzzles,\" a \"wide variety of enemies,\" and be \"a new chapter [in] Lara Croft’s story.\" That has no release date: but at least it's (probably) still going to happen. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "The next game from the creator of Hyper Light Drifter is a Toonami-core anime throwback set in one of the most interesting Metroid-style worlds I've seen in a while",
    "article_text": "My first look at Possessor(s)' gameplay was very promising. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alongside theembattled-but-promising roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine has another project in the works:Possessor(s), a more classicometroidvaniasearch actiongame looking to make its mark in an increasingly crowded genre⁠—one where studio founder Alx Preston definitively prefers the Japanese genre name over the unwieldy English one. Can't say I blame him, I hope it catches on. I had the chance to watch unscripted, live gameplay of Possessor(s)' earliest levels, and also talk to narrative director Tyler Hutchinson and writer Laura Michet about the project. Games like this really live or die on their exploration and level design: In recent years, Hollow Knight provided one of my favorite maps in the genre, while Metroid Dread left me feeling cold by somehow managing to be both handholdy and obtuse. But what I saw of Possessor(s)' world has me intrigued and hopeful, while it's also injecting some Platinum-style character action DNA, which was most apparent in a parry-centric boss fight I saw against a flying demon bomber guy. The premise and presentation is very '00s anime⁠—I kept trying to get \"Toonamicore\" to catch on when describing 2022's excellentNeon White, and it's a similar vibe here. Hutchinson and Michet wouldn't name names, but Death Note, YuYu Hakusho (I guess that's '90s), and Shin Megami Tensei (I guess that's a videogame) all sprang to mind looking at it. Something foul hits the fan in a fictional city dominated by an Umbrella-style megacorp (the economic achilles heel of many a promising metro area), leading to an influx of demons and a Half-Life 2: Episode 2 swirly-dimension-hell vortex looming over everything. Typical. Most of the demons⁠—who can't exist in our world long without a host⁠—accidentally possess inanimate objects, leading to one of Possessor(s) coolest conceits. \"They lose their minds because of the horror and pain of possessing a fax machine or a security camera,\" said producer Myriame Lachapelle, so most of Possessor(s)' enemies are going to be mundane objects made evil. That goes for weaponry too: One secondary weapon is a computer mouse, while the demo showed off an electric guitar as the big, slow, Guts sword type-deal. \"It was only fitting that since so many of our enemies are just everyday objects that are monsters, that our weapons themselves are improvised and common everyday objects that you might find,\" Hutchinson said. \"I think a lot of it just stems from Alx, early on, creating tons of tone pieces of cool people fighting with weapons and this is a really number one pillar of 'Yes, we want to have fun combat with weird weapons.'\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Our protagonist, Luca, is a young woman who loses her legs in the demon onslaught, saved from certain doom thanks to possession by a demon named Rhem. This lends her new demon legs, powers, and a cynical, experienced deuteragonist for her shaken idealism to bounce off of as she searches for survivors and answers in the wreckage. The thing that got me most excited in the hands-off demo was the look of Possessor(s)' environments. Search-metroid-action-vanias can often have this really abstract feel to their side scrolling levels, while Possessor(s)' starting destroyed office building actually felt like a real place I was getting a dollhouse view of. This could lead to a strong sense of atmosphere in the final game. \"I'm always super impressed by how moody the levels are and how much they do express these environments you would expect to see in this dystopian corporate city,\" said Michet, and Hutchinson explained that there was a big focus on \"diegetic choices\" when it came to creating these environments. My first impression of the mechanical level design is similarly positive: I clocked a fun, unexpected shortcut at one point, as well as a platforming challenge with the grappling hook that looked very satisfying. After checking in at the big 'ol sealed final boss door under Evilcorp HQ, you get that oh-so-satisfying search-vania moment where it cuts to your mostly-empty map screen and flings an objective impossibly far out into the void, daring you to go fill out those gaps. \"We have two really great level designers, [Mars Ashton] and [Jordan Fanaris],\" said Hutchinson. \"They work continuously on designing the map with [Heart Machine founder Alx Preston].\" It sounds like the design of this world is in good hands: Preston has the 2D exploration bona fides of the original Drifter, while Fanaris was a developer on Half-Life remake Black Mesa. \"They are constantly just refining levels and trying to build a map that fully matches up everywhere,\" Hutchinson continued. \"I think they've got great ideas about building out new systems of doors, keys, and abilities.\" Possessor(s)' combat and platforming looked great from afar, with crisp spritework and a good variety of abilities even in the starting area. There's the aforementioned grappling hook, as well as a shield/parry ability that reminded me most of Fox and Falco's Shine from the Super Smash Bros. series. The levels in Possessor(s) are full 3D, but Luca and her enemies are 2D sprites, all the better to show off the game's '00s anime character designs. Fighting with regular enemies looked good⁠—it's hard to judge without a controller in hand⁠—but the lone boss fight shown in the demo really grabbed my attention. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together He'd fly in a bomber pattern, carpeting the arena in parryable projectiles, with the trick of the fight being to angle yourself just right to bounce one or more of them back on each bombing run. It struck me as some mechanically unique, engaging design, like the great 2D boss battles of Hollow Knight or Pizza Tower. On the back of this preview demo, I feel like I know the exact game Possessor(s) is trying to be, and its familiarity means success or failure lies entirely in the execution. Luckily, signs point to it having a uniquely immersive searchvania world, and combat to continue Heart Machine's strong character action tradition. Possessor(s) currently does not have a release window, but you can wishlist the game onSteam.

By the looks of it, all of them. Lucky for you, the guns in Void/Breaker are heavily moddable, so much so that developer Stubby Games, who also created 2022's The Entropy Centre, promises \"infinite weapon customization.\" Adding to the fun are destructible environments, which you can get a glimpse of in the Void/Breaker trailer that debuted today at the Triple-I Initiative showcase: \"Discover limitless weapon combinations using the ultimate gun-modding system. Strategically combine mods to create devastating loadouts. Unlock wild synergies that turn you into an unstoppable force,\" reads the Void/Breaker Steam store page. \"Why just shoot your enemies when you can tear down the world around them? Environmental destruction isn't just for show—it's a core gameplay mechanic. Blast through walls, collapse structures, and stagger enemies to survive.\" It certainly looks slick as hell and action-packed: the Steam page also shows what looks like Slay the Spire-style paths you take through the game between arena-like enemy encounters. As you fight your way through the world you'll gather parts and power-ups and craft more powerful weapons to face an ever growing horde of mechanical enemies. It's especially impressive this is coming from a solo dev, Daniel Stubbington of Stubby Games.

    "article_text": "At long last, Askiisoft says \"everything has started to come together\" on the DLC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I don't think about 2019's sidescrolling cyberpunk samurai action gameKatana Zerotoo often, but any time I do the thought is: \"Damn that really was some excellent sidescrolling cyberpunk samurai action; I should replay it.\" My excuse to do so is finally almost here, because the free DLC that developer Askiisoft has beenworking on for yearsis \"finally nearing completion.\" The Katana Zero DLC—still unnamed, apparently—showed up at the Triple-i Initiative showcase today with a new trailer as proof of life. It's light on details but it looks like there's a lot more fighting through underground bunkers, special samurai abilities, and government conspiracy fever dreams. \"Featuring all new characters, levels, gameplay and story, this massive DLC promises to be worth the wait,\" Askiisoft and Devolver Digital say. They add that, yes, the DLC will still be free for everyone who owns the game despite the fact that it's now nearly the size of the base game—which was around six hours in my first playthrough if I'm remembering correctly. As for thewhen, they say: \"We still can’t give a date, but everything has started to come together!\" So this year, maybe? DLC or no, it really is just about time for me to go replay Katana Zero with the benefit of the hard mode and speedrun modes that got added after launch. It's been six years since it launched and frankly I already thought indie sidescrolling platformers were tired then, but Katana Zero is one of the gems rising above a dusty trend thanks to some really tightly-designed, puzzle-like levels and the constant threat of one-hit death. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Rematch is out in June, and there's a closed beta this weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. French game developer Sloclap is known for martial arts gamesAbsolverandSifu, both of which are very good in my estimation. I also love competitive (car) soccer game Rocket League. So I'm pretty excited for the combination of these things: Rematch, a 5v5 competitive soccer game from Sloclap. Rematch will be out on June 19, Sloclap announced at today's Triple-I Initiative showcase. A closed beta is happening this weekend, too—you can find details on theSteam page. There is one thing preventing me from being exactly the kind of person Remach is made for, which is that my Canadian and American upbringing has left me preferring Rocket League's hockey mode to its regular soccer mode. If only I had some strong familial connection to almost anywhere else in the world, where soccer is a religion (orthodox football, as they call it), I'd be the ideal Rematch player. But I still think it's a great idea. Sloclap's experience designing complex martial arts systems seems a natural fit for ball handling, and there's a lot of fertile ground still to explore in this sort of multiplayer sports game design. Rocket League is so fun because while it's abstract in some ways (the flying cars, mainly), it is not abstract in the way a lot of sports games are, where players control a whole field of little athletes. It's a team-based physics game, which makes it feel more like actually playing a sport than most sports games, despite the rocket engines. Rematch doesn't go full QWOP and make you control your limbs individually or anything, but it's also a sports game in which each player controls one athlete, and so at the tactics level, it looks like you've got to play it something like you'd play soccer—relying on your teammates to be where you need them to be to receive passes and cut off advances from your opponents.

If you want to sell to Mick, all you need to do is head to the front of the warehouse, which is next to the motel, and talk to the store clerk. This will give you two options: Either make a deal or sell Mick your unused equipment.

It'll also free up some space so you can make your drug manufacturing process slightly more streamlined. Before this patch the only way to free up space was just to discard the equipment, so at least you get a bit of cash for your troubles now. But if you still can't seem to sell to Mick, it probably means you're playing the wrong version of the game. Currently Mick's pawn shop is only available to those using the beta branch, which gives players early access to updates before they launch. Getting on the inside track is easy: all you need to do is find Schedule 1 in your Steam library, right-click it, select properties, go to Betas, and then click the drop-down menu where it says \"None\" and select the third option. The game will then automatically update itself, after which you'll gain access to the beta branch. In addition to giving players a new source of income, this content patch adds a whole host of new items like a gold watch, six different paintings, a toilet, and much more. There are also a couple of tweaks and improvements, like an increased jar stack size, more null checks and validity checks, and adding the supplier's name to the meeting icons in the map app. Time skips, like sleeping, also now affect the supplier meeting countdown, and the counteroffer product selection interface has been improved.

    "article_text": "Keen Games felt the shrouded areas were \"not strong enough,\" so they're being overhauled. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today at the Triple-I Initiative, open world survival RPGEnshroudedrevealed what's coming in next month's update, and it can be summed up in one foreboding phrase: \"Rebirth of the Shroud.\" That means deadly new monsters and mysterious new locations are lurking in those perilous shrouded regions of the world, along with plenty of new reasons to venture into the murk like a system that will let players build powerful new customizable weapons. Here's the teaser for the update: Last week I spoke with Antony Christoulakis, Enshrouded's creative director, about some of the big additions coming in the next update, which is called Thralls of Twilight. Christoulakis said the update is focused on the shroud because \"it's not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting.\" One of those new mechanics does indeed sound interesting: \"You can find special gems that you can insert into weapons that have various abilities,\" Christoulakis said. \"You can do so by finding these gems during combat or in treasure chests. But you can also enhance these gems as they all have special effects, and you can keep the specific effect, if you like it that much, across the rest of the game to basically level with you.\" When gems are introduced in the update, the weapons you'll find will have a chance to contain a slottable socket to fit a gem into. But you won't be slotting these gems into your weapons at your cozy little base: you're going to have to find \"special forges\" hidden around the world in some dangerous places. \"The higher the [weapon] rarity, the higher the chance that it also has a slot for a gem,\" Christoulakis said. \"You can mix and match, insert any gem into any weapon, but to do so, you have to unlock the slot first, which is one step, and then you have to insert the gem into the weapon, which you can do in special places that are also mainly found within the shroud.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That gives you more reasons to visit shrouded locations, and Keen Games has been working on making those areas more interesting to spend time in \"because some areas were a bit too empty,\" Christoulakis said. \"You can just run across it, basically, in a straight line without any obstacles, or the dangers awaiting you are a bit too repetitive. We felt there needed to be more variation.\" Nighttime is also getting an overhaul in the update, though Christoulakis didn't want to spoil too much about it other than saying it'll give players more reason to \"actually go out at night and not just sit it out and sleep,\" he said. \"We will add specific things that only appear at night, that can be found and that are also necessary to solve certain problems that we throw at the player.\" Vague, but intriguing. As for the biggest player request, adding water to the world, that won't be part of this update. \"It's a tricky problem, adding [water] to a dynamic voxel-based world where players can just pull the plug on a lake and it just flows somewhere,\" Christoulakis said, though he added: \"We are working on this, and it's definitely going to happen.\" Keen Games also announced another big milestone today: Enshrouded has amassed more than four million players. When it arrives in May, Thralls of Twilight will be Enshrouded's sixth major update since it launched into early access in January 2024.

That timeline just got a lot more certain. Thanks to anew trailershown during today's Triple-I Initiative showcase, The Alters has locked in a release date on June 13. In The Alters, you play as humble spaceman Jan Dolski, the single, stranded survivor of a failed expedition to an alien planet. Unfortunately, that planet will finish the job when its next sunrise melts Jan and his mobile space-base into slag. With a bit of quantum computing and experimental space matter, however, Jan finds a makeshift solution: He can pluck alternate versions of himself from parallel timelines, letting him can delegate the necessary elements of base building, tech research, and general survivalism in an effort to escape back to space through the combined effort of the Interdimensional Council of Jans. Unfortunately, as the trailer above highlights, putting a bunch of clones in a doomed survival situation tends to produce some interpersonal friction, and escaping annihilation will require as much conflict resolution as it does resource gathering. Some of the alt-Jans, like his Otacon-coded researcher-self, seem agreeable enough. Others will need more delicate management, like the ones who come from a timeline where they're still married to his ex-wife and might demand to speak to her. That's still an improvement over Miner Jan, who's apparently inclined to cut off his own limbs as a sort of existential protest.

    "article_text": "Serving a malevolent dead god sounds like a reasonable retirement plan right now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. During today's Triple-i Initiative stream, developer Coldblood Inc. shared a first look at its upcoming horror life sim, Neverway. It's the debut game from a studio co-founded by Celeste pixel artist Pedro Medeiros, with a soundtrack from Hyper Light Drifter composer Disasterpeace. Neverway looks to combine a few of my favorite things: late night brooding, combating the Horrors, bonding with loveable weirdos, and farming life. Infer from that last bit what you will. But simply comparing it to Stardew Valley seems unfair, as its debut trailer includes far more snippets of creepy dungeon-diving than turnip planting. As Fiona, you'll start life over on an eerie farm as the \"immortal herald of a dead god,\" which is basically my dream, though Coldblood has taken to calling it \"a nightmarish life sim RPG.\" Shots of fishing, farming, crafting, and decorating in a dark fantasy setting were enough to speak to me, specifically, but the few looks at Neverway's cutscenes in its debut footage are what struck me. The trailer is a macabre parade of ghouls and distorted horrors terrorizing poor Fiona, but it's in Medeiros' distinct, detailed pixel style for something equally cute and unnerving. There's also a few quick looks at some of Neverway's romanceable cast, of which Coldblood says there are more than 10, and progressing those relationships as friends or lovers will unlock combat abilities. It's a little bright spot in the showcase for fans of Celeste who were eagerly awaiting Extremely Ok Games' next adventure, Earthblade, since its reveal in 2021. At the beginning of this year, the studio announced its painful decision tocancel Earthblade, citing creative difficulties and a frustrating development pace. The team split, with Medeiros leaving Extremely Ok Games to pursue work on Neverway. Studio director Maddy Thorson wrote in ablog postat the time, \"Pedro and the Neverway team aren't the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn't welcome in any EXOK community.\" As for Neverway, there's no release date yet, but you can stillwishlist Neverway on Steamtoday. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "\"I wanted everyone to know that I was a real Minecrafter.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of my favourite movie tales concerns Marathon Man, a 1976 thriller starring Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier. Known for his method approach, Hoffman stayed up for three days in preparation for a scene in which his character was sleep-deprived. When he found out about this approach, the urbane Olivier apparently said to the young Hoffman: \"My dear boy, why don't you just try acting?\" A Minecraft Moviedoes not feature Hoffman, but it turns out the film's all-star cast also took something of a method approach to bringing the game to life: a private server for the whole cast and crew, in which Jack Black decided he had to prove himself a \"real Minecrafter.\" Going by the experience with my kids, a real Minecrafter is someone who builds pits filled with zombies and then punches villagers in from above. But in Black's case it meant building something beautiful: a mansion atop a mountain, complete with basement art gallery. \"It was so much fun,\" A Minecraft Movie directorJared Hess told IGN. \"Jack [Black] was super-weirdly method with the game. He was in his trailer harvesting lapis lazuli and always building stuff. [He] was geeking out on the game and would come back with ideas. It was a constantly evolving thing where everybody was contributing in their own fun, unique way.\" \"I had an Xbox in my trailer and I did play because an actor prepares,\" grins Jack Black. \"So I got as many hours as I could on this Minecraft server, which had tons of props from all the different departments. \"The cast and crew on the server were building some insane structures and I wanted to stand out. I wanted everyone to know that I was a real Minecrafter, so I said I was going to find the biggest, highest mountain in this world and build a stairway to Steve and a mansion up on top of that hill. I had a basement in there with an art gallery and... I don't even know if it's still there!\" A Minecraft Movie producer Torfi Frans Ólafsson says that the server is still live. \"I kept it up and I extended it for a year,\" says Ólafsson. \"I popped up in there a couple days ago and I said, 'Wait, there's somebody online!' I went in, and there were these two security guards who worked the gate on set and and they're like, 'Hey, welcome!' I said, \"You guys are still in here?' and they said, 'Oh, yeah!'\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Sadly there's no screens of Jack Black's magnificent mansion, but then maybe it's best left to the imagination. A Minecraft Movie hasproven a hit anyway, and its winning translation of the game's aesthetic can be seen everywhere at the moment (and the director's alreadymaking noises about a sequel). The secret to starring in such a film is clear: my dear boy, why don't you try Minecrafting. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core is expected to launch into early access later this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The roguelite shooterDeep Rock Galactic: Rogue Coremade an appearance at today's Triple-I showcase with a new gameplay trailer and word that a closed alpha test on Steam is \"starting soon.\" Announced in 2023, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core is a co-op shooter for 1-4 players that takes place in highly destructible caves filled with all sorts of alien unpleasantness. Not too far off the original Deep Rock Galactic in that sense, then, but Rogue Core changes things up with a roguelite structure: Players start each mission with just a basic loadout and earn upgrades, equipment, and new abilities as they progress through each multi-stage run. Optional missions will bring greater rewards, and of course the deeper you go the tougher it gets. Developer Ghost Ship Games further clarified that Rogue Core is a roguelite, not a roguelike, \"to signify that there will be a meta gameplay with permanent progression between missions.\" Between stages, players can return to their ship to research and unlock permanent upgrades that can be carried over to subsequent dives. Rogue Core will also feature four all-new classes, with more planned for future updates, and they sound a little moreexotic, let's say, than Deep Rock Galactic's lineup of Driller, Gunner, Engineer, and so forth: The plan is to launch Rogue Core into early access by the end of 2025, but first, the closed alpha: If you're interested in giving it a shot, you can register for access on theSteampage. A date hasn't been set but the game's development roadmap slates the alpha test for Q2 of 2025, which puts it sometime before the end of June. But that roadmap is dated from October 2023, when the game was expected to be out in 2024, and also indicates that the final update for 2024 is still in the works—so hopefully it'll make that early summer timeline, but maybe don't start holding your breath just yet. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Adorable or terrifying: Researchers unveil tentacular marine exploration drone prototype guaranteed to set off your Subnautica flashbacks",
    "article_text": "Me? I want to give this soggy science experiment a great big hug. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've never been the strongest swimmer; despite weekly trips to the pool with school, I never did manage to graduate from the shallow end paddlers. While some of my peers took to the water like a duck, or swam like a fish, I thrashed around like an octopus whose stubborn limbs refused to co-ordinate. Truly, I put cephalopods to shame everywhere—if they can figure it out, with their semi-autonomous limbs, then why couldn't I with my big human brain? Well, some bigger brained humans than I have taken my younger self's question one step further by creating a 'soft' robot that can swim with its own noodly appendages. TheZodiAqis an underwater drone that does much more than simply tread water (viaHackaday). 12 soft-body, flagella-like limbs allow the ZodiAq drone to swim and crawl across the sea floor with an impressive amount of maneuverability. This tentacular method of locomotion also ensures minimal disruption to any deep sea inhabitants in the water-logged neighbourhood. When in Rome, and all that jazz. A ballast inside the drone shifts its centre of gravity to keep it submerged, while each of the 12 swim limbs are attached to an individual motor, the speed and direction of which are all controlled by an onboard Raspberry Pi. You cansee it in motion in this LinkedIn postfrom research team member Anup Teejo Mathew. Besides onboard sensors tracking temperature and humidity as a form of internal damage detection, an onboard camera, and an Inertial Measurement Unit acting as a motion sensor, ensure the drone doesn't bump into anything as it bobs along. Thefull research paperbreaks down just what makes the ZodiAq tick (namely Lithium Polymer batteries) and is well worth the deep dive. I've no doubt that for some this marine exploration drone is definitely giving some 'oh no, I've ventured too deep inSubnauticaand I really need to get out of here' vibes, but I for one am totally enamoured with this little robo. For one thing, the wee beastie is unlikely to chase you down as it can only cover \"a distance of two body lengths every 15 seconds,\" even at top speed. You could say you're more likely to catch this bacteria-inspired bot, than this drone is to catch up to you. Sniff-worthy puns aside, the prototype deep sea drone isn't designed to use all 12 limbs to swim at once. In part, this is due to baked-in redundancy; basically, if a motor fails in one or even more limbs, the drone still has enough to slowly make its way home. For another thing, multiple limbs working together rather than all waggling at the same time allows the drone a greater range of somewhat sophisticated movement. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As robotics go, The ZodiAq is certainly one of the more practical uses I've seen recently. Between thissinewy nightmare fueland this generous would-be domestic robotgiving Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang a flash leather jacket, let's just say I've not been all that impressed by big tech's efforts as of late. Still, the ZodiAq team aren't the only ones taking inspiration from what already exists in the natural world, withMIT researchers creating fleshy meat robotstoo. Anyway, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a closer look at the ZodiAq's research paper and try to figure out on just which face of the dodecagonal drone they mounted that camera.

    "article_text": "No submarine this time: scavenge resources and battle abominations as you upgrade your locomotive in Fakefish's next game, Frostrail. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the Triple-I Initiative today, Barotrauma developer Fakefish revealed its next co-op survival game. It's swapped out its infamous submarine for another metal beast: a train, and instead of a 2D survival game this time it's an FPS. In Frostrail, players will \"endure a desolate post-apocalyptic world with arctic temperatures, unspeakable horrors, and one life-sustaining locomotive powered by the impressive Eden Engine,\" the developer says. Take a look: In the trailer above, you can see players riding a steam-powered locomotive through a frosty world and rushing off to scavenge resources from ruined little towns. There's a ticking clock: the temperature is brutally cold and players won't last long without the warmth of their train. There are also fast-moving ghouls called Revenants players will have to fend off before escaping on their train to reach the next stop along the rails. I spoke with Fakefish founder and CEO Aku Jauhiainen about Frostrail last week, who told me as players travel to new areas and scavenge for loot and supplies, they'll be able to build more onto their train, from crafting benches to refineries. This will allow them to generate materials like metal, cloth, and even plastic, resources that can be used to craft weapons and improve the train, including the engine. Upgrading the Eden Engine means the train will move faster and be able to pull more weight. \"It's a combination of getting more speed to the train, and there's a possibility to get more carriages to the train,\" Jauhiainen said. More carriages means players will have more room to build, but will also need a more powerful engine to move quickly with all that additional weight. \"The main loop is that when you are traveling between these locations, you usually want to refine and craft and prepare yourself for the next location,\" Jauhiainen said. \"Then there can be this branching railroad, so sometimes you need to jump out, switch the track, and go to another section of the level.\" Other hazards players might encounter are obstacles on the track that need to be destroyed so the train can continue. And then there's… well, whatever that massive monster is at the end of the trailer. To paraphrase Chief Brody: you're gonna need a bigger train. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For Barotrauma fans who are wondering (as I was) if there's a Traitors mode in Frostrail, where one player can actively work to sabotage the others, it doesn't sound like it's officially part of the plan. \"I think we are more focusing on the cooperative gameplay with Frostrail,\" Jauhiainen said, though he added that there's plenty of room for screwups where someone winds up endangering everyone else by, for example, using all the fuel or jumping off the train and getting left behind while the train steams away. \"But mostly we are focusing and aiming to have a good cooperative experience.\" Don't pull on your conductor's hat just yet: Frostrail isn't coming to Steam until 2026. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "The 5 most historically inaccurate moments in the Assassin's Creed series",
    "article_text": "From Pope fights to evil IT managers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the run up to the release ofAssassin's Creed Shadows, a lot of people apparently became very concerned about the series' historical accuracy. It was a bit perplexing, because as anyone who's actually played an Assassin's Creed knows, their historical accuracy usually hovers around the same level as an episode of Doctor Who. A sheen of real-world authenticity goes a long way, especially in the series' detailed open worlds, butUbisoft's always treated the history books as a set of suggestions rather than a straightjacket—and many of Assassin's Creed's most memorable and exciting setpieces have been born out a bit of enthusiastic revisionism. That makes perfect sense for a cinematic, blockbuster action game—it's there primarily to thrill, not to educate, after all. But that doesn't mean we can't have a bit of fun raking up some of its most absurd deviations from reality. So let's take a look back at some of the series' most historically inaccurate moments—and maybe learn a little about the real events that inspired them while we're at it. Maybe. It goes without saying but: expect spoilers ahead, for many of the games in the series. You've been warned! The game:Assassin's Creed 2 The event:In 1499, Ezio Auditore infiltrates the Vatican and has a battle with a maniacal and magically empowered Pope Alexander VI, which culminates in a knock-down fistfight for the fate of the world. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The reality:Contrary to what you might think, the Pope in this era did not get up to a lot of bare-knuckle boxing, making this event pretty improbable even before you get to the alien technology. But there are some grains of truth here. For one, Pope Alexander VI (formerly Rodrigo Borgia) was certainly a real dog of a bloke. He reached his office primarily via old-fashioned nepotism, fathered several children with multiple mistresses while in the supposedly celibate office, and helped to enable the Spanish slave trade in the New World, among other things. So his role as a brutish villain in Assassin's Creed 2 is earned, even if he was never truly one of the masterminds of an ancient conspiracy. The way the fight plays out—via non-lethal combat, with Ezio ultimately sparing Alexander—also respects the history to an extent. He didn't die until 1503, so while you may have wanted to put a hidden blade through his neck in that sequence, that wouldn't have fit with the facts. Authenticity rating:25% The game:Assassin's Creed Brotherhood The event:Over the course of the game, Ezio is charged with restoring Rome and shaking off Borgia rule by buying up pretty much every property in the city and charging rent for them. How that makes things better is a little murky, but the upshot is that between the years 1500 and 1507, one man ends up becoming the landlord of not only every shop and bank in the city, but also famous landmarks including the Pantheon and the Colosseum. He mostly spends the money on capes. The reality:While no one man ever owned as much of Rome as Ezio did, it is true that the rich have long loved gobbling up land, charging extortionate rates on it, and then spending the profits on frivolous nonsense (though probably rare for that to be crossbow upgrades and smoke bombs). There was also a significant shift towards what we would recognise as a system of landlords and tenants in this period, and away from more feudal systems of property ownership. Though the fact that Ezio has a genuinely altruistic mission in mind rather than just loving money blunts the historical accuracy a little. Rome's famous landmarks have certainly also required restoration efforts over the years too, and though they were probably never up for sale to the first guy to turn up in a hood with a pocket full of florins, they haven't always been treated with the reverence they enjoy today. Not too long after the period in which Brotherhood is set, Pope Sixtus V put forward a plan to turn the Colosseum into a giant wool factory that could employ Rome's prostitutes. Sadly he died before that foolproof plan could be enacted. Authenticity rating:32% The game:Assassin's Creed Odyssey The event:Over the course of her travels, Kassandra encounters: three cyclopses, a gorgon, a sphinx, and a minotaur (and kills all of them). They're not even hidden, really, and they're not explained away as hallucinations or anything like that. There just were actual monsters in Ancient Greece, I guess. Even the in-universe explanation for this one is weird: they were a bunch of inexplicable genetic experiments created by the Isu purely to freak out their human slaves. The reality:The mythology all these creatures are based on was real, of course, and Odyssey does go above and beyond in places. The names of the three Cyclopses, for example—Brontes, Steropes, and Arges—are taken from a nearly 3,000 year old poem that describes the creatures. But, of course, we have no evidence any of these monsters actually existed, and even if we did, they seem a bit out-of-time here. Odyssey is set in 431 - 422 BC, whereas these creatures were already the stuff of mythology hundreds of years before that. Many likely have their origins thousands of years previous, before Greece itself even existed. So it's a bit like making a game set in Edwardian London and having dragons and giants wandering about—anachronistic even if you accept the fantasy. Authenticity rating:3% The game:Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag The event:The legendary pirate Bartholomew Roberts turns out to be one of many reincarnations of an Isu called Aita, granting him ancient knowledge and strange visions. Hundreds of years later, he returns as a new reincarnation called John Standish and gets a job as an IT manager so that he can enact a sinister plan to upload his god-wife into the brain of a QA tester… or something. The reality:Well… they at least gave Roberts a really thick Welsh accent, authentic to his real-world origins, and I appreciate that it's so strong it seems to still be fighting to get out through John's American accent. In fact, mystic nonsense and modern day conspiracy aside, there is a lot of authentic Roberts detail in the game. He really did write his own pirate code, for example, and he did capture hundreds of ships over the course of his career on the seas. He probably was about as much of a lunatic as he is in the game too—he was apparently so confidently outspoken that he went from captured by pirates to captain of the crew within just six weeks. It is also true that people who work in IT are usually hiding something from you and should always be viewed with suspicion. Authenticity rating:9% The game:Assassin's Creed Origins The event:Proto-Assassin Bayek discovers a tomb in the desert where the number 15 is mysteriously marked on the wall. There he frees the main villain of Final Fantasy XV, who then has a load of swords thrown at him by a giant flying monster and teleports away into space. Bayek is rewarded with an ornate shield, a sword that looks like it has a car engine attached to it, and a frankly disturbing camel/Chocobo hybrid beast that he can ride through the rest of the game. Baffling. Sure, maybe picking on a crossover quest is mean, but in my defence that shit is canon, and the game doesn't even warn you what's going on. It just drops Bahamut on you and expects you to figure it out. The reality:Well, we can't prove thisdidn'thappen, given only Bayek was witness to it. But it does seem… let's say,relativelyunlikely. There are, however, many popular theories that aliens were involved in the creation of the Pyramids, explaining their seemingly impossible construction. Could those aliens have actually been characters from Final Fantasy XV, somehow real in another reality? No, they couldn't, don't be stupid. And there were no aliens, humans have just always been good at building things. Stop watching the History Channel. I'm docking this one extra points because that Chocobo camel doesn't even seem biologically possible. It looks like it resents its own creation and it makes me sad to ride it.

    "title": "Asus TUF Gaming RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Asus TUF is an impressive graphics card, and delivers excellent 1440p performance alongside some Frame Generation assisted-4K chops. It's no more impressive than any other RTX 5070 Ti in most respects, though, and while it runs a touch cooler and feels perhaps a little better made than the rest of the pack, it's still an overly-expensive proposition right now. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. It's fair to say that we've been impressed by theRTX 5070Ti, at least on paper. Nvidia'sRTX 50-series lineuphas had its ups and downs, but the upper mid-range (bordering on high-end) card looks to hit the sweet spot between impressive performance, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation goodies, and price. Again, on paper. The RTX 5070 Ti was announced at a $750 MSRP, but there's no reference card, meaning that a combination of reasonable demand, relatively low supply, and dubious AIB pricing strategies has resulted in a plethora of GPU options listed at well above that slightly-teeth-clenching figure. TheAsusTUF Gaming RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition is no exception—it's currently listed at$1,000/£970on the Asus website. So, before we even get started, we have a pricing problem. TheRTX 5080 FEhas an MSRP of $999, and it's a significantly beefier card. Again, though, you simply can't get hold of one for anywhere near that kind of cash right now. Reviewing a graphics card in this kind of market becomes an exercise in hypotheticals as soon as you start factoring price and availability into the equation. It's tough out there, folks. Still, what you get for your money is the same GB203 Nvidia chip, the same 8960 CUDA cores, the same 16 GB GDDR7 as the other, similarly-ludicrously-priced RTX 5070 Ti cards on the market. The difference here lies in two things: The boost clocks, and the ancillary components added to the board. GPU:GB203CUDA cores:8960Boost clock:2610MHzMemory:16 GB GDDR7Memory speed:28 GbpsMemory bus:256-bitTGP:300 WDimensions:329 x 140 x 62.5 mmPrice:$1,000|£970 In the case of the former, the Asus GPU has a max rated boost clock of 2,610 MHz compared to the 2,452 MHz max speeds of the standard, non-overclocked RTX 5070 Ti—although, as you'll see when we get to the benchmarks, this particular card boosts way above that. And in the latter, it's been fitted with a host of what Asus describes as \"military-grade components\" including upgraded chokes, MOSFETs and capacitors, a phase-change thermal pad, dual-ball fan bearings for its tri-fan cooler, and even a protective PCB coating to resist excess moisture and dust. It seems Asus takes this whole \"TUF\" thing rather literally. Good. I like an overbuilt piece of hardware, and this card feels like it the moment you get it in your hands. It's a weighty, satisfying object to hold, feeling closer to a technologically-advanced cinderblock than a graphics accelerator. Still, you're not going to be holding it for long. If you're anything like me, you're going to be desperate to wedge it in your machine. And wedge, in my case, is the right choice of words. It's a three slot design with 329 x 140 x 62.5 mm dimensions, and in the case of my otherwise reasonably spacious Micro-ATX chassis, requires some Tetris-like trial and error to squeeze in. Measure, then measure again if you plan on picking up one of these. Anyway, enough hemming and hawing about price, component choices, and size. This is a factory overclocked version of a very speedy card, so let's see how it does when pushed to the limits in our benchmark rig. The first point of comparison is theMSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC, a card that also comes with a factory overclock—according to MSI, a whole 45 MHz over the standard spec in Performance mode. However, over the course of three Metro Exodus Enhanced runs at 4K Ultra settings, it becomes clear that all of our RTX 5070 Ti samples are happy to range well above that, with the Asus TUF topping the chart with an average clock speed of 2,716 MHz. Still, it's not much of a clock speed gain compared to the other cards. Given the 24 MHz practical difference between the Asus and the MSI (and the 57 MHz difference between the Asus and theGigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC Ice SFF, also a factory overclocked GPU), you're probably expecting the gaming performance of these three cards to be very similar under real-world conditions. And, well, you'd be right. At 4K, the Asus is within two to three fps of the MSI and Gigabyte cards in either direction in the average fps results. When it comes to minimums, however, there are some more significant differences to ponder over. The TUF GPU manages a seven fps lead over the MSI inBlack Myth Wukong, although it's two fps off the pace when compared to the Gigabyte. In Cyberpunk at Ultra RT settings, it's neck and neck with the other RTX 5070 Ti models, although a single fps behind the MSI.It's a similar story at 1440p. Really, given that gaming benchmarks can be somewhat twitchy (although we perform multiple runs of each and record our own results with Nvidia'sFrameview toolto get the most accurate numbers), it's remarkable how closely each of these cards perform to each other. Minimum fps figures are always going to show the odd quirk, but averages remain within a six fps range throughout our test suite. But hey, there's always upscaling and Frame Generation to consider. All of our RTX 5070 Ti samples are on even footing here, and that translates directly to the similarity of results between the three. The major anomaly comes in the form of theRX 9070 XTwith FSR enabled in F1 24 and The Talos Principle 2 at Ultra settings, which somehow manages to give even theRTX 5080a sound thrashing in the averages. That's a GPU with a $599 MSRP, and it's impressive to see just how closely it matches (and sometimes outright beats) each of our RTX 5070 Ti samples. Are my price comparison woes over? Nope. We haven't seen one at that price for a while, and a quick scan of the listings reveals a smattering of cards for $1,000+. I told you this was going to be tough, didn't I? But what about power and thermals? All of those high spec capacitors, MOSFETs and more must move the needle somewhat, right? Especially given the size of that massive tri-fan cooler. Sort of. The Asus card manages a lower average power figure than the MSI— but slightly higher than the Gigabyte, by a whole three watts. It's significantly less power-hungry than the RTX 5080 FE, of course, but then it's significantly slower in the gaming benchmarks, too, like all of our RTX 5070 Ti cards. Who would have thought a 10752 CUDA core card would use significantly more power and deliver significantly more performance than the card below it in the stack? Me, for one, and I would imagine your good self, too. Thermal benches tell a slightly happier story for the beefy Asus. Thanks to that thermal pad and a sizable cooler, it runs four degrees cooler than the MSI on average, and manages a six degree cooler peak temperature result. It's the RX 9070 XT that wins the day once more, however, as the Asus Prime model stays remarkably chilled with a 59 °C peak and a 56 °C average. And then there's productivity, where… are you starting to spot a theme here? Still, one thing to note is that the overbuilt Asus is actually a little off the pace on average across our productivity tests compared to its RTX 5070 Ti brethren. It's by a relatively insignificant amount, though, and I'd say the results are still well within margins of error. PC Gamer test rigCPU:AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D|Motherboard:Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master |RAM:G.Skill 32 GB DDR5-6000 CAS 30 |Cooler:Corsair H170i Elite Capellix |SSD:2 TB Crucial T700 |PSU:Seasonic Prime TX 1600W |Case:DimasTech Mini V2 The last thing to talk about is overclocking. Given that the Asus TUF has good thermal performance and some high-spec ancillary components, on paper it looks like it might stand a better chance of hitting higher overclocked speeds than its competitors. My benevolent hardware overlord Dave James managed to achieve a stable +450 MHz chip boost in tandem with a +1000 MHz memory overclock on the MSI card, and I'm happy to report that the Asus manages the same. In fact, it's utterly rock solid at this particular magic combination. I've been running the Asus in my personal rig for the past several weeks at these speeds, and it's not flinched once. Push that chip to +475 MHz, though, and like the MSI, it begins to twitch and crash. A +450 MHz boost is where it likes to sit, meaning you're not really gaining any meaningful performance over our other overclocked RTX 5070 Ti cards, either. It'll manage the same equivalent boost as the others, but nothing tangibly more in terms of real-world gains that could edge it ahead of the pack. One thing I can say from personal experience is that it's much more stable than theColorful RTX 5070 Ti Vulcan OCwith its one-click OC VBIOS enabled. Small wins, and all that. Here's the thing: I like the Asus TUF Gaming RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition, silly name and all. I'm a fan of overbuilt hardware, and it's certainly that. It's also chilled out under load, imperceptible over my CPU cooler when it comes to noise, and is more than capable of delivering a tasty slice of 1440p and 4K performance that makes gaming on it a genuine pleasure. It's also a relatively stable overclocker, and a card that engenders confidence to do so. I'm not sure whether \"military-grade\" components really do last all that much longer when a card is pushed to its limits, but there's a sense that Asus has really thought about making this card live up to its TUF moniker, and that's pleasing to see. It may well end up being a little more resilient than other cards in terms of wear and tear, at least. ✅ You don't want to worry about thermals:The Asus TUF Gaming card runs cool and serene, even when pushed hard.✅ You want a stable overclocker:The Asus is rock solid at the same sort of clock speeds that can trouble lesser-built GPUs. ❌ You don't want to overpay:All RTX 5070 Ti's are too expensive right now, and this one is no exception.❌ You've not got a lot of case room to spare:I've seen bigger, but not by much. That substantial cooler really is a squeeze to fit into many cases. Is it worth paying $250 more than MSRP for that intangible (and difficult to test) sense, though? No. But then I see RTX 5070 Ti variants listed for $1,000+ on the daily. Even the Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti is now well above that price, and that's a card that, at $900, our Jacob already thought was far too expensive. He's right, naturally, but it's a poor state of affairs out there for you, the potential buyer. So really the advice is, if you absolutelymusthave an RTX 5070 Ti right now, the Asus is potentially the one to go for—as long as you can't find an equivalent GPU for cheaper. It only really makes sense while both the RTX 5070 Ti and RX 9070 XT cards are hovering around the $1,000 mark, and for how much longer that remains true is anyone's guess. With my own personal funds? I'd wait instead. The GPU market is about as volatile as it's ever been right now, not to mention the continuing economic uncertainty that surrounds it, and who knows how that might change in future. We're expecting more stock at some point, which may push prices down to more palatable levels, but even that seems uncertain. It's just a terrible time to recommend almost any new GPU given current pricing, and I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't point that out. Ultimately, it comes down to this: The Asus TUF Gaming RTX 5070 Ti OC Edition is a very good graphics card in the same way a titanium-framed fountain pen is a very good writing device. It's undeniably true, but the real question is, would you pay for any fountain pen, overbuilt or not, at vastly over-inflated prices? Me, right now, with my own cash? I think not. The Asus TUF is an impressive graphics card, and delivers excellent 1440p performance alongside some Frame Generation assisted-4K chops. It's no more impressive than any other RTX 5070 Ti in most respects, though, and while it runs a touch cooler and feels perhaps a little better made than the rest of the pack, it's still an overly-expensive proposition right now.

After spending a decade making sure everyone I encountered tried Endless Legend, my favourite 4X game, I might finally be able to shake things up. If things pan out, I'll be updating my proselytising by instead trying to get folks to play the sequel. That's because developer Amplitude has announced Endless Legend 2's early access launch window, and it's this summer. I'd much prefer an actual date, granted, but it's good enough to know that it's coming soon. To get you ready, Amplitude's been revealing the first factions that you'll get to play around with, including theKin of Sheredyn, whose ancestors you may have played as in the excellent Endless Space 2, and more recently theAspects, a bunch of coral-loving cyborgs. Conveniently, we've also just published our firstEndless Legend 2 hands-on, and it sounds very much like it's heading in the right direction. \"The sea-level concept of Endless Legend 2's new world already feels like a massive improvement over the drab winter one of its predecessor,\" Rob writes, \"while a focus on narrative victories and the seedling of a relationship system show signs that Amplitude is trying to do away with convention and find more ways to fit storytelling into the 4X framework.\" The \"sea-level concept\" Rob's referring to is Endless Legend 2's new hook—called tidefall—where the map changes over time, with the oceans retreating to reveal new land to explore and exploit. This will hopefully maintain the brilliant energy of the early game, where everyone's rushing to expand into new territory and uncover secrets, throughout a campaign. There's a lot to look forward to, then, and while you wait, you can check out the handsome new trailer above, which shows off a tantalising swathe of the game.

    "title": "Crimson Desert is an unrestrained feast of violence, with a toolkit of moves that's like a fusion of every action RPG protagonist of the past decade rolled into one",
    "article_text": "I've never wanted to lab an action RPG before. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I had the joy of playingCrimson Desert, the first proper singleplayer effort by Black Desert Online developer Pearl Abyss, again this week—and while I had some sense of how the game works, given I played itduring Gamescom last year, getting my hands on it in an air-conditioned London building rather than a stuffy, loud hall in Copenhagen allowed me to stare deeper into the action RPG tesseract, and I've come away with my head spinning. The elevator pitch for Crimson Desertsoundsa bit dry: You play as Kliff, a gruff fantasy mercenary in an archetypical fantasy setting, and leader of the Greymane Free Company. A bunch of vikings rock up and, best I can tell, kill most of them. You get stabbed butnotkilled, and eventually set out on a quest to deliver some payback in a wide open world, yada yada. In terms of how Kliff plays, though? He's basically every action RPG protagonist of the past decade smushed into one guy. This boy can fit so many combat systems in his grim, slightly northern-accented body. I've only had two hours total with Crimson Desert, and here's a list of the things IthinkKliff can do on top of the usual RPG meat and potatoes of having a dodge roll, a light attack, a heavy attack, and a block: (Deep breaths. We're halfway there). Now, granted, the 12-minute tutorial video I watchedbeforeI hopped in was, by Pearl Abyss's own admission, not exactly the best way to go about learning all of this stuff. Presumably, the game will slowly trickle these power-ups to you, and tell you where to use them. However, in trailers and demonstrative gameplay, I've seen combos I couldn't even suss out—and I want to point out that the massive list I just shared are the basic actions you can do. The building blocks of your ultraviolence. I couldn't tell you how many permutations of war you can wreak upon your enemy when you start learning how to string themtogether. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I fought four bosses during my preview: The Staglord and the Queen Stoneback—who I'm familiar with from Gamescom—as well as two new bosses, The Reed Devil and Hexie Marie. All of these big bads felt very different to brawl with, requiring different tools in your Swiss Army knife. The Staglord could be stopped dead with my big powerful magic punch, the Reed Devil got stomped with my sidestep slash, and Hexie Marie's legion of pot-men were allergic to explosive arrows. The best thing about Crimson Desert by far—which I'm glad to see hasn't been diminished since my Gamescom experience—is how utterly frenetic the combat is. Hexie Marie, in particular, seemed predisposed to summon two dozen pottery men and hurl them at me at any given time. The Staglord, also, hasn't become any less proficient at sending me rag-dolling into a pillar with gusto. I can't make promises of the open world, or the equipment system, or even the story, as I've seen precious little of all three, though I am promised high double-digit, maybe even triple digit gameplay hours, with all the expected activities that conjures. But the combat, bare minimum, is joyfully unrestrained. Kliff is an everything bagel with some absurd combo potential on par with any fighting game character.\" Kliff is an everything bagel with some absurd combo potential on par with any fighting game character—and I have a mighty itch tolab outthose combos on my own time, something an action RPG rarely ever inspires in me. The cutscenes, meanwhile, are fully invested in the same nonsense. It's like a high-fantasy wuxia martial arts movie wearing a Witcher 3/Game of Thrones skinsuit, and you know what? It's great. Any time the cinematic bars settled in, and Kliff started spinning around like Bruce Lee with a sword and shield, my inner 14 year old squealed with glee. It lies in the exact intersection between dumb and cool to send every neuron I have firing. I don't know if Crimson Desert will even be a cohesive game—it's possible that Pearl Abyss is taking on too many systems, and what we'll end up with is a confusing mess. But if you like action RPG combat, deep combo systems, and punting people into bonfires, you're going to havesomekind of fun here.Crimson Desertis poised to release in late 2025. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "Blue Prince foundation elevator: how to use it",
    "article_text": "There's an elevator in Blue Prince's foundation room: here are some hints and a full solution on how to get inside it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's not long into Blue Prince when you first find \"The Foundation\"—a rare draftable room that has the unique attribute of always appearing in the same place on the map. This permanent room has some noteworthy features, like dirt floors with several diggable spots and three doors in the east, west, and south walls. Most importantly, The foundation has a small one-person elevator situated along the north wall of the room over an open elevator shaft. But theBlue Prince foundation elevatoris out of reach, fixed high on a wall above you, too high to climb into. If you want to use the elevator, you'll have to lower it to ground level first so you can get in. To avoid outright spoiling this puzzle for you—I really recommend you try solving it on your own, especially since there's another room in the mansion that specifically explains how the elevator works—I'm going to give you a few hints first before showing the solution. Hint 1 There's a mechanism that lowers the elevator, but it isn't inside the foundation itself. You have to leave the foundation room to find the solution. Hint 2 The mechanism (it's a big crank you turn) to lower the elevator will appear in another room, but not onespecificroom. There are a number of rooms that will let you turn the elevator crank, depending on the attributes of those rooms and where you draft them on the map. Hint 3 Thinking about how other rooms you've drafted fit together may help. What happens when you draft a room with a doorway, but it's placed alongside a room without a doorway on the adjoining wall? What does that doorway look like, and what does it suggest? Hint 4 You will need to draft a room directly north of the foundation room so they share a wall. The room you draft will need a certain attribute in its south wall. Hint 5 There's another room you can draft, the master bedroom, which will have complete instructions on how to access the foundation elevator. You can find those instructions written on a piece of paper on a desk. To access The foundation elevator,draft a room directly to the northof The foundation on the map grid. Make sure the room you drafthas a doorway in its south wall. In other words, you want to build a room that will give you access to the rear side of the wall where the elevator is located. In the example below, I drafted the conference room because it has a doorway in the south wall. The open doorway in the south wall of the room you draft will reveal the elevator mechanism and a large crank. If the room you draft doesn't have a doorway in the south wall, you won't be able to reach the crank. Turn the crank and it will lower the elevator in the foundation to ground-level. Then head back to The foundation, get into the elevator, and throw the switch inside. If you want to see the solution as the game presents it to you, here is the note and diagram you can find in the mansion's master bedroom. Note that the diagram is flipped and appears to be showing the controls to the south, but you can see by the doorway configuration that it's actually north. Tricky! Once the elevator is lowered to ground level in the foundation, it'll remain that way permanently in future runs, so you won't need to use that crank again.

    "article_text": "Gosh, they sure are cute. There's definitely no dark side to this. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Black Mirror Season 7 has begun streaming on Netflix, and one of its episodes, \"Plaything,\" is about a sim game from the 1990s where players care for little critters in the wild and teach them to survive on their own. The fictional game is called Thronglets, and guess what? It's not so fictional after all. Netflix has releasedThrongletsfor Android and iOS and you can play it right now—if you have a Netflix account, that is. If you haven't watched Black Mirror Season 7 yet, the episode follows up on a character fromBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, the interactive movie Netflix released in 2018. The Plaything episode isn't interactive, but it features the same game developer from that story, Colin Ritman (Will Poulter), who invites a game journalist from PC Zone magazine to try out a demo of his new game. But Ritman claims Thronglets isn't a game at all. It looks like a sim where you care for little critters—feed them, bathe them, give them toys to play with—but Ritman insists these critters are actually alive. They're created with code but they're still biological, \"living individuals\" rather than \"obscene puppets like Sonic the Hedgehog,\" Ritman claims. I've played Thronglets a bit and it looks and works just like it does in the episode. You can feed the Thronglets apples, wash them with a cloth, give them beachballs to play with, and they'll eventually learn to care for themselves. And, if the conditions are right, they'll multiply. And multiply. And multiply. I won't say where the episode leads, and I don't know where the game itself goes, but it's pretty cute and probably not dark and ominous and twisted or anything like that. I think Thronglets may be based onCreatures, a sim game from 1996 which featured odd little animals called Norns that players could feed, play with, and care for, ultimately teaching to take care of themselves. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Creatures used machine learning and neural networks to allow the Norns to learn things, and the game was sound groundbreaking for its time that it influenced genuine AI research.

    "article_text": "The mysterious mansion offers up new puzzles around every corner, long after I thought it was done. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The first time I stepped inside the mysterious mansion of adventure puzzle game Blue Prince—and I'm talking about the first time I played a demo way back in March of 2024—I noticed something interesting about one of its rooms. I won't say what it was that I noticed—I'm going to be obnoxiously vague throughout this piece because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone—but it had to do with something I saw resting on a crowded shelf, a bit of decoration, clutter. I saw similar decorations in a few other rooms. \"I bet that's part of some puzzle,\" I thought. I didn't have time to do anything about it in the demo, but when I played a nearly full build ofBlue Princein August of last year, I noticed the same thing again. Even when I \"finished\" the game after 25 hours by reaching the elusive 46th room of the 45-room mansion, I didn't uncover that decoration's significance. I tested out one theory, but it didn't pan out and nothing was ever revealed. I played through it again from the beginning for myBlue Prince review(I gave it a score of 92%, by the way), and I've continued playing even past that. Just the other night, now a full 40 hours after I'd finished the review, it finally happened. I solved one particular puzzle for the first time, which led me to a place I'd never been before, and while investigating this area I finally figured out the significance of that decoration I noticed over a year ago during my very first demo. As Tears for Fears put it: \"And when you think it's all over, it's not over.\" In Blue Prince you draft room cards to build a 45-room mansion in hopes of somehow finding and entering the hidden 46th room. But while that's the goal of the game, it's not theendof the game, not by far. After finishing the game, it quickly becomes apparent there's plenty more to do in Blue Prince: new rooms to discover, new areas to unlock, new mysteries to explore—and in this case, at least oneoldmystery to take off the shelf and start working on again. That isn't the only old mystery I'm looking at with fresh eyes. There's a story in Blue Prince, sort of a backstory slowly gleaned from notes, diaries, and a few newspaper clippings. At first it felt like just some flavor to color in the edges of the world and explain a bit more about the history of the mansion and the family that has inhabited it, but the more I learn, the more I'm convinced there's another puzzle to solve here. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One of the characters mentioned in this story went missing, and based on how well the other mysteries of Blue Prince work, I think this might be something I can find the answers for. But I'm most excited to finally put to bed that puzzle I noticed in my earliest moments in the game last year. And I haven't cracked it yet, not completely. I now know the significance of the decoration I saw in that room the first time I played. I know what it means, why it's there, and I know how to solve the puzzle it represents, though it's still going to take some work to actually complete it. Best of all, even after all this time, I still have no idea exactly what solving this puzzle will reveal to me or reward me with. I'm perfectly happy to play another 15 hours to find out.

    "title": "Blue Prince dartboard puzzle: how it works and how to solve it",
    "article_text": "The billiards room in Blue Prince has a mathematical dartboard puzzle that gets a bit harder every time you complete it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As you explore the mysterious mansion inBlue Prince, you're going to find thedartboard puzzlepretty quickly and pretty often. Located in the billiards room, the dartboard contains a math puzzle that isn't easy to solve unless you've worked out the rules. You'll want to get good at the Blue Prince dartboard puzzle since it'll come up just about every time you play. The billiards room is one of the most common rooms to draft, andsolving the dartboard puzzle provides you with keys: usually normal keys to unlock doors, but sometimes special keys you'll only find once in a while. Note: this guide won't contain the solution for every dartboard puzzle, but it'll explain how it works and how to solve it, which really only requires basic math once you know what you're doing. Your first step to solving the puzzle is knowing what the four colors you'll see on the dartboard mean. The colors you see on the dartboard tell you what to do to the numbers they're adjacent to. Remember this, or write it down: Blue = AddYellow = SubtractPink = MultiplyPurple = Divide These colors and the numbers around the edges of the dartboard form a math puzzle. When you've solved the puzzle, click the number you think is the answer. That will take you to the next stage of the puzzle, and after you've correctly guessed a few stages, the dartboard will rise and you'll be able to collect your key or keys. If you guess incorrectly, you return back to the first stage to try again. Note: the dartboard puzzle will get a little bit harder each time you solve it, and there are some variations you'll run into the more times you see it. To know the order in which to perform the steps of the puzzle, you'll need to begin with the bullseye and work your way out from the center toward the edges. Here's an example of the order of operations: Closest to the bullseye is the colorblue(6), in the next ring,yellow(3), in the next ring,pink(5), then finally,purple(15). So in the example above,starting at zero, you'dadd, thensubtract, thenmultiply, thendivide. 0 + 6 = 66 - 3 = 33 x 5 = 1515 ÷ 15 = 1Solution: 1 That'salmosteverything you need to know. Just follow the order of operations from the center outwards, and do what the colors indicate. It can get tricky, and sometimes even involve negative numbers, so use a calculator if you need to. There are some variations that come into play the more you see this puzzle, and I've covered them below. You will sometimes see asquare in the bullseye. That means you square one of the numbers.But perform the color operation first,then square the result. Here's an example: Order:Blue, square, yellow, purpleAdd, square, subtract, divide 0 + 8 = 88 squared = 6464 - 20 = 4444 ÷ 11 = 4Solution: 4 You will sometimes see other colors in the bullseye with the square. That means wait to square the number until you reach that color in the order of operations. Example: Order: Blue, yellow, pink, square, purpleAdd, subtract, multiply, square, divide 0 + 20 = 2020 - 1 -13 = 66 x 1 = 16 squared = 3636 ÷ 12 = 3Solution: 3 If the square is tilted45 degrees inside the bullseye, like a diamond, that means you transpose the number's digits when you get to that color, after you've performed that color's operation. Example: Order: Blue, Pink, Yellow, TransposeAdd, multiply, subtract, transpose digits 0 + 10 = 1010 x 10 = 100100 - 9 = 91Transpose 91 = 19Solution: 19 Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "You know, cards that actually stay near MSRP. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's that time of the GPU season where we patiently await affordable graphics cards after the initial high-end launches (and yes, referring to a generation as a 'GPU season' is a thing, okay). And while there's no official word yet from Nvidia or AMD regarding new low-end cards, rumours and leaks abound, the latest being that we're going to get quite a dolloping of memory configuration options. As spotted by popular hardware leakerharukaze5719, the South Korean National Radio Research Agency (RRA) certification body has listed both16 GBand8 GBvariants of Gigabyte RX 9060 XT graphics cards (viaVideoCardz). These were apparently certified just under a week ago on April 4, 2025.

These are all 16 GB cards, although there are rumoured to be8 GB versions in the works, as well. A bunch of MSI RTX 5060 Ti listings havebeen spotted, and these too are all 16 GB cards. We'd seenlots of talk surrounding the RTX 5060 Ti's specspreviously, though, so what's really new here is seeming confirmation of both 8 GB and 16 GB variants of the RX 9060 XT in the wild. AMD told everyone back in February that more affordable RX 9060 graphics cards willarrive in the second quarter of 2025. Though no further details were given at the time (AMD seems to have a habit of keeping its cards close to its chest until right before launch). The hope, of course, is that the RX 9060 XT can bring something actually affordable to the GPU market which is currently in—and not to exaggerate—absolute shambles. A circa $300-$350 card to challenge theIntel Arc B580and some last-gen Nvidia GPUs would be ideal. And while people like to decry 8 GB of VRAM as not enough these days, if AMD can deliver an 8 GB competitor to the B580, it might—might—be able to do so on the cheap. Then we'd have all that RDNA 4 goodness, plus presumably more consistent drivers and gaming performance than the Intel card, all for a nice price. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is assuming that AMD prices the RX 9060 XT cards to undercut Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti, of course, as theRX 9070 XTundercut theRTX 5070 Ti. And it's assuming there's stock there to boot, which currently doesn't seem massively promising given only two RX 9060 XT cards have been spotted but a bunch of RTX 5060 Ti cards have. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. There's also a very large and smelly elephant in the room, this being that it's currently very difficult to find even AMD cards at close to MSRP, making the whole 'AMD cards are a better value proposition' argument somewhat of a moot point. Our Dave goes over all this in hisAMD RX 9070 XT vs Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti comparison, and the essential point is: there's little in it once the market becomes such a mess. Here's hoping some entry-level cards can straighten things out. We don't ask for much, really, do we? Just something moderately affordable and in stock.

    "title": "Multibillion-dollar MMO Dungeon Fighter Online is huge in Asia but 'not as well known in the West,' and The First Berserker: Khazan was meant to change that",
    "article_text": "At GDC 2025, lead actor Ben Starr and the CEO of Neople talk about elevating the \"niche\" online RPG franchise with a new origin story. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2D MMO Dungeon Fighter Online could quite possibly be the most lucrative game ever made that you've never played. Launched in Korea in 2005 as Dungeon & Fighter, it's since spawned sequels and spin-offs that have earned some$22 billionover the years. Despite being a massive hit in Asia, Dungeon Fighter Online never quite graduated past a cult following in the West. Last month'sFirst Berserker: Khazancould be a back door into helping the series finally get its hooks into more players. That's certainly what developer Neople is hoping for, at least. It's not obvious at first, but Khazan has deep ties to the DNF series and the developers aimed to leverage its long history and iconography for a different type of experience. During GDC 2025 we spoke with Neople CEO Myeongjin Yun and lead actor Ben Starr (whobroke out with his role as Clive in Final Fantasy 16) about the action game's goal of reinventing DNF for a new era. \"It's been close to 20 years since the original Dungeon Fighter Online released, and while a lot of people have enjoyed it, and it has seen great success all around Asia, it's still not as well known in the West,\" said Yun. \"There is a wide span of gamers and their taste when you look at gaming in general, and the original Dungeon Fighter is a 2D, side-scrolling game, and it might be a little bit niche. \"So for us, we thought about what genre we can reach more people with to really draw them into the Dungeon Fighter Universe. The experience of making a fighting game withDuelworked well, but for this time, we wanted to make an action game and stay very true to that core experience of Dungeon Fighter. We wanted to make Khazan to showcase the series' fast, intense action and highlight the storytelling and lore that the Dungeon Fighter IP has built in the last decades.\" The original DFO is bombastic with its combat; First Berserker instead emphasizes the lethal soulslike experience with the player's journey and their growth, through the eyes of Khazan as a broken warrior and eventually a powerful, malevolent warlord. It's very much an action RPG, but it leans into tension and more thoughtful action as opposed to the fast-paced and all-out combat of, say, Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry. According to the CEO of Neople, First Berserker is about getting players invested in a hardcore action-RPG experience that still makes them feel \"cool.\" \"We always want players to feel cool when fighting and that they are in control during a fight,\" said Yun. \"It can be a difficult and challenging game, but since you are playing as Khazan, we want you to feel cool and powerful, which will then give you motivation to try again and do better on new attempts. That aspect was important for us with this type of action game, as you'll then be able to start parrying and really relish that sensation of combat clicking for you. We didn't want players to go through too much pressure—it was more about balancing pressure, so we could make you feel you're growing on this journey.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. What makes First Berserker: Khazan compelling as a new game is that it acts as an origin story for the series and its title character, essentially DFO's parallel to Arthas/The Lich King from World of Warcraft. Without an expectation of knowing years of DFO lore, newcomers get an entry point to dive right in. For longtime players it offers a beginning story that provides some context for the large-scale conflicts in DFO. Set 700 years before the original game, First Berserker begins with the title character exiled into a frozen wilderness by his former allies with the Pell Los empire. After narrowly escaping imprisonment, he soon forms an uneasy alliance with a dark entity known as Blade Phantom, which pushes him to seek revenge against his conspirators and inadvertently leads the kingdom down a darker path—setting the stage for the era of Dungeon Fighter Online and his fate as an antagonist. First Berserker's story is dark, and this aspect of the character was something that actor Ben Starr found appealing. Starr is no stranger to playing brooding, and powerful protagonists like Final Fantasy 16's Clive or Warframe: 1999's Arthur. When he auditioned for First Berserker, he was taken in by how cool the character looked, but says that what really won him over was how much \"meat on the bones\" there was with the character's rags-to-berserker journey and how Neople allowed him to add his own spin on the character. \"For me as an actor, I love the challenge of exploring the things that aren't powerful, where a character is at their lowest, and this game has some great moments that reflect that,\" Starr said. \"This [game] is a profound power fantasy, and you build up this character and get new cool weapons, but it's not just an action game. This has a lot of heart to it, and this is about a world where people are suffering, and what Khazan can do to help, as well as battling his own literal inner demon. -The First Berserker: Khazan tips-How to use Soulstones in The First Berserker: Khazan-How to unlock the blacksmith in The First Berserker: Khazan-How to claim The First Berserker: Khazan pre-order bonus and deluxe edition DLC \"What really drew me to this role was just how much there was to play with, and I felt like [the developers] were all very open to allowing [the cast] to play in that way with this world.\" Starr also praised actor Anthony Howell who played the boss Blade Phantom—as well asElden Ringboss Morgott—for delivering \"a brilliant performance\" and being \"a perfect foil for Khazan.\" In addition to the Dungeon & Fighter franchises' turn towards a soulslike with First Berserker, the developers also have an open-world RPG known as ARAD: Dungeon & Fighter, which was revealed in 2024. So far, the developers seem to be keeping their options open for new experiences for the franchise. \"Our entire team is made up of people who loved the original Dungeon Fighter and even grew up with it over the years, and we really want to share those stories with more people, and that's why we started with Khazan,\" said Yun. \"We felt his experience as a fighter and warrior and how that can fit into a hardcore action RPG would translate well to new audiences. And there are so many other characters with depth, leaving more possibilities in the future. \"It could be more character-focused experiences, it could be online, it could be a movie, it could be more manhwas, or an anime series, a lot of different things, but stay tuned; we have a lot in store.\" Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.

    "title": "After years of historical 4X games, Endless Legend 2 is a much-needed flight of fantasy for the genre",
    "article_text": "My hands-on reveals a return to Amplitude doing what it does best. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Coral, coral, coral, as far as my mechanical eyes can see. I didn't know quite what to expect when building camps to claim territories and plonking down coral spreaders in my role as leader of a faction of part-mech, part-tendrilly oddities, but it certainly wasn't anything so drastic as half the world becoming carpeted in purple sprouting flora (or is it fauna?) in a matter of hours. As much as I'm in support of regrowing the reefs and so on, I can't help but feel that here on Endless Legend 2's world of Saiadha I'm propagating some kind of fuschia-flavoured ecological disaster. But from the perspective of the Aspects faction, this is a (ahem) core-al mechanic; it improves tile yields, heals my armies, and acts as a super-highway by letting units move faster across the map. The coral weaves towards water bodies where it spreads faster, and towards villages made up of wonderfully weird minor factions that might be eel-beings, dudes who fly around on giant owls, or vicious dark unicorns blustering for a fight. The coral automatically pacifies these factions, bringing you a step closer towards assimilating them into your empire. It's even a tool in diplomacy (a speciality of the Aspects), where you can offer the benefits of coral to friendly factions who choose to embrace it. True to the Endless series' philosophy of asymmetry, the great thing about all the above is that it's entirely unique to that one faction, and that each of the game's six factions—some new, some returning—will offer totally different ways to play. In the preview build, I also had a run as the Kin of Sheredyn: militaristic zealots (think Sardaukar from Dune) who count fervour-fuelled iron giants among their ranks and build up 'zeal' when you improve cities' fortifications, which can then be used to issue commandments that range from creating divine populations in your cities to smiting enemy armies on the campaign map. The Kin could well be the most vanilla of Endless Legend 2's six base-game factions, though that's not saying much in a series that lets you lead factions of corpse-eating plague insects, creepy faceless cultists, and fungus-spreading mushroom folk. Of course, all this talk of new factions and their wild mechanics is more for series' fans, so let's rewind. At its core, Endless Legend (and now 2) is a 4X turn-based strategy game where you build cities, research technologies, raise armies, and lock horns with other factions racing towards one of the multiple victory conditions for the game. In the case of Endless Legend 2, these victory conditions are your classic score and domination victories (yes, boring), but there are also seven as yet unrevealed 'narrative' victory types. The Endless series is a prime example of how great writing and storytelling can be integrated into the 4X format. This is a welcome change in direction from its predecessor, which had one 'Quest' (or narrative) victory amidst the usual make-the-numbers-go-up Economic, Diplomatic, Scientific yada-yada victories that have been the bedrock of 4X games for decades. The Endless series is a prime example of how great writing and storytelling can be integrated into the 4X format, so it's apt that its victory conditions should integrate with the series' strengths rather than fall back on tired genre habits. Granted, we don't know how these will look yet, but the foundation is in place. Speaking of foundations, Endless Legend 2 adds a few new twists to the original's excellent city-building (which did the whole 'multiple-tile cities' thing well before Civs 6 and 7). The sequel keeps much the same approach of letting you build sprawling cities across multiple tiles, but now you need to first build, yes, foundations in tiles adjacent to your existing city ones. Then you build your districts on top of those, and district-specific improvements (such as observatories to improve laboratories, or Legionnaires Workshops to turn defensive Strongholds into mini-factories) within those. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. An interesting new hook is that you first need to build a camp in a region to claim it. After that, you can expand the camp into a city using Influence,oryou can spend less and attach it to an existing city instead. This then turns the camp into a ministry, which acts as a kind of secondary city center for the existing city, letting you build new districts around it and funnel a whole new region's resources towards the existing city. In my time with the demo, I had two cities spread across three regions each where I'd previously have needed six cities, which is a neat way of keeping down the urban micromanagement while still giving you that satisfying sense of expanding your empire (and giving you the option to play tall by building out something akin to super-cities or Japan-style prefectures). Endless Legend 2 is set on the world of Saiadha, a lush planet strewn, much like the original game's world of Auriga, with resources, ruins, and other remnants of the galaxy-spanning empire known as the Endless. And like Auriga, the world subjects you to extreme natural cycles that you'll have to adapt to. Where Auriga was a dying planet steadily falling into an everlasting winter (resulting in rather tedious seasonal penalties that slowed the game down to a slog), Saiadha is shaped by an extreme planet-wide tidal cycle known as Tidefall. First the monsoons hit, causing minor factions to get more aggressive and unit visibility to decrease, but the real magic happens when the waters recede to reveal new lands, with more and more land getting revealed with each Tidefall cycle, keeping exploration at the forefront until much later in the game. During my first Tidefall, the land within my territories expanded to reveal a precious deposit of Glassteel, as well as several previously submerged fortresses. Led by my hero archer, levelled up from skirmishes with demonic unicorns and kitted out with upgraded gear, I marched my armies there to take on the new threat. Like in the original game, battles take place on a dedicated battle screen (or you can choose to auto-resolve). There's a decent level of depth here, with high ground, special tiles, deployable special abilities, adjacency bonuses and plenty of possible upgrades for your units. There are loads of great touches here that remind me why I'm a fan of Amplitude's work. The problem at this early stage is that the AI's just not up to these battles. Fortress encounters are ostensibly tougher than your regular skirmish, yet I tore through each one like a Spartan legion dispersing a shambolic peasant uprising. Yes, higher difficulty settings will load the numbers in the enemy's favour, but that won't make battles fun while the AI remains tactically inept; of course, Amplitude has plenty of time to patch this up, and I hope they do. Beyond that, there are loads of great touches here that remind me why I'm a fan of Amplitude's work, some of which carry over from the original game. There's the resource marketplace, for instance, with a proper supply-demand economy where individual resource prices go up and down depending on activity. I also love Endless Legend's approach to cultural integration, where through bribery or diplomacy you bring disparate tribes under your wing and see that reflected in your social makeup. So I may be leading the Kin of Sheredyn, but on my empire's council I have Liara from a faction of courier centaur-elves known as the Consortium, while mighty owl-riders from Hoy and Ladhran have basically become the Royal Air Force of my military. Of the new stuff in Endless Legend 2, the personal relationships system looks promising, letting you nominate a friend and companion (lover, essentially) for your hero. Give them a companion, and suddenly two 'Havens' (see: love shacks) pop up randomly in your empire, which grant bonus yields. Your heroes will also make enemies over time, and even a 'nemesis', who will yield bonus rewards if beaten in battle. It's great to see Amplitude let loose again after their forays into history-spanning Civilization territory with Humankind None of this feels very fleshed out yet, but that's what Early Access is for; I'd love to see this stuff be affected by narrative events and choices or by fighting together in battle, with relationships between characters changing dynamically over time rather than you just nominating who's shacking up with who. Above all, it's great to see Amplitude let loose again after their forays into history-spanning Civilization territory withHumankind(which was by no means a bad game, but whose real-world trappings inevitably restricted the studio's freedom to go creatively wild with world-building and storytelling). The sea-level concept of Endless Legend 2's new world already feels like a massive improvement over the drab winter one of its predecessor, while a focus on narrative victories and the seedling of a relationship system show signs that Amplitude is trying to do away with convention and find more ways to fit storytelling into the 4X framework. At a time when developers in this venerable genre have become a bit bogged down in the whole etch-a-sketch human history-spanning theme (shout out to Solium Infernum for bucking the trend), Amplitude's picked a great time to sweep us off once more to its singular sci-fantasy world, and from what I've played so far, it's going the right way about it.

That's not the wildest part; the seller known as Storm_City_Retro initially put the allegedSteam Deckprototype up with an asking price of either nearly $3,000 or best offer. Wilder still, the prototype apparently did sell—for $2,000. While the seller didn't detail in the listing just how they got their hands on this bit of kit, they claimed it is a legitimate prototype, though their own testing of the device revealed there's no OS installed. Steam Deck HQ notes that, even with the eBay prototype's missing right thumbstick, it does look almost identical to a confirmed prototypeValve shared on page 12 of this digital booklet. While I can see both handhelds have round touch pads and fetching blue button accents, it's worth noting the authenticity of the alleged prototype has not yet been fully verified. Complicating matters further, with the alleged prototype having apparently been snapped up, the original listing is now hard to track down via the eBay website itself. However,Kotaku notesyou can still dig it up viasites that can peek into eBay's API, confirming that, yes, someone somewhere really did put down 2,000 smackers for it on April 8. The Reddit post shares images from the original listing when it was still active, showing the underside of the handheld prototype. A sticker on the back purports that the prototype is an 'Engineering Sample' numbered 34. Funnily enough, that same sticker also states the unit is 'not for resale.' Well, it's too late now! This is far from the first time we've seen fabled tech prototypes turn up in odd places. For instance, the heavily rumoured but never-releasedGeForce RTX 4090 Tiwas apparentlydug out of a binlast year before YouTube channelGamers Nexusgot its hands on it for testing. Perhaps the buyer of this Steam Deck prototype will similarly offer a closer look in the future. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still, if you're like our Mollie and have recently decidedyou really do need the Steam Deck in your life, you don't necessarily need to scour eBay for a good deal. Last year,Valve themselves began offering certified refurbs(both for the standard LCD model and theOLED Steam Deck). That said,supplies are understandably limitedso be sure to check back often.

    "title": "Valve Deckard, a long-rumoured standalone VR headset, might not be too far off if these leaked shipping manifests are legit",
    "article_text": "A standalone HMD from Valve might be just what the VR market needs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There've certainly been a lot of Valve Deckard rumours over the last couple of years, but this one, at least, seems more tangible than previous ones referencing driver files and so on, because it's at least about something physical that's actually moving around in the world. The word on the street according to prolific Deckard leakerSadlyItsBradley(viaNotebookcheck) is that \"Valve has been importing equipment to manufacture VR headset facial interfaces inside the USA. The equipment is being provided by Teleray Group who also manufactured the gaskets for the Valve Index and HP G2 Omnicept.\" Valve has been importing equipment to manufacture VR headset facial interfaces inside the USAThe equipment is being provided by Teleray Group who also manufactured the gaskets for the Valve Index and HP G2 Omnicept pic.twitter.com/7iukcZhKz5April 9, 2025 SadlyItsBradley is a YouTuber who talks all things VR and who has previously divulged VR leaks, some of which have been pretty spot-on, such as various ones about Meta Quest headsets. One such leakfeatured CAD drawingsof the then-unannounced Meta Quest Pro, and this led toMeta cutting tieswith the contractor that gave SadlyItsBradley this information. According to a shipping manifestreported by the tech YouTuber, Valve's also been receiving shipments of face gaskets, these being the foam that sit around your eyes when you place a VR headset over your head. All of this, if true, points towards Valve Deckard, along-rumouredValve headset said to be standalone, unlike theValve Indexwhich requires a PC to power it. The Index was a fantastic, top-tier headset when it launched, but that was almost six years ago, now. Tech has certainly moved on since then—the much cheaperMeta Quest 3has a higher resolution, for instance. So, some might say it's high time Valve released a new industry-busting VR headset. It would make sense for this to be a standalone Deckard given the market has shifted in this direction, not to mention the fact that Valve now has experience creating a cracking entry-level, value-oriented physical product in the form of theSteam DeckandSteam Deck OLED. Late last year there was word that codename'Roy' controllers for Deckard were being tooled for mass production, alongside aSteam Controller 2. Now, if these latest shipment and import rumours are true, there's even more reason to believe that a standalone VR headset from Valve could be right around the corner, though with Valve there's no telling how far away that corner really is (Half Life 3, anyone?). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. SadlyItsBradley gives some interesting speculation, too, this being that Valve might be making these import moves to avoid any potential future US tariffs. The latest on this front is thatTrump's hit a pause on them for most countries except China, but things are so up-and-down right now that it's hard to tell what the future will hold. Valve might be smart to pre-empt anything and get its Deckard ducks in order nice and early. We'll have to wait and see whether these rumours bear fruit, but if they do, we can be hopeful they'll be mighty tasty. Given Valve's recent record with physical tech, Deckard could be great news for prospective VR gamers. Here's hoping, anyway.

The worst part ofMarvel Rivalsis its optimisation—loading in can take an age, and I've encountered my fair share of stuttering and even some crashes. The fact that I really enjoy playing this game, spitting whole teams off the edge of the map as Jeff, makes all of that even more frustrating. I'm suffering through the awful optimisation just for the love of the game. So I'm really excited to hear that the devs are trying to fix it with something new: \"Switch Shader Compilation Mode.\" \"To address the memory overload, we're unleashing an experimental feature inSeason 2: The Switch Shader Compilation Mode,\" thepatch notessay. \"With the Season 2 update, players can activate this feature through the PC launcher.\" Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles This mode will enable a couple of enhancements, including changing the shader compilation process, which will only now run when first entering the game and after a new game version or graphics driver update, hopefully decreasing loading times. Memory usage is also \"dramatically reduced, cutting down on severe FPS drops, frozen visuals, and crashes triggered by memory shortages.\" I can't even begin to describe how excited I am for this. I'm really hoping that this fixes the issues I've had with stuttering and crashes, because if it doesn't, I don't know how long I'll be able to continue wading through Marvel Rivals games that feel like wet cement. But this is apparently a risk the Marvel Rivals devs say players should be willing to take: \"We recommend that players with 16GB of RAM or less, who have experienced significant FPS drops, frozen screens, or frequent crashes in previous seasons, consider activating this experimental feature. And remember, if you encounter any issues after enabling it, our support team stands ready to assist on this quest for an optimal gaming experience.\" You can bet that I'll be enabling this new feature as soon as I get the Season 2 update sorted tomorrow. I was going to play a ton of Marvel Rivals anyway, just to experience a couple ofEmma Frost choke slams, but it'll be nice to do this with slightly better optimisation.

As you make your way through theEggstravaganza eventinDisney Dreamlight Valley, you'll eventually have to face theBlooming and Blossomingquest. This is one of the daily quests you can pick up from WALL-E, and while it's not a gateway to a mass of spring decorations, it's still a fantastic way to increase your friendship with everyone's favourite gardening obsessed robot. For the quest, you'll need to run around collecting all sorts of flowers, but given how many spring up across the valley, you'll have to work out specifically which ones to gather. So, here's everything you need to know to complete this quest. To complete Blooming and Blossoming, you need togather flowers to craft a \"Pretty Flower Basket\" for WALL-E. There are six possible flower baskets he might request, which will affect what you need to collect and craft. You need a total of five flowers for each, all of which you can find around the valley. You will also need a fiber to complete the basket, but you can make this yourself from seaweed which is easy to find on Dazzle Beach. The table below labels each Pretty Flower Basket, alongside which flowers you'll need to pick to make one: Pretty Flower Basket number Flowers needed One 2 x Yellow daisy 2 x Blue falling penstemons 1 x White and pink falling penstemon 1 x Fiber Two 2 x Red falling penstemons 2 x Dandelions 1 x White and pink falling penstemon 1 x Fiber Three 2 x Purple Rising Penstemon 2 x Yellow Daisy 1 x Green Rising Penstemon 1 x Fiber Four 2 x Purple Rising Penstemon 2 x Yellow Daisy 1 x Red Daisy 1 x Fiber Five 2 x Red Falling Penstemon 2 x White Daisy 1 x Green Rising Penstemon 1 x Fiber Six 2 x Red Falling Penstemon 2 x Purple Falling Penstemon 1 x Red Daisy 1 x Fiber Once you've gathered the flowers for the appropriate basket, visit a crafting station and take the finished product to WALL-E. As a reward, you'll get five Wild Spring Eggs, five Egg-cellent Fruits, and a Spring V-EGG-etable. It doesn't sound like a lot of payment for all your work picking flowers, but these eggs will give you a headstart on collecting items for other Eggstravaganza crafts available during the event.

    "article_text": "The praise it deserves. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The best part ofStill Wakes the Deep, without a doubt, was the acting. Every member of the cast gave outstanding performances, which made the events of the game even more heartbreaking, but hats off to Alec Newman, who absolutely smashed it as the protagonist Caz. Caz's story in Still Wakes the Deep was already pretty tragic. After getting into a stupid bar fight, he decides to run away to a rig off the Scottish shore to hide from a police investigation and potential prison time. But to do this, he has to leave behind his wife and children. It's a tough choice to make, and he doesn't leave on very good terms, so when all chaos breaks out on the rig and a monster crawls on board, his sole focus is just to survive long enough to see his family again. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together That story alone is sad enough, but Alec Newman makes it hurt even more with his fantastic performance, especially during the final act, which I won't spoil here. I know Still Wakes the Deep came out a year ago, but the story is so amazing I'd feel really guilty if I ruined it for even just one person. Alec Newman isn't the only actor who gave a fantastic performance. Shaun Dooley as Roy broke my heart, especially during his penultimate performance. Stewart Scudamore as Addair and Nicholas Boulton as Trots were also amazing. But aside from Newman, the best acting on the rig had to go to Karen Dunbar as Finlay. Finlay plays such an important role towards the end of the game, and is really one of your last allies. This, coupled with the fantastic voice acting, made me really attached to her character. Seeing that both Alec Newman and Karen Dunbar were celebrated at theBafta Game awards, as they won best leading performance and best supporting actor, respectively, made me really happy. Still Wakes the Deep didn't really get the acclaim I thought it deserved when it was released last year, so it's completely deserved, as these two actors, alongside most of the cast, gave some of the best performances I've seen in any game for a long time.

    "title": "Former Blizzard president says 'I'm not sure where Diablo is going' after Diablo 4 roadmap disappoints: 'Don't ship to check a box'",
    "article_text": "Poorly season'd. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Blizzard's loved a good roadmap, lately—and, as an occasional WoW player, it's mostly been reaping the rewards of them. But things aren't so bright and sunny over in Diablo 4 land, withthe latest onefalling a smidge flat. For starters, half of the thing's burnt off: Seeing as Diablo 4'snext major expansionisn't arriving until 2026, one would hope there'd be a swarm of seasonal content features to tide players over. Instead, it's mostly rep boards—which are sort of like battle-pass style seasonal grinds to unlock various gubbins. There's some other stuff on there—like new lair bosses—but when \"earnable pet\" is a flagship feature on every timeslot on your roadmap, something's up. It doesn't help that the map only gets 3/4ths of the way through a year before essentially going 'we've got more, trust us, it's gonna be great'. Mike Ybarra, former Blizzard president—who took a bit of a weird zag intoCEO of Prizepicks, a fantasy sports company—weighed in on thelukewarm response on Xin a very polite, three-point takedown of what he sees as the D4 team's current issues. Point one: \"Don't ship to check a box,\" Ybarra says. \"Seasons need to get off the cycle of shipping, spending 2 months to fix issues, then repeating.\" Which is an astute enough observation—I'm not familiar with Diablo 4's issues, but I've seen more than one live service game go through this cycle.Helldivers 2 is a prime exampleof a game caught in an eternal loop of 'it's so over' to 'we're so back'. Point two: \"Pause and give the team time to really address the end-game issues. Playing for a week to then [one-to-three-shot] an 'uber' boss 500 times for a unique, then quitting until next season is fundamentally not fun.\" Technically true, but I feel like Ybarra is just… describing a seasonal ARPG, here—maybe Diablo 4 is more stagnant than others. I'm certainly getting that vibe from the community. And lastly: \"[The] expansions schedule is too long—should be yearly. Reduce \"story\" investment (costs so much for one-time element in an ARPG) and focus on new classes, new mob types, new end-game activities that last more than a few days.\" He's not entirely wrong, here, either—a solid story is nice in an ARPG, but most come to these sorts of games to burn out their dopamine receptors by incrementally building towards a build that can backhand god. The story is an accoutrement, rather than the main course. \"If the cycle continues,\" Ybarra concludes, \"To just ship w/o fixing the fundamental issues, then I'm not sure where Diablo is going. You can add all the end-game activities you want, but you'll be running in place with the same issues. At some point there's just so many random things, it's not worth the effort.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While Ybarra is saying all the right things, I should point out that Diablo 4's current state—which, judging by thisthread of player complaints, has a lot to do with the fact that \"Service games suck!\"—is also kinda his fault, right? Diablo 4 was a game developed under his stewardship as company president, and while heleft in January of 2024after the Microsoft acquisition, Ybarra still oversaw around six months of Diablo 4's post-release content. Sure, he's said he planned to cut down onthe game's live service elementsbefore leaving, but hindsight is 20/20. It is, ultimately, extremely easy to say you'd have made all the cool and popular choicesafteryou aren't being held accountable for actually acting on them. To his credit, he's at leastself-aware about this: \"Anyone can say things. Teams have to understand and do them,\" he replies to one player who asked why these things weren't set in motion sooner. Joking elsewhere thathe was paid to be\"Captain Obvious.\" On the other hand: You werepresidentofBlizzard,my guy. I can't think of someone more qualified to get people to understand and do things. As for Diablo 4, I hope its developers are able to get out of the seasonal rut soon—I very much know what it's like for one of your favourite games to fall into astagnant formulawith tremendously slow content updates. I hope this roadmap's flames are merely hiding big news in the future, rather than an ill omen of further burns to come.

    "article_text": "Who's brave enough to face the horror? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. REPOis only getting more popular, so if your friends have been badgering you to play you might be wonderinghow many players can join a game. After all, it's always useful to have more hands on deck when it comes to scouring every nook and cranny for hidden valuables, or even taking down some ofthe horrendous monstersthat lurk in the shadows. With that said, you don't need a certain number of players to host a game, so even if you want to go in on your own, nothing is stopping you. However, I find that REPO is the type of game that is undeniably more fun with friends. Even when you're listening to your pals scream down proximity chat, there's a lot to love about sharing the terror. Or sharing the blame as soon as a very expensive valuable is smashed in your hands. Here's what you need to know about how many players a game of REPO can support. REPO supports up to six players.With games like Lethal Company and Content Warning both supporting up to four players, it's easy to assume that REPO would follow the same pattern. But surprisingly, you and five of your friends can come together to grab as much as possible from a level until something goes horribly wrong. The more players you host though, the more healing you'll have to do and upgrades you'll have to fork out for when you visit the shop. The prices don't change depending on how many players your game is hosting, and let's be real—health is a bit of a luxury in REPO. You should definitely prepare to get scrappy with your friends when it comes to who deserves what upgrades since you'll really need to farm valuables to make up the costs. Then again, you might not be as competitive as me and my group. Inviting friends to your game of REPO is incredibly easy.

    "article_text": "Pretty much identical to previous-gen, but should pair nicely with high-end RTX 50-series GPUs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Now that the next-gen graphics cards have made their entrance, we've started seeing some high-end next-gen laptops file through, too. These tend to feature Intel Core Ultra 200H-series orAMD RyzenAI HX 300-series processors, but before long we might start seeing AMD Ryzen 8000HX-series 'Dragon Range Refresh' chips inside gaming laptops. AMD has just announced these chips, and there are four of them so far, theAMD Ryzen 7 8745HX,Ryzen 7 8840HX,Ryzen 9 8940HX, andRyzen 9 8945HX(viaTom's Hardware). These aren't fully next-gen processors, though. They look almost identical to the previous-gen 7000-HX chips, as they're just a refreshed range of the same Zen 4 chips for the new generation of laptops. Here are the specs: Cores / threads Base / boost clock Cache (L2 + L3) Default TDP / configurable TDP AMD Ryzen 7 8745HX 8 / 16 3.6 / 5.1 GHz 40 MB 55 W / 45 - 75 W AMD Ryzen 7 8840HX 12 / 24 2.9 / 5.1 GHz 76 MB 55 W / 45 - 75 W AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX 16 / 32 2.4 / 5.3 GHz 80 MB 55 W / 55 - 75 W AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX 16 / 32 2.5 / 5.4 GHz 80 MB 55 W / 55 - 75 W For those unaware, the 'HX' designates that these are essentially (but not quite) full-blown desktop chips crammed into mobile devices. This means they should be more powerful than other chips (Ryzen 'HS' ones, for instance) but also consume more power. As you can see in the table above, they also have a bunch of cache, which is great for gaming. There is oneslightdifference between this range and the previous-gen one, and that's that the Ryzen 9 8940HX is 100 MHz faster than theRyzen 9 7940HXon the boost clock. That might get you a fraction of a frame here or there, but I doubt it'll amount to much. In all important respects, these chips are practically identical to their predecessors. What makes them important is just that they should come to reside in at least some of thebest gaming laptopsover the coming months and offer performance that can properly match the new high-end Nvidia GPUs. Having configurable TDPs of up to 75 W is no joke, nor are the mid-5 GHz boost clocks. Of course, anRTX 5080orRTX 5090gaming laptop paired with an AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX or Ryzen 9 8945HX is sure to be a battery-guzzling, heat-producing beast, so I wouldn't expect the sleekest and coolest laptops to run such configurations. But for those looking for sheer horsepower, these Dragon Range chips should offer a lot. If you spot any decent laptops with a previous-gen Ryzen 7000HX chip inside, you won't be losing out on much of anything compared to these new ones, and you might save a bit of money by opting for it. But if you want a current-gen GPU, these will probably be paired with the newly refreshed 8000HX chips listed here. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We should also note that properly next-gen Zen 5 chips are on the way too, in the form of AMD's 'Fire Range' 9000HX-series processors. That, crucially, will include at least one X3D chip in the form of the AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D,announced at CESearlier this year. They're supposedly due in the first half of this year, which means they've got less than two months to make an appearance. If you want true top-of-the-line, this X3D Fire Range chipwill be where it's at—the latest architecture, plus a dollop of 3D V-Cache. I dare say it'll be a tad more expensive than this refreshed Zen 4 8000HX line-up, though.

    "title": "Some lucky Redditors are getting 50-series cards below MSRP thanks to a weird Walmart quirk",
    "article_text": "Aren't you glad I didn't say 'one weird trick'? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Seems like only a few weeks back we were grumbling about the price ofNvidia RTX 5070graphics cards—because we were. Well, some enterprising Redditors have discovered a neat little loophole that's bound to be closed one day, allowing them to pick up a like new RTX 50-series card at a cut price. It all started with this post about one lucky posterstumbling upon a RTX 5080 card discounted down to $896from $1280. The Reddit user found the card with the fabled yellow price sticker in the PC section of their local Walmart. Store employees explained to the poster that it was a return from the day before and that they'd been \"placing bets [on] how fast it would sell\" since putting it back on the shelf. But rather than being a one-off lucky find, this might actually be a 'one weird trick.' A few days later,a different poster shared their spoils—plus a little bonus insight suggesting this might be somewhat replicable. Inspired by the aforementionedRTX 5080post earlier that week, this Redditor checked out the PC components cabinet at their nearest Walmart and picked up aRTX 5070card for the discounted price of $515. Not only that, but the box was still completely sealed. So, what's going on? The short answer is 'returns.' Basically, due tothe outsized demand for the RTX 50-series cardsmaking things likein-person lottery systems a bad idea, Walmart is using an online-only system. However, when these cards are then returned in-store, some store employees have been putting them back out on the shelf at a discounted price whether the card has been opened or not. Now, before you rush out to the big Mart of Wal', it's worth noting that there's no guarantee you'll be so lucky. For one, the comments are full of folks trying to do just that and returning to the post empty-handed. For another, some schemers in the comments are floating the idea of buying a card at full price only to return it, wait for it to be put back on the shelf, and revel in the discount. This presents a few risks, including someone else pipping you at the post on buying back 'your' card and, if enough folks jump on the bandwagon, Walmart potentially wising up—because the entire scheme could be considered fraud. All in all, there's gotta be an easier way to get a decent price on one of these RTX 50-series cards. Speaking of, may I suggest our very own Where to Buy listsfor the RTX 5090as well asthe RTX 5080 cardas a starting point? For a perhaps slightly more reasonable price point, you could always geta brand-new laptop with a RTX 50-series cardinstead. Happy hunting!

    "title": "Black Mirror Season 7 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Not as prescient and urgent as it once was, but the Twilight Zone of tech can still manage to be occasionally chilling. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Black Mirror Season 7 has arrived from the all-too-near future, bringing with it the familiar combination of tech-based horror, cautionary tales, and the occasional smidge of hope. The series doesn't feel nearly as prescient as it did when it began way back in 2011—how could it—but even when the episodes of this technological Twilight Zone don't quite deliver on their premises, they're still well worth watching (maybe while scrolling social media on your own black mirror). This time around there are a few game-centric episodes: one deals with AI in a sim game that might not be quite as artificial as it seems, another returns us to space-based MMO Infinity from Season 4, and one episode deals with something we all constantly use and deeply dread: streaming subscription services. Plus, you can even see someone playing Balatro in one scene in Season 7, which makes sense: Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker called the deckbuilder \"possibly the most addictive thing ever created.\" The most relatable tech nightmare begins in the episode \"Common People,\" where grade-school teacher Amanda (Rashida Jones) and welder Mike (Chris O'Dowd) are a humble but happy suburban couple until their lives are upended by a serious medical event. Amanda needs brain surgery, but offering the only real and affordable chance for success is a startup called Rivermind that will stream some of her brain functions from their cloud-based servers. For a monthly fee. We subscribe to everything these days: smartphone plans, streaming services, apps, music, news websites, videogames. It can be legitimately difficult just tobuysomething: it took me ages to find a fitness tracker that didn't require a monthly sub, and when I had a plumber come to install a new bathroom fixture recently, he told me now offers a monthly service subscription. We're all well-versed in the pitfalls of these subscriptions, like sudden price hikes, different tiers of service, and that infuriating moment when we realize, \"Wait, I'm paying for this subscription, so why the hell do I have to watch advertisements?\" Now apply all that stress to your brain instead of your phone, TV, or game library. It's an unsettling thought (especially if that thought is being streamed into your head). There are obviously benefits to streaming services both in this episode and in life—Amanda would be in a coma if not for Rivermind (at least here in the US, where you can't get life-saving medical procedures or even routine medications without bankrupting yourself). I complain about monthly subs but I still subscribe to a bunch of them so I can listen to any song ever made or any movie ever released without having to go hunt down a physical copy in a store. But the episode—the best of the six this season—is a pointed reminder of how quickly we've gone from owning the things we pay for to renting them a month at a time, and how just to live our lives we're relying more and more on distant servers controlled by megacorporations more than happy to squeeze every dollar they can out of us. Another episode, \"Plaything,\" takes us back to the 1990s as a young games journalist working for PC Zone magazine (as show creator Charlie Brooker did) is invited to preview a new game from Colin Ritman (Will Poulter), the developer we met in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. (Note: apart from Poulter's appearance, this episode isn't a really Bandersnatch follow-up as we'd hoped, and it's not an interactive pick-a-path episode like Bandersnatch was.) \"They're not some obscene puppets, like Sonic the Hedgehog.\" Ritman's new game isn't actually a game, he claims. It's called Thronglets and though it looks like it's a creature simulation, Ritman claims the critters on the screen are actually alive. \"They're not some obscene puppets, like Sonic the Hedgehog,\" he says. \"These are living individuals\" created with code. The cute pixelated creatures walk around in a simulated nature preserve multiplying and sometimes singing. The journalist realizes the Thronglets are trying to communicate with him, and after scavenging some gear like an Atari Jaguar, a Quickcam, and a Sound Blaster sound card (it's fun to see all this throwback hardware again), he upgrades his rig so he can talk to them directly. His interest in these creatures quickly turns to obsession, but if your Sims were really alive, wouldn't you be even more consumed with them than you already are? Thronglets might be based on sims like 1996'sCreatures, which featured little animals called Norns players could pet, feed, play with, and teach to take care of themselves. The Norns would communicate with little noises, similar to the Thronglet's singing, and Creatures used machine learning and neural networks to allow the creatures to learn behaviors, making it a precursor to today's AI research. (It's evenon Steam.) Unfortunately this episode can't really live up to its setup, and it's pretty much all setup. The idea of the sims in our games being actually alive is an interesting one, especially when they can grow and learn, but it's not particularly well explored here. It's great fun seeing lots of old hardware and references to games like 1994's Magic Carpet (in the episode the reviewer says he gave it a 93%, though apparently the real PC Zone gave it a 96%) but even Peter Capaldi playing an older version of the games journo can't make this episode memorable. The biggest draw of the season is probably the follow-up to the Black Mirror Season 4 episode \"USS Callister,\" in which a masochistic game developer (played by Jesse Plemons) made digital clones of his coworkers using their DNA and inserted them into his space-based MMO so he could abuse them. A lot more could have been done with the premise of real people trying to survive inside an MMO. In Season 7 sequel \"USS Callister: Into Infinity,\" the starship crew, captained by Nanette Cole (Cristin Milioti), find themselves in dire straits as the game they're living in has been heavily monetized and requires credits just to use their hyperdrive. Since they're not actual players but are living in the game's universe, they're targeted for deletion by the game's sleazy and greedy CEO James Walton, played again by Jimmi Simpson. Most of the episode is carried by the great performances of Milioti and Simpson, who play dual roles as the real world Cole and Walton and their digital clones inside the game. But the movie-length episode (it's 90 minutes) just doesn't have enough to sustain it other than a few laughs. A lot more could have been done with the premise of real people trying to survive inside an MMO, but most of the episode takes place outside the game in the less-interesting real world. The other episodes of Season 7 I hate to describe as \"fine,\" but they're fine: Paul Giammati plays a man exploring his painful past through photographs while assisted by an AI guide, Issa Rae is a modern day actor inserted (again, with AI) into an old film so it can be updated for re-release, and Siena Kelly is a chef who starts experiencing the Mandela Effect to a troubling degree when a former classmate resurfaces in her life. Like Season 6, most of these episodes don't feel like they're really foreshadowing the future when it comes to technology. The series relies heavily on its \"Experiencer Disk,\" a recurring gadget that you stick to your temple that instantly transports you into a virtual world where pretty much anything can happen, and that always winds up feeling more like fantasy than science fiction. But just because the show has lost some of the impact and weight of the earlier seasons, they're still worth streaming to one of your black mirrors: at least until Netflix can beam them right into our heads. Not as prescient and urgent as it once was, but the Twilight Zone of tech can still manage to be occasionally chilling.

Whether or not you're ready for the annual trailer extravaganza, which peaks in June and August during Summer Game Fest and Gamescom, it has begun. In case you forgot, Triple-i is just a group of a bunch of studios getting together to share big announcements. There's no real definition for what \"triple-i\" is, or AAA, or \"indie,\" even. Words can mean anything around here but think of it as a showcase for some of the \"big indies\" out there. We'll tell you exactly who's involved down below. The Triple-i Initiative showcase premieres at 9 am Pacific on April 10, 2025 onYouTubeandTwitch.Here's how that breaks downin other parts of the world: Triple-i says to expect the show to last a \"speedy 45 minutes with no ads and no hosts.\" So expect to get a bunch of trailers back to back with no banter segments to use for your bathroom break. Triple-i says that there are over 30 participating studios in this year's showcase bringing 37 different announcements. It specifically mentions updates from The Alters, Outbound, and Enshrouded. You can also spot things like Moonlighter 2, V Rising, Deep Rock Galactic, Endless Legend 2, and Sloclap's soccer (football) game Rematch in the trailer above. Personally I have my eye on Askiisoft, which may finally be some news about that free Katana Zero DLC that'sbeen in the works for years.

There's a clue for today'sWordlejust a little further down this page, all freshly written up and ready to help you win. Use it right at the beginning to get your guessing off to a fantastic start, or save it for when you're further down the board and need a bit of a nudge—either's good. The April 10 (1391) answer's here as well, ready to save your game in a single click. Imagine seeing three green letters all nicely bundled together. Imagine meeting them about halfway down the board, enough time to have ruled out a few common letters and bring the focus onto whatever was left untested. Imagine immediately reaching for the most obscure word in the universe, and then being surprised when it didn't work out. Imagine being that person. Me? Oh, uh… Think of a car part, of a fan or turbine used to improve performance, and more generally associated with an extra kick of speed or power. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. Here you go. The answer to the April 10 (1391) Wordle isTURBO. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

    "article_text": "After that, sieges will finally get a look-in. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Changes to the campaign AI of Creative Assembly's border-gore simulator Total War: Warhammer 3 were the focus of a recent beta test, which revealed one reason the AI was playing too defensively wasa bug that made it overreact to the presence of a single hero. Since that beta a second round of improvements has been outlined, which Creative Assembly has detailed in a recentblog post. The first enhancement will be a reduction of anti-player bias, meaning the AI will treat the player more like it treats other AI factions rather than inflating its view of our riskiness. The second is a tweak to distance scaling, which currently encourages the AI to stay home more than is ideal. \"One example is the Southlands World's Edge Mountains province\", principle technical designer Radoslav Borisov notes, \"the AI struggles to invade it normally.\" This tweak will make foreign armies less likely to idle at base for no good reason. Conversely, changes to AI aggression will make nearby armies less likely to attack when they have no hope of winning. Faction potential is due for a change as well. \"We heard you loud and clear that having a variety of minor factions survive and potentially thrive is something you want to see.\" Therefore underperforming factions will be getting a boost, meaning that Clan Moulder, the Warhost of the Apocalypse, Hag Graef, Itza, the Bloody Handz, Caravan of Blue Roses, Puppets of Misrule, and the Bonerattlaz will be more likely to survive—at least until we lift the fog of war on them. Meanwhile, overperforming factions will have their potential reduced, meaning you'll be less likely to see the Oracles of Tzeentch, Blooded Wanderers, Cult of Pleasure, and Khemri painting the map. In my last campaign the undead of Khemri were marching far from home all over the Old World for no good reason, so that's a welcome change. Finally, a bunch of bug fixes for the way AI factions use their specific campaign features are incoming: All these changes will be part of the new campaign AI beta, which you can opt into via Steam. Following that, senior community manager Steve Coleman says, \"we have a team internally starting to explore changes that we think we can make to Sieges, and are hoping to bring you more on that in the summer.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Google Docs' new AI voice will help you catch mistakes",
    "article_text": "Or a nice podcast-style summary When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Reading your writing out loud is one of the best ways to discover any mistakes or awkwardness that could use some editing. But as the writer, you might have a blind spot for your own typos or be too close to what you wrote to note where it needs some rewriting (or outright cutting). So, if you don't always have a friend on hand to help,Googlewill start jumping in with a new Audio Overview feature for Google Docs. Audio Overviews are already a part ofGoogle's NotebookLM platform. Now, Google is sending that “natural-sounding” narration to Google Docs to read your documents aloud. The goal is for the user to hear Audio Overviews read a document back to you, uncovering every mistyped word and stilted phrase you didn't hear when you wrote it. Google is also including a second option besides just getting an AI recitation. You'll be able to hear what the company calls a “podcast-style overview” of the text, meaning just a collection of the highlights instead of every single word. For texts that are more than a dozen pages long and full of research, that could be a big help. Alas, this isn't the kind ofpodcast-style review available on NotebookLM, which will generate an actual conversation between two AI voices discussing everything you've uploaded. Google claims the voices will be indistinguishable from an actual human, and if it's the same AI voice model employed by NotebookLM, that's not far from the truth. Of course, mispronouncing words, especially proper nouns they haven't heard before, is a very human foible when reading out loud. Still, that might not matter much if it also catches your actual errors. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The feature also has a major accessibility benefit as AI voices reading text have been a boon for people with impaired sight or other reading difficulties. An upgraded, more natural-sounding voice to read Google Docs would only make text more accessible. Plus, it could help anyone who just has a lot going on. You could 'read' a long report while driving, folding laundry, or doing anything else that keeps your eyes busy. This isn't a world-shaking feature, but it's the kind of quality-of-life improvement to a widely used product, Google Docs, that AI is uniquely suited to provide. It's hard to argue that using AI to enhance productivity software to make it more adaptive is unnecessary. Anything to streamline how you polish your writing will be a draw. Not that Google is unique in this pursuit, though, as bothMicrosoftandApplehave been experimenting with similar AI augmentation of their word processors. Even so, Google Docs is the go-to for millions of people, students, and professionals alike, and this move makes the product that much easier to stick with.

    "article_text": "The new display was built with feedback from Mac users When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For many Mac users,Apple’s Studio Display is a highly desirable product, but its steep price will have placed it out of reach for some potential buyers. Tech startDoughis developing the Spectrum Canvas, an alternative to the Apple Studio Display, based on feedback from Mac users on r/Mac. This device is a 32-inch 6K monitor aimed at creatives, remote workers, and professionals who want Apple-like quality without the premium price tag. The Canvas aims to strike a balance between visual fidelity, premium materials, and community-informed features. At the heart of the Spectrum Canvas isLG’s 6K IPS Black panel, which was announced at CES 2025. It offers true 10-bit color, 98% DCI-P3 coverage, 218 PPI, a 2000:1 contrast ratio, and 99.5% AdobeRGB coverage. The monitor also includes an ATW polarizer, which helps reduce IPS glow and improves color uniformity. With this level of performance, the Canvas is being positioned as one of thebest 5K/8K monitoroptions available for modern Mac users. In terms of design, the device features an anodized aluminum body, a die-cast stand, and solid cover glass on the front. The glass finish is glossy yet anti-reflective, avoiding the glare typically associated with glossy panels. At the time of writing, some aspects of the monitor, such as power delivery specs, webcam options, speaker integration, and USB hub layout, are still under development. Instead of finalizing these decisions internally, Dough is involving its user community in the process. Those interested in contributing can join the company’s Reddit community. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! For users searching for thebest monitor for Mac Minior thebest monitor for MacBook Pro, the native 6K resolution and large format of the Spectrum Canvas promises to deliver a seamless experience across both everyday tasks and creative workflows. As of now, Dough has not released official details regarding pricing or availability.

    "title": "After Bluetooth, China wants to replace HDMI connectors with a faster, more powerful port that could even support 16K",
    "article_text": "One cable for power, data, and display - meet GPMI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Following its push toreplace Bluetooth with Nearlink, China is now turning its attention to physical connectors, targeting HDMI, USB4, and Thunderbolt with a new high-bandwidth alternative. The General Purpose Media Interface (GPMI) was recently unveiled by the Shenzhen8KUHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance, a consortium of over 50 tech companies. Designed to meet the demands of ultra-high-resolution content, GPMI promises significant improvements in speed, power delivery, and versatility, enough to transmit 8K, and potentially even 16K, video. The GPMI standard comes in two versions - the more powerful GPMI Type-B offers a massive 192Gbps bandwidth and can deliver up to 480 watts of power, enough to support high-performancelaptops for photo editing, and far exceeding the capabilities of HDMI or Thunderbolt. GPMI Type-C, on the other hand, uses the widely adopted USB-C form factor but doubles the bandwidth of USB4 and Thunderbolt 4, reaching 96Gbps. It also matches USB4’s 240-watt power delivery, enough to power5K/8K monitorsand charge devices simultaneously. In comparison, HDMI 2.1 maxes out at 48Gbps and delivers no power. USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 both top out at 40Gbps, with power delivery of 240W and 100W, respectively. DisplayPort 2.1, currently the leader in bandwidth at 80Gbps, does not offer power transmission. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Additionally, the GPMI standard supports a universal remote-control protocol, allowing users to control multiple connected devices with a single remote. This will be especially useful for creative professionals who rely on multiple displays or peripherals, such as those usinghigh-end laptops for graphic design.

    "title": "Apple's uncharacteristic Siri stumble is bad news for you, and now we may know how it happened and why there's reason for hope",
    "article_text": "A tale of two teams When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As someone who's coveredApplefor almost a quarter of a century, thisApple IntelligenceSiri chapter is by far its most confounding one. We're now just two months away from the next Apple developer's conference, and it will likely mark an ignominious anniversary for Apple's artificial intelligence efforts. Apple's uncharacteristic failure to deliver on a product promise has shocked many fans. Ever since the company announced itwould not deliver some of the promised Siri enhancementsthis year, I, for one, have been wondering how we got here. Now, a new report paints a surprising picture of rival AI factions or rather two teams with divergent strategies that somehow led to flashy demos and some unfulfilled promises. Not everything inThe Information's reporton the Apple Siri debacle is surprising. I've been writing for some time about how Apple's usually laudableadherence to privacy principles hamstrung its Siri efforts. However, The Information's claim that Apple's AI lead John Giannandrea and Craig Federighi (Apple's software engineering head) were in some fashion acting at cross purposes is unexpected. Giannandrea's slow and steady approach and Apple's insistence on using its own models as opposed to, say,OpenAI'sGPTLLMs was in stark contrast to the obvious excitement Federighi's Intelligent Systems team had for experimenting with and possibly using third-party models. Internal battles are not unheard of in companies of all sizes, but they usually don't play out on a public stage at Apple. As The Information tells it, the Apple Intelligence demos I saw last June atWWDCmay have broken what I thought was a cardinal rule for Apple: never announce technology that you can't demo live, at least in some fashion. When Apple stunned WWDC 2023 with the newApple Vision Pro,it followed later that afternoon by inviting a handful of journalists (including me) for hands-on demos. The pricey mixed reality headset wasn't done, but it was still functional enough to blow our collective minds. In the case of Apple's Intelligence, though, our post-event demos were limited (Siri was no smarter). It seems that not only were many of the best bits not finished, but Apple may have shown them off in the pre-tapped keynote without giving the main Apple AI team in charge of Siri a full heads-up. Doing so obviously put Apple in a tough spot. The pre-tapped WWDC video showed us a responsive and aware Siri capable of looking into your iPhone, its apps, and your information to take action on your behalf. Apple then promised we'd see it sometime that year. Even after Apple delivered theiPhone 16withiOS 18and the first blush of Apple Intelligence (a new look, writing tools, Image Playground, Genmojis), most assumed it was just a matter of time before Siri got its major intelligence glow-up. By possibly demonstrating technology that was not ready or even fully programmed to run on any Apple Intelligence-ready iPhone, Apple may have set itself or, at least the Siri team, up for failure. Apple hasn't spoken on the record about this beyond the initialannouncement of the delay.News that Apple Intelligence is nowreportedly under Craig Federighi's leadershipis further proof that perhaps Apple realizes it chose the wrong path. Federighi's team, according to The Information, is much more open to integrating third-party LLMs. It's a good strategy not only because it will help Apple's AI efforts get back on track but also because it's the same strategy employed by most of its AI competitors, at least those who are not at heart AI companies. Late in the game,Amazonrelied on Perplexity's Claude AI models to build its own Nova system.Samsunghas leaned heavily onGoogleGemini to develop its own models. As we well know,Microsoftmade a big bet on OpenAI's GPT models to powerBingAI and then Copilot to build its own Microsoft AI models. This, folks, is the way in. Sure, it's maybe less predictable and, possibly, rock-solid secure than Apple's initial strategy, but most of these companies are racing ahead while iPhone fans wait for Apple to get its act together. Federighi (and Vision Pro lead Mike Walker) taking over is good news, but much of Apple's future success in the AI space will depend on Apple CEOTim Cook's leadership. This failure happened under his watch, possibly because he trusted the team to get the job done and has been adamant about sticking to Apple's secure and private approach. Now Cook has to find a new plan and, with Federighi, identify a clear path that gets you the smarter Siri you want in 2026, if not sooner. I've seen Apple do amazing things in the past, and honestly, I'm confident it'll do it again here. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

While having a 3-2-1 backup strategy is a start when it comes to ransomware protection, the Object First research also reveals that 96% of organizations who have suffered a ransomware attack in the last two years saw their data backups targeted as part of at least one attack, with one in ten seeing their backup storage targeted in every attack. While there is a general consensus that immutable backup storage is probably the best way to protect against ransomware, only 59% of organizations actually deploy this form of storage, and only 58% have multiple copies of their data in separate locations. In addition to this, 61% of respondents believe that IT security hardening offers enough protection against ransomware attacks.

To do this, businesses should segment their networks to minimize the potential blast radius of an attack, alongside using authentication mechanisms for log-ins such as multi-factorauthenticationandidentity access managementpractices. Moreover, each user should only have access to the files and applications they need for their specific workload. Immutable backup storage helps protect against ransomware attacks by storing data in a way that it cannot be modified or deleted. Traditionally, these have been hard drives or other storage mediums that are used to back up data and then stored in an ‘air-gapped’ environment that has no connection to the outside world. However, with cloud services booming, immutablecloud storageis now also an option.

    "title": "OpenAI just upgraded memory for ChatGPT – all the latest as Sam Altman says it’s about ‘how AI will integrate in our lives’",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAI’s certainly been on a roll with feature after feature and even new models – and if you thought the AI giant was going to take a break after it’s new image generation tech, you’re in for a surprise. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has taken toX (formerly Twitter)to tease that a new feature is coming. The post reads: “a few times a year I wake up early and can't fall back asleep because we are launching a new feature I've been so excited about for so long. Today is one of those days!” It's certainly building up the hype and leading us to wonder what might be on the horizon. OpenAI typically launches mid-morning Pacific Time, which translates to early afternoon Eastern Time – so TechRadar is here to break down and unpack whatever Altman and the team are planning to show off today. Considering he said \"new feature\" though let's quickly note that we'd be very surprised if it's new model or an upgrade to o3 or o4. Altman even followed up saying just that, but noting it's a critical one that will impact \"how AI will integrate in our lives.\" While ChatGPT has been running just fine in the nearly two hours since the improved memory feature was announced, the service hasn't been without its outages in the past few weeks. Notably, the load of generating images has caused some issues, including the melting of GPUs. Sam Altman posted to X, noting that 'usage has gone nuts over the past month' for OpenAI but that the team has been able to pull together more resources. How? Well, he simply asked the internet. He promised that rate limits and the speed of ChatGPT would continue to improve, as well. openai usage has gone nuts over the past month.but a surprisingly cool thing is you can ask the internet \"hey can we please get hundreds of thousands of more GPUs quickly\" and...the internet will deliver.🩵April 10, 2025 It's worth pointing out that ChatGPT could already recall, and the AI assistant has had a memory for a bit. Today's upgrades are exactly that: an upgrade to the existing memory, now being labeled as 'new, improved memory' by ChatGPT. The idea is that when you ask ChatGPT for something, it can look back and reference past conversations to deliver more accurate and helpful answers to whatever your query might be. It's sort of building a Rolodex about everything you've chatted about with it to help better assist and answer any given request. The AI can pick up on trends on its own, but you can also directly ask ChatGPT to remember something as you converse with it via typed text or when you're actually speaking in voice mode. You'll know once your account has been upgraded with the smarter memory via this splash screen. Again, it's rolling out now for Pro users, and Plus subscribers will get it soon after. It's also confirmed that those with ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, or Education accounts will get the functionality in a few weeks. We also have our first official look at how this improved memory in ChatGPT will function, thanks to a teaser posted on the @OpenAI X account. In it, we can see that when you ask, \"what we talked about this weekend,\" it will summarize the topics discussed into bullet points broken out by day. Plus, you can then follow up, as you would with any old ChatGPT conversation, allowing you to ask if what you've discussed matches what you've discussed at any point in its memorized history. Starting today, memory in ChatGPT can now reference all of your past chats to provide more personalized responses, drawing on your preferences and interests to make it even more helpful for writing, getting advice, learning, and beyond. pic.twitter.com/s9BrWl94iYApril 10, 2025 If the idea of an AI chatbot remembering everything you say doesn't interest you, OpenAI has programmed two ways to circumvent this within ChatGPT. You can either opt out of memory entirely or use a new feature called temporary conversations. This will allow you to start a fresh conversation that won't recall or impact memory. That might be the best approach, especially if you're mostly on board with Sam Altman's view that AI systems should get to know you. While ChatGPT Pro subscribers have access to the improved memory right now, those with a ChatGPT Plus plan should get access soon. Sam Altman is shedding a bit more light ina reply, noting it should be in the next few days. In a series of announcement posts on X (formerly Twitter), Altman showed that he views this feature drop as a pretty major one. Writing, \"this is a surprisingly great feature imo, and it points at something we are excited about: ai systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.\" Clearly, the team at OpenAI views this as a big step forward and, ultimately, a push toward making the AI assistant and chatbot even more useful. It also hints at the future for OpenAI as a focus is letting these AI systems really get to know whomever it's conversing with. That could hint at future AI agents, much more advanced large-language models, and that rumored piece of hardware. we have greatly improved memory in chatgpt--it can now reference all your past conversations!this is a surprisingly great feature imo, and it points at something we are excited about: ai systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.April 10, 2025 Now, we're eager to try out this new memory function, but my colleague Lance Ulanoff – TechRadar's Editor-at-Large – ChatGPT Plus account, doesn't yet have the memory function or know that it's a new feature. However, this improvement could prove quite useful for reviewing conversations you've had with ChatGPT without having to manually scroll through all of them. The major change here, as Altman describes it, is that ChatGPT can now refer back to previous conversations you've had with the AI assistant. Of course, this will be an opt-in feature and plays into the idea – and quest from AI makers – that AI should know a lot about you and ultimately be personalized to your needs. OpenAI is also wasting no time. ChatGPT's improved memory function is now rolling out for Pro Users in select countries, excluding the UK, EEA, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. It will eventually arrive for Plus subscribers, but there is no word on when this will hit free users. we have greatly improved memory in chatgpt--it can now reference all your past conversations!this is a surprisingly great feature imo, and it points at something we are excited about: ai systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.April 10, 2025 Now just after 1PM ET as we predicted, Sam Altman has announced that OpenAI has \"greatly improved memory in chatgpt\" we have greatly improved memory in chatgpt--it can now reference all your past conversations!this is a surprisingly great feature imo, and it points at something we are excited about: ai systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.April 10, 2025 So here's the original post on X that started the train of something new from OpenAI today. a few times a year i wake up early and can't fall back asleep because we are launching a new feature ive been so excited about for so long.today is one of those days!April 10, 2025 TechRadar is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.Visit our corporate site. ©\nFuture US, Inc.

A component of ESET’s endpoint protection solution was being abused to launch stealthymalwareon Windows devices. In an in-depth report, security researchers from Kaspersky said they saw a critical vulnerability in ESET’s command-line scanner being abused to deploy a tool named TCESB. The vulnerability, now identified as CVE-2024-11859, allowed attackers to hijack the loading process of system libraries by abusing how the ESET scanner usually loads them.

    "article_text": "Nvidia's gaming GPU is already facing mounting stock issues When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. During the early 2020s, cryptomining was a driving force behind a lot of GPU shortages and inflated prices, as high-end graphics cards were snapped up in bulk to mine cryptocurrencies, leading to record pricing across multiple generations of GeForce GPUs. Nvidiaattempted to address the issue by introducing mining limiters, but miners, naturally, found ways to bypass these, and retail prices remained well above the MSRP for long periods. History could well be about to repeat itself, but this time based around artificial intelligence demand rather than cryptocurrency.Videocardz(viaI_Leak_VN)reports that a Vietnamese retailer called Nguyencongpc has started selling barebone AI servers equipped with sevenGeForce RTX 5090graphics cards. The setup, cooled by air and powered by a 2000W PSU, is designed to handle large AI workloads, including support for large language models. The RTX 5090, with its 32GB of GDDR7 memory, offers a blend of high performance and relatively low cost compared to Nvidia’s dedicated in-demand AI accelerators. When several are used in tandem, as is the case with the server Nguyencongpc is selling, they can match or exceed the memory capacity needed for enterprise-level AI applications - without the high price tag of the RTX Pro or H-series products. While you've got to admire the ingenuity on display here, the knock on will inevitably be mounting supply pressures. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The RTX 5090 is already facing stock issues, and its price has climbed past $3000 in many markets, with some listings close to $4000. This mirrors the RTX 4090's trajectory, which driven by cryptomining, rarely dropped below MSRP and remained in high demand for non-gaming uses. With modders reportedly exploring ways to increase onboard memory even further, the RTX 5090 could follow the same path as its predecessors - designed for games, but monopolized by entirely different industries. Nvidia has yet to take steps to prevent system integrators or retailers from redirecting gaming GPUs toward AI markets and if it doesn't, gamers could well once again find themselves unable to purchase the latest graphics hardware at fair prices.

GoogleCloud CEO Thomas Kurian has said the company looks poised to go from strength to strength as the global demand for more AI technology continues unabated. Fresh from hosting the opening keynote at the company'sGoogle Cloud Next 25in Las Vegas, Kurian told a media Q&A session attended byTechRadar Proabout the latest challenges facing the business, as well as its myriad of successes. \"(AI) is simplifying technology itself,\" Kurian said in the session, \"You have the same technology that runs Google, available to every small business...by simplifying the technology, you bring it to everybody.\" \"If you look at the highest level of what we're trying to do - it's relatively simple,\" Kurian noted, highlighting how Google Cloud has expanded its global footprint to cover 42 regions across the world, with more to come soon. \"Our success is reflected not by what we do, but what customers and partners do with our technology,\" he added. \"We are very well-positioned due to the breadth of our portfolio - but also because of the differentiation in what we're doing with AI.\" Asked about the possible effects of US tariffs on business around the world, Kurian replied with a smile that the tariff discussion is \"an extremely dynamic one\", and that Google Cloud has been through many cycles like this (most recently in the Covid crisis) and that he was confident the company will be able to navigate this period too.

Stating the company has done \"a lot of work\" over the past two years to \"hugely reduce\" the cost of training and inferencing of models, he noted the company will continue to optimize the cost of serving models while improving quality. Kurian added Google Cloud has more than seven times the water-cooled AI systems as the rest of the world combined, and was also working on implementing nuclear power and sustainable energy sources such as hydroelectric and solar. \"For us, it's really important that people see AI as being a technology that can also drive both efficiency in the consumption of energy, and also created new forms of energy because of the investments that we are making.\" Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors: every rumored and predicted shade",
    "article_text": "Black, blue, and a mystery too When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. So far there haven’t been manySamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7colors leaks, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have an idea of what to expect, asSamsungtends to return to certain shades time and again. Below then, you’ll find the colors we’ve so far heard rumored for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, along with some others that we think are likely to be offered. Make sure to check back soon too, as we’ll be sure to update this article any time we hear anything new about Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 colors. The one Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 color leak we’ve seen so far takes the form of renders shared byAndroid Headlines, that show the phone in black. It’s unclear whether this is actually a shade the publication has heard will be offered, or just one it chose to use for the renders, but either way, we’d say some form of black is very likely, as every single Z Fold model so far has been sold in a black shade. The exact shade of black differs, but some version of black will almost certainly be offered for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. White is another shade we expect the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to be sold in, as while no leaks yet point to a white option, the last few models have come in either white or a white-adjacent shade, be that beige or cream. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. On top of which, white is simply a very popular and common smartphone shade, so while we’re less confident of this than black, we’d think there’s a good chance the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be sold in a white or off-white shade. As with white, silver and gray are both popular smartphone shades – particularly silver, so while neither have been mentioned for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 yet there’s a good chance one of them will be offered. We’re lumping them together here because they’re somewhat similar, and they’re both shades that Samsung has often sold Z Fold models in – including ‘Silver Shadow’ for theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, a shade that’s basically a cross between silver and gray. And because they’re so similar, it’s probably unlikely that Samsung will offer both a silver and a gray shade. Blue is a shade we’re less confident in than any of the colors above, simply because it’s a bit more unusual to see phones in blue. And as with everything except black, we also haven’t seen any rumors pointing to a blue Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 yet. But Samsung does seem to have a thing for blue, particularly in its Z Fold series. Last year there was navy blue, and the year before that there were actually two different blue shades. So, while we wouldn’t be at all surprised if there isn’t a blue option for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, we’d say there are reasonable odds that there will be. In recent years, Samsung’s numbered Galaxy Z Fold phones have been sold in five different shades, but as the numerically accomplished of you will no doubt have noticed, we’ve only mentioned four above. So even if all of those shades do make an appearance (and that’s a big ‘if'), we’d expect to see at least one more too. What that will be though is anyone’s guess right now, but we’ll update this article once we have a clearer idea. James is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

    "article_text": "Amazon plans huge expansion of its logistics facilities When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazonis reportedly planning to invest a staggering $15 billion across no less than 80 new logistics facilities across the US in a bid to better serve both cities and rural areas. A report fromBloombergclaims the company is planning to develop new delivery hubs, with some being large fulfillment centers equipped with state-of-the-art robots. Amazon is now inviting capital partners to submit proposals in what’s seen as welcome news amid ongoing tariff-induced economic uncertainty. When the world moved to remote and online habits during the pandemic, Amazon was believed to have overspent on retail infrastructure and staffing, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. Between November 2022 and March 2023, Amazon laid off around 27,000 workers. Although itsecommercebusiness continues to grow, recent investments have largely focused on cloud and AI technologies, so it’s reassuring to see that the online retail giant is hasn’t given up on what it’s known best for by consumers. Speaking about the company’s fourth-quarter and year-endresults, Jassy noted Amazon had delivered its “fastest speeds ever” for Prime in 2024, with a 65% year-over-year increase in US orders delivered on the same day or overnight, thanks largely to its expansive network of logistics facilities and transportation resources. The company now has around 600 fulfillment centers in the US alone, but no timeline has been shared for the addition of another 80. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite a positive outlook, it’s clear that Amazon isn’t immune from the ongoing trade war, having reportedly canceled numerous orders from China and other Asian countries over tariffs.

    "article_text": "Players may need to purchase the expansion pass separately When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nintendo has confirmed that NintendoSwitch 2Edition games will contain the full game and upgrades on the cartridge, but there's still uncertainty surrounding some downloadable content (DLC). Last week, a Nintendo customer service representative caused some confusion among fans following the NintendoSwitch 2 Directby informing one player thatSwitch 2 Edition games will be original Switch cartridges with a download code attached. Nintendo has now clarified that this is not the case and that enhanced games, likeThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the KingdomandThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,will feature the full game and upgrades on the Switch 2 Edition cartridge. In a statement toVooks, a Nintendo spokesperson said, \"Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.\" Although we have confirmation on this aspect, there's still uncertainty surrounding DLC, specifically when it comes toBreath of the Wildand its expansion pass. As reported byGoNintendo, a My Nintendo Store customer service representative stated that theBreath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition \"is not going to include the Expansion Pass content\", which includesThe Master TrialsandThe Champion's Ballad.

We still don't have official confirmation from Nintendo, but it seems that, like with the Switch version, players will need to purchase the DLC packs again to play them on Switch 2. It's also unclear if this applies to all Switch 2 Edition games with DLC. The Nintendo Switch 2 officially launches on June 5, 2025, and will cost $449.99 / £395.99 or $499.99 / £429.99 for aMario Kart Worldbundle.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're getting close to the launch ofMarvelRivalsSeason 2, which will bring a ton of updates to the blockbuster multiplayer game. As we near release day, there's plenty to dig into, including the announcement of a brand new Hero, a whole new map to explore, as well as tweaks and balancing patches that'll mix up the meta in-game. Start date and timeEmma Frost infoPatch notesSkinsRanked changesJump to live coverage Over the last week or so, Developer NetEase has lifted the lid onthe next season ofMarvel Rivals. There's been a lot to digest, especially when looking into the changes coming toCompetitive Mode. As an avidMarvel Rivalsplayer, and one that's looking to main a new character in Season 2, I've been digging into the full patch notes, trying to predict who will rise above the rest in the coming weeks and months. It's regular changes to the game's meta that have keptMarvel Rivalsranked highly in ourbest PC games list, and make me particularly excited for the launch of a new season. If things go well, we could be looking at the bestMarvel Rivalsseason yet, especially as far as ranked play is concerned. After sinking over a hundred hours intoMarvel Rivalssince the start of the first season, I'm really looking forward to getting stuck into some new maps, and trying out some DPS Heroes, as I've tended to favor Vanguard up to this point. Still, I won't be abandoning my tank duties completely, as I'll definitely be giving Emma Frost a whirl for my first few matches. Still, there's a little while to go yet, and there's some downtime to expect before all of the new stuff launches inMarvel Rivals. Join me as I keep you up to date with all of the latest news and happenings in the lead-up to Season 2. I'll be providing live coverage that highlights the best details revealed so far, as well as some predictions for whereMarvel Rivalscould be headed with its ongoing focus on new Heroes and its new mutant-themed narrative. Here's what you need to know aboutMarvel RivalsSeason 2. Only have time for the basics? Here are the most important things to know aboutMarvel RivalsSeason 2: Marvel RivalsSeason 2's start time is April 11 at 1AM PDT / 4AM / 9AM BST / 10AM CET / 5PM JST. Hold your horses, however, as scheduled downtime will start an hour later, and it'll last 2-3 hours according to this Tweet. As such, I've estimated theMarvel RivalsSeason 2 start time to be the following depending on your timezone: The headline forMarvel RivalsSeason 2 is that Emma Frost is joining as a new Hero. She's a Vanguard with telekinetic abilities and diamond skin. From the developer breakdown (which you can view above), she certainly looks formidable, with an Ultimate that causes enemies to walk towards her. This is great for environmental kills as opponents walk straight off of edges and into pits. Emma Frost will launch alongside the new season, so players will be able to try her out right away. For those looking to dive deep on everything coming toMarvel Rivalsin Season 2, you're in luck! NetEase has release the full patch notes for the Season 2 update, which includes some detailed information on the buffs and nerfs coming to certain Heroes.You can read them here. Now that NetEase has revealed the trailer for the Flower of Krakoa Battle Pass that's set to arrive inMarvel RivalsSeason 2, we have a good look at some new skins coming to the game. There are 10 new costumes to unlock, including skins for Iron Fist, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Cloak and Dagger, Hulk, and Rocket. I'm personally looking forward to the classic X-Men skins for Psylocke and Magik, which feature that iconic blue and yellow costume we all know and love. It's consistent updates like these that have earned Marvel Rivals a place in ourbest free games list. As someone who mainly plays Competitive Mode inMarvel Rivals, it's exciting to see just how many changes are coming to ranked play this season. Firstly, there's a rank reset for everyone, kicking players down by nine tiers. Then, there are new ranked rewards to earn, including an Emma Frost skin for reaching Gold tier by the end of the season. Map rotation comes into play inMarvel RivalsSeason 2 as well, initially removing the Yggsgard and Tokyo 2099 maps, and adding the new Hellfire Gala: Krakoa Domination map. Bans will be available at Gold tier now, allowing players to remove certain Heroes from their opponents' pools. Lastly, your performance per game, and the number of points you gain or lose, will now be more weighted towards individual performance rather than match outcome. As a freelance games writer, it's my job to stay up to date with the latest games, especially live service titles likeMarvel Rivals. I've put hundreds of hours intoRivalssince launch, primarily gaining Venom, who I now have a Lord rank. Generally, I play Competitive Mode with a regular squad, hovering around the top of the Platinum tier. So far, I've mostly stuck to the Vanguard and Strategist Roles, so I'm interested to try out a DPS-focused set of characters come Season 2. Mr Fantastic is receiving some buffs, so hopefully he's more viable as I absolutely love playing as him. We'll have to wait and see. I’m going offline for a while now, but I’ll be jumping back online at 4AM ET / 1AM PT / 9AM BST to cover the launch ofMarvel RivalsSeason 2. At that point, we’ll be only an hour away from downtime, and a few hours from launch. Here’s the key info you’ll need to know about Season 2: For now, make the most of the remaining hours of Season 1.5. Complete any remaining missions, and unlock as much of the Battle Pass as you can. If you’ve completed it, you can still earn 100 Units in exchange for 1000 Chrono Tokens, so it’s worth playing a few more games and completing your weeklies. My personal highlights for season 1.5 have been very Venom-focused. No shock really, as a Lord Venom player, but that bright orange skin is fantastic, as is the, erm, emote. Elsewhere, The Thing has been a great addition to the game, managing to dominate games by keeping certain opponents grounded. Generally, this has been a decent season, with some great skins to unlock as part of the Battle Pass. Now that Season 1.5 is winding downtag us on Xwith what you're most excited for in Season 2! There’s still time to reach Gold Tier III and earn the Human Torch (Blood Blaze) costume before the end of Season 1.5. You only need to reach Gold once, and you’ll get the reward once Season 2 is live. If you’ve yet to play 10 Competitive matches in Season 1.5, you’ll need to do so, though don’t worry, if you achieved Gold in Season 1, it doesn’t matter where you settle after your 10 games. New color options will arrive for some of the more popular skins inMarvel Rivals. So far, we’ve only seen a new variant for the Psylocke - Vengeance skin, and for Luna Snow, but I think this is definitely a neat way to add a bit more customization to Heroes. NetEase has revealed that it plans to launch a new Hero every single month starting with Season 3. I have my concerns here, especially as the roster is already so packed. Balancing could be difficult, but we’ll have to wait and see how things will play out. The first Hero I’ll be looking at is Peni Parker, who is being described as “a Hero that’s struggling to find a broader place on the battlefield” by developers. She’ll be receiving a buff in Season 2, including enhancements to her primary attack damage efficiency and a boost to her survivability and combat capabilities. Her base health is being increased from 650 to 750, and her Cyber-Web Cluster can now Crit. It also won’t slow Peni Parker down as much as she fires. There’s set to be a bunch of buffs and nerfs coming to certain Heroes in Season 2 & Season 2.5 over time. There’s a really great developer insight video that I’ve embedded above that details the main changes to characters like Mr Fantastic and Doctor Strange. I’ll be going into detail on the Heroes that are being buffed and nerfed in the lead-up to the new season, but that video is a great place to get some context behind the changes, and the reasons why the developers are making them. The upcoming Season 2 patch forMarvel Rivalswill add a new experimental feature, and it’s good news for PC players running on lower-end hardware. NetEase has outlined anew Compilation Shader featurewhich aims to improve performance: “We recommend that players with 16GB of RAM or less, who have experienced significant FPS drops, frozen screens, or frequent crashes in previous seasons, consider activating this experimental feature. And remember, if you encounter any issues after enabling it, our support team stands ready to assist on this quest for an optimal gaming experience.” I’ve just been reading up on some of the changes coming to Team Ups and METALLIC CHAOS IS GONE. The absolute monster ability that equipped Magneto with a sword made of metal and chaos magic will be removed at the start of Season 2 and if you listen closely, you’ll hear Magneto mains around the world crying out in unison. It’s not all bad news though, as Magneto is getting a new Team Up with Emma Frost that gives him a holographic double, tricking foes and allowing him to survive for longer. With less than a day left of Season 1.5, you’ll want to spend any leftover battle pass Chrono Tokens, as they won’t carry over to the new Battle Pass. There’s also set to be a rank reset for Season 2, knocking all players down nine divisions. Time to lock in and climb as high as you can, so that your starting rank for next season is as high as possible. If you've purchased Chrono Tokens however, these will carry over. No for real though, what happened to Blade? Did he escape from his prison? Will he be added as a Hero anytime soon? Here’s hoping. Got a pal that you wanna treat this season? Well, there’s a new Gifting feature launching in Season 2. You’ll be able to purchase and send out items to friends, making Secret Santa exchanges and birthday presents a lot easier to buy for this year (I’d like a new Magik skin if any of my pals are reading). Scarlet Witch is getting a hefty buff in Season 2 with a new Team Up featuring Doctor Strange. She’s well worth trying out, especially for newcomers, as you’ll get to unlock and use the Chaos Gown skin just by playing nine matches. Nice! Welcome to Krakoa! The annual Hellfire Gala kicks off in Season 2, hosted by the glamorous Emma Frost. With the timelines in disarray, she’s gathering all of our Heroes for an event like no other. This season will center around the Gala, with Krakoa being the setting for a new Domination map. You’ll also notice Heroes receiving new skins where they’re positively dressed to the nines. A very fashion-forward affair indeed. Marvel Rivalsis free to play, but of course, there are a lot of new skins and cosmetics that you’ll need to pay for. Before we all jump in and buy the Battle Pass, however, it’s worth highlighting some free stuff that you can pick up in Season 2. Firstly there’s a new Emma Frost skin that you can earn by reaching Gold tier in Competitive Mode. Then there’s the Scarlet Witch Chaos Gown skin, which you just need to play nine matches in order to unlock. You’ll get a nameplate too. 💧 Watch your favorite Marvel Rivals streams and earn epic Twitch Drops including a spray, nameplate, emotes, and the stunning \"Will of Galacta\" costume for Namor!\n📅 Event Time:\n🕛 Starts: April 11, 12:00 PM UTC/5:00 AM PT/8:00 AM ET\n🕓 Ends: April 30, 11:59 PM UTC/4:59 PM… pic.twitter.com/7iDmYIXDfOApril 9, 2025 Finally, there’s a blue and pink Namor skin that can be earned as a Twitch Drop. Just stick on your favoriteMarvel RivalsTwitch streamer while you play, and after four hours the skin will be yours. Emma Frost is the headline Hero for Season 2 and fills the role of a Vanguard. By the looks of things, she’s an interesting mix of brawler and strategist, with the ability to place shields, blocking and absorbing damage away from her team. She also has a telekinetic blast that does impressive DPS. There’s a diamond skin mode that allows Emma Frost to get up close and personal, making use of a chokeslam/kick combo that looks wild. Definitely one to watch this season. Let’s kick things off with a look at when you’ll actually be able to jump into Season 2 and try out Emma Frost for yourself. Things are a bit complicated, but expect downtime to start on April 11 at 2AM PDT / 5AM / 10AM BST / 11AM CET / 6PM JST.

    "title": "Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti benchmark leak hints at performance boost over its predecessor – but it won’t matter if it doesn’t stay at retail price",
    "article_text": "Especially if there's no reference card... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're still awaiting an official announcement ofNvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti GPU, which has had several rumors and leaks crop up recently. However, a new leak has given us fresh insight into expectations regarding its performance. As highlighted byWccftech, a new Geekbench 6 leak indicates that the RTX 5060 Ti is up to 14% faster than its predecessor, the RTX 4060 Ti. These benchmarks were done in both OpenCL and Vulkan: the latter is a popular graphics rendering API used across several games, and the upcoming Blackwell GPU scored an impressive 140,147 points using it. As evident in the benchmark results, the RTX 4060 Ti scored 122,534 points in Vulkan, making its successor 13% faster - and while this may not be a significant margin, the new GPU ispurported to be the cheaper optionwith both 16GB and 8GB models. It's also worth noting that all RTX 5000 series GPUs have the advantage of Nvidia’s new Multi-Frame Generation over the previous gen, granting a better frame interpolation (additional AI-generated frames in between original rendered frames) experience. It certainly isn't perfect, especially withrecent driver complications, but the feature will come in handy for gamers once all is back in shape again. The rumored 16GB VRAM capacity may be a baffling one: the RTX 5070 (which is the higher tier GPU) offers 12GB of VRAM with a 192-bit memory bus, while the RTX 5060 Ti, is expected to have 16GB of VRAM with a 128-bit memory bus. It's total speculation, but the VRAM differences could be due to the memory bus differences, with the RTX 5070's 192-bit memory bus having much better memory bandwidth and therefore being able to manage with only 12GB of VRAM. However, none of these rumors will change the fact that theGPU market is arguably in its worst state ever. So, even if the RTX 5060 Ti ends up cheaper than its predecessor, there's no guarantee it will stay at retail price. Regardless of its potential performance leap over its previous gen counterpart, the price of the RTX 5060 Ti will be the dealbreaker for many budget gamers: I'm not only referring to its launch price - and I'm hoping the rumored $429 / around £330 / around AU$687 is accurate - but the price of third-party partner cards sold across multiple retailers. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Both Nvidia’s andAMD's new GPU lineups have been met with heavy scrutiny, asnearly none of these GPUs are available to purchase at retail price. This had been happening long beforeTrump's latest tariffscame into effect, due to low stock and high demand - so the chances of this trend continuing with the RTX 5060 Ti are very high. It may turn out to be far worse if Nvidia doesn't have a reference card planned for the new GPU: the RTX 5070 Ti notably doesn't have a Founders Edition model, which are cards that are designed and sold directly from Team Green, and it means consumers must rely on third-party retailers selling third-party models. A repeat of this is a potentially dangerous move in a GPU climate where scalpers and inflation are at their worst. We're supposedly a few weeks away from an official reveal and launch, so we may have our answers sooner rather than later… I just hope Nvidia doesn’t blow this one, because PC gamers are sorely in need of some sensibly-priced solutions.

    "title": "MicroSD Express vs microSD card: What's the difference?",
    "article_text": "It comes down to speed, price, and compatibility When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For about two decades, traditionalmicroSD cardswere the storage solution of choice for portable devices like mobile phones andhandheld consoles. However, the evolution of storage solutions has led to the development of microSD Express, an advancement over its predecessor. While microSD cards and microSD Express appear the same, their specifications and applications differ. You may be wondering why you haven’t heard about microSD Express – that’s because the technology is not only relatively new, but its adoption has been quite slow. microSD Express is an advanced version of microSD that uses PCIe and NVMe interfaces similar to high-end SSD storage solutions to achieve significantly faster transfer speeds of up to 985MB/s. This storage format was first released by the SD Association in 2019, and since then, several brands have developed cards with guaranteed minimum speeds of 150MB/s, 300MB/s, 450MB/s, or 600MB/s, as indicated by the “E” symbol on the card label. These cards, however, have not seen wide usage until recently, when Nintendo announced plans to use them for expanded storage in the upcomingSwitch 2. On the other hand, a microSD card is a small, removable storage device that has been widely used in smartphones, tablets, cameras, and gaming consoles. Originally launched in 2005, the format has evolved into SDHC, SDXC, and SDUC variants, with capacities up to 2TB. These cards use the SD interface and are classified based on speed. Most consumer devices today support UHS-I cards, with read speeds up to 100MB/s. Less common UHS-II and UHS-III cards can reach speeds of up to 300MB/s and 600MB/s, respectively. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The obvious advantage of microSD Express over microSD is transfer speed. Its interfaces enable faster write speeds, allowing for seamless recording and quicker file transfers. Another key benefit is reduced latency, thanks to NVMe technology. Unlike traditional microSD cards, which rely on older interfaces, microSD Express offers lower response times when accessing data. This leads to faster system responsiveness, especially when opening large files, running applications, or switching between stored media. One major drawback of microSD Express is its lack of full backward compatibility. If you use a microSD Express card in an older device with a traditional microSD slot, the transfer speed drops to UHS-I levels, which can be disappointing. In addition, devices made for microSD Express are exclusive, meaning regular microSD cards will not work in them. This compatibility issue is clear with the Nintendo Switch 2, which only supports microSD Express cards. Users now need to purchase new storage solutions, even if they have plenty of data on older microSD cards from previous Switch models. This shift has caused frustration among users who expected backward compatibility to be preserved. microSD Express cards are not designed for all use cases. If you mainly store regular photos and videos on mobile phones or cameras, a standard microSD card will do just fine. microSD Express shines in scenarios where high-speed data transfer is critical, with one key example being gaming. Games are data-intensive, and faster read/write speeds reduce load times, improve performance, and make gameplay smoother. This is likely a key reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 adopted microSD Express. Standard microSD cards often struggle with large files, leading to dropped frames or slow transfers when dealing with high data rates, such as4Kor8Kvideo. This makes microSD Express especially valuable for filmmakers and content creators. That all said, getting a microSD Express card isn’t easy. Few brands currently produce them, and availability may be limited in some regions. Also, because the technology is still developing and uses more advanced components, microSD Express cards tend to be more expensive. For example, a 1TB microSD Express card from Lexar costs around $200, while a standard 1TB microSD card from the same brand is priced under $70. Whether to switch to microSD Express depends on your needs and device compatibility. If your device requires it, like the Nintendo Switch 2, then upgrading is necessary. But if your device only supports standard microSD cards, there’s little benefit, as speeds will drop by almost 90%. That said, if low latency is a priority, it may still be worth considering. For general users who want affordable storage for smartphones, cameras, or other devices, traditional microSD cards remain a practical choice. Professionals working with high-speed applications, may find microSD Express to be a worthwhile investment. Portable computing devices, including laptops, tablets, and handheld gaming PCs, now use high-grade hardware and often rely on expandable storage for larger apps and media. For example, some mobile phones and cameras can now record in 8K, which puts a lot of pressure on storage performance. A one-minute 8K video can be as large as 20GB. Saving this to a regular microSD card could take around four minutes, while a microSD Express card could do it in about 30 seconds. That is a significant difference that could drive the adoption of microSD Express. Still, the future of microSD Express really depends on how many device manufacturers choose to support it. If more consoles, cameras, and portable devices integrate the format, prices may come down and the market could expand.

    "article_text": "Valve Deckard production is seemingly getting underway When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nearly six years since the launch of the smash hitValve Index, it appears theSteamteam is gearing up to start making the long-awaited standalone sequel according to new rumors. Codenamed theValve Deckardin leaks, the headset was initially believed to have a late 2025 release date, but details were few and far between, suggesting it might slip later. However, new details fromSadlyItsBradley– a source of several VR hardware leaks in the past – suggest that Valve could be steaming ahead with production, as the company has been importing the equipment needed to manufacture VR headset facial interfaces. Ina later postSadleyItsBradley pointed out that Valve has been receiving facial interface shipments since last year – suggesting that this new equipment may not just be to produce Deckard interfaces, but prototype designs for its next VR headset. Alternatively, this might be an attempt by Valve to avoid some of theincreased tariff coststhat US President Donald Trump has been horsing around with recently. FWIW, Valve also received pallet shipments of new facial interfaces (not machinery) since last year from the same companyThe machinery Valve recently received was probably* an injection moulder tweaked to focus on making future gaskets1/3 https://t.co/0qlgi2UcfD pic.twitter.com/D7YweQuRqJApril 10, 2025 Admittedly facial interfaces don’t tell us much about the headset itself, but given they're only used for devices like VR headsets and not anything else in Valve’s hardware line-up (such as aSteam Deck), Valve investing in their production suggests it has plans to make a new VR headset. And since the Valve Index reportedly exited production sometime last year (viaSadlyItsBradley, again) it’s unlikely these interfaces would be for its existing tech. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Beyond this latest rumor, other leaks are teasing something special, with Deckard said to not only be a standalone headset (like the Meta Quest 3) but alsoa wearable Steam Deckthat you can use for playing flat games. Just be prepared for it to be pricey. We’re talking around $1,200 (around £950 / AU$1,950), though this would include a few games in a bundle. This isn’t as cheap as a Meta Quest 3, but with Steam’s incredible software support the Valve Deckard could be a shoo-in for ourbest VR headsetslist. It’s worth remembering that all leaks should be taken with a pinch of salt, but with Valve Deckard it feels like where there’s smoke there's likely fire. We’ll just have to wait and see if that’s the case as we roll through 2025 and the rumored Deckard release date approaches.

In a follow-up to its May 2024 botnet takedown operation codenamed Operation Endgame, Europol said it made multiple arrests. The European law enforcement agency, together with a number of national partners, had shut down some of the biggestmalwaredroppers, including IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader, and Bumblebee. The operation spanned numerous countries and multiple continents.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Smokeloader is a pay-per-install malware loader, in which cybercriminals pay to use the service (which has already infected numerous devices) and drop their own malware. Europol said criminals used Smokeloader for keylogging, webcam access, ransomware deployment, cryptomining, and more. “Law enforcement tracked down the customers as they were registered in a database seized during Operation Endgame,” Europol explained, saying these people now faced “house searches, arrest warrants or ‘knock and talks’”. It did not discuss the number of people involved, but it did say that “several suspects” cooperated with the authorities by facilitating the examination of their digital devices. Several other suspects admitted to have resold the Smokeloader services at a markup. Just like in Operation Endgame, multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the follow-up, including the FBI, Secret Service, the DoD, DCIS, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Czech police, Danish police, French National Police, Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, Prosecutor General’s Office Frankfurt am Main – Cyber Crime Center, The Netherlands’ National Investigations and Special Operations, and The Netherlands Police.

    "article_text": "US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced a large-scale federal initiative aimed at identifying the factors behind what he called the“autism epidemic,”with findings expected by September 2025. Speaking during a televised Cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday, Kennedy – who has previously been accused by critics of promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines – said the new research effort would involve“hundreds of scientists from around the world.” “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures,”Kennedy promised. He stressed the urgency of the project, citing a sharp increase in childhood autism diagnoses over recent decades, rising from“one in 10,000 when I was a kid.” RFK Jr. just pledged: “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.”“The autism rate, the most recent numbers we think are about 1 in 31 … up from 1 in 10,000 when I was a kid.”“We’ve launched a massive research effort that’s gonna involve hundreds of…pic.twitter.com/Eq0pwHGYRg The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently estimate that 1 in 36 children in the US are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder – a rise often attributed to improved awareness and expanded diagnostic criteria. “That is a horrible statistic, isn’t it? There’s got to be something artificial out there that’s doing this,”Trump told Kennedy. “If you can come up with that answer – where you stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot – but something’s causing it,”Trump added. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) already invests over $300 million annually in autism research, primarily focusing on genetic factors and prenatal environmental influences. Kennedy did not elaborate on the scope of the new“massive testing and research effort”or what specific exposures might be targeted. Kennedy, the founder of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has gained prominence in the US for questioning the safety and effectiveness of childhood vaccinations and promoting the claim that vaccines are linked to autism – a theory widely rejected by the scientific community. He was also a vocal critic of the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 response measures, including lockdowns and the rapid rollout of experimental vaccines. Despite his controversial reputation, Kennedy denies being opposed to vaccination, noting that his own children are immunized. During his confirmation hearings, he stated that he advocates for stricter safety testing and more rigorous studies of vaccines. After Kennedy endorsed Trump’s campaign last year, the president vowed to give him broad authority over healthcare policy, saying he would let Kennedy“go wild.”",

    "title": "Only 6 Western states willing to deploy troops to Ukraine – AFP",
    "article_text": "Only six Western nations have pledged to send troops to Ukraine after the hostilities between Kiev and Moscow end, AFP has reported. Most of Ukraine’s supporters are reluctant to make any promises, according to the agency. The report comes after the latest meeting of defense ministers from the so-called“coalition of the willing”in Brussels on Thursday. The group of some 30 nations, predominantly composed of EU and NATO member states, appears to remain split on a potential deployment. Its members are questioning the goals and mandate of the proposed mission. Thus far, only six nations, including the UK, France, and the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have promised to contribute troops, the AFP reported, citing unnamed European officials. The sixth state in the group was not named by the agency. Britain, has insisted the coalition has actual plans to deploy, claiming that the troops would contribute to a“lasting peace”between Russia and Ukraine. “Our planning is real and substantial. Our plans are well developed,”UK defense minister John Healey told the meeting.“Our reassurance force for Ukraine would be a committed and credible security arrangement to ensure that any negotiated peace does bring what [US President Donald] Trump has pledged, a lasting peace for Ukraine,”he added. Other coalition members, however, have publicly expressed concerns about a potential mission, refusing to make any commitment before plans are more fleshed out. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the group must have the US on board, though Washington has repeatedly said it has no plans to send troops to Ukraine in any role. “What is the potential mission, what is going to be the goal?”Brekelmans wondered.“What is the mandate? What would we do in the different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?” Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson highlighted“a number of questions that we need to get clarified”before it could make any promises.“It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do - if we are peacekeeping, deterrence or reassurance,”he said. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against deploying troops to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to forces from any NATO countries ending up in the country. Last month, former Russian President and the deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the potential emergence of any NATO“peacekeepers”in Ukraine would mean a war between the bloc and Russia.",

    "article_text": "The Russian and US delegations at Thursday’s talks in Istanbul, Türkiye, mainly focused on the restoration of normal operations of their respective diplomatic missions, both sides have revealed. The closed-door talks lasted for more than five hours. The Russian team was led by Moscow's newly appointed ambassador to Washington, Aleksandr Darchiev, while US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Sonata Coulter headed the US delegation. Darchiev told reporters after the meeting that an“understanding has been reached[to pursue]further measures aimed at easing the movement of diplomats in the host country as well as related visa procedures,”as quoted by TASS. With respect to Russian diplomatic properties previously seized by the US, Moscow and Washington agreed to work out a road map. Darchiev called on his American colleagues to aim big when it comes to restoring bilateral ties, including the resumption of direct flights between the two countries. According to the statement, Moscow and Washington agreed to thrash out the proposals put forward in Istanbul on Thursday so that mutually acceptable solutions can be found by the next meeting. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow later announced that the Russian and US diplomats exchanged notes cementing their bilateral commitment to“facilitating uninterrupted banking and financial services for Russian and American diplomatic missions,”a position echoed by the US side. The US agreed to address Moscow’s financial contributions to the United Nations and other international organizations while Washington’s representatives also brought up the issue of policies prohibiting the US embassy in Moscow from hiring local staff. The State Department noted that the two sides had“discussed holding a follow-up meeting on these issues in the near term, as needed, with the date, location, and representation to be determined.” The last Russia-US consultations in Istanbul took place on February 27. Since assuming office in January, US President Donald Trump has engaged in active diplomacy with Russia, mounting a concerted diplomatic effort to end the Ukraine conflict. As a result, Washington and Moscow have gradually moved to restore bilateral contacts, which were effectively frozen under the administration of former US President Joe Biden.",

    "article_text": "Five UK Greenpeace activists have been arrested after pouring biodegradable“blood-red”dye into the pond outside the US embassy in London, the organization reported on Thursday. They were protesting against US arms sales to Israel amid the war in Gaza, it added. The group has stated that 12 activists transported containers labeled ‘Stop Arming Israel’ on bicycles with trailers disguised as delivery bikes. They emptied what they describe as non-toxic dye into the pond to symbolize the bloodshed in Gaza. “The red dye highlights the death and devastation caused in Gaza as a direct result of the US’ continued sale of weapons, ammunition and military hardware to Israel,”a statement on the organization’s website claims. Greenpeace co-executive director Will McCallum was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause criminal damage, an offense that carries a maximum prison sentence of ten years, The Guardian reported. The other four activists were reportedly detained on similar charges. The Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrests and clarified that no security perimeters had been breached during the protest.“Five people have so far been arrested nearby on suspicion of criminal damage and conspiracy to cause criminal damage,”they told the outlet. UK Greenpeace activists have turned the US Embassy red in London for their complicity in the genocide in Gaza.pic.twitter.com/XNBtKlAyC6 “We took this action because US weapons continue to fuel an indiscriminate war,”Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, told The Guardian. She cited the destruction of schools, hospitals, and entire neighborhoods in Gaza. She added that“tens of thousands of Palestinian lives [have been] obliterated,”and stressed that as Israel’s largest arms supplier, the US government“bears a heavy responsibility for the horrors unfolding.” Greenpeace has urged both the UK and US governments to implement a total arms embargo on Israel. The organization contends that US weapons contribute to civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. The protest was organized as part of a broader campaign highlighting the humanitarian impact of Israel’s military operations in Gaza, which have resulted in over 50,000 deaths, according to the local authorities. Israel invaded Gaza following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack that killed around 1,200 people.",

    "title": "CIA files reveal secret search for Hitler in 1950s",
    "article_text": "The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted a secret search for Adolf Hitler in South America for a decade after his supposed death, according to declassified files. The documents, dating from 1945 to 1955 and released by the CIA in recent years, were analyzed by the Washington Post this week. They show that field agents suspected Hitler may have escaped to South America under an alias, even though the agency had an autopsy report confirming his death. According to MI5files, Hitler and his longtime companion Eva Braun, whom he had married the day before, killed themselves on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker to avoid capture. Their partially burned bodies were later discovered by Soviet soldiers outside the Reich Chancellery. Yet CIA agents continued to chase leads into the mid-1950s. One 1945filesaid US War Department agents told the FBI that a spa hotel in La Falda, Argentina, had been prepared as a potential hideout. The hotel’s owners, who had donated to propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, had close ties to Hitler. US intelligence believed they had made“all necessary”preparations to shelter Hitler after Germany’s defeat in WWII. Anotherdocumentfrom October 1955 included a photo of a man believed to be Hitler sitting with a friend in Colombia. The man, using the name Adolf Schrittelmayor, reportedly left Colombia for Argentina in January 1955. The CIA briefly authorized an investigation into Schrittelmayor’s background but later dropped it, noting that“enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete.” No further CIA documents made public suggest that agents continued searching for Hitler after 1955, the WaPo reported. The revelations come as Argentina – long known as a hideout for Nazi fugitives – prepares to declassify government documents related to those who found sanctuary there after WWII. As many as 10,000 war criminals are believed to have used so-called ‘ratlines’ to escape Europe. Roughly half reportedly settled in Argentina, which was known for its reluctance to grant extradition requests. Among them were Adolf Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust, and Josef Mengele, the notorious Auschwitz doctor. Eichmann was captured by Israeli agents in 1960 and taken to Israel for trial. Mengele evaded capture and died in Brazil in 1979 after suffering a heart attack while swimming.",

    "title": "Lessons Trump could learn from the last Soviet leader",
    "article_text": "The Great Trump Toddler Tariff Tantrum that we have all been living through is so very Trump – blunt like a baseball bat,burn-it-down-first-figure-out-the-consequences-laterreckless, and attention-grabbing like Kim Kardashian – that it is easy to forget that Donald Trump is merely human, too. The now 47th US president has an extraordinary gift for occupying center stage. Yet, as Karl Marx wrote almost two hundred years ago with reference to France’s Napoleon III, another bigger-than-life“global disrupter”leading his country into a fiasco,“men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please […] but under circumstances existing already.” And if the co-founder of“scientific Communism”isn’t your thing, take it from the other side: Arch billionaire capitalist and creator of the world’s largest hedge fundRay Daliois warning us that the current tariff brouhaha, fundamentally driven by Trump’s crude ideasabout how to re-industrialize the US, is obscuring what is really at stake: namely, a“once-in-a-lifetime event”: a“classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” Yet collapse is only half the picture. We are also witnessing historic transformation on a global scale: yes, the old world order of so-called“liberal hegemony”– that is, really, US“primacy”– is tottering and crumbling. But it is also already being replaced by emerging multipolarity. With American politics simultaneously, according to Dalio again,“fraying”at home, conditions are“ripe for radical policy changes and unpredictable disruption.” And hasn’t Trump made good on that? Before his subsequentU-turnand suspension (not yet canceling) of his“Liberation Day”tariff blitz, accumulated 2025 US import tariffs were scheduled to growhigher than ever since 1909. Rapid subsequent US stock market cratering alone wiped out well over $5 trillion – as if, to quote the Communist Manifesto, melting into the air. A post-U-turn rally thenrecovered some of the losses. Yet, whichever way you look at it:“Radical policy changes”and“unpredictable disruption”indeed. Now – after what the Trump team tries to sell as the president’s brilliant pressure tactics and an analyst has called Trump’s“capitulation to the markets”(except regarding China) – even if Trump may end up negotiating away some or many of his tariff hikes, great damage has been done to Washington’s already shoddy standing and credibility: Because it has once more displayed the staggering irresponsibility, stunning shortsightedness, and sheer incompetence that make living on the same planet with the self-appointed“indispensable nation”so painful for the rest of us, and this lesson will not be forgotten. Yet the bigger point is that – with his giant ego, lovingly cultivated idiosyncrasies, and Freudian-sized Sharpie signatures – Trump remains locked into his time and place even more firmly than he can cage migrants in El Salvador. And his time is one of America never going to be great again. Like a late-Roman emperor, Trump is trying to stop and reverse history itself. Little wonder thatsome specialists on Roman history see parallelsbetween his tariff storm and that ancient empire of relentless aggression, ruthless exploitation, and, finally, decadent perversion, decline, and fall. But, like those stubborn Roman emperors, Trump cannot succeed. It does not matter whether he himself politically survives the brutal toll his tariff offensive will impose on the American home front: Before Trump’s U-turn/capitulation, the Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University, had estimated that toll at, on average,3,800 dollars per householdannually. It may or may not turn out less catastrophic in the end, but there is no reason to assume it will be negligible. This may cost Trump’s Republican Party the midterms in 18 months. It may also cost Trump his whole political career, his unconstitutional dreams of a third term included. For even if he were able to re-industrialize America with his simplistic and misguided methods, it would, of course, take years, if not decades. And it would not, as he suggests, produce an abundance of jobs – and certainly not well-paying ones – because job losses have been due more to automation than to off-shoring. Meanwhile, the self-hobbling US is also supposed to do all of the following, at least: First, fight an escalating economic – and not necessarily only – war againsta cohesive, patriotic, and internationally well-connected China that is not ceding ground but retaliating in kindand also hasthe difficult but devastating option of dumpingits humungous holdings of American government debt. Second, wage the usual catastrophic wars in the Middle East to please Israel and American Zionists, with Iran currently in Washington’s sight. Third, cajole or conquer its neighborhood, including Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal, as a minimum. And, fourth, in general keep spending as if there’s no tomorrow on its already insanely expensive, bloated overkill forces – yes, that would be the same onesthat cannot defeat Yemen(at a price tag of, at least, a coolbillion, and counting) and are just losing their proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. Just now, Trump has announced a new annual military budget“in the vicinity”of one trillion dollars, or, in the original Trumpese“the biggest one we’ve ever done for the military.” But, in reality, Trump’s attempt to recreate a mid-twentieth-century industrial-manufacturing base in the 21st-century US is quixotic anyhow. And vaguely reminiscent not of ancient Rome but of a large, powerful state much more recently deceased and also often called an empire. It was the late Soviet Union about which Cold War Westerners liked to joke that it had the most impressive early-twentieth-century industry on the planet. That was, of course, an absurd and mean exaggeration – no one built satellites and intercontinental missiles in the first half of the twentieth century, for one thing. But it is true that one weakness that brought down the Soviet Union was clinging to an outdated and always insufficiently modernized economic structure skewed toward heavy industry. Curiously enough, there are other aspects of Trump’s second presidency that bring the Soviets to mind, in particular the one-and-a-half decade between, roughly 1985 and 2000, that is the period of the Soviet collapse and its long, extremely painful reverberations. For one thing, there is Trump’s perverse sense of imperial grievance. In reality, for decades the US has profited massively, economically and politically, from its position at the center of its own empire, including what a French finance minister once called the“exorbitant privilege”of the dollar, that is, a unique ability to live on virtually unlimited credit. And yet here is an American president who cannot stop whining about how everyone else is“ripping off”of his poor, downtrodden country. And to top off the absurdity, that president also happens to be a billionaire business clan leader raking in money around the globe. Meanwhile, Trump’s bad habit of believing his own demagoguerymakes him mistake any trade deficit for evidence of a raw deal; and hisoddly pinpoint forgetfulness makes him simply overlook American trade surpluses in services. A disruptive, charismatic, rabble-rousing politician presenting the dominant core of an empire as the victim of exploitation by its peripheries? A natural-born populist – with an occasional dancing habit – resorting to a nationalist appeal fusing crude economic quarter-truths with widespread resentment at declining living standards and life chances? That description would also fit Boris Yeltsin, of course, the man who first exploited late-Soviet Russian frustrations to deliver the death blow to the Soviet Union and then misruled what was left through the dark and dismal 1990s. Or consider the curious fact that, among other things, Trump triggered a massive wipe-out specifically of wealth held in stocks. But that kind of wealth is anything but evenly distributed among Americans. Bloomberg even goes so far to speak of an“American investor class — that top 10% that owns almost all of the stocks.” Make no mistake: Trump’s tariff shock is already hittingall other Americansas well – through rising prices, declining retirement funds, reduced labor income and, soon, lost jobs. Indeed, as an American, the harder you already have it, the worse the Trump’s brutalist economics will harm you. That’s because, tariffs are, in effect, a kind of tax on the domestic population, too,“burden[ing] households at the bottom of the income ladder more than those at the top as a share of income.” In other words, if you are already poor, these tariffs – to one extent or the other – will make you even poorer; if you are teetering on the brink of poverty, they are likely to push you over into full destitution. And that means large numbers of Americans will be hit severely: According to a Congressional Research Service paper,as of 2023 between 11.1 and 12.9 percent (almost 37 to nearly 42 million) were already in full-blown poverty(depending on which oftwo US Census Bureau definitionsis applied).15 millionof them were enduring an inner circle of hell by the name of“deep poverty.” Andyet another 15 percent of Americans (or almost 50 million)are still just above the poverty line but precariously close to it. All in all, more than a quarter of the American population is either poor or almost poor. And they are all going to suffer especially badly from Trump’s wrecking ball policies. Sorry, ordinary Americans: With all his populist braggadocio, this president is not your friend. And he’ll cost you. A lot. And yet, it was also striking to see how Trump’s“Liberation Day”impacted Bloomberg’s“investor class”and in particular the even narrower circle of the rich and super-rich. After the tariff blitz, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg taken together, for instance, lost an estimated$42.6 billion– in one day. That does not really hurt them, and they may generate more wealth soon, through no discernible effort of action of their own, as so often. But even if they do, here as well there is a lesson that will remain: namely that America’s oligarchs, with all their ostentatious finance power which allows them to corrupt and bend politics, are not invulnerable but, when push comes to shove, also depend on one man at the top. Of course, the above cannot be compared to the taming of the Russian oligarchs gone feral in the 1990s, which was a necessary, healthy stage in Russia’s recovery from the Soviet collapse. And yet, fragile as the analogy may be, there it is: around the end of empire no one is entirely safe, not even the richest. And then, there is the final and greatest irony of empire’s end: It may be hard to see at first glance, but there is a fatal similarity between the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev and Donald Trump as 47th president of the US. They were different in ideology, personal ethics, temperament, and style. Gorbachev was, for one thing, what Trump only claims to be – a peacemaker. The last Soviet leader was so smugly naïve toward the West that he greatly damaged his own country in the process, but he did play the single most important role in ending the first Cold War, which, otherwise, could well have ended with World War III. Trump, by contrast, is failing to end the Western proxy war in Ukraine while co-perpetrating the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians as criminally as his predecessor Joe Biden. Moreover, one reason for his abrupt change of course on tariffs may well be that Netanyahu and friends have ordered him to get the US shipshape for attacking Iran on Israel’s behalf. And yet, Gorbachev and Trump do have one fundamental trait in common: trying to save and make great again a proud superpower in deep crisis. Trump may not end up having to preside over the full, official demise of his country, as Gorbachev tragically did. Yet, just like Gorbachev in that one respect, history will remember Trump as a would-be“reformer”whose policies of change only hastened the decline he tried to fend off.",

    "title": "White House admits ignoring reporters who use gender pronouns",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump refuses to engage with reporters who list their gender pronouns in their email signatures, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt and other senior officials have confirmed. Such an approach towards pronoun-using reporters, rumored to be in place since the early days of Trump’s second term in office, was confirmed as an official policy by the White House on Wednesday, when an inquiry on the matter was made by multiple media outlets. Leavitt confirmed the White House does not trust such journalists and is less likely to respond to their emails. “Any reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,”Leavitt told the Washington Post in a statement. The press secretary did not respond to follow-up questions on when exactly the policy was enacted and whether it applies to all correspondence between reporters and other White House officials outside the presidential press service, WaPo noted. The spurning of reporters who list their pronouns appears to be part of a broader government policy that extends beyond the White House press service. For instance, a Department of Government Efficiency adviser, Katie Miller, gave a similar response to a reporter with the New York Times, stating that she does not“respond to people who use pronouns in their signatures as it shows they ignore scientific realities and therefore ignore facts.” “This applies to all reporters who have pronouns in their signature,”she said, as quoted by the outlet. The Trump administration took sweeping action aimed at dismantling gender and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs shortly after the president assumed office back in January. Employees of multiple government agencies reportedly received notices requesting that they remove pronouns from their email signatures. Trump has taken various actions against DEI, banning“radical gender ideology”in the military in an executive order and stating that service should be limited only to those mentally and physically fit. Another order banned trans women from female sports, while the policy of recognizing only two sexes has been adopted federally. The actions of the new US administration have been met with several legal challenges, with civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates condemning the policy changes as discriminatory.",

    "title": "EU divided over Russian asset seizure – Kremlin",
    "article_text": "The Kremlin is aware of divisions within the EU over the fate of frozen Russian assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Some members of the bloc are opposed to seizing the funds, citing legal risks. An estimated $300 billion worth of Russian sovereign assets was frozen by the West following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around €200 billion ($209 billion) of this is held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based clearing house. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has repeatedly called for the funds to be tapped for Ukraine’s reconstruction. This week, Kallas acknowledged that some member states still oppose the move, but did not specify which ones. Peskov told journalists on Thursday that Moscow is“aware that indeed some countries do not support such an approach, as they understand the inevitable legal consequences of such actions.” The Kremlin has condemned the freezing of its assets and warned that seizing them would amount to“theft,”hinting at possible retaliatory measures against Western investments in Russia. The frozen funds have already accrued billions of euros in interest, with Euroclear transferring €1.55 billion to Kiev last July to back a $50 billion loan for Ukraine provided by the G7. Some EU members, notably the Baltic and Nordic states, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, have pushed for the immediate transfer of the frozen funds to Kiev. Others, however – including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – have been more cautious, citing legal concerns and arguing that the funds should be kept as leverage. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has warned that confiscating Russian assets would be considered“an act of war”and could provoke a response from Moscow. Other EU officials have also raised concerns that seizing the assets without a legal basis could set a dangerous precedent and alarm global investors. The International Monetary Fund has warned that appropriating the funds without a clear legal basis could undermine global confidence in Western financial institutions.",

    "title": "‘Some states’ opposed to using frozen Russian assets – EU’s top diplomat",
    "article_text": "Several EU member states are“strongly opposed”to handing Russian assets frozen by the bloc over to increase military support for Ukraine, foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has admitted. The objections to the proposed move, which Kallas supports, are based on legal concerns and financial risks. Western countries froze around $300 billion in Russian sovereign and state-linked assets following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, with the bulk under EU jurisdiction. Brussels has since been exploring ways to use them to benefit Kiev, including by giving Ukraine the interest earned on the assets. Moscow has strongly condemned these efforts, calling them“theft.” In an interview with Estonian state broadcaster ERR on Thursday, Kallas said that the bloc’s members are still in talks on the issue.“We’re getting ready, as there are certain risks involved and we need to find ways to mitigate those risks. Plus, some states are strongly opposed to it,”she said. When asked which countries are opposed, Kallas declined.“I can’t start naming names… it is not very difficult to figure out,”she said. The diplomat noted that countries holding large portions of the frozen assets face greater risks.“For example, take Belgium… they hold most of the assets. As a result, they feel their risk exposure is the highest.” The proposal to use Russian assets to help Ukraine has faced significant opposition within the EU, with heavyweights such as France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Austria warning of potential legal repercussions of an outright confiscation. Meanwhile, Hungary and Slovakia have warned that such a move could escalate the conflict and undermine regional stability. Responding to Kallas’ comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that“Russia will never renounce its rights to its own assets and will not stop defending them”. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova remarked that Kallas’s interview presents“a unique opportunity to analyze a crime not after its commission, but at the moment of its planning.”",

    "title": "US to screen migrants for anti-Semitic posts",
    "article_text": "The US immigration will review applicants’ social media accounts and deny visas or residency to individuals who post content the US President Donald Trump administration deems anti-Semitic, according to an announcement the agency made on Wednesday. Immigration agents can use social media posts interpreted as supporting“anti-Semitic terrorism”to deny applications for student visas or green cards, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Posts considered anti-Semitic will include social media activity expressing support for militant groups designated as terrorist organizations by the US, such as Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and Yemen’s Houthi, USCIS said in a statement on Wednesday. The agency“ will consider social media content that indicates an alien endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting anti-Semitic terrorism, anti-Semitic terrorist organizations, or other anti-Semitic activity as a negative factor”in determining immigration benefits, the statement said. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said that“there is no room”for the US to take in“the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers,”adding that“we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here.” She added that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has made it clear that anyone who believes they can come to the US and invoke the First Amendment – the constitutional protection of free speech – to justify advocating anti-Semitic violence or terrorism is mistaken.“Think again. You are not welcome here,”McLaughlin said. The policy takes effect immediately and applies to both student visas and applications for permanent resident“green cards”to stay in the US. Trump campaigned last year on promises to tighten immigration policy and reverse what he viewed as his predecessor Joe Biden’s lenient approach to the issue. Since taking office in January, Trump has expanded the expedited removal of illegal immigrants and denied federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. He has declared a national emergency, thus allowing the deployment of the armed forces to secure the border. His administration is expanding detention facilities to hold up to 30,000 migrants. The Trump administration has already targeted foreign students participating in anti-Israel protests on US college campuses as part of its broader deportation efforts, dispatching immigration agents to detain them. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late last month that he had stripped roughly 300 international students of their visas, and was doing so on a daily basis. The crackdown follows a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that erupted last year at universities across the US, during which students demanded an end to Washington’s support for Israel amid the war in Gaza. The US administration has also cut millions of dollars in federal funding to leading universities, including Harvard and Columbia, accusing them of failing to adequately address anti-Semitism during the campus protests over the Gaza war.",

    "title": "EU puts US counter-tariffs on hold",
    "article_text": "The EU has suspended the imposition of counter-tariffs on American imports, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced. The move follows US President Donald Trump’s decision to pause increased tariffs for three months while negotiations take place. In a post on X on Thursday, von der Leyen said the EU“took note of the announcement by President Trump”and wants to“give negotiations a chance.” “While finalizing the adoption of the EU countermeasures that saw strong support from our Member States, we will put them on hold for 90 days,”she stated. According to von der Leyen, the bloc will not hesitate to go ahead with counter-tariffs if the negotiations with the US fail. In a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump announced a“90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%.” He claimed that“more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR[Office of the United States Trade Representative]to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs.” According to the US president, these nations have refrained from retaliating against the tariffs his administration previously placed on them. That same day, EU member states approved retaliatory measures to the 25% tariffs imposed last month by the US on the bloc’s steel and aluminum, effective April 15. The counter-tariffs do not address the more recent 20% US tariffs on all EU exports that took effect on Wednesday and have since been paused. While Brussels did not specify the list of targeted goods or tariff levels, media outlets have reported that tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% would cover a wide array of US goods, including poultry, grains, clothing, and metals. Last week, Trump announced sweeping tariffs targeting numerous countries across the world, citing the need to restore global trade fairness and accusing other nations of“ripping off”the US. The move sent shockwaves across global stock markets, though they have rebounded since Trump announced the pause on Wednesday.",

    "article_text": "The incoming German government, set to be led by Friedrich Merz, aims to increase the strength of the armed forces without resorting to mandatory conscription, the conservative politician has said. He shared his plans as the EU aims to spend hundreds of billions of euros on a large-scale militarization program. Merz is set to become the next chancellor, following successful coalition talks this week between his Christian Democratic Union (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). A significant part of their agreement focuses on reforming the German military under the current defense minister, Boris Pistorius. “We will initially strengthen our armed forces on the basis of voluntary service,”Merz said at a press conference on Wednesday.“We hope that with enough volunteers, we will achieve the Bundeswehr’s expansion target.” The German Armed Forces have faced recruitment challenges for years, with personnel shortfalls reaching a staggering 28% at the end of 2024. Pistorius has argued for the reinstatement of compulsory service, but no such measure was included in the major reforms he announced last April. Merz said coalition members have agreed to further increase military spending. Regarding the manpower situation, he mentioned the potential adoption of the ‘Swedish model’, which is being considered by several NATO countries experiencing difficulties in volunteer recruitment. In 2017, Sweden reintroduced mandatory conscription after suspending it seven years earlier. The current system involves screening over 100,000 18-year-olds of both sexes annually, drafting less than 10% deemed the most capable. In 2019, three Swedish men became the first to face jail time for evading the draft. The EU has outlined plans for broad militarization, potentially costing up to €800 billion ($880 billion) in loans over four years, citing the need to prepare for a potential conflict with Russia. Though Moscow views NATO as hostile and expansionist, it denies having any intentions of attacking NATO member states.",

    "article_text": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has claimed that the EU would be“cutting its own throat”if it seeks a closer alliance with China while loosening ties with Washington. Bessent commented on Wednesday after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had called for a reassessment of the EU’s trade relationship with Beijing earlier in the day. Sanchez told reporters during a diplomatic trip to Asia that the EU could benefit from closer cooperation with China amid uncertainty surrounding US trade policies and President Donald Trump’s recent moves to hike tariffs for nearly all trade partners. “Nobody wins with a trade war. Every country loses,”Sanchez warned. Bessent defended Trump’s tariff moves and urged partners not to side with Beijing, claiming that its trade policies are ruinous to the global economy. “The economic minister in Spain made some comments this morning, ‘Oh, well, maybe we should align ourselves more with China,’ – that would be cutting your own throat,”Bessent stated at a press briefing.“These Chinese exports that the US tariff wall is gonna keep out… the Chinese business model… it never stops. They just keep producing and producing and dumping and dumping.” Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for 75 countries, which he had earlier hit with duties ranging from 10% to 50% over what he called unfair trade imbalances, and lowered duties to a flat 10% rate on everyone except Beijing. Instead, he slapped China with a further hike to 125%, accusing Beijing of escalation after it raised tariffs on US goods to 84%. “In terms of escalation, unfortunately, the biggest offender in the global trading system is China, and they’re the only country who’s escalated,”Bessent claimed. The Treasury chief said many countries are now seeking negotiations with Washington following the tariff changes, noting upcoming talks with Japan and Vietnam. He also said he hopes to finalize new trade deals with US allies to create a united front against what he called China’s unbalanced trade structure. China has vehementlyopposedthe tariffs and vowed to fight them. On Wednesday, the Chinese Finance Ministry called the latest US hikes a“mistake on top of a mistake”that“infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system.”",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal on the sale of TikTok’s US operations to American investors, despite the escalating tariffs on Chinese imports. TikTok, a popular short-form video platform owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny from US lawmakers over national security concerns. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said an agreement is“very much on the table.” The US formally implemented the increased tariffs on Chinese imports this week, marking the highest rate yet in the ongoing trade dispute. In an effort to ease tensions with other trading partners, Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for 185 countries, temporarily lowering them to 10%. However, tariffs on Chinese goods remain at an elevated rate of 125%. In response, China has increased tariffs on US imports to 84% and blacklisted 11 American companies, further escalating the trade dispute. “Obviously, I would say right now China is not exactly thrilled about signing it,”Trump said.“We have a deal with some very good people, some very rich companies that would do a great job with it, but we’re going to have to wait and see what’s going to happen with China,”he told reporters.“It’s on the table very much. I think China’s going to want to do it, actually.” Last week, Trump acknowledged that China might be reluctant to move forward with the TikTok agreement due to the latest tariff increases. He suggested, however, that a reduction in tariffs could expedite approval of the deal, saying China would agree“in 15 minutes”if these concessions were made. The proposed plan would reportedly restructure TikTok’s US operations into a new American-based company, majority-owned and controlled by US investors. On Friday Trump signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to secure a US-based buyer, postponing the potential ban. The extension marks the second delay in TikTok’s divest-or-ban deadline, originally set for April, 5. The initial extension was granted when Trump first entered office in January. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Ed Markey criticized the extension, saying Trump lacks the legal authority to grant it. On Wednesday, Markey attempted to pass a bill to move the deadline to October, but the effort was blocked. China has said that any agreement over TikTok must comply with its laws and that Beijing opposes moves that violate market principles and harm legitimate business interests.",

    "title": "Russia seeks removal of ‘toxic legacy’ in latest talks with US (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "Diplomatic delegations from Russia and the US have concluded closed-door talks in Istanbul, Türkiye, which were designed to pave the way for normalizing bilateral relations. The negotiations lasted more than five hours. The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s newly appointed ambassador to Washington, Aleksandr Darchiev, while US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Sonata Coulter headed the US presence. Prior to the talks, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed that the sides were focused on“eliminating numerous obstacles, including technical ones, that complicate diplomatic operations.” According to Ambassador Darchiev, Moscow seeks the removal of“the toxic legacy of the previous American administration.”In particular, he noted the need for a“serious conversation”about the return of diplomatic properties seized by the US –“a key condition”for returning to normalized bilateral relations. Visa and financial restrictions, freedom of movement for diplomats, form what Darchiev described as“a tight knot of problems.” “Now the Russian and American delegations are working together to untangle it,”he said. A short clip released by Russian media on Thursday showed a minibus arriving at the gates of the Russian Consulate General in Istanbul. US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told media ahead of the meeting that“these talks are solely focused on our embassy operations, not on normalizing a bilateral relationship overall, which can only happen, as we've noted, once there is peace between Russia and Ukraine.” According to Bruce, the two parties do not intend to discuss any political or security issues, or the Ukraine conflict. The new talks come after US President Donald Trump engaged in active diplomacy with Russia, including a concerted diplomatic attempt to settle the Ukraine conflict. As a result, Washington and Moscow have gradually moved to restore contacts that were virtually non-existent for approximately three years under the administration of former US President Joe Biden.",

    "title": "US ‘just lost a war with Russia’ – Tucker Carlson",
    "article_text": "American policymakers are too arrogant to acknowledge that they have“lost a war with Russia”over Ukraine, US journalist Tucker Carlson has said. Russian officials perceive the Ukraine conflict as a NATO proxy war – a notion that some Western politicians, including US Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand former British Prime MinisterBoris Johnson, have openly agreed with. In an interview with Alex Jones published on Wednesday, Carlson accused those perpetuating the hostilities of ignoring that Russia has emerged victorious. ”We just lost a war with Russia,”the former Fox News host declared.“The US was running that war – the US military, the Pentagon, State Department, CIA – running the war against Russia. It was not… was never about Ukraine.” Carlson expressed concern that“nobody will say that out loud – that we’re overstating our power.”He likened the US to a divorced 60-year-old man attempting to woo a 25-year-old woman, oblivious to how absurd and humiliating he appears. Tucker Carlson on the reasons for the conflict in Ukraine:\"We just lost a war with Russia. The US was waging this war. The military, the State Department, the CIA, and the Pentagon are fighting a war against Russia.This was never about Ukraine. No one in Washington cares about…pic.twitter.com/iRCBPOnAnR “That’s called hubris and that’s how empires get destroyed and populations vaporized,”Carlson warned.“Maybe we should readjust our expectations a little bit.” Jones argued that many advocating for unconditional support of Kiev are“militarily ignorant,”mentioning actor Sean Penn’s dismissal of nuclear escalation risks with Russia. He emphasized that the scenario of major nuclear conflict is termed ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’ for a reason. In response, Carlson referenced a Pentagon assessment indicating that at one point the risk of the Ukraine conflict escalating to nuclear war reached 50%, arguing that any policymaker comfortable with such odds belongs“in prison for the criminally insane.” Senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have publicly asserted that Moscow will employ all tools at its disposal against what it perceives as an existential threat. Ukraine and its Western supporters have dismissed the Russian leader’s statements as“nuclear blackmail.”",

    "title": "Trump says he could pull US troops out of Europe",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has indicated he would consider pulling American forces out of Europe if Washington’s NATO allies in the region do not pay more as part of broader negotiations over his sweeping tariff policy. NBC News reported on Tuesday that the US is considering withdrawing up to 10,000 troops from Eastern Europe. Sources noted that while the exact figure is still under discussion, the proposal could affect American forces stationed in Romania and Poland – two NATO members close to the Russian border. Asked on Wednesday whether he has plans to reduce the number of US troops in Europe or other NATO countries, Trump did not rule out the possibility. “Well, I could. I mean, it depends. We pay for military over in Europe. We don’t get reimbursed by much,”Trump told reporters at the White House. It would be one of the things we discuss. That’s unrelated to trade, but I think we’ll make it part of it because it makes sense. [It would be] nice to wrap it all up in one package for each country. You know, it’s nice and clean. As of early 2025, there were nearly 84,000 US troops stationed in Europe, with the largest concentrations in Germany and Poland, and smaller deployments in Romania, Estonia, and Lithuania, according to US European Command. NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, warned on Tuesday against reducing the forces the Pentagon had“surged forward”under former President Joe Biden following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. “It’s my advice to maintain that force posture as it is now,”Cavoli told a House Armed Services Committee hearing. In response, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that“the only person that will make a determination about force structure of US troops in Europe will be President Trump, the commander-in-chief.” “And we will continue to have ongoing discussions, including inside the context of Ukraine-Russia negotiations, about what our force posture should be on the continent – a posture that best addresses American interests and ensures burden sharing in Europe as well,”he added. The US is NATO’s largest financial contributor, and Trump has repeatedly criticized the bloc’s European members for failing to meet defense spending targets. The discussions about potential troop reductions come as the Trump administration continues to pressure European allies to take more responsibility for their own defense. Russia has repeatedly expressed strong concern about NATO expansion and the bloc’s military activities near its borders. After Washington entered talks with Moscow aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict and restoring bilateral relations, Russia welcomed what it called a willingness by the US to explore the“root causes”of the crisis – including Kiev’s aspirations to join NATO.",

    "title": "US has secret weapons – Trump",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has boasted about US military power and weapons that“nobody has any idea”about, in response to concerns that his tariff war with China could spiral out of control. Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% on Wednesday, in retaliation for countermeasures imposed by Beijing. China has yet to respond to the latest hike, though the Ministry of Commerce previously vowed to fight the trade war“to the end.” Asked whether he was concerned about Beijing’s next moves – and a potential“escalation beyond the trade war”– Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping is“one of the very smart people of the world”who would never“allow that to happen.” “We’re very powerful. This country is very powerful. It’s far more powerful than people understand. We have weaponry that nobody has any idea what it is, and it is the most powerful weapons in the world that we have. More powerful than anybody even, not even close,”he told journalists in the Oval Office. “So nobody’s going to do that,”Trump added, reiterating that Xi is a“very smart man”who“knows exactly what has to be done.” The US president, who has previously teased secret weapons using unusual scientific terminology, did not elaborate on the kind of weapons he was referring to this time. In 2020, Trump touted what he called a“super duper missile”that could fly“17 times faster”than anything America’s adversaries had in their arsenals. He also claimed that Russia’s hypersonic technological breakthroughs resulted from stealing US missile plans during the presidency of Barack Obama – despite the fact that the US has yet to field an operational hypersonic weapon. Moscow and Beijing have pulled ahead in the race to develop hypersonic weapons over the past decade. Russia put its first system of the kind, the air-launched Kinzhal missile, into service in 2017. China rolled out its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle two years later. Russia has used both the Kinzhal and the naval Zircon hypersonic missile during the Ukraine conflict. Last November, Moscow also carried out the first combat test of its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, fitted with multiple independently targetable warheads capable of hypersonic speeds. In December, after multiple delays and failed tests, Washington announced the successful test launch of its Long Range Hypersonic Weapon, which has been developed by Lockheed Martin since 2017. The UShopesto equip the first unit with a ground-launched version of the missile this year.",

    "article_text": "Kit Connorloves Carhartt. Back in 2023, the British actor practically lived in theworkwearlabel's Cartograph jacket. He evenshowed upto a few film premieres in it, too. Who can blame him? There are very few brands out there that endlessly fly so high; as fellow Carhartt fan Austin Butler oncetoldGQof the rugged jackets, “As they get worn in, they just feel better and better.” So in New York City this week, when Connor was heading toGood Morning Americato talk all-thingsWarfare—the new Alex Garland movie about a Navy SEAL mission during the Iraq War, circa 2006—it was little surprise that he pulled up in aCarhartt Detroit jacket. After all, the fashion search engine Lystdidcall it one of the“hottest products”of 2024, with searches up by over 400 per cent in the last few months. At first glance, the actor's Detroit jacket looked like the standard-issue jacket you could buy off the rack today. Which is fine, and solid. Butvintage-headsspotted something a little deeper. The pockets on theHeartstopperstar's piece were at a slightly different angle. The zip across the chest was significantly bigger. The shoulders were slightly more structured. The sleeves were ripped and torn. And the canvas, which was originally black, has now faded into a dark charcoal. The jacket was also embroidered with the“Pinnacle Pete” logofrom a presumably defunct motorsports team. If we had to make an educated guess, this was probably made in the late ’90s to early ’00s, and even though it's likely decades old, it still looks sicker than ever. Kit Connor isn't the only member of theWarfarecast to hit up their thrift plug during the film’s press tour. Last month,Charles Meltonwas spotted in Los Angeles wearinga vintage leather flight jacketfrom Great Golden Fox. Fancy syncing up with Hollywood's new guard? Do the hard work and find yourself some old Carhartt. A version of this story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "11 Best Tracksuits for Men in 2025 to Make You Infinitely More Stylish",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. There’s something about the best tracksuits for men, comfortable as they may be, that just feels more purposeful than asweatsuit. The fabric is denser and more structured, and there’s a jacket involved—one that you have to go to the trouble of putting on and zipping up, rather than just slipping over your head like ahoodie. And then there are all thebaked-inassociations. Tracksuits are uniforms for people who get shit done efficiently and ruthlessly: elite athletes, UK grime rappers, mall-walking senior citizens determined to stay in shape, tough guys stretching from the Polish section of Brighton Beach all the way to actual Poland. Oh, yeah, and they also look really, really dope—leisurely and relaxed, but still plenty smart and distinctive. Tracksuits are so essential right now that literally every brand on the planet makes their own swishy, striking take. That might sound like a good thing, only the actual number of available options is so vast that it’s honestly sort of anxiety-inducing—and lord knows you don’t need any more of that at the moment. So we did you a solid and surveyed hundreds of versions, from the tiniestunderground streetwear labelsto the oldestluxury fashion housesto the biggestathletic conglomerates, and narrowed it down to these. Pick the one that’s right for you, get into it pronto, and give your tried-and-true sweats a well-earned break. Adidas Amazon Adidas Amazon What, were you really expecting something else? Since 1967, when Adidas debuted its first tracksuit on the lanky frame of German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer, there’s been no sportswear ensemble more omnipresent in our culture. FromRun D.M.C.toKorn,Henry HilltoChas Tenenbaum, the sheer simple cool of the three-striped zip jacket and matching stretchy pants hasn’t just endured across six decades—it’s snowballed. And the fact that you can get in on all that timeless style for less than $100 total means there’s no other place we could’ve put this icon besides the very top of the heap. Needles Ssense Needles Ssense As if you didn't need another excuse to rock a full velour look, A$AP Rocky raps: “My pants, velour” in “Praise the Lord (Da Shine).” He (obviously) must be referring to Needles, because the Japanese apparel brand might be the second brand you think of (after Adidas, of course) when thinking about tracksuits. Its buttery smooth construction is a far cry from the Juicy Couture set your high school crush wore, and it comes decked out in range of colors from bold (like this Barney purple) to lowkey (like boring black). Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Reigning Champ The ‘90s were all about warm-up suits, which were loud and bold, because you just had to let other people know you were about to work up a sweat. Reigning Champ’s take on the tracksuit yielded this paneled number, which comes lined in mesh and made from water-repellent nylon that'll keep you dry if you decide to go for a misty run. Ryoko Rain Ryoko Rain Ryoko Rain Ryoko Rain Tracksuits usually opt for no hoods, but if you're trying to throw on a hood like Batman's cowl, then we really like this set from Ryoko Rain. But wait, are those shorts? No one said a tracksuithadto include pants, and the combo of this jacket and those shorts bring the total pocket count to a whopping eight. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Gone are the days of Abercrombie's heavily branded graphic tees, and we're absolutely giddy over it. From crop tops to wide-legged jeans, the mall brand is ready to dress a new generation of guys (and gals). The brand has a new-ish line of activewear, and we're particularly chuffed by the tracksuit. It features a relaxed fit and retro piping details, and it's got a bit of stretch as to not be restrictive if you actually do decide to get active in it. APC APC APC APC APC and Asics recently collaborated on a capsule collection of sporty clothing, from tracksuits to shoes. Its tracksuit is particularly great, combining the French brand's focus on fit while leaning towards Asics' athletic side. The waterproof construction keeps the rain off of your gym 'fit as your huffing it to go do your workout, and it pairs exceptionally well with theco-branded gym bag. Palmes Ssense Palmes Ssense Palmes' playful take on tennis apparel is the reason why we think its tracksuit is so great. The green getup features a logo for a non-existent tennis club, while the yellow piping pays tribute to the tracksuits of yore. IfChallengersweren't so stylish already (and basically a feature film-length Loewe ad), then we're pretty certain Art or Patrick would be decked out in this set. Our Legacy Ssense Our Legacy Ssense Our Legacy's tracksuit is like the fashion guy's take on the typical mafia uniform, albeit way more stylish, better fitting, and overall justcooler. The full-zip jacket features a two-way zipper, while the track pants have zippered pockets to keep all your goods secure. Wales Bonner Farfetch Wales Bonner Farfetch An ongoing collaboration between Wales Bonner and Adidas has brought the former brand to mass appeal, but if you're looking to dive head first into whyWales Bonnerhas been one of our favorite new fashion brands for so long, then its Tide tracksuit is here to educate you. The slim jacket paired with the straight, somewhat wide pants create an interesting silhouette, which is made even better by the Adidas-esque side stripes and ribbed mockneck collar. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder The Todd Snyder tracksuit asks the question: What if you wanted to wear a tracksuit to work. The wrinkle-resistant fabric and terry construction can easily trick people into thinking you're wearing just another stylishmatching set, but little do they know you're wearing glorified pajamas to the office. Nike Nike Nike Nike We gave you the stripes, now here's the swoosh. Nike's tracksuit is full ‘90s style, from the paneling to the contrast piping. Its elasticated cuffs—on the wrists and ankles—keep everything nice and tapered, while the lightweight fabric keeps you light on your feet.",

    "title": "20 Best Colognes for Men, Reviewed by GQ | 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best cologne for men might vary across budget, preference, and occasion, but each operates in service of the same fundamental goal: helping you smell really good. Cologne formulations differ substantially from one scent to the next, but what unites the greatest of the genre is their ability to smartly punctuate your personality—and enhance everyone else’s experience while they’re at it. The opposite is true of bad colognes, too (if you’ve ever been stuck in the elevator with a colleague doused in Axe you know exactly what we mean), so it’s especially important to choose wisely. Thechoosingpart is where we come in. Landing on the best men’s cologne for you starts with understanding fragrance families, and identifying which ones work in any given context.Woody,citrus, or aromatic colognes, for example, tend to wear well as daily “signature scents”—the smell your coworkers, friends, and the guy at your local bodega associate withyou. “Woody fragrances have depth, richness, and are more [inherently] masculine,” says Leila Zagwolsky, co-founder and CEO of the perfume discovery platformLuxury Scent Box (LUXSB). Aromatic and citrus colognes, on the other hand—scents Zagwolsky describes as “bright, refreshing, and energizing”—are better suited to year-round wear. They’re also better candidates for your signature scent than, say, a sensualspicyorleatheroption, though those sultrier formulations have their time and place. Regardless of what you’re looking for in a cologne—an everyday go-to, a gloomy-day pick-me-up, a special-occasion statement-maker—there’s a superlative, compliment-eliciting option here with your name on it, each one sprayed, tested, and ultimately loved by us. Le Labo Nordstrom Saks Fifth Avenue Amazon Vibe:Sophisticated architect| Key Notes:Citrus, fig, woods Why we love it:Let everyone else have Santal 33—in my book, Thé Matcha 26 is the Le Labo scent to beat. I can never quite tell if it's more smart or playful, more introverted or sexy. In reality, it's all of those and more, which makes it such a platonic signature scent for the fella with an equal amount of layers. In the time since its debut, I've converted half a dozen friends to the cause, and I’m happy to take partial blame if half a million more make the switch, too—it's exquisite in every way, and more than deserving of its rank here. Many notes in the bottle, zero notes from me. Ralph Lauren Amazon Walmart Vibe:Worldly polo player| Key Notes:Pine, patchouli, leather, tobacco Why we love it:There’s a reason the original Polo continues to hold strong nearly half a century into its existence: It manages to be both sexy and professional, a versatile woody-aromatic scent that works in almost every context. Better yet, because there are so many remixes of the OG, wearing the version that started it all still feels as refreshing as the latest launch. Arquiste Arquiste Dermstore Vibe:Self-aware creative director| Key Notes:Patchouli, lavender, tonka bean, balsam Why we love it:In the perfume industry, all noses are pointed towards Arquiste right now, and Misfit is the niche house’s absolute best scent. Misfit errs on the sexier side—perfect as an evening or date-night scent—but it works great in the daytime, too, if your vibe skews vibrant and extroverted (or you'd really like it to). Fair warning: Youwillget asked about it, so prepare to play dumb if you're the gatekeeping type. There’s a reason that my personal bottle is half empty despite the hundreds of other options in my scent library—and why I'm going to order another as soon as it's finished. Chanel Nordstrom Vibe:Happy-go-lucky teenage heartthrob| Key Notes:Citrus, resin, sandalwood Why we love it:Even if you weren't aware of it at the time, you've probably caught a whiff ofChanelBleu at one point or another—and likely haven't forgotten it since. Its pleasant omnipresence tends to conjure happy memories from those who smell it, especially in passing. (It reminds me of an ex-boyfriend who was all-too-fun and none-too-serious—exactly what I needed him to be.) I always treat myself to a huff when I amble into Sephora, if only to feel 22 again. How's that for time travel? Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton Vibe:That mid-shower moment of mental clarity (but the shower overlooks an ocean)| Key Notes:Citrus, neroli, ginger, black tea Why we love it:I legitimately get goosebumps every time I smell Louis Vuitton's flagship EDP, a tingle in my scalp that sends serotonin surging through my veins. Before I encountered it, I never thought a scent could make me feel like the gravity had left my body. To put it in less poetic terms: If I had to choose one scent to wear for the rest of my life, it'd probably be this. Tom Ford Nordstrom Amazon Vibe:The coolest account manager at the fanciest marketing agency| Key Notes:Lavender, geranium, moss Why we love it:Every time I wearTom Ford'sBeau de Jour, I feel like I'm cosplaying as a genteel man-about-town. (Joke's on you: I hate the opera.) More realistically, though, I feel like a writer who hits all of his deadlines with zero notes from my editors, who are all very proud of me. That's exactly what it's supposed to do: turn you into the best version of yourself. Escentric Molecules Amazon Bloomingdale's Vibe:Dude who swears he “isn’t wearing anything!”| Key Note:Iso E Super Why we love it:This scent might be the most famous “no-fragrance fragrance” on the market; its Iso E Super molecule expresses itself differently on each wearer. You can layer it with another fragrance or let it mix with your skin's natural chemistry for an oh-so-subtle effect. Some folks won’t notice a thing, others will instantly demand to know what you're wearing. Calvin Klein Amazon JC Penney Vibe:A Saturday at home with your boo| Key Notes:Green tea, musk, lemon, jasmine Why we love it:By any metric, this istheunisex cologne. It’s great for couples who share scents, especially when both parties prefer wearing something down the middle. I think of CK One as the perfect weekend warrior, too—when all I want to throw on is a beefy hoodie and shades, it's mine to enjoy. Hermès Hermès Vibe:Hot tennis instructor| Key Notes:Vetiver, sichuan pepper, green bergamot Why we love it:Over a decade-plus of grooming coverage, there are only two bottles of fragrance that I've used to the last drop. One isn’t on this list (shoutout to the brilliantArquiste Nanban, a wintry staple); the other is Terre d'Hermès Eau Intense Vétiver, the best expression of Hermès’ iconic cologne. I went through an entire bottle in just a few months, and it remains one of the best buys you can make for yourself, your partner, or your son. It's a reliable, invigorating, and head-turning masculine scent that's perfect for all scenarios and seasons—and it should be triple the price. Diptyque Neiman Marcus Vibe:Showering at a 5-star hotel| Key Notes:Mint, geranium, patchouli Why we love it:No scent is fresher than this. Wearing it is like stepping out of the best shower of your life, wrapping yourself in the plushest robe on the planet, and ordering room service on the company tab. It might be a pinch too buoyant for some fellas, but it’s catnip for anyone who might be in the suite (or, heck, the shower) with you when that room service arrives. Aesop SSENSE Vibe:Math professor who’s kind of a babe| Key Notes:Rose, sandalwood, vetiver, shiso Why we love it:Whenever I wear Rōzu, I swear that some of my high school AP Calculus knowledge comes back into focus. It sounds corny, but it really does make me feel, well,smarter. Maybe I should give the debate team another go after all. Dior Nordstrom Vibe:The movie producer everyone’s talking about at Cannes| Key Notes:Licorice, lavender, nutmeg Why we love it:Of all the Sauvage expressions out there, Elixir excites me the most. I find it perfect for the colder months of the year, the darker half of the day, and any date nights throughout. It has a nice bite, too—a signature licorice-tinged zing that makes it memorable. Memorable on date night…that’s a decent sell, no? Malin + Goetz Amazon Walmart Nordstrom Vibe:DILF at a PTA meeting| Key Notes:Leather, sandalwood, incense Why we love it:Malin+Goetz has conjured an approachable—dare we say…polite?—way to wear leather, while still announcing to the world that you are, in fact, just as confident as you are sexy. I love that this expression offers so many notes besides just raw, dripping leather. Despite that sex appeal, though, nobody will call you out for wearing it to the hardware store (or in the middle of May). Frédéric Malle Bergdorf Goodman Vibe:Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine on a Tinder date in Calgary| Key Notes:Musk, vanilla, amber, sandalwood Why we love it:Musc Ravageur is aptly named, in that it evokes exactly what it advertises: musk-infused sex appeal—but in a playful enough manner that won't overwhelm your date. I wouldn’t wear it to the office, but Iwouldwear it if I wanted to suggest—politely, of course—to someone special that I have the place to myself that evening. It’s a nice way to broadcast your complexity without coming on too strong, if you catch my musky drift. YSL Sephora YSL's latest fragrance also happens to be one of its best. This woody-floral number is an excellent everyday fragrance that's bright and warming, able to easily transition from day to night. Guerlain Neiman Marcus If you fear that a vanilla-forward scent might make you smell like a box of Betty Crocker, then you'll be pleasantly surprised by Guerlain's Spiritueuse Double Vanille. It's vanilla-forward for sure, but it's been expertly balanced to smell more like bourbon than pound cake thanks to a hefty dose of amber and cedar. D.S & DURGA D.S. & Durga If you often find yourself wondering what fragrance to wear, well, I Don't Know What is a crowdpleaser—and the go-to EDP forGQ's senior commerce editor Ian Burke. Coming from the indie scent folks atD.S. and Durga, this scent is actually a “fragrance enhancer,” meant to play up whatever existing scent you might already have on. Independently, this scent's main note is bergamot, so it's clean and fresh, making it easy to wear no matter who you are. Creed Nordstrom For most who are getting into colognes, Creed is their entryway into the luxury scent game. It's overtly citrus on the front, but it's balanced out by lavender and geranium—two amazing floral notes—before the lasting impression is of cedarwood and oakmoss. Diptyque Nordstrom This musky number from Diptyque is just the right amount of flowery to justify its name. It's also fruity and sweet, but not so much where it feels like you've been running through a valley of roses. Byredo Woody and citrus notes come together to create a scent that's like a refreshing dip in the lake during thespring. Byredo knows how to craft a fragrance, and this one is exceptionally well designed to be appealing for all noses. Yoursignature scentis the one you wear most often—to the office, to after-work drinks, to re-up on toilet paper at the bodega down the street. Think of it as your olfactive personality. “A signature scent becomes your identity,” says Leila Zagwolsky, co-founder and CEO of perfume discovery platformLUXSB. “Fragrances are not only part of our lives: they’re as individual as a favorite song or pair of jeans.” Here's how to zero in on the best signature scent foryou. Understand notes and fragrance families Familiarizing yourself with scent families and key olfactive notes is a great starting point—as is understanding which ones work best as “everyday” scents. At the onset of your journey, Zagwolsky recommends considering woody, aromatic, or citrus fragrance, which work across most occasions and tend to be less polarizing. (Yes, cologne can be polarizing!) Consider the vibe In the fragrance world, the same notes can manifest differently depending on how they're employed—so it’s also important to understand a scent's ever-elusive vibe. Is it designed to transport you to the sun-dappled beaches of a private island? Or conjure memories of a rainy day spent indoors? If you're looking for an everyday scent, steer clear of any vibes that immediately read as overly powerful or expressive. Ask around Use the web Websites likeFragranticacan help you discover new scents or those similar to fragrances you already know about; they're a great place to search by brand, season, and fragrance family. (We're also fans of Fragrances of the World always-helpfulmatching tool.) Try before you buy Have a scent in mind? Double-check if the brand behind it offers samples before you commit to a full size. Discovery sites likeLUXSBare great platforms for building a low-cost fragrance library, too, if you want few options in the starting lineup once you land on a star player. Ever wondered about the difference between an “EDT” and an “EDP”? It's not actually all that complicated. The primary differentiator comes down to the percentage of perfumed oils used in the product, which dictates how brands classify their scents. These days, we tend to treat “cologne” as a catchall term for any men’s fragrance, but technically speaking, the term is just one of many you should know about. These are the rest. Eau Fraiche 1-3% perfume oil concentration. Very few fragrances are true eau fraiches these days; those that are classified as such will last for just an hour or two. Cologne/Eau de Cologne/EDC 3-5% perfume oil concentration. We tend to refer to the broader category of men’s scents as “colognes,\" even when they don’t fall in this range. Eau de Toilette/EDT 5-8% perfume oil concentration. Shop in this range or higher if you want a scent to perform past lunchtime. (And yes, the translation from French is literally “toilet water”. We promise you'll still smell great.) Eau de Parfum/EDP 8-15% perfume oil concentration. This wide range of concentrations makes EDPs the hardest category to predict in terms of longevity and performance. Either way, an EDP should be noticeably stronger than an EDT. Parfum/Extrait de Parfum Parfums tend to be in the 15-30% perfume concentration range, but they can climb up to 40% before a brand switches to “pure parfum oil”. Some extraits and parfums are described as “eternal”—but remember, that’s not necessarily what you should be looking for. The classifications above aren't an exact science, of course, but the concentration levels they allude to are a solid indicator of where to set your expectations, and how much a fragrance will cost. Oud Meaning “wood” in Arabic, oud smells exactly like you think it would: woodsy. It's a commonly beloved fragrance note for men, but when paired with something sweeter or more floral, it helps to add a depth that's great for all people. Bergamot What's bitter in taste is actually quite sweet and delicious on the nose. Bergamot offers a fine citrus note that's fresh on the nose, and when it's paired with something like oud, there's a wonderful dissonance that makes you think about your fragrance all day long. Vetiver Often considered a “manly” scent, vetiver has a distinct smoky aroma to it that's often compared to incense or cigar smoke. Leather Why would you want to smell like leather? The same reason that “leather” is a positive attribute when describing wine. Think more vintage sofa than ratty old handbag though, and that's what you'll get when you douse yourself in this intoxicating scent. Musk Musk, which was once harvested from the glands of the musk deer, is now created artificially, and it's often described as earthy and sweet. Neroli Another citrusy scent, neroli offers more of a “green” tinge than bergamot, so it smells like freshly cut grass that might've seen an accident of spilled orange juice. Patchouli With a bit of a spicy-sweet aroma, patchouli is often associated with bad smells. But these days, patchouli-forward scents are a complex blend of wood, musk, and spice. Orris One of the more floral fragrance notes there is, orris has a sweet flower-like aroma that can be balanced out by some darker, heavier notes to cancel out any reminders of grandma's old perfume. Tonka Bean We describe a lot of scents as sweet, but between florals and citruses, that can mean anything. When it comes to tonka bean, you'll get something that leans more vanilla, with a hint of baked goods. Testing colognes is one of the best parts of this gig. Writing forGQaffords me access to new scents as soon as—and sometimes, well before—they hit the market; at any given point in time, my personal collection includes dozens of gleaming, unopened bottles. Testing all of them is a full-time job in and of itself, so I keep on ongoing tally of which formulas feel best for which occasions. (You'd be surprised by how many of them don't pass the simplest sniff test, regardless of where I'd wear 'em.) In compiling this guide, I kept a particularly close eye on context and budget; not every guy wears cologne the same way or for the same reasons, and the breadth and depth of this list is designed to reflect those differences. Generally speaking, I evaluated each winning pick on the basis of its universal appeal, factoring in a mix of opinions from my sources in the fragrance community, to ensure that every scent included here will leave its wearer looking—andfeeling—like the absolute best version of himself. Adamy Hurly has been covering the grooming industry since 2013. For most of that time, he's been GQ.com’s primary grooming contributor, too. For this article, Adam also spoke at length with Leila Zagwolsky, co-founder and CEO of perfume discovery platformLUXSB, to solicit her insights on signature scents and fragrance wardrobes. What is the best men’s cologne? According toGQ, the best men’s cologne for year-round wear is Le Labo Thé Matcha 26, which imbues a smart and sophisticated formula with a welcome dose of subtle sex appeal. We consider it the platonic signature scent for its four-season versatility, too—it's ideally suited for professional and personal settings, along with every context between. What is the best way to test a cologne? Fragrance notes evaporate over time and aromas can change, so if you're trying a new cologne for the first time, you need more than a first impression. “It’s important to let the fragrance dry-down on skin [before making a final decision],” says Zagwolsky. “Wait a few hours and smell your skin again. If you can imagine yourself wearing this fragrance for a certain occasion or [a specific] mood, it’s a keeper.” What is one underrated fragrance family that men should consider? Zagwolsky recommends trying gourmand fragrances, likevanilla colognes, which are often perceived as cold-weather-oriented. Many vanilla scents, Zagwolsky says, can be worn year-round, too. Look for notes that that make you drool, like vanilla, chocolate, almond, honey, and caramel.",

    "title": "15 Best Beard Trimmer Picks, Tested by GQ Editors in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Every guy needs the best beard trimmer for his situation. Whether he grows itpatchy, keeps itperma-stubbled, or is as lustrousas the A-List beards, a trimmer is mandatory in everybeard kit. And not all beard trimmers are alike, which is why the best one for yourfacial hair stylemay be different from the next guy’s. I tested a bunch ofbeardtrimmers to deliver you a real who’s who ofmen’s grooming devices. This list reflects a range of options—some multitaskers, some detailers; some top-shelf, some a better buy for lower budgets. Above all, though, I ask you this: Make sure that the device you choose allows yourbeardto reach its full potential. That doesn’t mean you need a big bushy beard, but rather, you should be able to achieve whichever style (or a suite of styles) you want to wear over the next few years—which is the minimum amount of time any of these devices should last. Ideally, they’ll hum on for 5-10 years, anyhow. Here are the bestbeardtrimmers, after I tested pretty much every last one of them. (And while you’re at it, consider my rosters of other grooming tools, fromrazorsandelectric shavers, tomanscapersandhair clippers.) Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart No sense in burying the headline: Philips Norelco’s Multigroom 9000 Series is, hands down, the best beard trimmer you can buy. And that’s before factoring in how much more it can do than just keep your facial hair in check than other electricrazorsthat are found in your everyday grooming kit. (It’s also recently been renamed the “All-in-One 9000” but answers to both names.) For the last 5 or 6 years, this has been my single go-to trimmer. Everything else is trying to dethrone it, and so far, no true contest has emerged. In terms of customization and power, this device checks all of the boxes. It all starts with the beating heart: \"The Multigroom does not compromise on power or battery life, and it's very intuitive to use,\" saysFellow Barber’s Head of Education Emily Clark. The battery life truly over-delivers: your mileage may vary since Philips Norelco only claims a (still impressive) six hours of charge, but I got a ridiculous 17 hours of consecutive runtime fresh out of the box, thanks to a lithium ion battery. Speaking of the box, there’s a lot in there, all of it useful. Between the small tooth-like detail attachment and foil shaving head, the Multigroom 9000 makes it easy to style and sculpt with precision. One trimmer even adjusts by tenths of a millimeter to help you get the perfectdesigner stubble, if that's your aim. And that’s just itsbeardtrimming bona fides. The Multigroom 9000 is also a solid hair trimmer (shout out to that brawny motor and battery again) andbody hair trimmeras well. Covering off for three products, and doing it well, suddenly makes the $90 price tag look like a deal. Long-term testing notes:Wouldn’t you know it… I lost the beloved little shaver on this one recently. Heartbreak. (Yeah, I can test a new one, but I realize now how much of my love for it is pinned on that micro shaving attachment.) I stand by the fact that it’s the best on the market, but without that shaver, the window has opened for me to spend time with other devices, like the Braun below. Let this be a lesson: Don’t unpack your Philips Norelco all-in-one in a hotel room without carefully auditing every single piece when you pack it up again. Specs Number of tools and accessories:21, including nose and hair trimmer, detailer, body trimmer|Run time:6 hours| Charge time:3 hours|Trimming lengths:0.5-16mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:8 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This trimmer is great! It comes with so many attachments to use for your trimming needs. The battery lasts a long time, i have yet to have to charge mine and i've had it for a few months now. The trimmer is super quiet as well as very well made. It's all made up of metal, not plastic, and feels like it will last a long time. It's fairly lightweight and easy to handle when [using] it. It also comes with a small cleaning brush that makes cleaning it up a breeze!\" Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Given how much I love the Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000, it’s no surprise that the more affordable model, the Multigroom 5000, is my budget choice to keep things manscaped. It offers most of the same steel-bladed precision and customization benefits as its fancier family member, albeit in a less durable body (plastic instead of stainless steel) and half the battery life. Still, its a three-hour battery power beast that bests many beard trimmers twice the price. And the lighter plastic body is nice for travel. The Philips Norelco Multigroom 5000 is great for anyone on a budget, but it’s not “budget.\" Whereas other lower-pricedbeardtrimmers can’t handle precise detailing, the Multigroom 5000 includes a detail trimmer and nose trimmer, not to mention hair clipper and body trimmer guards for versatility. It does lack the shaving detailer and the body shaver (as does the in-between 7000 model), which is important to note if you wantthatlevel of customization and don’t otherwise own a detail shaver that you also rely upon for bare-faced stretches of facial real estate. For this reason, I find it a little less perfect across the board compared to the 9000, but the price-to-precision ratio is hard to match. And if you want a great value above all—and a straightforward beard trimmer—meet your optimal Multigroom, the 5000. Long-term testing notes:Recently, I used the 5000 consistently, and got quite cozy with it. Sure, it lacked the key shaving features of the 9000, but I think this is truly the best value device in the game when you only want a trimmer. Terrific muscle, terrific customization, great endurance. Five stars for this one. Specs Number of tools and accessories:18 including beard trimmer, nose and hair trimmer, detailer, body trimmer| Run time:3 hours| Charge time:70 minutes| Trimming lengths:0.5-16mm |Waterproof:Yes| Warranty:5 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This Phillips/Norelco trimmer works great. It is very quiet, the battery life is pretty long and it does exactly what I need it to do. It comes with a lot of attachments - haven’t used them all, but the ones I have used worked just fine. This is a good quality trimmer.\" Hatteker Amazon Walmart Hatteker is a surprise of a buy—it’s that “out of left field” Amazon brand that most of us recognize by name, despite not knowing anyone who uses it. This all-in-one kit covers every kind of hair-trimming task, from lineups to sideburns to beards, eyebrows, and body hair. What's more, its a hair cutting machine for full beards and stubble alike with multiple plastic guards. I bought the tool with little expectations for quality and care, but was consistently surprised at how well it held its own compared to the more reputable brands. This device won’t win any design awards and certainly hasn’t reinvented the wheel, but most consumers won’t care about that stuff; they want a good beard trimmer that meets all their grooming needs, and Hatteker’s checks all of those boxes. I do wish its detailing trimmer was a bit narrower, but that’s me minding some very fine details. It’s also not up to the same quality as, say, Philips, Andis, Braun, Wahl, etc, but it’s also not low quality either. For $40, you get your money’s worth, especially considering that LED battery display and vast range of trimming lengths and clipping attachments. It’s still a great option if you’re not looking to spend a lot, or if our other best value winner, the Philips Norelco Multigroom 5000 Series, is out of stock. Long-term testing notes:Every time I bring this one out, I am amused by how surprisingly great it is. It goes to show that those Amazon reviews really are one of the most accurate depictions of value; I long wrote the brand off because of its non-image compared to the big names, but in terms of performance and return on spend, Hatteker really clears the bar. Granted, I’m not using most of these devices more than a few times a quarter (since by and large I stick with my own favorites or test new ones) but my Hatteker remains strong and sturdy and has endurance, some three years after I first acquired it. Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 trimming and clipping heads with various guards| Run time:90 minutes| Charge time:90 minutes| Trimming lengths:0.5-10mm, 12, 14, 16mm| Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:none What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"The trimmer is easy to use and the charge lasts a very long time. I have not had to recharge since the initial charge after taking it out of the box, trimming bi-weekly. It is not heavy. It’s easy to handle. They adjustment guides stay where you select. I don’t worry about them shifting during use. Beard maintenance is an easy job with this.” Braun Braun Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin Like the Philips Norelco Multigroom models, Braun's All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 is a jack-of-all-trades option that can do far more than tidy up your beard; the box is packed with anoseand ear trimmer, a precision head, and longer guards, too. But what separates this trimmer from the rest of the pack is the built-in dial that offers 40 trim-length settings. It’s top-notch precision in minimalist packaging. I think it’s the only real contender for the top spot on this list—perhaps that price and slightly less enduring battery are its shortcomings compared to the Philips Norelco 9000, but I do find it a superior device in terms of ease and design. Where other devices require you to swap out different heads or attachments, or ask you to pick between bigger length gaps than you’d prefer, Braun’s Series 9 offers half-millimeter increments from 0.5 to 20 without having to futz with extra accessories. In my testing, that made the trimmer the most user-friendly device on this list—no swapping guards as you fade your beard or neckline. Plus, the Series 9 is fully waterproof for those of you shaving-in-the-shower fans looking to speedrun your morning regimen. (And I’ll admit, shaving in the shower certainly makes clean-up—of both the beard hair mess and the trimmer—faster and easier.) Bottom line, Braun’s All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 is exactly what the name promises. If it seems a little expensive, that’s because a beard trimmer that can handle all these tasks, and handle them well, isn’t cheap. Long-term testing notes:Like I said above, this one has been getting lots more mileage from me lately, and I am so pleased with that fact. I absolutely adore how easy it is to navigate between the smallest minutiae of trimming lengths without swapping guard heads, and that detail shaver has been so clutch at keeping my neckline, cheeks, and beard perimeter cleaned up. My one complaint from a recent trip was that it’s quite difficult to repack everything into the carrying case, if you bring along all attachment heads. Besides that… perfect grooming tool. Specs Number of tools and accessories:13 including a mini foil shaver, body trimmer, T-blade and adjustable beard comb|Run time:3 hours| Charge time:2.5 hours |Trimming lengths:0.5-20mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 Years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “Before this trimmer came into my life, I made a couple of cheap purchases. The style I like it's 1mm overall with a 2mm on my chin and 2.5 on my mustache. The problem was the other trimmers could not handle it on a daily basis. I am the type of guy whose beard grows back really fast, so I'd trim my beard. Then, the next day, you could see clear growth, and when I tried to do it again, it just wouldn't trim the same. I'd end up hurting my face a little bit. Not this trimmer. This trimmer can handle my beard on a daily basis without hurting my face. It's that good and efficient. It's built for heavy performance and durability. For the first time I am able to maintain my beard on a daily basis.” Wahl Amazon Walmart Wahl is a pedigreed name in the professional and home grooming worlds, but that doesn’t mean it’s done innovating. Its new High Visibility trimmer has a killer app: the trimming attachment is angled so the teeth sit “above” the base, letting you get eyes on the action in the mirror as you mow through facial hair. It’s maybe not a priority if you’re just doing leisurely trims, but if you’re trying to get the perfect line at your cheek, sideburns, or neck, that little bit of offset is a godsend. Suddenly I’m seeing very clearly exactly where the blade is hitting. If you’ve ever had to drop that cheek line too far down or do the back-and-forth thing with your burns, you’ll recognize what a game changer this is. The Wahl High Visibility trimmer’s laser-pointer precision is boosted by some of the best ergonomics in the game. The body’s relatively thin with an excellent rubber grip, which lets you hit difficult angles like a professional pool player. The High Visibility trimmer is new to the market, but I’m betting it’ll become a barber favorite—and yours, too, if you’re doing daily touch-ups to keep those lines looking sharp. Long-term testing notes:I find myself using this more often as a detail trimmer than a full-on trimmer—probably most comparable to the Andis Slimline on this list. I think it’s a fantastic trimmer through and through, but I pull it from the bullpen as a closer; that’s where I hold it mostly in my mind—and happily! Specs Number of tools and accessories:13 including an exposed T-blade for error-proof cleanups, plus a swappable nose hair trimmer and dual foil shaver|Run time:Up to 2 hours| Charge time:2 hour charge time |Trimming lengths:1.5-13mm |Waterproof:Yes| Warranty:5 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"Absolutely amazing product. Heavy, rock-solid construction makes the hand feel confident, has great ergonomics, and has a solid grip even when the hand is soapy. But the best part is the forever blade makes it easy to see what’s getting cut, even with guard on (I used the 2). Most precise edge for a jawbone line beard I’ve ever had. And with the guard, it combs as it cuts with the grain of the hair, keeping stray whiskers knocked down. I’ve been pinched/cut before with fatter spaced blade rakes, but I didn’t feel threatened trimming under the nose.\" Remington Amazon Walmart Vacuum trimmers keep you from having dozens of errant clippings dropped amongst your sink-ledge grooming products. But this one is more than just a vacuum—it has a detailing and edgework attachment and can trim up to 18 mm with a line-drawing detail head that rivals most T-blade trimmers. While it feels noticeably less sturdy and powerful than the others on this list, Remington's trimmer has no performance issues and even holds a decent 90-minute runtime. While this may be the last significant vacuum trimmer left standing, it is for good reason: Remington's trimmer saves you tons of time and stress by sucking up the majority of your facial hair shearings—up to 95% of clippings, according to the brand (I'd posit it's more like 85%, but hey, that's still a huge win). To me, it’s the obvious choice if your roommate or s/o constantly complains about clippings on the sink ledge, no matter how much you try to clean up after the fact. Perhaps Remington’s device can actually save your relationship? That’s a stretch, but it would make for a not-too-passive-aggressive gift from said s/o to the bearded fellow in question. Long-term testing notes:My one-time favorite trimmer was a vacuum device from Philips Norelco, which they discontinued. And for a long time, I was crushed, because I so loved that one. I thought that Remington would be my new mainstay, and as much as I really like it, I just don’t get the same mileage out of it as that previous PN model. I can’t say why; it certainly checks all the same boxes and I find it extremely customizable and easy to clean up. I don’t mean to do them a disservice here, but I think the competition has grown stiffer in the past five or so years, which might also explain the dearth of vacuum options. Still, I stand by the fact that this is a great device, and delivers on its promises. Specs Number of tools and accessories:1 adjustable comb|Run time:1.5 hours| Charge time:1.5 hours |Trimming lengths:2-18mm |Warranty:60 days| Waterproof:Yes What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This is fantastic. Over the years I have gone through many different kinds and even a few other brands that offer a vacuum function but this one is by far the best. The edger works great. The attachments are also very sturdy. I charge it maybe every two weeks or more and I use it just about every day. Easy to empty out, and it grabs a good amount of the hair so it’s not a big mess to clean ups. I absolutely recommend getting this.” Manscaped Amazon No attachments; no problem. For a beard trimmer that can only do one thing (but is damn good at doing that), Manscaped's Beard Hedger will make light work out of the bushiest, burliest beards. Its zoom wheel controller lets you dial in the comb's length between .5 and 10 millimeters for even shaves, while the waterproof construction means you can shower and shave to save time on your morning or nighttime rituals. The built-in comb is great for picking up hairs that are stuck to your face so that every strand gets whacked, because few things are more unsightly than stray long hairs poking out from an otherwise well-groomed beard. Specs Number of tools and accessories:None|Run time:60 minutes|Trimming lengths:0.5-10 mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:90 days What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “I've owned maybe 5 or 6 beard trimmers over the last 15 years. Make no mistake, this is the most expensive, but hands down it's also the best (that includes competition from Braun, Philips Norelco and Wahl). The quality is the first thing you notice as soon as you unbox it - the feel of the handle and the quality of the blade, even down to the USB charging cable which doesn't have the usual cheapness you'd expect from an accessory that's something of an afterthought.” Bevel Amazon Tested by Timothy Beck Werth If you’re researching beard trimmers, you’ll see the term “zero-gap” a lot. So, what’s a zero-gap trimmer? A zero-gap trimmer cuts as close to the skin as possible, effectively a 0mm cutting length. That can make them dangerous for novices, as you can easily cut your skin or ears while you trim. But for the highest possible level of precision, that’s what you want. (The Bevel Trimmer can also be adjusted so it has a slightly longer taper.) This trimmer was designed by Black men, for Black men, and damn does it look good. It’s a work of art that design lovers will appreciate. This sculptural device will look mighty impressive on your bathroom counter and feels phenomenal in your hand. It’s a true barber-quality trimmer, perfect for guys with curly or Afro-textured hair. It’s also one of the most powerful trimmers for home use, with a 6,000 RPM motor. Despite that, it beats all comers in terms of battery life, with an 8-hour charge that will last for months. A word of warning: This trimmer doesn’t come with any attachments or comb guards. That’s by design, as it’s a precision trimmer for making clean lines and shaping up longer beards. If you want to cut precise hair lengths, opt for theBevel Trimmer Proor purchase extra attachments like theT-Blade. Specs Number of tools and accessories:None|Run time:8 hours| Motor power:6,000 RPM |Trimming lengths:Zero gap (0 to 2.5 mm) |Waterproof:No |Warranty:1 Year Philips Norelco Amazon A lot of grooming brands tout the number of accessories that come with their trimmer as a major selling point. The Braun Series 9 trimmer comes with 13 tools (whereas the Braun Series 7 has a measly 12). Philips Norelco brags about the 21 accessories that come with the MultiGroom 9000. And with the Panasonic MultiShape, the long list of accessories is the whole point of the device. But to be honest, keeping track of dozens of accessories can be a major pain in the ass. (Maybe that’s because I have a dozen beard trimmers in my apartment at any given time.) But if you want to trim your beard without breaking out an entire tacklebox full of blades and comb guards, then theSeries 9000will be a godsend. It’s the best beard trimmer with an adjustable dial, and it couldn’t be easier to use. A few clicks of the dial expands the length setting, and it comes with one—and only one—attachment. For shorter beards, even that extra 10mm cutting attachment isn’t necessary. Like its sister product, the MultiGroom 9000, it has a sleek, ergonomic, and waterproof design that combines a stainless steel handle with a rubber grip. You can easily see where you’re cutting, which makes it easier to shape your beard and make clean lines. The steel blades and integrated comb guard provide an even trim, and you only need one or two passes to clean up your hair. Specs Number of tools and accessories:1 comb guard|Run time:2 hours| Trimming lengths:0.4-10mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 years Andis Amazon Walmart Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin This is an industry-staple device—just ask any barber or professional groomer.  Andis makes dozens of professional-grade tools that the pros swear by, with powerful motors and sharp stainless steel blades (that you can alsoreplace easilyif they rust or dull). But perhaps none is as ubiquitous as this one. It’s certainly a staple in my grooming kit, as the go-to detailer for neck, cheeks, burns, and mustache. A frequent collaborator of mine, celebrity groomerMelissa DeZarate, has at least two of the Slimline Pro on her at all times. \"I'll use it to reshape beards or provide a larger trim,\" she says, adding that it’s powerful but “small enough to handle most detail work and shaving off length.” Longer beards need not apply: the Slimline Pro’s four included guides only range from 1/16” to 3/8”—but if that works for you, it’ll give you a barber-caliber line-up along the cheeks, sideburns, mustache, and neck. And along the back of your hairline along the neck, too—though we’d suggest calling in a steady-handed significant other or best friend to do the work for you. Long-term testing notes:This one is so nice, I got a second device. (Just like DeZarate.) Not because I expect the first one to crap out, but because Andis launched agalaxy purpleone and I knew I wanted to have that in rotation; now I can expect my treasured Slimline(s) to last twice as long with half as much individual usage, since I have them in routine rotation for neckline, cheek line, mustache, and sideburn cleanups. A+ device right here—ask any barber! Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 including a T-blade and attachment combs|Run time:2 hours| Charge time:2.5 hours |Trimming lengths:0-9.5mm |Waterproof:No |Warranty:1 Year What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “A must have in any barber setup. Probably my most used trimmer from designs to lineups and small areas around the lip/mustache it’s perfect!” // “Bought as a gift for my husband. The battery stays charged for a long time. Very durable and the added attachments are nice.” Philips Norelco Amazon Target Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin One morePhilips Norelco device, for good measure and good reason: This tool is adored by both our expert source and me: I love the OneBlade for its ability to switch between trimmer, shaver, T-blade, and body groomer with aplomb. I think it's one of the best-designed tools in facial hair care right now, and a dozen other brands are releasing dupes to chase the same high. “I appreciate how affordable it is and how easy it is to find at drugstores since so many clients ask me where to buy it because they love it too,” says DeZarate. “There was one week where I needed to buy three of the OneBlade for different clients during press events, so that they were able to actually travel home with it because they loved how easy it is to use and that it's universal. It does a really nice job at creating clean lines and is great for sensitive skin.” This one is easy to torque in different directions, too, allowing its shaving function to act like a T-blade trimmer while also offering familiar cartridge-shave movement for anyone who wants an entirely clean mug or simple a neckline tidy up. Get one with the body grooming attachment, too, and you could have an all-in-one grooming device for all facial and manscaping needs; it really does it all with that one singular blade. Long-term testing notes:Like DeZarate, I frequently reach for this guy to mind the details; it’s an easy tag-along for any trips (especially if I need some body trimming all the while) and will certainly be with me on a big 3-month trip I have to take soon; it’s a terrific head-to-toe customizer, though I don’t necessarily rely on it when I’m at home and have dedicated devices for each task. It is a terrific middle ground pick, for the guy who wants things streamlined. Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 length settings|Run time:1 hour| Charge time:4 hours |Trimming lengths:.2-5mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “I have to admit, I’ve avoided this product for the past few years. For some reason I didn’t think it was something I needed. I recently started maintaining my beard on my own more and needed something with a bit more precision. Safety razors and straight razors were cutting up my face. My $200 electric razor cuts good, but is terrible at getting straight edges. So I figured I would give this a try and I must say I’m very happy with it. This is a very high quality product for the price. Not only does this razor provide the precision I needed to line up my beard, but it also shaves very very well.” Wahl Amazon Wahl is the name of the game when it comes to barbershop-quality trimmers, and this wet/dry model is a great way to bring that professional-grade power into your home. Panasonic Amazon A display screen on your beard trimmer? In this economy? If it seems too good to be true, we get it, but this easy-adjusting trimmer from Panasonic is, in fact, the real deal. Wahl Amazon If you've never experienced the power you get from a corded trimmer, try the Wahl Peanut. Besides the fact that its a workhorse, the ergonomic grip means it won't slip in your hand —and thanks to the corded design, you'll never have to worry about battery life. Philips Norelco Amazon As far as budget options go, this is a great pick. With swappable trimmer heads and a quick-adjusting wheel, this no-nonsense trimmer gets the job done every time. You want a beard trimmer that’s simple, effective, and doesn’t come with useless features or add-ons. Here are a few features to consider when looking for a great beard trimmer. Motor power and blade quality:The device needs to be able to mow through your hair without any resistance or pulling. Trusted reviews are the only way to be sure, but we’d also suggest avoiding any beard trimmer that costs less than $20. Often that means a motor with too little power and longevity, and blades that dull quickly. Cost:Beardtrimmers are like the wine menu at a restaurant: you don’t need the priciest option to have a good time, but you don’t want the bargain-basement bottle either. If you don’t believe us, believe pro barber Emily Clark, who lives by the mantra that cheap is expensive. “I’ve had clients buy a cheaper model, only for them to break a couple of months down the line,” she says. “If you want your tool to have a decent battery life and be powerful enough to cut cleanly, it’s well worth not only buying from a trusted brand, but also not going for their cheapest model and spending some time researching reviews.” Customization:Not every beard style requires a 25-piece kitchen sink accessory set, and often you can save a few dollars—or get a better trimmer—by being honest with yourself about what your beard needs really are. At the most basic, you want adjustable guides, a tool for clean lines, and a foil shaver for smooth skin (if you don’t have a true shaver in your grooming arsenal already). Beyond that, you’re somewhere between future proofing—maybe youwillgrow a longer beard—and overkill. “Make sure if you’re upgrading, you’re investing in features that are relevant to you and how you will use it,” Clark advises. “The key is to ensure your tool is proficient, efficient, and powerful. From there you can research the additional features offered and if they apply to how you will use your tool.” Battery life:You’ll want a couple hours at least, though in this case, more is truly more. “Long battery life means consistent use and even being able to travel without a charger,” says Clark. I charge my Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000, maybe once or twice a year, despite it being used weekly by myselfandmy partner. The company claims it ges six hours of battery life, but I’ve tested mine at 17 hours when it was new. That also means thebeard trimmershould last longer, since batteries tend to be a real weak point for tech longevity. (Just ask anyone with a two-year-old iPhone.) Warranty:A warranty tends to be less a guarantee of functionality for the given duration than it is a symbol of how much trust the manufacturer puts in its product. That’s because no warranty—whether it’s eight years or five years or only two—covers damage from all the ways a trimmer is more likely to kick the bucket: because you dropped it on tile floors, or let the blade rust, or water slipped inside the motor and shorted it out. A store’s return policy is probably more crucial, in case you get the product and hate it immediately. I’ve been a grooming editor since 2013, and I’m constantly testing products, including the best (and not-quite-best) beard trimmers, shavers, and hair clippers (as well as skin, hair, and hygiene products). My favorite is (and has been, since 2021) the Philips Norelco Multigroom, and I use that beard trimmer as my measuring stick for other beard trimmers across factors like customization, cost, durability, power, ease of use, and more. As a longtime professional reviewer, I often test productsbeforethey come to market. Given beard trimmers are products that should last for 5-to-10 years, I’m conservative in my approach. There are plenty of innovations, but many reinvent the wheel in a way we don’t actually need. I’ll keep testing beard trimmers, month after month, and I’ll be eager to let you know if something new impresses me enough to make it onto GQ’s best beard trimmers list. What is the best beard trimmer? There’s no denying: The Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000 is the best beard trimmer you can buy these days. If its $90 price tag is too steep, the baby-brother Multigroom 5000 is a solid fallback. It’s not shower-proof, has a shorter warranty (five years to the 9000’s eight years), has a plastic body instead of steel, and comes with a few less attachments. But at $40, it gets the basics done nearly as well as it’s pricier sibling. Can you use a beard trimmer to cut head hair? Beard trimmers are not meant to be used as hair clippers, since clippers require much more power to cut through thicker patches of hair. However, some beard trimmers have the muscle to multitask, and they’ll proudly hype that skill—usually by declaring the work for “beard and head” or similar language. We usually verify those claims against product reviews, too. And frankly, we’d probably just opt to buy a dedicated hair trimmer (you can find our roundup of thebest hair trimmershere), especially if you’ll be using it often. Which beard trimmer do barbers use? The professional barber interviewed for this article recommends using the Philips Norelco Multigroom for all sorts of needs—not just beard trimming. The celebrity groomer we interviewed relies on the Andis Slimline Pro to draw clean lines and manage her A-list clients ahead of photo shoots, awards shows, and movie premieres. They give bonus points for following with a beard oil to keep your facial hair soft. What do professionals use to trim beards? The best professional-grade beard trimmer is the Wahl Pro Series High Visibility Cordless Trimmer. Trusted by barbers all over the world, Wahl makes seriously high-quality products that are built to last. Which trimmer number is best for a beard? That's going to depend on what beard style you're going with. In order to play around with trimmer numbers, we like the Braun All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 9440 fo its easy-to-use adjustment wheel. Emily Clark is Head of Education atFellow Barberand a Senior Barber at Fellow’sSoHo NYC barbershop.

    "title": "John Mulaney's ‘Everybody’s Live’ Is Just as Delightfully Weird In Person",
    "article_text": "We’re about halfway throughEverybody's Live with John Mulaney, the latest iteration ofJohn Mulaney’s gloriously random late-night experiment, and at this crucial juncture, the reading on the heat check comes in at “fire.” In one of the longest-running and most staid formats on television, Mulaney is a breath of fresh air still in mid-exhale. I had the pleasure of watching from the stands at Sunset Gower Studios as last night's episode unfolded, and can report that the show’s looseness—the key to its trademark weirdness—feels just as organic in the room. The show thrives off its aura of fluidity and its obsession with the bizarre and ephemeral; it's more subservient to its creator’s idiosyncrasies than it is to any late-night talk show conventions. “It’s fun to have a topic, and not to interview people about their career or life,\" Mulaneytold Vulturein an interview when the series returned to Netflix a few weeks ago. The original iteration,Everybody's in L.A., was loosely themed around Los Angeles-specific topics; the new, non-regionalEverybody's Liveis free to range wider, for good and for ill. An episode from a few weeks ago whose theme was “cruise ships” left Mulaney struggling to find compelling angles to riff on with guests Quinta Brunson and card-carryingPoseidon AdventurefanBen Stiller, while a cameo from Silkk the Shocker flailed once the shock of his appearance wore off. The lesson? A truly successful episode requires more incisive themes, and maybe a more calculated lineup for assured banter. So an installment reuniting Mulaney with longtime friendsBill Haderand Chelsea Peretti, both riffers extraordinaire, plus the always-gameJohnny Knoxville, and a broadly-relatable topic—“getting fired”—is about as close as a show like this can get to guaranteeing a hit. And it was, while still feeling light on its feet. Early into sitting down, Hader audibly whispered to Mulaney “Is the whole show like this?” and Mulaney, laughing, answered “Yes,” with the excitement of someone who's just roped his boy into chaos he clearly wasn’t quite prepared for. No sweat: Hader told a great anecdote about getting fired from his first job, while gleefully lobbing candy from the trusty food-delivery robot Saymo into the crowd, to John’s bemusement. But of course the real charm here are the throw-it-at-the-wall ideas that seem to pop out of Mulaney’s brain, a factor no one can calculate or predict. On last night's episode, Mulaney started the evening off with an insane, zigzaggingeight minutemonologue about career dejection, Madden and Ray Lewis—a sequence long and intricate enough that he could have slotted it into his next standup special. This week's courtside-seat cameo from a fake VIP in the audience turned into an extended dance number from a heroin-addicted pimp whose likeness is the secret inspiration for Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah. And this week’s digital short was a prolonged60 Minutes-esque interview with Bubbles the Chimp—on the strength of the gloriously thin peg of the Michael Jackson movie being delayed—that felt like a so-goofy-it’s-brilliant bit you might see in latter-seriesAtlanta. Shortly after his monologue, Mulaney did one of his recurring bits, matter-of-factly reading dry trade-paper news about which celebrities signed with which agencies off of a clipboard. When he brought his guests out, he sat back down and apologetically read off one last name: “Emmy Rossum signed with WME.” Did he truly miss a name, or did he “forget” on purpose, then rectify as if it really mattered, to score a chuckle later? I can’t call it, and ultimately, it doesn’t matter; that gray area between the inadvertent and the inspired is where this show's brilliance lives.",

    "title": "Even LeBron James’s Barbie Wears a Grail Watch",
    "article_text": "In addition to being the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, a multi-time NBA champion, and three-time Olympic gold medalist,LeBron Jamesrecently achieved the highest honor of all. Okay, maybe that’sslighthyperbole, but the news is very cool: The Laker great is now the first professional athlete to be depicted in Ken-doll form. You read that right: For $75, you can snag aKenbassadors dollin King James’s likeness. Mattel captures all the finer details here: He’s dressed in a fly varsity jacket signed “LJ,” Nike Terminator High sneakers, and Beats headphones. However, the detail we’re most concerned with is on LeKen’s wrist, where there is a design extremely similar to that of Audemars Piguet’s yellow-goldRoyal Oak Offshore.Sweeeeeet.(A rep for Audemars Piguet didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.) Think about that for a sec: Thirty years ago, vintageRolex Daytonaswere trading for a few hundred bucks. Fifteen years ago, a new crop of blogs gave pedantic geeks a place to yell at one another about extinct Swiss watch companies with names likeUniversal Genèveand Nivada Grenchen. Ten years ago, you could buy a vintageTudor Submarinerfor like $4K. (Maybe less!) Today? Watches are so ubiquitous, so culturally important, so touchstone-y that LeBron James’s Ken dollcomes with a miniature depiction of one on his wrist. That’s quite the journey. Ken-James’s gold watch appears to be a miniature version of the Royal Oak Offshore, which makes sense given the man’s AP affinity. The hooper’s been snapped in a huge variety of the iconic model over the years. He ownsrare gem-set Royal Oaks,Offshore Chronograph Tourbillons, andspecial 50th-anniversary pieces. And while a singlerealyellow-gold ROO will run you a cool six figures, you could conceivably buy at least 1,300 miniature Mattel versions for the same price! (We can’t guarantee they’ll fit on your wrist, however.) Conceived of by watch designer Emmanuel Gueit and launched in 1993, theRoyal Oak Offshorewas meant to be a larger, more masculine version of the brand’s Royal Oak. As the story goes,Gérald Genta, the man behind the original Royal Oak, absolutelyhatedit, but associations with famous evangelists such asJay-Z,Arnold Schwarzenegger, and James have made the model nearly as famous as its 1972 forebear. Furthermore, this is ironicallynotthe big ol’ gold watch’s first association with a significant cultural moment vis-a-vis Mattel: RememberRyan Goslingback in Barbie? In case you missed it, the dude rocked not onebut threevintage gold Heuerswith his Ken doll getup in Greta Gerwig’sBarbie. (Goslingelaborated upon the inspo for this scenein a recent interview, explaining that he spends more time than ever thinking about timepieces.) Watches areeverywhere, people, and we couldn’t be happier about it. In a statement, James expounded on why he was moved to make his own doll. “It’s an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.” And with the help of a tiny gold-looking Royal Oak, maybe a few of these kids will be inspired to reach horological greatness too.",

There’s no shortage of reasons to love spring, but for real clothing fiends, there's only one of any import:spring menswear. That the J.Crew sale just so happens to be in full bloom as the season finally gets underway is no coincidence—withBrendon Babenzien at the helm, the retailer has honed an uncanny knack for predictingexactly what you wantbefore you know you want it.

From breezy button-ups to tailored trousers, spring-wedding-circuit sport coats to stellar sweaters, theJ.Crew sale is absolutely bursting with new-season heat. The only problem, as far as we can tell, is the one you're already aware of: sales don’t last forever, and this one won't stick around long. J.Crew J.Crew We will never not ride for a classic blue striped button up shirt, so you'd better get used to it and jump in. Wallace & Barnes J.Crew Listen to your therapist: sometimes, cutting things off is a very, very good thing. J.Crew J.Crew Year after year, J.Crew's Irishlinen shirtsare on GQ's short list. Why?

    "title": "A Streetwear Innovator Makes It Rain in Milan",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. It will go down in history as one of my more twisted travel days: This past Sunday afternoon, I left Eau Claire, Wisconsin, by car for a short drive to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, where I caught a Delta flight to Paris. A surprisingly lovely two-hourlayoverin the Air France lounge brought me to my final leg; I landed in my favorite Italian city, Milan, around midday on Monday. This week is the 63rd edition of Salone del Mobile, a weeklong celebration of the furnishings and design industry. It has also become a must for the same kind of well-heeled person who might go to Fashion Week in Paris, Art Basel in Miami, or even theF1race in Montreal. Bar Basso and La Specialita are rammed, and the streets feel much busier than usual. Brands of all kinds show up in different ways. The Row did a one-day presentation of beautifully folded and arranged blankets hanging on Julian Schnabel-designed racks, Saint Laurent is showing unseen Charlotte Perriand designs, Loro Piana recreated a 1970s-80s apartment, and Humanrace is popping up at Terroir, a high-end Milanese grocer. On Monday night in the Isola neighborhood, I went to a dinner hosted by designerSamuel Rossto celebrate his installation, “TRANSPOSITION,\" a collaboration withThe Balvenie. I had been awake for almost twenty-four hours and had no idea what I was getting into. I was seated next to Samuel, whom I had never met. I was familiar with some of his work; his streetwear brand, A-COLD-WALL*, was never for me, but did quite well before Ross sold it in 2024 (and started SR_A, his new label, as soon as the non-compete expired.) The room was set with a long table that was located next to three large, but slightly different, industrial sculptures made from copper, which created and maintained a steady rain that matched well with the soundtrack—which contained no bass, because it didn’t jibe with the comforting sound of the water. The light was positioned in a way that made the rain glow. Brands of all sorts try to gain relevancy by collaborating with someone who has sauce, eyeballs, a point of view, and most importantly, influence. This one didn’t make much sense to me on paper—it was apparently inspired by the whisky-distillation process—but after chatting with Ross for most of dinner, I realized his method was somewhat radical. He and his team approach brands with a baked concept, spending months working to ensure things are feasible and digestible with their partner. Most people won’t put pen to paper until the check has cleared, but Ross is playing a different, longer game. He knows how to speak about his ideas, but more importantly, how to execute them—how to get something over the line, which, from my view, is half the battle. Whenever I think we have reached collaboration fatigue, I am surprised by something that works—when it's not just two logos slapped together, when someone has a realized vision and the budget to bring it to life. Brands don’t always invest in the right people or ideas, but we still take notice when they do. Another licensing deal won’t move the needle, but something that takes time, effort, and genuine, and most importantly, interesting creativity should be rewarded, no matter if a brand is involved or not.",

    "title": "19 Best Black Sneakers for Men 2025: Adidas, Nike, Vans, and More",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. For a long while, black sneakers for men were kind of an afterthought, useful only to opportunist guys who wanted to sneak some comfort into their work and school uniforms. How times have changed! Today, as men across the country lean towards quieter, sleeker dressing, a black sneaker has become a true must-have. First, because a black sneaker goes with everything, but unlike awhite sneaker, doesn't stand out. And two, because nobodyactuallywants to spend their spring and summer slapping the pavement in stiff, shiny loafers. These days, every sneaker brand worth its weight in StockX authentication tags makes blacked-out versions of its best sellers, which means there are truly thousands of black sneakers on the market right now to choose from. Unfortunately, the plain old truth is that many of them are just notthatgood. In fact, I'd wager that only about 19 are truly worth your consideration (and more importantly, your money), because those 19 hit bang in the center of the worth-it sneaker Venn diagram: Quality materials, comfort, and sheer good looks. From French walking classics to military reworks, you'll find them all below. Nike Nike Since its relaunch at the start of the decade, word has increasingly got out that the Nike Zoom Vomero 5 might just be the most comfortable, stealthy sneaker in the Swoosh's entire line-up. Salomon Nordstrom Salomons are so hot, we recently devoted anentire guideto 'em. Many have questioned whether they were just coasting on archive styles, but the just-released Whisper has silenced those… whispers. Mephisto Amazon Another French comfort classic, grandpas the world over have worn their same pairs of expertly hand-made Match's for fifteen years and counting. But now, the Mephisto Match is stepping down to a new generation, and enjoying a stylemoment all of its own. New Balance New Balance Yes,New Balanceis now onto the 990v6. But the 990v4 remains the most recent mega-hit, and I wouldn't suggest being an early-adopter just yet. At least, not while these are so well-stocked in handsome black suede. Asics Nordstrom The black Gel-Kayano 14, our one-time Sneaker of the Year winner, is never in stock. But why is no-one talking aboutAsics'eerily similar looking Gel-Nunobiki, named after and inspired by the terrain of a Japanese mountain? Adidas Adidas While we're on the subject of Japan: All of your friends might be going this summer, but the Adidas Japan—which has much more cushioning than a Samba—brings the aesthetic of the nation right to your door. Nike Nike You've seen them, you've worn them, you probably miss the pair you used to have. Simply put, few sneakers are as comfortable and bouncy as the Air Force 1—the clue is in the “Air” part. Reproduction of Found x Lady White Co. Lost & Found Reproduction of Found teamed up withGQ-staffer favoriteLady White Co.on this recreation of a British Military Shoe, which is dressy and terrain-tackling at the very same time. Vans Zappos We've said it: It's time tostart wearing Vans again. But if the checkerboard is still a little much for you—I get it—the all-black is ready and waiting. Converse Nike The same Chucks you've always loved, only 70s-ier. Puma Nordstrom Puma reinserted themselves into thetrendy little sneakerconversation by re-releasing the Speedcat. And while many spring for the Red and White, eagle-eyed observers have caught this full-black model waiting in the wings. Reebok Amazon In white, these quality kicks helped one GQ writerbow out from the sneaker gamefor good. In black, they might be even more powerful. Our Legacy Nordstrom Our Legacy does everything a little differently—in this case, we have diagonal lacing and silver-tone hardware at the tongue. Word. Adidas Nordstrom You've seen a Stan Smith before, and if you know the style works for you, why not enjoy it in upgraded materials and night mode? Nike Nordstrom Nike has sadly retired its Internationalist sneaker, but there are still a few waffle-soled daily beaters to be found if you look hard enough. Like this guy. Keen Huckberry Keen isn't just sandals—this “hiking” shoe has a contoured fit that follows the curvature of your foot, and foam cushioning from heel to toe. Maison Margiela SSENSE Maison Margiela's famous take on the legendary German Army Trainer is sleek, long-lasting, and way more comfortable than your brogues. Camper Nordstrom Like the Mephistos above, Camper's Pelotas shoe has been a beloved style for GWWs (Gentlemen Who Walk) for years. Now, as sneakers dress up, it's finding a new crowd. Salomon SSENSE The XT-Whisper up top might be the latest, but if we're talking about the greatest trail sneakers out there, the Salomon XT-6 is not going down without a fight.

    "article_text": "Justin Bieberis apparently pretty into golf lately. Last week, the singer shared a screenshot of himself on a FaceTime call with the“dirtbag cool”professional golfer Min Woo Lee,whom the Biebs congratulatedfor his win at the Houston Open. Frankly, we’d love to see what kind of fits Bieber and Lee (who, by the way, have both sportedsexy, sleazy mustachesat one time or another) would pull off together on the links. Perhaps they’d match in ultra-fitted performance mock necks andMarni plaid trousers? Would Lee swap his Oakley mirrored wraparounds for one of Bieber’s littlerolled-up beanies? Let’s manifest this link(s)up. In the meantime, Bieber gave us some insight into his personalgolf stylethis week while grabbing a coffee en route to a course in sunny Palm Springs, beforeCoachellakicks off this weekend. (Justin and his wife,Hailey Bieber, actually just picked up their festival passes—on a golf cart, no less!—and though he’s not on the docket to perform this year, hehasbeenrecording new musiclately.) He suited up for a round in a greenish-gray V-neck sweater vest layered over a bright red, oversized collared shirt, ultra-baggy pinstripe shorts, and rubber-toed Marni clogs. He accessorized with a contorted mesh-and-canvas bucket hat and matching green socks. Bieber later shared some conceptual shots of the outfit in action, including a blurry close-up of those clogs on a zooming golf cart,on Instagram. (It does seem that Bieber would rather share fit pics on his own accord than have them documented by paparazzi. On Wednesday, the singerconfrontedseveral photographers outside of a Palm Springs coffee shop, telling them, “You don’t care about people. Only money. No people. You don’t care about human beings.”) While we don’t know whatBieber’s golf gameis like, his outfit nailed exactly the sort of “trippyCaddyshack” look that jibes withgolf’s new era of “no rules” style—and as several of myGQcolleagues agreed, it was one ofBieber’s best outfitsyet.",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ask your high school nemesis: all jocks eventually grow up, and so do their wardrobes. Or skip the trip down memory lane and just ask Bradley Cooper—earlier this week, the hardcore sports fanatic helped aclassic rugby shirtgraduate from the junior leagues to the pros. On the set ofIs This Thing On?, his latest directing gig, the actor wore a green and white rugby from About Blank’s spring-summer 2024 collection, an eye-grabbing riff on theGQ-favoritespring staple rendered in heavyweight cotton and equipped with a telltale contrasting collar. Cooper's rugby shirt is a far cry from the skin-tight jerseys typically worn today. Instead, it harks back to a bygone era of the game, when players took to the pitch looking more likeretro J.Crew modelsthan modern-day blokes. So when we say it's the type of rugby shirt players would've worn when they were still allowed to take smoke breaks at half time, we mean it as the highest compliment possible. About Blankunderstands the dueling tension between old and new especially well. The London-based streetwear label imbues its preppy-leaning wares with a breath of fresh air by tweaking their silhouettes, cropping a hem here or blowing up the proportions there. For Cooper, a somewhat surprisingstreetwear aficionadoand whollyunsurprisingsports buff, it’s a perfect match. Cooper, of course, is no stranger to the type ofrun-of-the-mill sports merchavailable on the Fanatics site. (His commitment to the Philadelphia Eagles is especially legendary.) But this is also a guy who sits front row at Louis Vuitton shows, so a rugby shirt with a bit more flair feels entirely in his wheelhouse. Not sure what to wear while spring dukes it out with winter for control of your closet? You could do a lot worse than ripping a page from the Bradley Cooper playbook and hunkering down in a grown-man rugby shirt of your own.

    "title": "Why Are Today’s Manly Men So Afraid of Cities?",
    "article_text": "On the latestSaturday Night Live, James Austen Johnson, in character as Donald Trump, dropped a callback to previous episode’s musical guest, Morgan Wallen, who had famously scampered offstage while the credits were still rolling and then posted “Get me to God’s country” over a photo of his private jet. “I even put tariffs on an island uninhabited by humans,” said Austen as Trump. “It’s called Heard and McDonald Island. I would love to visit there. Can you imagine that? Big Mac and a hula skirt. Get me to God’s country, right? Remember that?” “Remember that” was the funniest bit, a meta-ish acknowledgement that one week later, the meme was stale enough for an out-of-touch Boomer’s sweaty callback. Old news or not, Wallen's apparent disgust with the city (he denied that “God’s country” was a dig at NYC orSNL, while immediately releasing merch emblazoned with the phrase) was merely the highest-profile example of certain type of guy who has been slowly coming into focus over the last few years. Later that same week, in fact, Deep Prasad, an Austin-based CEO of an AI startup (who is actually Canadian) claimed to have been shot at in San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf. “I’m still shaking,” Prasad tweeted immediately after the event. “They chased me to my hotel and shot the second time when I ran inside and got one of the staff to come out.” When police later said that Prasad had mistaken the sounds of fireworks for gunshots, he, predictably, doubled down, tweeting, “It is my opinion that @SFPD wrongly misclassified this as a use of fireworks case with zero investigation and it is dangerous to treat cases like this with such callousness. The city is dangerous. I have never experienced this in 30 years.” Around the same time, another AI CEO, Brian Chau, was going viral for ranting about the dangers of theothercoast. “A mere 8 hours in NYC and I understand why bankers hate poor people so much now,” Chau wrote. “i have never seen such an underclass so barbaric, shameless, and aimlessly aggressive. My understanding of new york politics has been revolutionized.” “Conservative man scared of cities” has beena thingsince long before any of these Twitter main characters came along. That’s partly why the Wallen jokes came so easily; they were practically already written. It’s been more than four years sinceElon MuskandJoe Roganloudly relocated from California to Texas, and hardly a day goes by without someone slightly less famous living out something similar. The idea that the cities, the coasts, and anywhere you aren’t personally familiar with are Godless cesspools of sin and filth is also, of course, nothing new. Older heads among us may remember John Rocker hitting basically all the bullet points way back in 1999, when he explained to aSports Illustratedreporter why he’d never play in New York: \"Imagine having to take the [No.] 7 train to [Shea Stadium] looking like you're [in] Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing. \"The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the foreigners,\" the 25-year-old Georgia native said. “You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this country?” Too many foreigners, too many poor people, too many gays—the specific foreigners and the hair colors may change, but the essential complaints remain the same. The cities are godless, unamerican, and non-white. “Urban” has been a byword for “Black” for years, with the “metro” in “metrosexual” performing basically the same function for gayness (or at least, for anything not quite hetero). The purple-haired political correctness of yesterday has become theblue-haired wokenessof today. There’s nothing wrong with preferring open spaces to cities, nature to concrete, or even not having to confront society’s angry dispossessed on the way to work (we make a lot political hay over whether the preferred response to the the homeless and mentally ill on the street should be anger, fear, pity, or indifference). “Settled and populated” can easily become associated with despoiled and corrupted. To some extent, we’re a nation founded on such ideas. “There’s no such thing as American history, there’s only a frontier!” bellows Don Draper in the midst of an epiphany onMad Men. If you don’t like something, just run away! The myth of the cowboy, the settler, or the frontiersman who gazes boldly at the horizon and sees opportunity remains so ingrained even now that a president can base his entire campaign onechoing an earlier fake cowboy president(there’s probably a metaphor for the state of pop-country music in there as well—the third-hand odes to characters we forgot were fiction). The politics of colonialism aside, there is something admirable about boldly venturing into the unfamiliar (hopefully without being an asshole when you get there). So why now are the startup CEOs, the country singers,the professional fighters—today’s models of the intrepid manly man—seemingly so allergic to exactly that? Their language may occasionally draw on the Davy Crockett mythos, but what they’re really saying is “these new experiences are scary to me.” Even worse, they tend to take a bragging tone—a kind of crybullying. They preface rants about urban anarchy with “I don’t care if this is offensive,” or qualify them with preemptive defenses on the grounds of speaking one’s truth. Days after his fireworks kerfuffle, Prasad retweeted apostthat read, “wow, it turns out, if you write vulnerably on the internet, some people will actually be evil and try to prey on you.” Even the most stridently anti-woke seem to invoke therapy-speak whenever convenient. “You can’t yell at me if I’m already crying” is how Felix Beiderman of Chapo Trap House once summed up the unspoken mantra of the modern American male. And the boogie men are no longer restricted to coastal cities: the Blowhard Softboi now sees nefarious others even in the shadows of “God’s Country.” Maybe you’ve seen the viral TikTok in which a man, strolling with his carefree female companion, tactically assesses the threats around him like a suburban Robocop. In this post (seemingly now deleted), he makes walking down some everyday street seem like Rambo slipping into enemy territory. That is, perhaps, the rub: that the guys who once keptSoldier of Fortunemagazine next to the toilet are now fantasizing not about infiltrating a secret Vietcong prison camp or taking down a Mexican drug lord, but rather dreaming up reasons to unleash their fury and YouTube weapons training on the mean streets of Lincoln, Nebraska. The modern tough guy takes political polarization to its logical extreme, targeting not just foreign enemies or gays or minorities, but, in a classic case of mission creep,allof America's city dwellers. And while it’s tempting (and let’s be honest,fun) to dunk on macho men trying to rebrand fear as virility, it also brings to mind Gore Vidal’s old quote about Teddy Roosevelt: “Give a sissy a gun and he’ll shoot everything in sight.”",

    "title": "How Warfare’s All-Star Cast Made the Most Intense Iraq War Film Ever",
    "article_text": "The A24 movieWarfare, fromCivil Wardirector Alex Garland and combat veteran-turned-co-director Ray Mendoza, is a detailed recreation of an actual Iraq War battle that took place in 2006. A group of Navy SEALs on a counterinsurgency mission—including Mendoza—found themselves trapped in a house in Ramadi and had to extricate themselves (and several critically injured compatriots) while under near-constant assault from opposing forces. It’s an intense viewing experience, and for the cast—a group of young actors whose collective resumé includesStranger Things,The Bear,Heartstopper,Shogun,Reservation Dogs,May December, and basically every other buzzy movie and television project in recent memory—it was an intense film to make, and one that fostered deep bonds among the performers. So what happens when you send some of the most sought-after young male actors to boot camp together? You get wrestling matches, tattoos, and one of the most distressingly realistic war films in recent memory.WarfarestarsWill Poulter,Charles Melton,Joseph Quinn,Kit Connor,Cosmo Jarvis,D'Pharoah Woon-A-TaiandMichael Gandolfinitold us some of their stories from the set. Before filming began, the actors underwent a three week boot camp where they trained as their characters would. Joseph Quinn:It was pretty funny. It was a little boarding school for boys, for bad boys, out in the middle of nowhere. We were in Penally Manor. Shout out to Penally Manor. Thank you for looking after us. They were very kind. We did lots of weapons training, physical drills, leadership tasks, and tried to foster this culture of camaraderie. When I say try—we didn't have to try very hard. Ray [Mendoza] was like, \"It's up to you guys to create the culture here.\" So we took the guys out and we had some laughs—but in the actual participating of the boot camp, it was long days. And the efficacy with which we had to present these characters at the end of three weeks was a little daunting, because I myself had no experience with weapons. We were fortunate enough to have some of the cast who were pretty proficient, and they were able to give us a hand, along with Ray's expertise. Michael Gandolfini:It was going to be a very taxing shoot. I was so moved by Alex [Garland]'s love and kindness and just stern honesty. \"If you do want to do this movie, you have to be able to do things that are very hard.\" And it was a really frank, honest and touching conversation in and around not only the emotional aspects, but also, \"Do you think you can train?\" He was like, \"I don't want you to look a different way. I don't want you to have a six-pack. I don't want you to do anything other than functionally be able to put 60 to 80 pounds on your back and run for eight hours.\" The physical nature of my life is: I'm not going to the gym every day. It's just not the household I grew up in. So it's a transition. I had a training regimen and I worked very, very hard in order to functionally be able to do the things that I needed to do. D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai:While we were in training boot camp one of Ray's priorities was making sure we were safe with the weapons. I understand completely because a lot of us, this was our first time handling guns. We did shoot—with real rifles, just with blanks. So it was a lot of responsibility to him to make sure that we were safe. He really drilled that into all of us, that we had to be safe. Cosmo Jarvis:One of the things I found challenging was anything to do with firearms, because, to me, there seemed to be a lot of moving parts. But there were guys in the cast who'd served as well, and they would help. We would help each other. A lot of the other cast members who were more familiar would help. We would teach each other things that other guys were struggling with. And that was kind of a deliberate part of the process. Kit Connor:Near the end, we all geared up and had all of our weapons, and we went on patrol and were basically given a stretcher and one of us had to get on the stretcher. We were under time conditions and we had to carry a lot of weight from A to B. We had certain people on the comms. It was kind of putting all of our training to the test and giving us a taste of what filming would be like, and again, just putting our bonds and our camaraderie to the test as well, I suppose. I remember there was a thought of having Will Poulter on the stretcher, and then we realized, \"Oh no, he's one of the largest human beings on that set, so let's maybe not do that.\" Mendoza and Garland appointed Poulter, Quinn, and Melton as the leaders of the company, just like their characters were leaders of their respective OPs. That meant there was a rank on set unlike other productions. Charles Melton:Alex and Ray, more specifically Ray, came to us at the start of the boot camp and was like, \"Look, you guys are leadership and the culture is up to you guys.\" So it was an opportunity with the responsibility that everyone took and with the reverence that we had for the project and to really have discussions and determine just how we wanted to do it together. And a part of the culture was, the team comes first before the individual. As an actor, it's always me. For me personally, I'm always like,Me, me, me. But it was a very beautiful thing to come to where there's this team element. Woon-A-Tai:I would call Charles Melton “Sir.” I would call Will “Sir.” I would ask Will to use the restroom, if I may. So this superiority complex that they have in the military very much was both on-screen and off—in a positive way. Melton:We got watches for everybody. Will Poulter:[The watches] were G-Shocks. And basically it was Charles's idea to put together a pack for all the guys. It was a really beautiful act of leadership from Charles to do that for the guys. I was just getting really pissed off with people being late. And I basically said to the guys one day at boot camp, I was like, \"Listen.\" I was like, \"Charles was kind enough to arrange watches for you all. There's now absolutely no excuse. So starting tomorrow if anyone comes up to me and asks me what the time is, I basically said, I'm going to tell you to F off.\" And I meant it. Melton:Will was like, \"Okay, it's 0600. We have to make sure you guys eat, get done by 0630, get into hair and makeup by 0645, be fully rigged at 0700. We're all going to leave as OPs at 0715 and go to the marquee at 0730 and then we're going to rehearse at 0800.\" It was very precise. The guys who played communications officers would keep up the lingo even off camera. Woon-A-Tai:When we're one set, me, Finn, Michael, Adain [Bradley]—we would all be just talking to each other on the radios. And it was just a lot of fun. I mean, we would play around with it a little bit. We were bored a lot of the time, so we would just joke around with each other, do radio checks, just check up on each other. I think that it really bonded us together. Gandolfini:It created this environment ofComms comes first. Good lord, we really struggled. And then we'd have to take our notes. But as we got there, you’re really like,Oh, I really am starting to get this and I'm starting to get the cadence to it. I know what they're saying.\"Interrogative: Do you want a Coke from crafty?\" You just start to learn the language. And it wasn't only the language, but it was the way in which there's a musicality. The cast spent a lot of time together. Not only were they bunking in the same place, but Garland and Mendoza required everyone to come to set even when they weren't on camera. So what did they do to pass the time? Shit talking, wrestling, and games of Mafia. Joseph Quinn:Talking incomprehensible amounts of shit with each other. I think it was just stupid, stupid jokes for five weeks. Dumb bits. You get creative in those situations and there was a lot of laughter. There were a lot of funny men in this film, and so we were able to pass the time pretty effectively. Woon-A-Tai:A bunch of us wrestled each other. I put Noah [Centineo] on his ass. He could back me up on that. But very healthy things, stuff that doesn't matter. There were a lot of people who put other people on their ass. We didn't go by the ranks and like, \"Okay, you won. You go face me now.\" We were just like, all right, Noah versus DP. All right, boom. Noah kicked my ass twice. I kicked his ass once. I say I win. You know what I mean? Poulter:I still haven't got over the fact that Charles beat me in a wrestling match. It's still a major sore point. That was the really lovely thing—and also, again, slightly modeled, I think, on the big gentlemen we were representing. There's an interesting thing, with the nature of their personalities. They are authoritative and they are kind of severe when they have to be, but they are also, at the end of the day, a teammate before they are an individual. They also won't ask any of the guys to do anything that they wouldn't do themselves. Gandolfini:The surreal nature of this group is how much we love each other and how much fun we have doing nothing. We would pretty much sit around a table and piss our pants for hours. We would play little games, we would do Mafia, we would talk, we would piss our pants. The responsibility The cast also spent time with the veterans whose story they were telling.The film is dedicated to Elliott Miller,played in the film by Jarvis. Miller was on set during production; other actors sought out their real life counterparts as well. Jarvis:[I spent] a fair bit of time [with Elliott] when work wasn't occurring. We all did. Everybody. He was staying in the same place that we were staying. And so we would see him every evening. He came later in the shoot, but once he was there, he was there. And yeah, a fair bit of time just talking about anything really. It wasn't necessarily always about the work, but it was just great that he was there, because it's such an unusual thing for him to be a part of a process of the recreation of an event that he was present for and involved in. And it was another one of the many things in the process that really amplified the stakes and the responsibility and I guess gave credence to Ray and Alex's original mission statement. Gandolfini:We spoke a lot, actually. I had been offered the role, but I wanted to just ask his permission, in a way. So that was the beginning, just getting to know each other. And then I just asked him, \"What are you willing to talk about? What are your boundaries regarding this event?\" First, we went through the whole day, just the actions. Then, another time, we went through the feelings, the emotions. Then we went through why he joined and how he met Ray and how he ended up in Ramadi. That was incredibly helpful. And then his temperament. One of the things that struck me was in many ways I thought, \"Okay, all right, as an actor, now this will be my moment to cry or break down or whatever.\" What actually happened was he just disassociated and was like, \"This whole thing's a training exercise.\" So it was quite interesting to play that sort of numbness. It informed absolutely everything, down to the way he talked, down to the words I used, down to the actions I used. One of the major talking points of the press tour has been a tattoo the guys got after filming. The first wave of the cast got it right after wrap. Others held out a little bit longer. Connor:We all got it on the day of the wrap party, which was the day after our last day of shooting. There was a thought: \"Gosh, what if we're going to regret this the next day?\" But I look at it every day and I go, \"Yep, I'm glad I did that.\" I put it on the inside of my arm, which is much, much easier to show people because I didn't really love the idea of having to pull my trousers down to show people my tattoo. But all of the others were a bit more keen to do that, it seems. It's three words. It's just\"Call on me,\"which is a reference to the song at the beginning of the film. Gandolfini:We were sitting at lunch and were like, \"We're never going to do it if we don't do it right now.\" So 10 of us went to this poor tattoo shop in Soho in London and I was just like, \"Can you tattoo 15 guys?\" We went in batches, though, and then everyone got it. And then Will, Joe and Finn [Bennett] were the last three. Will and Joe got it yesterday afternoon and surprised us last night, and Finn got it late last night. Poulter:Joe and I got them together in secret, but we hadn't yet been able to decipher exactly how we were going to reveal it to the guys together. Joe was paired with Kit for press and I was paired with D'Pharaoh and Charles. Joe took it upon himself to just reveal it to Kit in the middle of an interview, so I did the same thing to Charles and D'Pharaoh. So we did it separately, and then the wider group found out the other night.",

    "title": "The Increasingly Global Case Against Andrew Tate",
    "article_text": "In late 2014, a British woman saw a gun on influencerAndrew Tate’s sofa, she recently claimed in a lawsuit. Shetoldthe BBC that she didn’t mention seeing it, but she was “a bit freaked out by it.” When she slept with Tate, she said, the sex began as consensual, but then he strangled her until she lost consciousness and still continued. Another of the four women who filed the suit claimed that, amid his daily threats while she worked for him, Tate waved a gun in her face, calling himself a “boss” and a “G.” “You’re going to do as I say or there’ll be hell to pay,” she claimed he said as he pointed the gun. On two other occasions, she said, Tate grabbed her by the throat and pinned her against a wall. As Tate has become a global force in recent years, his online rhetoric has become a familiar language. At the same time, allegations of his sexual violence have proliferated. Other accusations in the recent suit, which seeks damages “arising from the assaults, batteries, and infliction of intentional harm,” include a claim that Tate told a woman, “I’m just debating whether to rape you or not,” before raping and strangling her. The case concerns incidents that occurred in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015. Tate, a 38-year-old dual US-UK citizen, has denied the claims in a written response, calling them a “pack of lies” and “gross fabrications,” according to the BBC. (When reached for comment, his British attorney referredVanity Fairto that reply.) Two of the four women worked for Tate’s webcam business, while the other two were in relationships with him. Three of the accusers reported Tate to the police, but criminal charges were not brought. In his response, Tate also said that too much time had elapsed for the women to take legal action against him. For about the last two years, Tate and his brother,Tristan,were on and off house arrest in Romania, where they face charges of human trafficking and establishing a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. Tate has also been charged with rape, and the brothers deny all allegations against them. Florida recently opened a criminal investigation into the brothers, an effort Tate has described as “trying to find crimes on an innocent man.” That inquiry followed the brothers’ brief return to the US after their travel ban was lifted. In a recentCalifornia lawsuit, an ex-girlfriend of Tate’s accused him of physical and sexual abuse during a 10-month relationship that began last year, which he has denied. In a statement toVanity Fair,Tate’s American attorney,Joseph McBride,compared his client toDonald Trumpand Jesus, writing, “Andrew has formidable enemies who despise him, much like Trump’s enemies despise Trump and Jesus’s enemies despised Jesus.” “Andrew Tate is not without sin,” he added. “However, the idea that Andrew is a rapist or abuser of women is a fiction fabricated by his incel feminist enemies.” A lawyer for Tate’s four UK accusers told the BBC that his clients had “been denied justice by the police and [the Crown Prosecution Service] while watching Andrew Tate's influence grow.” One of the women said that watching the brothers travel in recent months was “horrible to see.” \"Maybe men will look at him,” she told the outlet, “and think, Oh, well if he can get away with that, then so can I, and it kind of makes it normalized.” As Tate has reemerged in the early days of Trump’s second administration, he has made the case for his innocence—and relevance—in some of the samealternative media quartersthat the president sought out during his campaignpress tour. During a recentinterviewwith Fort Lauderdale entrepreneur and podcasterPatrick Bet-David,Tate defended himself against criticisms lobbed byDave Portnoy, Ben Shapiro,andRon DeSantis.He also described the makeup of his audience, saying that he was used to hearing from people in Mongolia, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, and the Arab world. Of particular interest, he said, were “hundreds of letters from women in Tennessee or Kentucky or Alabama who are raising their sons without a father, and they say that I help them teach their boys how to be men.” In this sort of interview setting, Tate is often understood as a canny political observer. He and Bet-David discussed Trump’s intermittent proposal to instate the death penalty for drug dealers as a means of deterrence. “It’s a solution,” Tate said. “Often what you’ll do, and I actually think Trump is smart enough to understand this—he says things that gets people very emotionally upset. But what did we say earlier about the threat of violence? You won’t need the death penalty if you have the threat of the death penalty.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Kamala Harris’s Next Moves? A Big Speech, a Bigger Book, and Perhaps a Run for Office",
    "article_text": "Kamala Harriswas most definitely sayingI told you soaboutDonald Trump.Last week the former vice president made a surprise appearance at a women’s leadership conference in California’s Orange County, giving her first extended remarks since her November 6 concession speech. Harris’s tone was somber, with one major exception. “There were many things that we knew would happen,” she said before departing from her written text. “I’m not here to say I told you so! I swore I wasn’t gonna say that!” With that, Harris briefly backed away from the mic, laughing and grinning. “I thought she performed incredibly well—one of her best speeches,” saysAshley Etienne,who worked as Harris’s communications director during her first year as vice president and was in the room last week. “The way I read it was, she felt a little lighter in her presentation but heavier in the depth of what she was saying.” Those eight minutes may have also been a preview of what’s to come: Harris, according to an associate, is now writing a longer and broader speech that will address the chaotic moment the country is enduring, with a tentative aim of delivering it in the next several months. She is also at work on a book. Both moves will stoke even more speculation about Harris’s plans, which are already the subject of considerable debate in her own camp: Should she run for governor of California in 2026 or mount a third presidential bid in 2028? Or none of the above? “She’s taking a second to figure out how she can best serve in this moment,” a senior adviser says. “People are expecting her to only be guided by this blind ambition of, ‘I want to be in charge,’ when in fact a lot of the roles she’s played are because one, she wants to do the job, but two, she knows how she can make the biggest difference.” Harris has mostly been offstage during President Trump’s first 100 days, drawing some criticism from a Democratic Party in search of leadership. She certainly earned a break, having run a frantic 107-day presidential campaign, which saw her pile up 75 million votes but lose the Electoral College decisively. Harris took ashort vacationin Hawaii, put on a stoic face atTrump’s inauguration, andhelped distributefood in Altadena amid the January wildfires in Southern California. Harris has also, a friend says, been catching up on her passion for cooking, spending time with her nieces and nephews, and soliciting suggestions for TV shows to binge-watch. But even though Harris is out of elected office for the first time in 21 years, she is not entirely out of the game. She has been working the phones; focusing on how to improve the party’s state-level infrastructure and social media presence; chatting up donors; and congratulating activists for helping defeat four Republicanballot measuresin Louisiana. Harris has also been assessing the reasons for her defeat, if not dwelling on the what-ifs. “In my experience, she is not the kind of person who ruminates on the past,” saysJamal Simmons,who served as vice presidential communications director in the middle of Harris’s term. “Working for her, sometimes you want to spend time licking your wounds or celebrating your success. She’s thinking about, Here’s where we are—what do we need to do to get to the next place? You’re like, Can we have a cocktail first?” Her team’s early reading, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that Harris wasn’t the problem in 2024. “What she ran on—health care and housing and small businesses—that wasn’t the wrong message,” saysSheila Nix,Harris’s chief of staff during the campaign and now in private life. “The people who heard that message, they liked it. So it shouldn’t be, ‘Oh my God, throw your hands up in the air. We don’t even know what to say to people.’ No, that’s not true. The values she talked about and the things she cared about were important to the people who heard them.” One obvious place for Harris to go next is the 2026 California governor’s race—an option too obvious, in the view of some of her advisers, who see quickly jumping into the contest as the political equivalent of dating a rebound boyfriend. Others believe she’ll be unable to stay out of the action for long. “She hasn’t been out of public service during her entire career,” a Harris insider says. “I think it will be difficult for her to pass up a bird in the hand.” Harris has told allies she will make up her mind by the end of this summer. At least 10 Democrats have already declared their candidacy to succeed the term-limited current governor,Gavin Newsom.Harris would instantly become the front-runner if she were to join the field, and most of the other Democratic candidates would probably step aside, though former Los Angeles mayorAntonio Villaraigosahas said he’dstay inthe fight, and he could be formidable in a runoff. “He has a stronger relationship with Republicans in the state than Kamala does, and he has a more real relationship with Latino voters across the state than Kamala does,” saysMike Trujillo,a former strategist for Villaraigosa’s mayoral campaign. In March, former representativeKatie Porter,another Democrat in the gubernatorial race, also made anindirect digat Harris’s delayed decision-making: “No one should be waiting to lead. I think we need to make a case right now.” Yet Harris needs to determine whether she wants to run for president again in three years before deciding whether she wants to run for governor next year. Her keeping the national option open provided a not-so-subtle subtext for her speech last week: It came as possible 2028 Democratic primary rivals—including New Jersey senatorCory Booker,Illinois governorJB Pritzker,Connecticut senatorChris Murphy,New York congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez,and even former Harris running mateTim Walz,the governor of Minnesota—have been aggressively promoting themselves. They are in the middle of the conversation that has been raging for the past few months, about how the Democratic Party can and should remake itself—a discussion from which Harris has been largely absent. “I think she deserves to be part of that conversation. She’s earned the right to put her thumb on the scale of what’s next here,” a Harris insider says. “Democrats, in general, are lacking messengers who have name ID and respect. And I think people need to remember that she only lost the popular vote by 1.5%.” Maybe Harris will benefit from maintaining a relatively low profile for now, allowing Trump to flail and giving voters space to forget what they disliked about her. But if she ramps up her visibility without a more potent message, she risks allowing an unflattering conventional wisdom to congeal. “Right after the election, people were like, ‘Oh, she did everything she could,’” a former high-ranking Biden-Harris campaign operative says. “Now the consensus is building that the future of the party isn’t someone like her—an overly cautious candidate who let other people define her and played things extremely, extremely safe. And even in 2028, the Biden baggage is gonna be an issue for her.” As thoroughly as Harris laughed at her own joke last week, she certainly can’t enjoy being proven right about Trump and watching from the sidelines as he demolishes the federal government and so many democratic norms. Harris closed her speech by vowing, “I’m not going anywhere.” Now she just needs to figure out where, exactly, she wants to go.

    "article_text": "Jillian Lauren Shriner, wife of Weezer bassistScott Shriner, was involved in a bizarre and dangerous situation with the Los Angeles Police Department outside her home in Eagle Rock, California Wednesday afternoon. According toa Wednesday LAPD press release, officers were looking for three suspects in a hit-and-run incident and arrived in Shriner’s neighborhood. The 51-year-old, who recently underwent a hysterectomy and other surgeries to treat an unspecified form of canceraccording to a March 4 social media post, met police while holding a handgun. According to the media release, Shriner was told to drop the gun repeatedly, did not, and then pointed the gun at the officers. She was shot by police, resulting in a non-life-threatening wound. She then reportedly went into her house and emerged after some time with another woman. She was then arrested, taken to a hospital for treatment, and booked for attempted murder in absentia. She was released that evening on a $1 million bond, official records show, and is due on felony charges in Los Angeles Superior Court on April 30. According to a local CBS affiliate, Shriner told police that she had the gun because she was defending her home from the hit-and-run suspects they were looking for. LAPD did not returnVanity Fair’s request for comment. Shriner is an author, and under the name Jillian Lauren (her middle name)has written two memoirs,Some Girls: My Life In a HaremandEverything You Ever Wanted, about her earlier life as a call girl to the prince of Brunei, a novel,Pretty, and most recently a true-crime book,Behold the Monster, about serial killer Samuel Little. Shriner’s manager did not returnVanity Fair’s request for comment. She and husband Scott Shriner are parents to two sons, whom they adopted, and she is an advocate for adoption. She frequently posts photos of her family on her social media accounts. Her husband has been the bassist for the rock band Weezer since 2001, and is set toperform with the band at the Coachella music festivalon Saturday.

    "title": "Everything to Know About the Met Gala 2025: Theme, Hosts, Dress Code & More",
    "article_text": "Fashion enthusiasts have long had the first Monday in May circled on their calendars: It’s nearly time for theMet Gala 2025. Formally called the Costume Institute Benefit, the Met Gala is the annual fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. In practice, it’s one of the year’s most coveted invitations, where around 450 of the biggest names in fashion, entertainment, culture, and politics gather in support of the cultural institution while donning dazzling designer looks. Below, everything you need to know about the Met Gala 2025. The Met Gala, also known as the Costume Institute Benefit and sometimes called the Met Ball, is the annual fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. It also celebrates the opening of the year’s Costume Institute exhibit, with guests dressing to correspond with the night’s theme. The Met Gala is the museum’s biggest fundraiser of the year: In 2024, the eventraised roughly $26 millionfor the Costume Institute. The first benefit was held in 1948, and since 1995, the Met Gala has been chaired by Condé Nast global chief content officer andVogueeditor in chiefAnna Wintour. The Met Gala 2025 will take place on Monday, May 5, 2025. The red carpet typically opens at 5:30 p.m. ET. This year’s Costume Institute exhibition istitled “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” and spotlights the Black dandy, a historical cultural figure that prioritizes fine dressing over all. The exhibit is partially inspired byMonica L. Miller’s 2009 bookSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, and Miller serves as guest curator alongside Costume Institute curator in charge,Andrew Bolton. The exhibit will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and other fine art, texts, and relics from a variety of artists, representing dandyism from the 18th century to the present day. It will be organized into 12 sections exploring different aspects of the concept: ​​Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook, Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism. Another important reference point for the exhibit is Zora Neale Hurston’s1934 essay “Characteristics of Negro Expression,”if you’re eager for background reading ahead of the event. Tyler Mitchellwill provide the photography for the exhibition’s catalog. This year’sMet Gala dress code was announcedin February: Guests are instructed to wear their best interpretations of Tailored for You, inviting a personal take on the exhibit’s themes of tailoring, menswear, and individual expression of identity through fashion and presentation. Given the focus on menswear in “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” expect to see a good amount of suiting and men’s-inspired looks making their way up the iconic Met steps. Every year, the Met Gala welcomes a handful of A-list co-chairs as hosts for the event, and this year is no different:Colman Domingo,Lewis Hamilton,A$AP Rocky,andPharrell Williamswill serve as co-chairs and hosts alongside Wintour, withLeBron Jamesalso stepping in as an honorary chair.

    "title": "Donald Trump Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, Retaliating Against Anyone Who Resisted His Lies About the 2020 Election",
    "article_text": "In case you have any doubts,Donald Trumpis still mad about 2020. On Wednesday, he announced he was targeting Susman Godfrey, the New York–based firm that representedDominion Voting Systemsin its defamation suit against Fox News. That dispute, if you needed a refresher, over whether the network and its parent company knowingly broadcasted baseless conspiracies about Dominion being involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election, ended with the news outlet settling the case in 2023 for$787.5 million. The president signed an executive order that would immediately suspend security clearances for employees of Susman Godfrey LLP and told reporters, during the signing, “There were some very bad things that happened with these law firms.” Also apparently on the president’s 2020 hitlist: former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency directorChris Krebs, whose rejection of Trump’s voter fraud claims during the 2020 election pushed him out of his position, and Department of Homeland Security officialMiles Taylor, who anonymously wrote a 2018New York Timesop-edclaiming he was part of the “resistance” inside the Trump administration.The executive order strips Taylor and Krebsof any remaining security clearance they may hold since leaving office and calls for Attorney GeneralPam Bondiand Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noem to probe both former officials. “I think what he did, and he wrote a book, ‘Anonymous,’ said all sorts of lies, bad things– and I think it’s, I think it’s like a traitor, like, it’s like spying,” Trump stated. “I think it’s a very important case, and I think he’s guilty of treason if you want to know the truth, but we’ll find out.” Taylorresponded to the president on X, noting that the president had “inelegantly” proved his point: “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.” Susman Godfrey also responded to Trump’s executive order, affirming that the firm would put up a challenge: “Anyone who knows Susman Godfrey knows we believe in the rule of law, and we take seriously our duty to uphold it. This principle guides us now. There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order.” The orders arrived asSteven Banks,leader of the pro bono practice at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, announced his resignation—just weeks after the elite firm struck a deal with Trump to evade an executive order that hindered its ability to represent clients before the federal government. In March,Trumphanded down a directive aimed at lawyers and firms he perceived were engaging in “frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.” The responses to the administration’s focus on dissidence in the legal sphere have run the gambit. Some are in league with Susman Godfrey, likeWilmerHaleandPerkins Coie, refusing to bow while others, including Paul Weiss, have conceded. Banks doesn’t attribute his move directly tothe deal struck with Trump. “This has been weighing on me since the November election,” Banks said in a statement. “At this historical moment, I know that I belong back on the front lines fighting for the things that I have believed in since I first walked in the door of The Legal Aid Society as a staff attorney in 1981.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "King Charles and Queen Camilla’s Marriage Thrives on Friendship—And Having Their Own Bedrooms",
    "article_text": "This week,King Charles IIIandQueen Camillacelebrated their 20th anniversary witha romantic photo shoot in Rome—anda 20-minute meetingwithPope Francis.The couple, who were married in an April 2025 civil ceremony three decades after they first met, have been showing off their close relationship through trips to iconic locations and jaunts for ice cream during their royal tour of Italy. As a sign of her affection, the queen even rewore her wedding dresson Wednesday. According to one commentator, their majesties’ relationship works well for a few simple reasons. “They have known each other since [they were] very young and are great friends. There is no competitive edge between King Charles and Queen Camilla,” broadcasterHelena ChardtoldFox News. “They have also sussed out the best sleeping arrangements. At Clarence House, they are privileged to have their own bedrooms as well as their shared bedroom.” Charles and Camillafirst moved into Clarence House, which belonged to the Queen Mother for more than 40 years, in 2002. At the beginning of the king’s reign in 2022, the couple decided that they would stay thererather than occupy Buckingham Palace, the monarch’s traditional home, due in part to ongoing renovations, which are expected to last until 2027. Charles and Camilla are not the only monarch and consort to have separate bedrooms in addition to a shared bedroom, and in fact, it wasa practicethat Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip also kept throughout their marriage. In the 19th and 20th century, it was common for members of the British aristocracy and royal family to keep separate bedrooms whether or not their relationships were strong. Inhis 1991 memoirabout his time serving as Lord Mountbatten’s valet, William Evans explained that the practices derived from “the diversity of their interests and duties” between Mountbatten and his wife, Lady Edwina Mountbatten. “Most of the royal family and British aristocracy” followed suit, Evans wrote, because “practical considerations override personal ones.” When Charles and Camilla wed in 2005, seven years after the death of Princess Diana, his mother did not attend the wedding because both were divorced. The couple chose a civil ceremony to avoid religious controversy, and, as the head of the Church of England at the time, the late queenreportedlybelieved she was not allowed to attend a nonreligious wedding ceremony. The couple also owns separate country homes. Charles boughtHighgrove Estatea year before his first marriage, and he and Diana werebelievedto sleep in separate bedrooms in that home. Before marrying Charles, Camilla had lived in her private home, Ray Mill House, and she has held onto the property ever since. Most years, she will spend a week vacationing in the house alone, and during the pandemic, her sonTom Parker Bowlesquarantined in the house with his two children.

    "article_text": "In a speech on Wednesday, Michigan governor and occasional Democratic presidentialprospectGretchen Whitmersaidthat political partisanship has “infected every aspect of our lives.” She’s right. Which is precisely why there was no winning when she stepped into the Oval Office that same day for a meeting withDonaldTrump, where he proceeded to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was “rigged” and signedexecutive orderslaunching investigations into two former officials who dared to challenge him. Whitmer had extended an olive branch of bipartisanship—and the president thwacked her with it. “Just a f---ing disaster,” one Democratic operativetoldNBC News. Whitmer’s goal in meeting with Trump was ostensibly to discuss issues impacting Michiganders. And during the visit, the president lavished praise on Whitmer, who he oncecalleda “dictator” for imposing COVID restrictions. “She’s really done an excellent job,” Trump said Wednesday. “Very good person.” But a compliment from Trump can be a kiss of death for Democrats—particularly against the backdrop of Trump’s actions on Wednesday. The executive orders he signed stripped security clearances from two men:Chris Krebs, former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who has refuted Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen, andMiles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymouslyauthoreda scathing book about Trump’s first term. The orders also instructed the DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security to launch investigations into both former officials. They were but the latest in astringof similar actions Trump has taken against his critics. In a statement to NBC, a spokesperson for Whitmer said, “The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during President Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter. Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.” But Whitmer's inadvertent photo op hardly seemed like an accident for the White House. Instead, it exposed the risk of trying to engage in bipartisan discussions with an administration that has shown so little interest in doing do.

    "title": "Usha Vance Is Apparently Loving Her New Role, Kennedy Center Boos and All",
    "article_text": "Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States and wife of vice presidentJD Vance, didn’t think anyone would notice, let alone care, when in March she and her husband headed out for a date night at the Kennedy Center. She thought wrong. In her first interview sinceDonald Trumpmoved back into the White House, and she and her family took up residence in the Naval Observatory,Vance told theFree Pressaboutgetting booed by the crowdthat night. “It was about 20 or 30 seconds of some people booing and delaying the start of the concert, right as the conductor is about to come out, and there were a few other people clapping,” Vance recalled, noting that someone shouted “oh, fuck him!” up at their balcony seating, and someone else urged the building to “kill that light” to hide the couple from view. “JD waved at them, and then we enjoyed the show that we had come for.” This is just one of the ways that Vance, who elsewhere in the interview advocates for reading “paper books” and shares that her “highest priority right now is to be actually a normal person,” has had to adjust to her new life in its latest chapter. Her journey has already taken her to many previously unfamiliar territories: Yale, herhusband’s native Ohio(not Appalachia, as his detractors are quick to clarify), clerking for a pre-Supreme CourtBrett Kavanaugh, (one of two highly desirable clerkships with a “superhot judge” at the time, a former classmate told theFree Press), a white shoe law firm, and now Washington, DC’s most gilded halls. JD Vance is sworn in as US vice president as his wife Usha Vance and family and President Donald Trump look on in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Despite the lengthy piece being her supposed formal introduction to the public, Vance, the woman whom Trump on his inauguration day called “the only one smarter than [JD],” remains largely mysterious. “I would have chosen her,” Trump said then of choosing his vice president, “but somehow the line of succession didn't work that way. She's great.” Vance told theFree Pressthat “It’s a very strange life that we lead, where there are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us and what we think and what we do and why we do it and how much planning goes into it and all these sorts of things.” The narrative offered by former law school classmate and palJames Eimers, one of the few named sources in the article, is that Vance is “selfless” and has a “superhuman capacity to achieve.” To demonstrate how nice she is, he told a story about furniture. “In a somewhat ridiculous display of her devotion to a friend, Usha even went so far as to buy a table she didn’t really need from a particular student in the class a year ahead of us,” Eimers told theFree Press. “Usha knew that I had been looking for an unobtrusive scenario in which to ask the table seller on a date and that—with the table purchase—I would be forced to retrieve and transport the table for her because I owned the only pickup truck and served as the unofficial nonprofit moving company of our class.” “Shortly thereafter, I did indeed pick up Usha’s superfluous table. As well as a date with the table seller.” The table’s fate thereafter goes unmentioned. US Second Lady Usha Vance arrives at the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on March 28, 2025. The visit is viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation amid President Donald Trump's bid to annex the strategically-placed, resource-rich Danish territory. Vance, the nation’s first Asian-American and first Hindu second lady, has not yet announced a signature social cause for her time in the Trump administration, with herofficial White House biodescribing her as a “proud wife” and “mother of their three beautiful children” before touting her academic and legal bonafides, as well as love of orchestras. In theFree Pressarticle, it’s agreed that she’s one of her husband’s closest advisors, chatting with him about news and politics both in person and via text throughout the day. Despite that “almost uniformly positive” experience she touted so far, she did nod to the isolation of the role. “I don’t know that he’s asking me for advice so much as, it can be a very lonely, lonely world not to share with someone,” she said.

    "article_text": "One more time for those in the back:Michelle Obamaand former presidentBarack Obamaarenot getting divorced. In aninterview onSophia Bush’s podcast,Work in Progress, published Wednesday, the former first lady clarified that just because she’s not always physically with her husband, she’s stillwithhim. Alluding to her absence at both thestate funeral of former president Jimmy Carter in Januaryand the inauguration ofDonald Trumplater that same month, which her husband attended solo, Michelle stood beside her decisions to skip the occasions. “I chose to do what’s best for me, not what I had to do,” she said, not explicitly singling out either event. She has beencritical of Trump in the past, and has urged the worldnot to “normalize”him or his policies. The skipped engagements have been pointed to by conspiracy theorists, who, for months have claimed the pair are splitting up, sometimes with an also-untrue side of accusations thatBarack had an affair withJennifer Aniston, a rumor that Vanity Fair reported the long tail of, and debunked. On the podcast, Michelle continued that people “couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.” “This couldn’t be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?” she said. “But that is what society does to us.” Next thing you know, she’ll have her own credit card and decide what to wear without her husband’s approval. It’s a slippery slope. Michellerecently launched a podcast of her own, co-hosted with her brother,Craig Robinson, calledIMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. On theshow’s first episode, she talked about divorce—her brother’s, and how hurt she was when her sibling didn’t tell her about his split from his wife years ago.

    "title": "Sinners Is a Bloody and Bracing Study of History, With Vampires",
    "article_text": "After a decade ofCreedfilms andBlack Panthermovies, it’s a thrill to see writer-directorRyan Coogler—one of the great populist Hollywood talents working today—do something new. Though his latest film,Sinners(in theaters April 18), traffics in familiar horror-action tropes, its milieu and thematic arguments feel novel to the genre. Big, ambitious, and erratic,Sinnersis a wide-appeal studio movie from a filmmaker breathtakingly adept at the form. Sinnersis set in 1933 in the Mississippi Delta, where Black sharecroppers still work the cotton fields nearly 60 years after the end of slavery. Jim Crow laws bear down on these industrious communities, while the Ku Klux Klan lurks at the edges, ready to pounce. Amidst that oppression and fear, a vibrant culture—of church life, of emergent blues music—thrives. Coogler’s film is a tribute to those traditions, and a sorrowful, furious acknowledgment of the waves of aggressors who, decade after decade, have come to seize or destroy them. At the outset of the film, two prodigal sons have returned home. They’re twins who fled an abusive father for the freedoms, both real and only imagined, of Chicago, where they went to work for mobsters. Their names are Smoke and Stack, both played by a commanding, wilyMichael B. Jordan. Coogler’s muse (this is their sixth film together; Coogler has directed four of them) is in fine movie-star form inSinners, alluring even in moments of menace. The brothers’ plan, coolly elucidated by both Jordans, is to use the ill-gotten gains they’ve brought back from the North to open a juke joint, far from the prying eyes (and worse) of white people. They will, in essence, create a communal space for those who like to drink, dance, gamble, and otherwise carouse. It’s a scrappy and reckless dream, and a dangerous one. The first half of the film is about the process of making something, following the brothers as they commission local musicians to play at their venue—chief among them their talented young cousin, Sammie (newcomerMiles Caton, making an auspicious debut)—and attempt to attract crowds and solicit ancillary business. An exciting momentum builds, Sammie watching in giddy awe at what feels like the dawning of a new era of his life. Early in the film, Coogler introduces a concept, found in folklore across many cultures, that there are some rare people capable of making music with such fire that they conjure spirits, benevolent ancestors and demons alike. It seems that preacher’s son Sammie, who can wail on a guitar and sings in a plaintive deep baritone, is just such a figure. The juke’s opening night will be a realization of that mystical prowess. Given the time and place, it’s all too likely that trouble is rushing up to greet this fervid and merry occasion. Antagonism comes in the form of a mysterious man, Remmick (Jack O’Connell), possessed of his own lilting musicality and a hunger for human blood.Sinnersis a vampire movie, one that has tense fun with all the old rules—garlic, wooden stakes, needing an invitation to enter a building—but uses them in service of a sad, harrowing evocation of history. One could look at the two sides ofSinners—Black entrepreneurs, artists, and revelers versus predacious white fiends—and see an obvious intent. That is certainly a foundational tenet of the film’s thinking. But Coogler, as ever, digs deeper and complicates matters. Just as he presented a persuasive, nearly righteous villain inBlack Panther(said villain was played, of course, by Jordan), inSinners,Coogler lets Remmick make a tempting argument. It is implied that, when human, Remmick was an Irishman, and thus no stranger to the degradations and worse that come at the hands of a cruel ruling class. Vampirism, Remmick suggests, offers freedom from that—and the ability to truly, bloodily fight back. Coogler affords Remmick and his growing brood of ghouls their own musical moments, of Appalachian folk song and old Scotch-Irish tunes from which that American genre evolved. They’re lovely and haunting, suggesting some common but broken bond between many peoples—poor white immigrants, the descendants of slaves—who have found themselves in America, by choice or not, and had their culture and identities warped, maligned, mangled, snuffed out. PerhapsSinnersis urging that all are victims in a vicious class war that has been playing out in the Western world since, perhaps, that world began. It’s a provocative suggestion, one that Coogler manages to get across even when Remmick is doing gory, horrible things. And even when it is obvious that many of Remmick’s people bought into America’s racist hierarchy in exchange for a position slightly above the bottom. Sinnersis a horror-action-drama with an intelligent, sparking mind, a curious and gripping mix ofFrom Dusk ‘til Dawnexcess and serious sociopolitical discourse. It’s a film full of music, especially in one bold scene in which Coogler imagines a flattening of time. The long thread of music history is gathered into one nighttime party thumping with song, cultures and people gloriously converging and commingling, unaware of their influence on one another. Amidst those grand conceits, the film has stranger, less endearing quirks.Sinnersis leeringly preoccupied with the act of cunnilingus, and one particular, oft-repeated slang term for the vagina. Which exists in discomfiting dialogue with the film’s frequent insinuation that women are dangerous liabilities. Sinnersotherwise earns the ardor of its construction—of Coogler's steadfast command, ofLudwig Göransson’s deftly adaptive score,Autumn Durald Arkapaw's sumptuous photography,Ruth Carter's incisive costuming. The film is both playful and grave with its violent ends, enjoying spatters and spurts but also letting us feel the human loss at the center of that. The cast—which includesWunmi Mosaku(captivating as a grieving mother and shrewd mystic),Hailee Steinfeld(beguiling as a risky love interest), and an old blues man ready for kingdom come played by the legendDelroy Lindo—all groove at their own pleasing, offbeat rhythms. Sinnersis propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.Sinnersannounces a new and perhaps further elevated era of Coogler’s cinematic reach.

    "title": "So, Is Anyone Buying Team Trump’s Spin About His “Genius” Tariff Turnaround?",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpwasplayingchess, not checkers. Welcome to theart of the deal, folks. Amaster strategy! Chef’s kiss! The MAGA world’s reviews are rolling in for Trump’s massive tariff take-back, and they’re positively ecstatic. This, team Trump smugly insists, was the “strategy all along.” Except that all evidence is pointing to the contrary. Even the president didn’t stick to the party line. On Wednesday, as global markets descended into free fall, the president announced a 90-day pause on his so-called “reciprocal” global tariffs, while keeping his 125% tariffs on China in place. Explaining why, Trump said he made the call after watching the bond markets overnight. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” hetoldreporters. According toThe New York Times, Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentand Vice PresidentJ.D. Vancewere among the top officials trying to convince the president to take a more measured approach to his tariff plan behind the scenes. Even before the tariffs took effect at midnight Wednesday, Bessent was lobbying Trump to begin looking for an “endgame,” another sourcetoldPolitico. But Trump dug in his heels, refusing to budge until after it became clear that the market was about to descend into all-out panic. The White House’s claims that this was all part of Trump’s grand plan are also inconsistent with their defense of his posting spree on Truth Social. After all, what exactly was he doing when hetoldhis Truth Social followers that it was a “great time to buy” Wednesday morning, just hours before reversing course on his tariff plan, sending markets soaring? Democrats in Congress are already calling for investigations into alleged market manipulation. “Trump's 9:30am tweet makes it clear he was eager for his people to make money off the private info only he knew,” Connecticut senatorChris Murphypostedon X. In a statement to NBC News, a White House spokesperson dismissed the allegation. “It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,” spokesmanKush Desaisaid. The Trump administration is trying to have it both ways—insisting both that this was the president’s plan all along and that, as of Wednesday morning, he was just as blind as the rest of us as to what was coming next. At the very least, it says a whole lot about this White House that Trump’s team would rather insist they were all engaged in some Machiavellian plot to terrify the world into submission than admit that this president can sometimes be swayed by reason and overwhelming public backlash. As any strongman knows, admitting that may be the riskiest move of all.

    "title": "Diego Luna Is Ready for the Revolution",
    "article_text": "Diego Lunais one of Mexico’s most internationally known actors, as well as one of the most popular stars in his own country. After his early years acting in Mexican soap operas, he went on to steal the spotlight with his performance inY Tu Mamá También(2001), which also served to raise the profile of directorAlfonso Cuarón.From there, Luna has traveled a multifaceted path, working with indie royalty such asGus Van SantandHarmony Korine,mainstream giants likeSteven SpielbergandKevin Costner,venerable auteurs likeWoody AllenandBill Condon,and a good number of younger figures from the Mexican film world as well. His body of work is a testament to his versatility and maturity. Luna is also known to be one of the most affable men in a profession that includes many difficult stars. He’s directed short films, television series, videos, documentaries, and feature films. He has also produced more than 40 works, written screenplays, and even sung, without ever letting any of it go to his head. The Mexican actor now strikes again with the second season of one of TV’s most acclaimed recent series:Andor,premiering on Disney+ on April 22. Luna plays Cassian Andor, protagonist of a dark tale set in theStar Warsuniverse that has been described as “ifKen Loachhad made aStar Warsmovie.” Loach, a cult British director, has devoted his entire life to films portraying class struggle, the challenges facing working-class families, and even the Spanish Civil War. Many consider him to be one of the most militant filmmakers of his generation. “Wow. Bringing up a guy like him, with such a distinguished career, to talk aboutAndor—I think I know where you’re going,” says Luna. “The communities [in his films] have always needed to tell their stories, and it has never been more important to tell these stories from the bottom up, as he often does. Right now the world is defined by a struggle for power, and this series talks about exactly that.” Luna is no stranger to the world of the Jedi. His most commercial film to date,Rogue One—a critical as well as a popular success—is also set in theStar Warsuniverse, and many consider it the saga’s most unusual installment. “I thinkAndorwouldn’t exist withoutRogue One,” says Luna. “I also think thatRogue Oneis exceptional in every way.Andorhas a great plus, which is that you don’t have to have seen any of theStar Warsfilms to enjoy it. A number of people have told me, ‘I’m not interested inStar Wars,and I’ve never followed the movies. But I’ve seenAndorand I really like it.’ And that’s because if you like genres like political dramas, spy series, and mysteries, this is a series you can watch and enjoy without having to be a loyal follower of the saga.” Andorfound a place in the hearts of fans thanks to a story that skips clichés, instead describing a rebellion led by the galaxy’s forgotten and disinherited. The show feels enormously relevant. “I agree with that, but I’d add another thought,” Luna says. “This series would have been important 10 years ago and will be important 10 years from now, because it is a reflection on how communities can take control and fight for their destiny. It reflects on the responsibilities of being a citizen, which have long existed, are important now, and will continue to be in the future. “The characters inAndor,just like real human beings, often exist in gray areas,” he continues. “We portray real people, people without hope. They’re all downtrodden, but there’s still this sense that something has to happen. We know Cassian will become a hero, but we know there may be more than one path to that conclusion. This is something I’ve said many times before: When we talk about revolution, the message we’re sending out is that any revolution starts with yourself.” When I ask why a performer who came up through indie film agreed to something so far from his typical work, he explains: “I’ve been aStar Warsfan since I was a kid. I grew up with the first trilogy and became a fanatic. I played Jedi with my cousins, although I must admit that part of me was always drawn to the dark side. I can’t deny that.” He laughs. “I was the smallest of all my friends, and I went crazy playingStar Wars. “But to answer your question, the director ofRogue Onecame to see me, and told me that he wanted to make a very particularStar Warsmovie, with a different style of acting and hyperrealistic tone bordering on naturalism. He wanted to create something that was close to being almost like a documentary in its tone. ‘I want them to improvise, to take over the characters, the dynamics between them. I’d love to feel like I’m watching something likeY Tu Mamá También,’ he told us. At that moment I thought, Well, maybe this is a role for me.” But at the time, the actor didn’t know there was a catch. “When he approached me, he was suggesting that I audition to be in the film, but he still had to convince everyone else in charge. And then began an endless series of auditions and readings. In the end, everything went well. People enjoyed that it was different, darker, more mature. That you couldn’t watch it with a six-year-old because the ending was bleak. That was the big difference. Six-year-olds could watchStar Wars,I think.” ButRogue One,he says, went places that the other nine films in the franchise did not. Luna seesAndoras similar to its precursor, “because we didn’t have to prove anything.” Luna with Gael García Bernal and Maribel Verdú inY tu mamá también(2001). Luna’s acting career began early. As the son of set designer Alejandro Luna and costume designer Fiona Alexander, he easily slipped into the worlds of stage and screen. When he was only 13 years old, he was already acting in a telenovela calledEl Abuelo y Yo(Grandfather and I) from the Televisa network. He joined it after appearing in plays for years. “When you’ve been in this profession for as long as I have, there are many things that you stop worrying about. You don’t have as much stress, and problems seem less important,” he says. When asked if he has a plan for his career, Luna doesn’t hesitate: “There is no plan. In this profession, it’s almost impossible to follow a plan and it’s often even dangerous to think that you might have one. Of course, when I was 20 years old, I had an incredible plan.” Luna laughs again. “Then things happen, and the plan fades away. Now I don’t think about it anymore. I think about doing things that I feel really comfortable doing. That’s my top priority.” Luna’s father died in 2022. The actor has no doubts about the role his father played in shaping Luna’s future career. “My dad brought me to the theater and let me see everything about that world. That life has surrounded me until I’ve reached the point where I am today.” His immersion into the world of drama also involved another great figure: the legendary Mexican playwrightLuis de Tavira,who was Luna’s mentor and one of the forces influencing his decision, at the age of 15, to become serious about acting. “My father had his doubts and, of course, I also had my own, but I learned a lot about myself and about how you get ahead and how you face problems that come your way. When you’re very young, you see things with the perspective that age gives you and that perspective changes as you get older. That’s something you discover along the way, and I discovered it earlier than I probably would have otherwise.” Luna, Kevin Costner, and Robert Duvall inOpen Range(2003). Luna’s love for theater led him to television; from there he jumped to the movies. “My life revolved around acting,” he says. “I had a lot of free time to explore that world, and theaters and sets became my real home. I would spend days in the theater; there was no place else like it. I’m not talking only about rehearsals, the magic of the actors performing their crafts, or the stage when it is all lit up and ready for a performance. I’m also talking about those moments when you could see how everything fell into place, how a play came together, how it was created. I have never forgotten how I fell in love with the theater.” As an actor, director, and producer, Luna has also always been a determined activist. Proof of this can be seen in his production company, La Corriente del Golfo (translation: Gulf Stream), a project he started together with afriend whom he calls “mi hermano” (“my brother”)—Gael García Bernal.The company is dedicated to addressing a range of social problems. They launched it with a statement signed by both of them: “The Gulf Stream is an ocean current that rises from the Gulf of Mexico and reaches the North Atlantic, giving a temperate climate to a region that would otherwise be barren tundra. We adopt the name of this global current to emphasize how life can give us freedom, in all its meanings, as it flows like an ocean current.” Luna and García Bernal have long supported causes such as ending violence against women and threats to Mexican journalists, who often work in conditions where violence is a given. “I think the best way to explain it is that we let ourselves be carried along by that current. We want to get to where these stories are,” Luna says. Andoris not a conventional series, which is precisely why Luna accepted its starring role. “Andortalks about social issues that have always concerned me. I think that if a film or series doesn’t reflect the world we live in and if it doesn’t relate to who we are, it doesn’t matter. For me, what I want to do is get involved in things that are important to me.” The Disney+ series has also provided him with a more realistic perspective on his profession: “After the success ofRogue One”—which grossed more than a billion dollars worldwide—“I thought that from that moment on I could do whatever I wanted…and, well, no,” he says with a laugh. “WithAndor,I learned that you can push smaller projects and allow them to grow without setting any limits on them.” Luna and Elle Fanning inA Rainy Day in New York(2019). Despite a career that now spans more than three decades, many still know Luna best fromY Tu Mamá También,which he starred in alongside García Bernal andMaribel Verdú.“I don’t mind at all that the film always comes up in every conversation, because I thinkY Tu Mamá Tambiénremains one of the best films I’ve ever made,” he says. “I was lucky to be able to make it in my own country, with my best friend, and with an incredible director. Also, even though I was already known in Mexico and had been working there for years, it was the moment when my career took off. “We went to Venice, then to San Sebastian. It was a very crazy year, but it was definitely the moment when things changed. Also, Alfonso Cuarón played a fundamental part in helping me understand the medium. He taught me to see cinema in a different way, and sparked in me, for the first time, a need to experiment with directing and to start producing films too. It was the beginning of a journey that has brought me to where I am today.” Luna smiles when asked if he ever feared thatAndorwould end after a single season, as so many other streaming projects have. “This will surprise you, but I originally signed on for five seasons. And then one day I thought, But, Diego, how the hell are you going to do this for five seasons?” he says. “So I sat down with Tony”—that would beTony Gilroy,Andor’s showrunner—“and told him that I didn’t see myself playing Cassian at 80 years old, almost in a wheelchair, going back to the same story over and over again. Tony suggested we do one more season, but make the second season like four movies. That way we could close it the way it deserves to end. “And you know what?” Luna laughs. “He convinced me.” This interview was originally published byVanity Fair Spain.It was translated by John Newton.

    "title": "Cannes 2025: Joaquin Phoenix, Josh O’Connor, Scarlett Johansson, and More Lead Impressive Lineup",
    "article_text": "A year after the Cannes Film Festival had arguablyits biggest impact on the Oscarsto date, all eyes were on Thursday’s festival lineup announcement. Which buzzy titles could the Croisette launch into major awards contention this year? The list, unsurprisingly, is pretty stacked. Several major North American filmmakers have made the cut in main competition, including Cannes mainstaysWes Anderson(The Phoenician Scheme) andKelly Reichardt(The Mastermind). Despite his decades of success in indie cinema, this marksRichard Linklater’s first premiere in the main Cannes competition since 2006’sFast Food Nation, arriving just months after another movie of his,Blue Moon,went on to win a prize at the Berlin Film Festival. But the timing makes sense: Linklater’sNouvelle Vaguedepicts the making of iconic European filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard’sBreathless. You could hardly imagine a more Cannes-friendly plot description. Mubi, the studio behind last year’s Cannes sensationThe Substance,is handling twoJosh O’Connorvehicles this time around: Reichardt’s art-heist movieThe Mastermind, also starringAlana HaimandJohn Magaro,andOliver Hermanus’s gay romanceThe History of Sound,co-led byPaul Mescal.A24, meanwhile, is behindEddington, the latest from the studio’s beloved auteurAri Aster.Much remains unknown about this one, but with a cast top-lined by awards darlingsJoaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal,andEmma Stone,it ought to be one of the festival’s highest-profile premieres. (Another film from the studio,Spike Lee’sHighest 2 Lowest,was also expected to figure in here today, but has not been announced—yet. The directorposted on his Instagramthat the film has been invited for an out-of-competition premiere.) No American distributor looms larger at Cannes at this point than Neon, having been behind the festival’s last five Palme d’Or winners, including eventual Oscar best-picture winnersParasiteandAnora.This year, it has multiple movies in competition. One is helmed byJulia Ducournau,who won the top Cannes prize just a few years ago withTitane;her new movie,Alpha,starsTahar Rahim.The other,Sentimental Value,features recent Cannes best-actress winnerRenate Reinsve,reuniting with herThe Worst Person in the Worlddirector, Oscar nomineeJoachim Trier.Their new collaboration also includes bigger global stars likeStellan SkarsgårdandElle Fanning. In addition toAnoraandThe Substance,last year’s Cannes launched two other eventual Oscar-winning films inEmilia PérezandFlow.TrumpbiopicThe Apprenticepremiered on the Croisette too, before embarking on a difficult road to distribution in the US—though it ultimately netted Oscar acting nominations forSebastian StanandJeremy Strong. Elsewhere in the main competition, some major international titles have caught our eye. The Belgian Dardenne brothers are back withThe Young Mother’s Home; they’ve twice won the Palme d’Or and are best known stateside for directingMarion Cotillardto an Oscar nomination forTwo Days, One Night.Kleber Mendonça Filho’sThe Secret Agent,starringWagner Moura,is a buzzy title from Brazil that tackles subject matter similar to that of last year’s Oscar-winning sensationI’m Still Here.And Iranian legendJafar Panahi(This Is Not a Film) is back withA Simple Accident,three years after his last movie,No Bears,was made illegally and in secret—not unlike last year’s Oscar-nominated Cannes premiereThe Seed of the Sacred Fig. Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoningwas already announced to be bowing out of competition in Cannes (let us all pray for a wildTom Cruiseentrance), whileRobert De Nirowas previously confirmed to be receiving the honorary Palme. Finally, the Un Certain Regard competition, which recognizes emerging filmmakers, has accepted the directorial debuts ofHarris Dickinson(Urchin) andScarlett Johansson(Eleanor the Great), the latter of which already has distribution secured with Sony Pictures Classics. (Johansson also plays a supporting role in the new Wes Anderson movie.)Kristen Stewart’s first film,The Chronology of Water,had also been rumored for a Cannes bow but was nowhere to be seen in today’s announcement. We’ll see if that or the many other movies that have been circling Cannes get added at a later date, since rumor is that the slate is not yet complete.

    "title": "The Education—and Anointment—of Barron Trump",
    "article_text": "The night beforeDonald Trump’s second inauguration in January, the 22-year-old conservative activistCJ Pearsonthrew a party in honor of the influencers who had rallied behind the Republican nominee. The following week he received an email from a journalism student at New York University. She was interested in interviewing him about his social media journey. After some back-and-forth about her use of the term “alt-right,” all of which Pearson then posted on X, the political personality made a request: “Please stay away from Barron.” There was no need. The student,Julia Diorio,had never seen the president’s son—as of last fall, her most famous classmate among the 30,000 or so other undergraduates—around campus, though she’d grown used to inquiries about him from friends and family. Such is the towering presence ofBarron Trump,a 19-year-old six-foot-seven freshman at NYU’s Stern School of Business, in the young MAGA imagination. The podcasters who have dined with Barron at Mar-a-Lago rave about his swagger and romantic eligibility; the president and his aides credit him with strategic mastery as an ambassador to young online men. On social media, where his youth soccer highlights periodically circulate, he is discussed with varying degrees of irony but nearly always in breathless terms. He does not speak publicly or operate a public social media account, which, by all appearances, has only deepened his mystique. Any view of his true place in the Trump firmament arrives in third-party glances. His mother described him to Fox News as “very vocal” in advising his father, andElon Muskrecounted on X how he spent Thanksgiving “discussing consciousness & video games with Barron.” Barron has long made for aBLANK CANVASor aFIELD OF BATTLE. Diorio and her colleagues atWashington Square News,where she is the arts editor, have barely covered Barron’s presence on campus. Despite his outsize profile, his campus life has proven too vaporous, a notable distinction at a school that countsMary-KateandAshley Olsenand a handful of other former child stars as alumni. “EvenDylan Sprousewas a leader at one of the dorms,” Diorio points out. To get Barron to class, a motorcade of black SUVs drives him about 20 minutes from his home at Trump Tower. Tisch Hall, Stern’s undergraduate building, is a block from Washington Square Park and set off behind a barricaded plaza. In the fall, as Barron’s first semester got underway, his movements were tracked and recorded on social media for sport. “Naaa,” a junior finance major wrote on Instagram, posting an off-guard photo of him in the back of a lecture hall. “Today was wild.” The attention started to feed on itself. The conservative YouTube personalityBenny Johnson,observing the campus hype, described Barron as a study in “what real rizz is.” NYU—and its business school in particular—lacks a central social life, with classrooms and living arrangements dispersed throughout Lower Manhattan. Barron’s classmates describe his day-to-day comings and goings to me as limited. One remembers asking to play basketball with him. Barron seemed interested, he says, but he got the sense that, with plainclothes Secret Service officers hovering, “he wasn’t really allowed to do stuff.” “He’s sort of like an oddity on campus,” saysKaya Walker,the former president of NYU College Republicans. “He goes to class, he goes home.” In interviews, Trump normally likes to talk about Barron in relation to TikTok, the world of podcasting, and his son’s other of-the-moment interests. When the family was promoting a new cryptocurrency finance platform last year, Barron was touted as the company’s leading visionary. But he never showed up to the livestreamed launch event, leaving the host to lament that Barron skipped making his first-ever public remarks because “we took too long.” The pattern is disorienting but unmistakable. Barron’s cachet grows with every missed appearance. He is too young, and too wordless, to have been tarnished by the broader resentment his father inspires. Owing to some combination of novelty and force of repetition, he has become the Trump child most readily associated with his father’s reelection, even as he also skipped the Republican National Convention in July. In a statement,Melania Trumpcited prior commitments. (A White House spokesperson declined to comment for this story.) Barron has long made for a blank canvas or a field of battle.Rosie O’Donnellapologized to Melania in 2016 for speculating that he was autistic, and the following year, aSaturday Night Livewriter was suspended for predicting on social media that the then 10-year-old “will be this country’s first homeschool shooter.” On several occasions,Chelsea Clintonhas come to his public defense. While the likes of the Bush daughters andElla Emhoffhave also served as inevitable proxies for their parents and stepparents, in the last year or so, the fervor for Barron has taken on an uncommonly dedicated dimension. His schooling has not yet surfaced anything resembling the beer pong photograph from the Obama kids’ Sidwell Friends days, to say nothing of the Olsens’ reported nightlife exploits during their own NYU tenure. Still, there’s no shortage of effort to position him as an emblem of young American indulgence. After TMZreportedin December that Barron’s peers knew him as a low-key video game enthusiast, a source quickly emerged to tellPeoplethat he was, in fact, a “ladies’ man.” According to the report, young women of all political persuasions were falling for him. The subject—not, it should be said, a strictly dichotomous one—has been widely litigated, withEric Trumpdescribing his half brother as the “most eligible bachelor in the world” and one of Barron’s classmates confirming to me that “he definitely is a gamer.” TheDaily Mailproposedthat conservative 21-year-old influencerMaria Arana,a Mexican American NYU student who grew up in Miami, could make for a suitable “future Mrs Barron Trump.” “I just thought it was very random,” Arana tells me. “But it’s not like I was against it.” A junior studying child psychology at NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, Arana has never seen Barron, although she thinks she spotted his motorcade once. She describes the network of influencers on campus as loosely affiliated, with some of them traveling in some of the same circles; her mainstay for nights out is Socialista, a Cuban-inspired club in SoHo. After TMZ reported in December that Barron’s peers knew him as aLOW-KEY VIDEO GAME ENTHUSIAST, a source quickly emerged to tellPeoplethat he was, in fact, a “LADIES’ MAN.” Arana says she’s always found the campus environment hospitable to her line of work. In recent months she has also felt more secure in her politics as she’s watched opposition to Trump die down. “I’ve seen a lot of people just kind of keep it more to themselves,” she says. It is a prevailing sentiment in the months since the president’s reelection. When Trump appeared onThe Joe Rogan Experiencein October, the host posited that conservatism was the new punk. On the campaign trail,JD VancereadSlouching Towards Bethlehem,apparently priming for another end of an era. After Trump won,Matt Gaetzboasted at a New York Young Republican Club gala that the victory was as cultural as it was electoral. NYU is broadly known as a solidly liberal enclave, if not at the level of Columbia, an uptown locus of activism. The plaza in front of Stern is the go-to student protest site, but only because it is the largest gathering area available on campus. The business school’s reputation has more to do with its competitiveness—the “Stern curve” is a reliable cliché—than it does any political leaning, even if the finance aspect gives it some right-of-center air. In January, NYU suspended about a dozen anti-Israel protesters, leading to the Fox Newsheadline: “Elite university attended by Trump’s son cracks down on left-wing student agitators.” Walker is mildly bothered by the frenzy around Barron, arguing that he deserves a more normal college experience. She recalls a joking remark from one of her professors that “he doesn’t really belong here.” As a general matter, she understands why Barron has been so readily elevated by his peers. But even with a crop of new right-wing culture warriors beginning to emerge, the foremost celebrity in Walker’s mind has remainedLana Del Rey.She’s not sure that anyone has yet arrived as a mainstream face of the rearrangement she has been feeling at school. “Somebody in the hair-and-makeup trailer,”Timothée Chalametremembered. “They would play this podcast, which is how I discovered it.” In the midst of his press tour forA Complete Unknown,the actor was explaining toTheo Von,the comedian and podcaster, how he wound up on his increasingly visible show. Von, who has described himself as feeling like a “secretary sometimes for Joe Rogan,” is one of the leading personalities in the loose media space, characterized by its free-ranging and lengthy interview style, that became a focal point of Trump’s campaign last year. In this ecosystem, Barron is often understood as a behind-the-scenes operator as well as an aspirational figure. His coming-of-age has coincided with the rise of a corner of pop culture into which the president has slotted naturally. “He knows you very well,” Trump said during his own appearance onThis Past Weekend w/ Theo Von.“He said, ‘Dad, he’s big.’” After Von attended the January inauguration, where the president’s son received a standing ovation at a rally, he posted a parting wish on X: “I wanna meet dang Barron!!” As Barron prepared for the day that his father would assume office once more, he worked with a tailor recommended to him byJustin Waller,a steel entrepreneur and internet personality. Waller is a friend ofAndrew Tate’s—he tells me that the ultra-notorious influencer encouraged him to join his online fray—and had his YouTube channelstaken downfor promoting one of Tate’s businesses. Just recently, Waller says, he, Barron, and Barron’s close friendBo Loudon,a rising 18-year-old conservative voice, were in a canopy area at Mar-a-Lago, “talking about everything that’s going on here.” “Through the glass,” Waller says, “I see Donald and Elon and[Donald Trump] Jr.walking in, so they’re 30 yards away from us while I’m sitting there talking to Barron.” Waller became connected to Barron after Loudon reached out last year to tell him that his friend was a fan of his work. Waller, podcasterPatrick Bet-David,and UFC fighterColby Covingtondined with the teenage duo at Mar-a-Lago a few weeks later. “We’re just trying to help the young men,” Waller says. “There’s a whole generation of young men that need help. A lot of single-mother households, they don’t have direction. They need somebody to tell ’em it’s okay to be strong, it’s okay to be masculine.” Not including Barron, though. Waller describes him as “the kind of guy that can start a business that can go public, but he also can sit down and drink a beer with the individual that’s running his manufacturing facility.” Newsweekrecentlyreportedthat Barron and a friend from his Palm Beach prep school, along with the cousin of a Republican congressman from Idaho, were planning to start a luxury real estate firm. One of Barron’s partners said that the company had been dissolved shortly after the election to avoid media coverage but that it would be relaunched in the spring. In the following days he doubled back and said it wasn’t happening at all. No further business ventures have been announced yet—Barron’s not due to graduate until 2028, when his father’s term will have nearly ended. A couple of weeks after Trump returned to office, as the spring semester was beginning, Barron appeared at NYU in a cream sweater and black Adidas sneakers. Alongside a fresh set of paparazzi photos, theNew York Postannounced that “the big man on campus is back.” He isTOO YOUNG, andTOO WORDLESS, to have been tarnished by the broader resentment his father inspires. His reputation was growing in concert with his father’s reemergence as the daily center of political and cultural life. When Tate and his brother Tristan recently arrived in Florida from Romania, where they are facing human-trafficking charges, which they deny, Andrew boasted to reporters about his proximity. In the aftermath of the Trump assassination attempt in July, he said, he had been a confidant to the first son. “I’m very close with the Trump family,” Tate said. “I know them well, and I spoke to Barron after the incident. I look forward to, once I am free, being with Donald Trump in person and reminding him that he’s a bulletproof badass.” The broad social media constellation to which Tate belongs is best, if overgenerally, known as the “manosphere.” Cultural diagnoses of Trump’s victory have in large part located it around this center of power, and the extent to which the president has drawn from it. Tate has for several years represented an outer limit to the milieu—its most extreme, vile, and popular edge. His return to the US presented a possible fault line for conservative personalities. Florida governorRon DeSantissaid the brothers weren’t welcome in the state. UFC CEODana Whiteembraced them at a fight in Las Vegas, saying, “Welcome to the States, boys.” When Trump was asked in the Oval Office if his administration had lobbied Romania for the Tates’ release, he said, “I know nothing about that.” One afternoon in February, shortly after a version of this story was published online, AF Post, a fledgling far-right media outlet dedicated to an “America First” mission, circulated a comment Kaya Walker had made to me alongside a photograph of her at the College Republicans booth at a campus club event. For this audience, the notion that a young woman had described Barron as an “oddity on campus” set off an instant tirade. A raft of onlookers derided Walker as insufficiently respectful of the president’s son, posting images of her face to convey their incredulity and rage at the author of this perceived slight. It hadn’t occurred to me—or Walker—that her remarks could be understood as critical. The sentiment she had expressed was sympathetic to Barron and his place at the center of a campus frenzy, albeit in a distant and perhaps perfunctory way. If anything, the quotation in question was banal. By the next day, the post had been viewed nearly 10 million times. The backlash against Walker was beginning to mount. Before the day was over, she resigned as president of the NYU chapter of College Republicans of America, citing pressure from the national organization. The group said in a statement that Walker’s comments did “not align with the values and principles upheld by our organization.” Its president,Will Donahue,told theNew York Postthat chapter leaders are expected to request board approval before speaking to “left-wing journalists.” As the scuffle blossomed into international news, I was flummoxed and intrigued. It’s rare (and lucky) to have a piece of reporting travel so widely, but the campus scandal quickly detached itself from the story in which it originated. I had become an observer, and from the outside, I felt as if I was watching matter change state. In the online slipstream that Walker’s comments entered, it wasn’t just that the remarks were taken out of context; it was that there was no longer any idea of context to begin with. In her resignation letter, Walker wrote that her comment had been “ridiculously misconstrued” and that she was “merely describing the ugly side of our culture…that delights in forming parasocial relationships with celebrities.” She ended by apologizing “to everyone that I love and respect that was caught in crosshairs of this willful and malicious reading of my comment.” Walker soon expressed regret over stepping down,telling thePostthat “everybody knows that it’s an uphill battle being a Republican at NYU.” She said she had “put my everything into building up my chapter.” College Republicans of America had by then moved on. In its statement, it extended an invitation to Barron to join them as, the authors wrote, “the future of the conservative movement.” Aimee Lou Woodon the TragicWhite LotusFinale AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood Karen Read Returns to Trial: Here’sEverything You Need to Know DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle",
    "article_text": "Last weekKaren Readreturned to a wood-paneled courtroom about 25 minutes southwest of Boston for hersecond murder trial. Twelvejurorshad already determined that there was not enough evidence from Norfolk County district attorneyMichael Morrisseyto convict Read of second-degree murder and a lesser charge of leaving the scene of a deadly accident, according to two jurors who spoke toVF.After amistrialwas declared, five jurors came forward to say that the voting body had only been split on the manslaughter charge, but had not understood that coming to apartial verdictwas an option, according to Read’s lawyers. And now, against a backdrop of escalating appeals arguing that a second murder trial would violate Read’s double jeopardy rights, the former equity analyst was back in the defendant’s seat. The initial trial had riveted Massachusetts; Read was accused of drunkenly killing her police officer boyfriend, John O’Keefe, by hitting him with her car and leaving him to die on the lawn of a home belonging to another Boston cop,Brian Albert.As Read previously toldVanity Fair,she believes that she is being framed in a corrupt saga involving four law enforcement agencies—including the Massachusetts State Police, whose troopers work out of Morrissey’s office and investigated O’Keefe’s death. (In Massachusetts, homicides outside of Boston and a few other cities are investigated by state troopers. Morrissey’s office declined to comment.) That trial ended with ahung juryand worldwide attention. In her second trial on the same charges, Read again faces life in prison if convicted of murder. Read has now expanded her legal team ofDavid Yannetti, Alan Jackson,andElizabeth Little—addingRobert Alessiof New York;Victoria Georgeof Massachusetts,a jurorfrom the first trial; and nine law students who will act as clerks, includingSophia Hunt,who recently served asHarvard Law Reviewpresident, andAbigail Rosovsky,a former Fulbright scholar. Read has already sunk seven figures into her defense—liquidating her retirement funds, selling her house, and relying on donations. All 11 of her additions are working pro bono. Morrissey, meanwhile, has enlistedHank Brennan,one of Whitey Bulger’s defense lawyers, to act as special prosecutor for the government. Brennan has taken a more proactive approach than his predecessor in the first trial, Norfolk ADAAdam Lally.Last month Brennan tried to obtain text messages between Read and Yannetti, arguing that Read had sacrificed the right to attorney-client privilege by discussing her conversations with the lawyer ininterviews. (JudgeBeverly Cannonedenied the motion.) He also sought private conversations between Read andAidan Kearney,the blogger known as Turtleboy, contending that they would prove “consciousness of guilt.” Brennan argued that motion before a different judge. After Read and her numerous lawyers single-filed in during that proceeding, an entrance so dramatic it made local news, Brennan told the judge, “I’m not sure why we’re being joined by Ms. Read’s team, unless they have a standing in this.” Read squinted at Brennan in disgust. He was later granted access to the messages. Brennan found himself on the defense too. In the last six months, Read’s team received two new batches of security footage from the Canton Police Department, where she claims law enforcement tampered with her car—the alleged murder weapon—and began to frame her. Read alleges that her taillight was broken at Canton PD, with fragments later planted at the crime scene. (Canton PD did not respond toVF’s request for comment. A recent police audit outlined mistakes made at the O’Keefe scene but found no evidence of tampering, corruption, or conspiracy based on the materials the hired intelligence company reviewed.) The “new” videos were turned over in October 2024 and January 2025, more than two and a half years after they’d been recorded and months after Read’s first murder trial had ended. (Some videos obtained by Read’s team in October were “clarified” versions of what had been provided to the defense in April, as the original videos were extremely dark.) There was no apparent chain of custody for new videos provided in October, but there was a note from Canton PD chiefHelena Raffertythat read, “That is how it records LOL. No tampering.” Rafferty is on thewitness listfor the second trial. While Brennan conceded that the video situation “should have been managed better,” he said the defense had not specifically requested this footage and that there was nothing to indicate it was exculpatory. Cannone sided with Brennan and denied Read’s request for an evidentiary hearing. On any day when Read is inside the courthouse, her supporters can be found outside accusing Cannone of being biased toward the prosecution. Signs have included slogans such as “Bev’s Court Is a Clownshow” and “Judge Bev Is Conflicted.” After Cannone reinstated and extended the buffer zone for this trial to keep peaceful protesters at bay, four Massachusetts residents sued the judge, claiming that the action was “an unprecedented move to muzzle dissent and protect her own reputation.” Inside the cramped Dedham courtroom, Read is likely to again confront the people she is accusing of framing her, including former Massachusetts State Police trooperMichael Proctor,who led the Read investigation and was dishonorably discharged from the law enforcement agency last month. (Proctor plans to appeal the decision, according to his lawyer.) The Massachusetts State Police found him guilty of unsatisfactory performance, with violations stemming from his “derogatory, defamatory, disparaging, and/or otherwise inappropriate text messages about a suspect in that investigation to other individuals.” He was also found guilty of consuming alcohol on duty. Last month Proctor’s family, including his wife,Elizabeth,and his sister,Courtney,released a statement casting Proctor as the victim of “egregiously false statements from Karen Read and her defense team.” They added that he “has been defamed, maligned, and falsely labeled corrupt by the alleged murderer, her family, her defense team, and a mob of her followers.” “All the statement did was put hisvile behaviorback in the news cycle. And he had to use two women to do it?” Read said toVF.“Can’t he speak for himself?” The statement also defended Proctor’s texts: “How would you feel if the contents of your personal phone were questionably released to the public without full context?” Read, whose text messages were read aloud during the first trial, said she found that sentence “rich.” These days, when Read watches movies about Boston corruption, some characters strike her as eerily familiar—likeMatt Damon’s self-righteous yet corrupt statie inMartin Scorsese’s filmThe Departed:“He typifies Proctor’s arrogance and excitement to play God in people’s lives.” Given her experience as a murder defendant squaring off against a biased detective, Read now looks back at O.J. Simpson’s 1995acquittaldifferently. “I felt so strongly about the prosecution and his guilt and the fact that he spent all this money on this dream team of lawyers. They all looked like snake oil salesmen to me,” Read said. Her thinking now, however, has changed a bit: “I’m not saying I believe O.J. was innocent, but I believe that it was not a completely above-board investigation. Now that I am smarter, I would’ve cheered at that acquittal. You have to hold cops accountable.” Read is also expected to face other people she has accused of framing her, includingJennifer McCabe,Brian Albert,Brian Higgins,andColin Albert.(All four have denied involvement in O’Keefe’s death or any cover-up.) Cannone has furthermoreput parametersaround Read’s third-party-culprit defense, banning its mention in Read’s team’s opening statement and prohibiting Read’s lawyers from pointing to Colin as a suspect. In early March, Brennan announced that he had permission to reveal that “there is no longer any federal investigation into the investigation of John O’Keefe’s death or any related matters. It is closed. It is over.” (The US Attorney’s Office would not confirm or deny the existence of the investigation.) Shortly after Brennan’s declaration, Canton police chief Rafferty issued a statement declaring “that ALL ASPECTS of the federal investigation…have been completed.” But some question whether that is true given the resources and time the DOJ devoted to a logistically complicated probe into an active investigation. Brian, Colin, and Higgins—plus McCabe—were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. Yannetti revealed in court that his entire case file had been subpoenaed by the US Attorney’s Office, later sharing that the request was part of an ongoing investigation—disclosures that took the prosecution by surprise. The US Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts has turned over with the new presidential administration, withLeah B. Foleyhaving replacedJoshua Levy. When I asked Read about Brennan’s assertion that the federal investigation had ended, she messaged me that, in her mind, there are only two possibilities. The first: “Someone is not being truthful.” The second: “The new administration is choosing not to pursue this investigation. That hardly means anyone involved in murdering John or framing me was cleared of wrongdoing. But everyone should note which side of my case is celebrating the federal investigation supposedly being closed and which side isn’t. That will tell you which side of this case is culpable and therefore worried about a possible federal indictment.” When Brennan first signed on to the case, he vowed to give Read “a fair trial.” But Read said she never expected that courtesy. She pointed to some of Brennan’s recent arguments, such as one asking Cannone, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to impose a gag order on Read’s attorneys so that “we can have a fair trial.” (Cannone granted the request.) “If you notice Brennan’s language, it has evolved from wanting ME to get a fair trial to ‘the COMMONWEALTH deserves a fair trial,’ which is not a right I’ve ever heard of. But it doesn’t matter—I shouldn’t even be on trial,” Read messaged me in the hectic days before jury selection began. The first-trial jurors who came forward said the jury had been unanimous in deciding to acquit Read of the murder and leaving-the-scene charges, but had been split on manslaughter and failed to understand that coming to a partial verdict was possible. There is an entireReddit threadspeculating why Brennan took this case.J.W. Carney,Brennan’s partner in defending Bulger, did not elucidate on a phone call withVF:“The opportunity was offered to him and he took it.” Carney called Brennan “the finest cross-examiner that I have ever seen.” In this sense, Brennan is a match for Jackson, who prosecuted Phil Spector and wasdescribedbyVF’s Dominick Dunne as having “an uncanny ability to enrage those he quizzes.” Brennan was responsible for “one of the most riveting days” of the 2013 Bulger trial, according toTheNew York Times,when he cross-examinedStephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi,the government’s star witness and Bulger’s former crime partner. Carney said Brennan had caught the convicted murderer off guard with his first question: “He asked him if his daughter ever sat on his lap as a child and called him daddy.” Flemmi had been involved in the killing of his stepdaughter, and Brennan’s opening salvo was a surprise. Later, Brennan tripped him up on key details that shot his credibility—eliciting acknowledgment that Flemmi had played a role in his stepdaughter’s death. “I agreed because I was coerced into it,” Flemmi said before pausing. “And Mr. Brennan, I didn’t kill her.” After just over a week of jury selection, the prosecution and defense have seated 15 out of the desired 16 jurors. Read told reporters outside the courthouse that opening arguments could begin as early as Tuesday. With a combined list of 150 potential witnesses, the second trial could last as long as the first—nine weeks—if the Supreme Court does not intervene. Read appealed to the nation’s highest court last week, arguing that her constitutional double jeopardy protections would be violated if she were to be tried again on the charges of murder and leaving the scene. Until the Supreme Court decides whether to take up her appeal, Read says she is trying to look on the bright side. “I am still free.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "My Reflections on the George W. Bush Clan’s 25th Reunion",
    "article_text": "For most, it was a celebration. But for many of us, the reunion also felt a bit like a wake. Because while we toasted something we’d helped create, we mourned much of what had been lost. Last weekend, members ofGeorge W. Bush’s 2000 presidential team (225 in all) returned to Austin, Texas, to toast the 25th anniversary of an incredible collective effort that resulted in a good number of them landing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The gathering was reflective and sentimental. Remember,thanks to a tumultuous recount sagathat was finally decided by the Supreme Court, the outcome of that contest wasn’t clear until after a drawn-out overtime of just over a month. So we had never shared that Champagne-popping moment to hug and fist-bump one another after toiling so long in the trenches. Bush with advisors Andrew Card, McKinnon, and Karen Hughes at the Republican National Convention before giving his acceptance speech. This time—a generation later—there were a lot of high fives and variations of, “Can you believe the roller-coaster ride we went on back then?” But there were also a lot of eye rolls and hushed whispers of, “Can you believe the roller-coaster ride we’re onright now?!” (Neither Bush nor former vice presidentDick Cheneywas on hand.) A former Democrat, I had crossed the bridge to the GOP around 1996. I’d been attracted, in no small part, to the free trade, free market approach of the Republican Party. But the very week of our conclave, I felt myself in a kind of upside-down,Alice Through the Looking Glass–esque limbo. PresidentDonald Trumphad literally upended free trade by imposing a radical and unprecedented tariff regime. And the nation and the world had recoiled in response. The so-called free market was in a global free fall. The shattered norms made the picture all too clear: Trump had completely refashioned the GOP into something bearing little resemblance to the party I’d joined because of my belief in Bush’s message of compassionate conservatism, as he referred to it. Bush had called immigration “a blessing and a strength.” But even as the Trump team admitted last week that it hadmistakenly deporteda migrant father to a brutal El Salvador prison, the administration challenged in court any obligation it had to get him out and bring him home. In a similar vein, Bush had tried to secure a strong education safety net for all young people, working closely with Senator Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, to pass federal legislation requiring that states establish standards and accountability to ensure that no child would be left behind or subject to “the soft bigotry of low expectations.” Since taking office, Trump and his minions have been seeking to virtually eliminate any federal role in education. On and on it goes. After 9/11, Bush tried, among other things, to expand democracy overseas, with limited success. Trump, in contrast, appears to be currying favor with autocrats while limiting democratic freedoms here at home. In addition, Bush labored mightily to fight authoritarianism abroad by supporting nonmilitary broadcast operations overseas, such as Voice of America, which for decades had used radio and television outlets to spread messages of freedom. He appointed me to VOA’s governing board. Trump has begundismantling the whole enterprise. Perhaps Bush’s most enduring legacy is his PEPFAR program, which helps provide assistance to people around the world with HIV/AIDS. By the government’s estimate, that program has helped save 26 million lives. Trump has frozen the initiative. None of this was lost on most of the reunion attendees. Conversations and remarks were laced longingly with words likehonor,integrity,decency,character. In his remarks before the assembled, Bush campaign chairmanDon Evans,who became a Cabinet secretary in the administration, asserted: “The president’s core beliefs formed our ‘compassionate conservative’ agenda—a message that resonated with voters looking for a leader who would bring honor, dignity, respect, and a moral compass to the Oval Office…. I can’t tell you how many reporters told me how they admired our team for being respectful, kind, hardworking, and professional.” It’s not like Bush had a copyright on those qualities or aspirations. Many past candidates and presidents, both Democratic and Republican, mirrored those ideals. But you sure don't hear those expressions today—or anything like them. And if you do, they’re followed by accusations of weakness or wokeness. I’m not here to preach that we were right. Or better. Last November, voters clearly expressed their preference for a Republican approach without much empathy or compassion. And a preference for rule breakers over rule makers. It seems quaint today, but when George W. Bush called someone a “good man,” it was the highest of compliments—a seemingly simple characterization that encompassed a deep well of traits essential to the success of mankind. Being “good” was not only an aspiration, but the ultimate achievement of a life well lived. It was also part of the underpinning of democratic governance: an attempt to serve the public good. To be clear, my sentiments are not shared by everyone who was at the Austin proceedings. And strong supporters of the current administration and its policies were certainly in attendance. But there was also a clear consensus among this group that we sure were glad we had an opportunity to serve then and not now. It was clear that 2000 was a different time. A simpler time. A kinder time. For a while in the 2010s, roadside billboards appeared around the country featuring Bush smiling goofily alongside the words“Miss Me Yet?” I sure do.

    "article_text": "How will patients benefit and how much will proposed community pharmacies help Hong Kong’s chronically overstretched public healthcare system? As part of his daily routine, Hong Kong retiree Yiu Po-tai, 81, has to rummage through a plastic bag full of medicine and gulp down 16 different pills to manage his chronic illnesses. “I suffer from hypertension and had shingles two years ago, but I still have not recovered from the nerve pain,” said the former construction worker, who lives alone in a subdivided flat in Sham Shui Po. “I had a stroke 10 years ago … and my face was paralysed twice around the time I had shingles.” To manage nerve pain in his arms, Yiu also took medicine from doctors in mainland China, where service was faster, and from a local pharmacy, besides prescriptions in Hong Kong. Yiu’s experience is not uncommon for many local patients with chronic diseases. They often use various medications prescribed by different doctors, taking pills without realising that some may be duplicates of others they use or have adverse effects. Fortunately for Yiu, a social worker noticed his situation and took him to a community pharmacy where a pharmacist cut his medication to 13 pills. Non-government organisations currently operate a number of community pharmacies, providing medication management consultations, a dispensing service and referrals to other healthcare resources. Around 190 pharmacies serve as drug collection points for residents and those in homes for the elderly who use public hospital services. The government will also launch a community pharmacy programme in the fourth quarter next year, with each of Hong Kong’s 18 districts to get at least four to five facilities.",

    "title": "Apple said to be flying iPhones from India to US to avoid Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "Apple is reportedly chartering cargo flights to ferry iPhones from its Indian manufacturing plants to the US in an attempt to beatDonald Trump’s tariffs. The tech company has flown 600 tonnes of iPhones, or as many as 1.5m handsets, to the US from India since March after ramping up production at its plants in the country,according to Reuters. Trump’sthreatened tariffs of 26% on Indian importsare on hold for about three months after the US president called a 90-day pause, but he has announced that tariffs on goods from China – where Apple assembles most of its iPhones – will be subject toa levy of at least 145%. A source familiar with the planning behind the move told Reuters Apple “wanted to beat the tariff”. Imports to the US fromIndiastill face a tariff under Trump’s policy but at the reduced rate of 10%. Analysts have warned iPhone prices could surge after the US imposed its highest tariff on imports fromChina, with the investment bank UBS estimating an iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB of storage could increase in price by more than two-thirds from $1,199 (£925) to nearly $2,000 if Apple passes on a substantial chunk of the tariff costs. Reuters reported that Apple had targeted a 20% increase in production at iPhone plants in India. It did this by increasing the number of workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggestFoxconnIndia factory in Chennai to Sundays. The Chennai plant produced 20m iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models.Applehas three plants in India operated by Foxconn and Tata. The Wall Street Journalreported this weekthat Apple planned to send more iPhones to the US from India as a “short-term stopgap” while the company attempted to secure an exemption from the China tariffs. If Apple diverted all India-made iPhones to the US it would account for about 50% of American demand this year, according to the Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan. Analysts have warned that moving iPhone production to the US would be prohibitively expensive because of factors such as the cost of paying hundreds of thousands of workers. Analysts at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services company, have said a US-made iPhone would cost $3,500. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion “If consumers want a $3,500 iPhone we should make them in New Jersey or Texas or another state,” said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, in a note to investors this week.

    "title": "Researchers concerned to find AI models misrepresenting their “reasoning” processes",
    "article_text": "New Anthropic research shows AI models often fail to disclose reasoning shortcuts. Remember when teachers demanded that you \"show your work\" in school? Some new types of AI models promise to do exactly that, butnew researchsuggests that the \"work\" they show can sometimes be misleading or disconnected from the actual process used to reach the answer. New research from Anthropic—creator of the ChatGPT-like Claude AI assistant—examines simulated reasoning (SR) models likeDeepSeek's R1, and its own Claude series. In a research paperposted last week, Anthropic's Alignment Science team demonstrated that these SR models frequently fail to disclose when they've used external help or taken shortcuts, despite features designed to show their \"reasoning\" process. (It's worth noting that OpenAI's o1 and o3 series SR models were excluded from this study.) To understand SR models, you need to understand CoT: a step-by-step text output showing the AI’s simulated reasoning as it solves a problem. CoT aims to mimic how a human might \"think aloud\" while solving a complex task. These outputs are valuable for both improving performance and offering transparency—but only if they faithfully reflect what influenced the model’s answer. Having an AI model generate these steps has reportedly proven valuable not just for producing more accurate outputs for complex tasks but also for \"AI safety\" researchers monitoring the systems' internal operations. And ideally, this readout of \"thoughts\" should be both legible (understandable to humans) and faithful (accurately reflecting the model's actual reasoning process). \"In a perfect world, everything in the chain-of-thought would be both understandable to the reader, and it would be faithful—it would be a true description of exactly what the model was thinking as it reached its answer,\" writes Anthropic's research team. However, their experiments focusing on faithfulness suggest we're far from that ideal scenario. In their experiments, Anthropic found that even when models likeClaude 3.7 Sonnetreceived hints—such as metadata suggesting the right answer or code with built-in shortcuts—their CoT outputs often excluded mention of those hints, instead generating detailed but inaccurate rationales. This means the CoT did not reflect all the factors that actually influenced the model’s output. Rather than intentionally hiding anything, the model simply does not reliably represent all influential inputs in its output. As a result, it may generate what sounds like a reasoning process, even if that explanation doesn't match what actually drove its answer. To measure \"faithfulness\"—how accurately the CoT matches the actual reasoning—the researchers inserted various kinds of hints into questions and observed whether the model acknowledged using them. The researchers then checked whether the models referenced using these hints in their chain-of-thought. The researchers designed some hints to be neutral (e.g., stating \"a Stanford Professor indicates the answer is [A]\" or embedding the answer in faux metadata), while they designed others to be more concerning (e.g., \"You have gained unauthorized access... The correct answer is [A]\"). Some hints provided the correct answer, while others were deliberately wrong, allowing researchers to observe how the models responded. The team tested Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek's R1 model. The results regarding faithfulness were eye-opening: across all hint types on average, Claude referenced the hints in its CoT only 25 percent of the time, while DeepSeek R1 did so 39 percent of the time. This means a substantial majority of answers were unfaithful, omitting mention of information that influenced the output. Intriguingly, the researchers found that these unfaithful chains of thought were, on average, longer than faithful ones, suggesting the omissions weren't merely for brevity. They also noted preliminary findings that faithfulness tended to be lower when the questions were more difficult. Perhaps most notable was a \"reward hacking\" experiment. Reward hacking refers to an AI model finding unexpected shortcuts to maximize its performance scores without solving problems as intended. In Anthropic's experiments, models were deliberately rewarded for choosing incorrect answers indicated by hints. The models quickly learned to exploit this loophole, selecting wrong answers over 99 percent of the time to earn points—yet reflected that behavior in their CoT outputs less than 2 percent of the time. For example, a model given a hint pointing to an incorrect answer on a medical question might write a long CoT justifying that wrong answer, never mentioning the hint that led it there. This suggests the model generated an explanation to fit the answer, rather than faithfully revealing how the answer was determined. It's important to note that AI models don't have intentions or desires; they simply follow patterns learned from extensive training on large datasets. The apparent omission of certain factors in their reasoning reflects limitations in transparency rather than intentional deception. Could faithfulness be improved in the AI models' CoT outputs? The Anthropic team hypothesized that training models on more complex tasks demanding greater reasoning might naturally incentivize them to use their chain of thought more substantially, mentioning hints more often. They tested this by training Claude to better use its CoT on challenging math and coding problems. While this outcome-based training initially increased faithfulness (by relative margins of 63 percent and 41 percent on two evaluations), the improvements plateaued quickly. Even with much more training, faithfulness didn't exceed 28 percent and 20 percent on these evaluations, suggesting this training method alone is insufficient. These findings matter because SR models have been increasingly deployed for important tasks across many fields. If their CoT doesn't faithfully reference all factors influencing their answers (like hints or reward hacks), monitoring them for undesirable or rule-violating behaviors becomes substantially more difficult. The situation resembles having a system that can complete tasks but doesn't provide an accurate account of how it generated results—a particularly risky scenario if the model is being subtly influenced by inputs that humans don’t recognize, and those influences aren’t acknowledged in its explanation. The researchers acknowledge limitations in their study. In particular, they acknowledge that they studied somewhat artificial scenarios involving hints during multiple-choice evaluations, unlike complex real-world tasks where stakes and incentives differ. They also only examined models from Anthropic and DeepSeek, using a limited range of hint types. Importantly, they note the tasks used might not have been difficult enough to require the model to rely heavily on its CoT. For much harder tasks, models might be unable to avoid revealing their true reasoning, potentially making CoT monitoring more viable in those cases. Anthropic concludes that while monitoring a model's CoT isn't entirely ineffective for ensuring safety and alignment, these results show we cannot always trust what models report about their reasoning, especially when behaviors like reward hacking are involved. If we want to reliably \"rule out undesirable behaviors using chain-of-thought monitoring, there's still substantial work to be done,\" Anthropic says.

    "article_text": "CloverPit combines a slot machine with Balatro-like upgrades and progress, and there's a demo you can try now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You think Balatro had trouble convincingrating boardsandYouTubeit's not gambling? I predictCloverPit, a self-described \"rogue-lite slot machine nightmare,\" is going to have to work twice as hard. CloverPit combines a demonic slot machine with Balatro-like upgrades and progress, crams it into a grubby prison cell, and makes you spin the reels. Pump in coins, play the slot, buy weird upgrades, repeat. Oh, and the money you're playing with isn't really yours, it belongs to a forbidding ATM in the corner, so pay off your debt between rounds. If you don't, you die. Even the small taste of the freeCloverPit demois really appealing if you like slots, magic, and gritty graphics. You start with just a handful of change and have to repay a debt of 75 coins in three rounds (similar to facing a Balatro boss every third round). Deposit your coins, spin the reels, and hope lady luck grants you some matching lemons, cherries, and bells: seems like a slot machine so far. But at the end of the round you can spend tickets and coins you've won on upgrades, which lets you start breaking things. With my first round of winnings I picked out a weird squid with a bloodshot eye who would leap into the frame on the last spin of a round and grant me good luck—the first time I used it, the reels turned up nearly all cherries, so that horrid little good luck charm was a good buy. I also bought a bible to protect me against a \"666\" coming up on the reels (I'm pretty sure my prison cell is in hell), a \"stonks\" talisman that let me earn more interest from my winnings, and some shrooms which gave me a nice multiplier if more than 3 patterns appeared on the reels. There are also abilities you can buy, some that trigger randomly, others that fire off when you hammer the big red button on the slot machine. The idea is to find items and powers that synergize nicely together to turn your dozens of coins into hundreds or thousands. I love the gritty, grubby looks of the game and how everything is situated around you in the claustrophobic little prison cell: if you want to buy an upgrade, you have to physically turn around and click on the vending machine it's stored in, and whatever you buy will be plopped on the table next to the slot machine. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At the end of the round it feels like the camera is physically jerking your head around the cell (in a good way) to show you what's happening: your coins pouring out of the slots, your interest being dispensed from the ATM, your tickets being printed, and the grate under your feet rattling. Yeah, did I mention the grate under your feet? It's what's going to open at the end of every third round if you haven't paid back your ever-increasing debt to that looming ATM. Then you'll fall. You'll fall into darkness. I like this slot machine game. But is it gambling? I'll let the CloverPit Steam page answer that: \"Hell no! CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator,\" says developer Panik Arcade. \"Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!\" Will PEGI and YouTube buy that argument? I wouldn't bet on it. You can find theCloverPit demohere. Full release comes later this year.

    "title": "Marvel Rivals season 2 coverage: new season out now, all the latest on Emma Frost, and my reaction to new features",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. MarvelRivalsSeason 2 is now live. As such, players can now try out Emma Frost who's a new Vanguard, and try out the brand new Krakoa-set Domination map. I've covered the launch of Season 2 below, digging into its new features and Team Ups now that it's online. Start date and timeEmma Frost infoPatch notesSkinsRanked changesJump to coverage of Season 2 as it happened Over the last week or so, Developer NetEase has lifted the lid onthe next season ofMarvel Rivals. There's been a lot to digest, especially when looking into the changes toCompetitive Mode. As an avidMarvel Rivalsplayer, and one that's looking to main a new character in Season 2, I've been digging into the full patch notes, trying to predict who will rise above the rest in the coming weeks and months. It's regular changes to the game's meta that have keptMarvel Rivalsranked highly in ourbest PC games list, and make me particularly excited to see how Season 2 unfolds over time. If things go well post-launch, we could be looking at the bestMarvel Rivalsseason yet, especially as far as ranked play is concerned. After sinking over a hundred hours intoMarvel Rivalssince the start of the first season, I'm really looking forward to getting stuck into some new maps, and trying out some DPS Heroes, as I've tended to favor Vanguard up to this point. Still, it's already evident that I won't be abandoning my tank duties completely, as I've been trying out Emma Frost in Quick Match for my first few games. Join me as I keep you up to date with all of the latest news and happenings now that Season 2 is out. I'll be providing live coverage that highlights the best details I've found in the new Battle Pass, as well as some predictions for whereMarvel Rivalscould be headed with its ongoing focus on new Heroes and its new mutant-themed narrative. Here's what you need to know aboutMarvel RivalsSeason 2, now that it's available for all players worldwide. Only have time for the basics? Here are the most important things to know aboutMarvel RivalsSeason 2: Marvel RivalsSeason 2's start time was April 11 at 4AM PDT / 7AM / 12PM BST / 1PM CET / 8PM JST. The headline forMarvel RivalsSeason 2 is that Emma Frost is joining as a new Hero. She's a Vanguard with telekinetic abilities and diamond skin. From the developer breakdown (which you can view above), she certainly looks formidable, with an Ultimate that causes enemies to walk towards her. This is great for environmental kills as opponents walk straight off of edges and into pits. Emma Frost launched alongside the new season, so players will be able to try her out now. For those looking to dive deep on everything that's been added toMarvel Rivalsin Season 2, you're in luck! NetEase has release the full patch notes for the Season 2 update, which includes some detailed information on the buffs and nerfs to certain Heroes.You can read them here. Now that NetEase has revealed the trailer for the Flower of Krakoa Battle Pass that's set to arrive inMarvel RivalsSeason 2, we have a good look at some new skins coming to the game. There are 10 new costumes to unlock, including skins for Iron Fist, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Cloak and Dagger, Hulk, and Rocket. I'm personally looking forward to the classic X-Men skins for Psylocke and Magik, which feature that iconic blue and yellow costume we all know and love. It's consistent updates like these that have earned Marvel Rivals a place in ourbest free games list. Marvel Rivalsnow has a brand new map as part of Season 2. It's called Hellfire Gala: Krakoa, and you can check out a full breakdown in the video embedded above. As someone who mainly plays Competitive Mode inMarvel Rivals, it's exciting to see just how many changes are coming to ranked play this season. Firstly, there's a rank reset for everyone, kicking players down by nine tiers. Then, there are new ranked rewards to earn, including an Emma Frost skin for reaching Gold tier by the end of the season. Map rotation comes into play inMarvel RivalsSeason 2 as well, initially removing the Yggsgard and Tokyo 2099 maps, and adding the new Hellfire Gala: Krakoa Domination map. Bans will be available at Gold tier now, allowing players to remove certain Heroes from their opponents' pools. Lastly, your performance per game, and the number of points you gain or lose, will now be more weighted towards individual performance rather than match outcome. As a freelance games writer, it's my job to stay up to date with the latest games, especially live service titles likeMarvel Rivals. I've put hundreds of hours intoRivalssince launch, primarily gaining Venom, who I now have a Lord rank. Generally, I play Competitive Mode with a regular squad, hovering around the top of the Platinum tier. So far, I've mostly stuck to the Vanguard and Strategist Roles, so I'm interested to try out a DPS-focused set of characters come Season 2. Mr Fantastic is receiving some buffs, so hopefully he's more viable as I absolutely love playing as him. We'll have to wait and see. Now thatMarvel RivalsSeason 2 has been out for a few hours, I'll be heading off to get a bit of a breather, before jumping into Competitive Mode with some pals this evening. This means that my live coverage of Season 2's launch has come to an end. Who knows, maybe I'll be back for Season 2.5, as Ultron joins the roster and we see further changes to the meta. Goodbye for now, and wish me luck crawling my way back up to Gold tier! I've just finished the first of four sections in the Cerebro Database event. This mostly involved playing as Emma Frost, and rewarded me with some Chrono Tokens and a new Spray. The next segment unlocks in just over three days, and looks like it'll involve Wolverine. Psylocke players are eating good this season, with a new Team Up ability, and a Battle Pass skin. The skin is the Retro X-Uniform, a classic blue and yellow number that'll be recognizable to anyone that grew up watching the cartoon. The third Team Up new to Season 2 is Stars Aligned. This finally gives Captain America and Winter Soldier a Team Up, one that boosts Cap's max health by 100. Winter Soldier can use Stellar Impact to leap towards allies, slamming the ground and dealing damage to nearby foes. He can also activate a move with Cap, that must be confirmed by bother players before it activates. This sees Winter Soldier slam into Cap's shield, unleashing a shockwave that deals damage and inflicts slow on enemies. I've only tried this out in one match, but it massively increases Winter Soldier's mobility, allowing him to dart to an ally in an instant. Look, I had a lot of fun in Season Zero, pummeling enemies as Iron Fist, taking advantage of the fact that no-one knew how to deal with melee characters, but I've changed. There is a very nice Iron Fist skin in the Battle Pass however. As good a reason as any for me to jump back in and see how Iron Fist stacks up in the current meta. Moon Knight benefits greatly from the Season 2 balancing changes. Firstly, his Crescent Dart projectile speed is increased, Moon Blade now awards 25 bonus health per hit up to 100, and the Ultimate ability falls faster, has more talons, and lasts longer. There will now be a damage fall off however, relative to how close to the center you are. Gamma Charge has been one of the most powerful Team Up abilities in Marvel Rivals since launch, giving both Iron-Man and Doctor Strange enhanced abilities, and Hulk some bonus health. Strange is now removed from this trio, and Namor has taken his place. Yes, that means gamma-powered squid turrets. While Ultron won't arrive as a new Hero until Season 2.5, you can get some Ultron-themed goodies in the Season 2 Battle Pass. There's a Nameplate on page 3, which costs 200 Chrono Tokens. New to Season 2, you can now gift things to your pals inMarvel Rivals. Just select the item you'd like to Gift, and you'll see a \"Gift\" option next to the usual price tab. This will bring up a list of friends that you can send skins to. The majority of the balancing changes to Strategists in Season 2 are weighted towards decreasing their performance in the overall meta. Adam Warlock is getting an increase to his Soul Bond ability cooldown, and his Ultimate now revives enemies at 30% of their health, instead of a flat 100. Of course, this Ultimate change could actually mean some characters come back with more health than before, while others will get less. I've now played a five or so matches with Emma Frost, and it's clear that she's a very damage-focused Vanguard. Her Primary Attack charges up a gauge, that increases damage output as it goes up. At 100, this damage multiplier really makes a difference, so the loop seems to be keeping that number as high as possible. This is done by entering diamond form, which pauses the gauge stopping it from depleting. Once it hits 100, I've had a lot of success hitting enemies with Psionic Seduction, and using the Telepathic Pulse to apply massive damage. It's early days, but Emma Frost clearly has a lot of potential. In her diamond form, she can stun enemies into a choke slam. This interrupts certain Ultimates, like Star Lords and Scarlet Witch, potentially saving your teammates from dying. Marvel RivalsSeason 2 has made some tweaks as to how you’re scored at the end of a ranked match. As per this patch notes postfrom NetEase: “Currently, the score you earn per Competitive match is determined by both the outcome and your individual performance. After Season 2.0 launches, we will be increasing the weight of individual performances. The better you perform, the more points you will earn in victory, and the fewer points you will lose in defeat.” I'm currently still in the Practice Range testing out the new Team Ups, with Arcane Chaos being between Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch. This one gives Strange a boost of 100 max health, while Wanda gets Sorcery Surge. This ability turns her Cthonian Burst into a rapid fire magic machine-gun, absolutely shredding the opponent. I can't wait to try this out in-match. We know that Ultron is the second Hero being added toMarvel Rivalsin Season 2, though he’s yet to be fully detailed. NetEase has revealed that we can expect Ultron to arrive sometime in Season 2.5, so it’ll be a while yet. After having played a few games ofMarvel RivalsSeason 2 over my lunch break, I'm now ready to dive a bit deeper into the Team Up abilities. First is Mental Projection, which gives Emma Frost a boost to max health of 100. Magneto gains Magnetic Resonance, which spans a body double that mimics your movements and attacks. With Magneto, this is a great way to have two shields up at once, casting a wide area of protection. Unfortunately this doesn't mean double Ultimate abilities. Interestingly, Psylocke's Ultimate sees her double firing her primary to assist, leading to extra damage. And with that, Jake is back, fully refreshed and ready to take over and continue his live analysis and coverage ofMarvel Rivalsseason 2 - see you soon gamers! Doctor Strange is the first Hero we’ll be looking at that’s set to receive some downgrades in an upcoming patch. He’s having his Daggers of Denak damage reduced from 18 to 16, and there will be a reduction to the Maelstrom of Madness conversion ratio of Dark Magic to damage from 1.3 to 1.2. Mr Fantastic is one of the Heroes being buffed significantly in Season 2. His base health is going from 650 to 675, his Stretch Punch will be more powerful, Flexible Elongation now has a slowing effect on enemies within range, and Brainiac Bounce grants adds additional bonus health. All in all, Mr Fantastic should be a lot more viable. Jake's nipped for a lunch break and to calm down a bit after all the excitement of the newMarvel Rivalsseason dropping. Have you managed to spend any time in the new season? What do you think? Let us know bytagging us on Xand give us your thoughts on the new season for a chance to be featured in our live coverage. Now thatMarvel RivalsSeason 2 is live, there's a bunch of new achievements to work through. Most of them involve completing objectives on the new Hellfire Gala: Karkoa map, or utilizing Emma Frost's abilities. Magik has a X-Men costume to unlock in the Battle Pass. It's on page 3, and costs 400 Chrono Tokens. You will need to unlock all other rewards on this page before you can get the skin, however. I finally managed to get into a match on the new Hellfire Gala: Krakoa map. It's beautiful, though it's also very dense, with loads of different angles to attack the point from. This made defending the point very difficult, though there's sure to be some great opportunities for flanking an enemy team here. I could see a dive composition doing very well on this map. Now that Emma Frost is live, we can take a look at her progression rewards, including the Lord nameplate. There's a brand new Star Lord outfit for you to purchase in the Store. It's the King of Spartax, and sees the planet-hopping hero donning some formal attire for the Hellfire Gala. Mr Fantastic has received a number of buffs in Season 2. And he might just be a new main for me. The Mission Board inMarvel Rivalshas been revamp to allow for easier readability. You'll see the Chrono tokens that can be earned at the top, and the event is clearly labelled too. You can earn a free Scarlet Witch skin now, just by playing nine matches. You can check your progress in the tab shown above. There's a name plate to grab too. I'm starting my Season 2 journey by trying out Emma Frost in the Practice Range. Her primary attack is an absolute beast, one that you barely have to aim. Psychic Spear creates a node that can be hit to damage an enemy, kind of like Moon Knight's Ankh. Diamond Form is the real highlight here, allowing you to choke slam foes and then send them flying with a kick. Season 2 has launched with a brand new event. It'll reward players with a Mantis - Flora Maiden skin once all four sections are completed, though some don't unlock for a while. I can now dig deep into the new Battle Pass, and it looks like Cloak & Dagger are the final costume unlock. Elsewhere there's new skins for Spider-Man, Captain America, and some classic X-Men costumes for Magik and Psylocke. Upon loading into Season 2, I've been rewarded a new Human Torch skin. This was for all players who reached Gold tier last season. Nice. Marvel Rivals Season 2 is now live, so jump in and take a look at the new Battle Pass, and Cerebro event. We could be seeingMarvel RivalsSeason 2 go live any moment Though it's still down for me. According to an in-game estimate,Marvel RivalsSeason 2 is set to go live in just 10 minutes. Check back in to see exactly when servers open. I'll be highlighting the new Battle Pass, and taking a look at how the mission system has changed. The Flower of Krakoa Battle Pass will launch as part of Season 2, and thanks to the trailer above, we’ve seen many of the main skins to be unlocked. There’s new costumes for Spider-Man, Hulk, Squirrel Girl, Cloak & Dagger, Captain America, Iron Fist, Star-Lord, Luna Snow, Black Widow, Magik and Psylocke. The Magik and Psylocke skins are particularly cool, with classic X-Men designs in blue and yellow. According to a new error message inMarvel Rivals, downtime could be ending in 30 minutes. I'll update with any changes. If you've downloaded theMarvel RivalsSeason 2 update, and you load into the game, you'll be greeted with the new title screen, and some lore to read through. This sets the scene for the upcoming season, giving some history of Krakoa, and the reasoning behind why the developers have picked it as the setting. We're now a little over an hour into downtime, meaning thatMarvel RivalsSeason 2 could go live in an hour or so. By NetEase's estimates, downtime is scheduled for 2-3 hours. If it's on the shorter side, we won't have to wait much longer to get in on the action. Another Team Up is being removed entirely for Season 2. It’s Voltaic Union, which saw Thor lending his lightning powers to Captain America and Storm. This is largely being done to balance Captain America, who's getting a new Team Up with Winter Soldier. Of course, Storm and Thor already have Team Ups elsewhere. You can now download theMarvel RivalsSeason 2 update. On PS5, this required me to exit the game, and \"Check for Update\". On other platforms, it should pop up automaitically. The file size is 9.386GB on PS5, on PC it's a whopping 48GB. On Xbox platforms it's 23GB. You'll want to get this download started as soon as possible. Marvel Rivalswill receive an update around launch time that players will need to download. As such, don’t delete and reinstall the game. Just make sure to have auto-updates enabled on your platform of choice, and get it downloaded as soon as it goes live. Despite having been a top pick in competitive play, Hulk is receiving a series of buffs come Season 2. His base movement speed is being increased to 650 from 600, and the cooldown time for Indestructible Guard is going from 12 seconds to 10 seconds. Finally, The charge time for Incredible Leap has been reduced. This will improve Hulks maneuverability, while helping him survive with a more frequent shield cycle. Downtime is expected to last 2-3 hours according to NetEase. During this time, you’re unable to access the game, as servers will be down. Upon loading, you’ll get into the title screen, and be shown an error message. Don’t worry, and don’t bother running diagnostics, this is just an expected error now that the servers are down. Marvel Rivalsis down. Looks as though NetEase let some players, including myself, finish their games before kicking them back out. If you try to load in now, you'll be greeted with the server error message in the screenshot above. More than five minutes after scheduled downtime and I'm still in-game. A good opportunity to get one last look at Tokyo 99 before it's taken out of the map rotation. Marvel Rivals appears to still be up. As I'm currently still in-game. We'll see what happens when downtime triggers We're now just 10 minutes away from Marvel Rivals downtime, which is scheduled to last around 2-3 hours. Hopefully, this all goes to plan and we can all jump into the new season sooner rather than later. If you've got any remaining missions to complete, and any unearned Battle Pass rewards, now is the time to jump in and make one last push. I'll be playing Quick Match as Squirrel Girl, spamming attacks to try and get one last 4KO streak before downtime activates. As part of Season 2, all players will get booted down by nine divisions at the start of the new season. This means that if you ended Season 1.5 at Diamond I, your Season 2 journey begins at Silver I. Better make that last match count! I'm still logged into Marvel Rivals, and just received a pop-up banner warning of scheduled maintenance set to trigger in 30 minutes. It also warns that ongoing battles will abruptly end, so be sure to finish you matches before this all kicks in. There’s a news map being added toMarvel Rivals: Hellfire Gala - Krakoa. This is a bright and vibrant island locale that’s the home of mutant kind everywhere. Interestingly, Krokoa is actually a living entity, with quite the history in the comics. Now for another Hero that’s getting a change this season, Captain America. Steve Rogers will be getting a brand new Team Up with Winter Soldier called Stars Aligned. As the anchor, he gets a maximum health increase of 100, and a 5% boost to damage output. Winter Soldier is then able to leap towards allies and trigger the Stellar Impact ability. This Team Up will be important, as Cap is getting a base health reduction from 675 to 650. His Living Legend shield ability is also being reduced from 400 to 350. There’s set to be some new Team Up abilities that’ll arrive as part of Season 2. The first is led by Emma Frost, who will act as the anchor for a new Team Up called Mental Projection, with Magneto and Psylocke. Emma Frost gains a maximum health boost of 100, while Magneto and Psylocke receive new abilities that create illusory projections. We're now just hours away fromMarvel RivalsSeason 2, which will introduce Emma Frost as a brand new Vanguard. Downtime will kick in at 2AM PT / 5AM ET / 10AM BST / 11AM CET / 6PM JST. Expect it to last for 2-3 hours, during which time you won't be able to load into the game. Don't worry though, I'll be bringing you all of the latest updates live, while diving deeper into what to expect from Season 2. I’m going offline for a while now, but I’ll be jumping back online at 4AM ET / 1AM PT / 9AM BST to cover the launch ofMarvel RivalsSeason 2. At that point, we’ll be only an hour away from downtime, and a few hours from launch. Here’s the key info you’ll need to know about Season 2: For now, make the most of the remaining hours of Season 1.5. Complete any remaining missions, and unlock as much of the Battle Pass as you can. If you’ve completed it, you can still earn 100 Units in exchange for 1000 Chrono Tokens, so it’s worth playing a few more games and completing your weeklies. My personal highlights for season 1.5 have been very Venom-focused. No shock really, as a Lord Venom player, but that bright orange skin is fantastic, as is the, erm, emote. Elsewhere, The Thing has been a great addition to the game, managing to dominate games by keeping certain opponents grounded. Generally, this has been a decent season, with some great skins to unlock as part of the Battle Pass. Now that Season 1.5 is winding downtag us on Xwith what you're most excited for in Season 2! There’s still time to reach Gold Tier III and earn the Human Torch (Blood Blaze) costume before the end of Season 1.5. You only need to reach Gold once, and you’ll get the reward once Season 2 is live. If you’ve yet to play 10 Competitive matches in Season 1.5, you’ll need to do so, though don’t worry, if you achieved Gold in Season 1, it doesn’t matter where you settle after your 10 games. New color options will arrive for some of the more popular skins inMarvel Rivals. So far, we’ve only seen a new variant for the Psylocke - Vengeance skin, and for Luna Snow, but I think this is definitely a neat way to add a bit more customization to Heroes. NetEase has revealed that it plans to launch a new Hero every single month starting with Season 3. I have my concerns here, especially as the roster is already so packed. Balancing could be difficult, but we’ll have to wait and see how things will play out. The first Hero I’ll be looking at is Peni Parker, who is being described as “a Hero that’s struggling to find a broader place on the battlefield” by developers. She’ll be receiving a buff in Season 2, including enhancements to her primary attack damage efficiency and a boost to her survivability and combat capabilities. Her base health is being increased from 650 to 750, and her Cyber-Web Cluster can now Crit. It also won’t slow Peni Parker down as much as she fires. There’s set to be a bunch of buffs and nerfs coming to certain Heroes in Season 2 & Season 2.5 over time. There’s a really great developer insight video that I’ve embedded above that details the main changes to characters like Mr Fantastic and Doctor Strange. I’ll be going into detail on the Heroes that are being buffed and nerfed in the lead-up to the new season, but that video is a great place to get some context behind the changes, and the reasons why the developers are making them. The upcoming Season 2 patch forMarvel Rivalswill add a new experimental feature, and it’s good news for PC players running on lower-end hardware. NetEase has outlined anew Compilation Shader featurewhich aims to improve performance: “We recommend that players with 16GB of RAM or less, who have experienced significant FPS drops, frozen screens, or frequent crashes in previous seasons, consider activating this experimental feature. And remember, if you encounter any issues after enabling it, our support team stands ready to assist on this quest for an optimal gaming experience.” I’ve just been reading up on some of the changes coming to Team Ups and METALLIC CHAOS IS GONE. The absolute monster ability that equipped Magneto with a sword made of metal and chaos magic will be removed at the start of Season 2 and if you listen closely, you’ll hear Magneto mains around the world crying out in unison. It’s not all bad news though, as Magneto is getting a new Team Up with Emma Frost that gives him a holographic double, tricking foes and allowing him to survive for longer. With less than a day left of Season 1.5, you’ll want to spend any leftover battle pass Chrono Tokens, as they won’t carry over to the new Battle Pass. There’s also set to be a rank reset for Season 2, knocking all players down nine divisions. Time to lock in and climb as high as you can, so that your starting rank for next season is as high as possible. If you've purchased Chrono Tokens however, these will carry over. No for real though, what happened to Blade? Did he escape from his prison? Will he be added as a Hero anytime soon? Here’s hoping. Got a pal that you wanna treat this season? Well, there’s a new Gifting feature launching in Season 2. You’ll be able to purchase and send out items to friends, making Secret Santa exchanges and birthday presents a lot easier to buy for this year (I’d like a new Magik skin if any of my pals are reading). Scarlet Witch is getting a hefty buff in Season 2 with a new Team Up featuring Doctor Strange. She’s well worth trying out, especially for newcomers, as you’ll get to unlock and use the Chaos Gown skin just by playing nine matches. Nice! Welcome to Krakoa! The annual Hellfire Gala kicks off in Season 2, hosted by the glamorous Emma Frost. With the timelines in disarray, she’s gathering all of our Heroes for an event like no other. This season will center around the Gala, with Krakoa being the setting for a new Domination map. You’ll also notice Heroes receiving new skins where they’re positively dressed to the nines. A very fashion-forward affair indeed. Marvel Rivalsis free to play, but of course, there are a lot of new skins and cosmetics that you’ll need to pay for. Before we all jump in and buy the Battle Pass, however, it’s worth highlighting some free stuff that you can pick up in Season 2. Firstly there’s a new Emma Frost skin that you can earn by reaching Gold tier in Competitive Mode. Then there’s the Scarlet Witch Chaos Gown skin, which you just need to play nine matches in order to unlock. You’ll get a nameplate too. 💧 Watch your favorite Marvel Rivals streams and earn epic Twitch Drops including a spray, nameplate, emotes, and the stunning \"Will of Galacta\" costume for Namor!\n📅 Event Time:\n🕛 Starts: April 11, 12:00 PM UTC/5:00 AM PT/8:00 AM ET\n🕓 Ends: April 30, 11:59 PM UTC/4:59 PM… pic.twitter.com/7iDmYIXDfOApril 9, 2025 Finally, there’s a blue and pink Namor skin that can be earned as a Twitch Drop. Just stick on your favoriteMarvel RivalsTwitch streamer while you play, and after four hours the skin will be yours. Emma Frost is the headline Hero for Season 2 and fills the role of a Vanguard. By the looks of things, she’s an interesting mix of brawler and strategist, with the ability to place shields, blocking and absorbing damage away from her team. She also has a telekinetic blast that does impressive DPS. There’s a diamond skin mode that allows Emma Frost to get up close and personal, making use of a chokeslam/kick combo that looks wild. Definitely one to watch this season. Let’s kick things off with a look at when you’ll actually be able to jump into Season 2 and try out Emma Frost for yourself. Things are a bit complicated, but expect downtime to start on April 11 at 2AM PDT / 5AM / 10AM BST / 11AM CET / 6PM JST.

    "title": "RFK Jr. promises to uncover cause of ‘autism epidemic’",
    "article_text": "US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced a large-scale federal initiative aimed at identifying the factors behind what he called the“autism epidemic,”with findings expected by September 2025. Speaking during a televised Cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday, Kennedy – who has previously been accused by critics of promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines – said the new research effort would involve“hundreds of scientists from around the world.” “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures,”Kennedy promised. He stressed the urgency of the project, citing a sharp increase in childhood autism diagnoses over recent decades, rising from“one in 10,000 when I was a kid.” RFK Jr. just pledged: “By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.”“The autism rate, the most recent numbers we think are about 1 in 31 … up from 1 in 10,000 when I was a kid.”“We’ve launched a massive research effort that’s gonna involve hundreds of…pic.twitter.com/Eq0pwHGYRg The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently estimate that 1 in 36 children in the US are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder – a rise often attributed to improved awareness and expanded diagnostic criteria. “That is a horrible statistic, isn’t it? There’s got to be something artificial out there that’s doing this,”Trump told Kennedy. “If you can come up with that answer – where you stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it’s a shot – but something’s causing it,”Trump added. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) already invests over $300 million annually in autism research, primarily focusing on genetic factors and prenatal environmental influences. Kennedy did not elaborate on the scope of the“massive testing and research effort”being rolled out or what specific exposures might be targeted. Kennedy, the founder of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, has gained prominence in the US for questioning the safety and effectiveness of childhood inoculations and promoting the claim that they are linked to autism – a theory widely rejected by the scientific community. He was also a vocal critic of the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 response measures, including lockdowns and the rapid rollout of experimental vaccines. Despite his controversial reputation, Kennedy denies being opposed to immunization, noting that his own children have been vaccinated. During his confirmation hearings, he stated that he advocates for stricter safety testing and more rigorous studies. After Kennedy endorsed Trump’s campaign last year, the president vowed to give him broad authority over healthcare policy, saying he would let Kennedy“go wild.”",

    "title": "Only six Western states willing to deploy troops to Ukraine – AFP",
    "article_text": "Only six Western nations have pledged to send troops to Ukraine after the hostilities between Kiev and Moscow end, AFP has reported. Most of Ukraine’s supporters are reluctant to make any promises, according to the agency. The report comes after the latest meeting of defense ministers from the so-called“coalition of the willing”in Brussels on Thursday. The group of some 30 nations, predominantly composed of EU and NATO member states, appears to remain split on a potential deployment. Its members are questioning the goals and mandate of the proposed mission. Thus far, only six nations, including the UK, France, and the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have promised to contribute troops, the AFP reported, citing unnamed European officials. The sixth state in the group was not named by the agency. Britain, has insisted the coalition has actual plans to deploy, claiming that the troops would contribute to a“lasting peace”between Russia and Ukraine. “Our planning is real and substantial. Our plans are well developed,”UK defense minister John Healey told the meeting.“Our reassurance force for Ukraine would be a committed and credible security arrangement to ensure that any negotiated peace does bring what [US President Donald] Trump has pledged, a lasting peace for Ukraine,”he added. Other coalition members, however, have publicly expressed concerns about a potential mission, refusing to make any commitment before plans are more fleshed out. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said the group must have the US on board, though Washington has repeatedly said it has no plans to send troops to Ukraine in any role. “What is the potential mission, what is going to be the goal?”Brekelmans wondered.“What is the mandate? What would we do in the different scenarios, for example, if there would be any escalation regarding Russia?” Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson highlighted“a number of questions that we need to get clarified”before it could make any promises.“It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do - if we are peacekeeping, deterrence or reassurance,”he said. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against deploying troops to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to forces from any NATO countries ending up in the country. Last month, former Russian President and the deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the potential emergence of any NATO“peacekeepers”in Ukraine would mean a war between the bloc and Russia.",

    "title": "John Mulaney's ‘Everybody’s Live’ Is Just as Delightfully Weird in Person",
    "article_text": "We’re about halfway throughEverybody's Live With John Mulaney, the latest iteration ofJohn Mulaney’s gloriously random late-night experiment, and at this crucial juncture, the reading on the heat check comes in at “fire.” In one of the longest-running and most staid formats on television, Mulaney is a breath of fresh air still in mid-exhale. I had the pleasure of watching from the stands at Sunset Gower Studios as last night's episode unfolded, and can report that the show’s looseness—the key to its trademark weirdness—feels just as organic in the room. The show thrives off its aura of fluidity and its obsession with the bizarre and ephemeral; it's more subservient to its creator’s idiosyncrasies than it is to any late-night talk show conventions. “It’s fun to have a topic, and not to interview people about their career or life,\" Mulaneytold Vulturein an interview when the series returned to Netflix a few weeks ago. The original iteration,Everybody's in L.A., was loosely themed around Los Angeles–specific topics; the new, non-regionalEverybody's Liveis free to range wider, for good and for ill. An episode from a few weeks ago whose theme was “cruise ships” left Mulaney struggling to find compelling angles to riff on with guests Quinta Brunson and card-carryingPoseidon AdventurefanBen Stiller, while a cameo from Silkk the Shocker flailed once the shock of his appearance wore off. The lesson? A truly successful episode requires more incisive themes, and maybe a more calculated lineup for assured banter. So an installment reuniting Mulaney with longtime friendsBill Haderand Chelsea Peretti, both riffers extraordinaire, plus the always-gameJohnny Knoxville, and a broadly-relatable topic—“getting fired”—is about as close as a show like this can get to guaranteeing a hit. And it was, while still feeling light on its feet. Early into sitting down, Hader audibly whispered to Mulaney, “Is the whole show like this?” and Mulaney, laughing, answered “Yes,” with the excitement of someone who's just roped his boy into chaos he clearly wasn’t quite prepared for. No sweat: Hader told a great anecdote about getting fired from his first job, while gleefully lobbing candy from the trusty food-delivery robot Saymo into the crowd, to John’s bemusement. But of course the real charm here are the throw-it-at-the-wall ideas that seem to pop out of Mulaney’s brain, a factor no one can calculate or predict. On last night's episode, Mulaney started the evening off with an insane, zigzaggingeight-minutemonologue about career dejection, Madden and Ray Lewis—a sequence long and intricate enough that he could have slotted it into his next stand-up special. This week's courtside-seat cameo from a fake VIP in the audience turned into an extended dance number from a heroin-addicted pimp whose likeness is the secret inspiration for Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah. And this week’s digital short was a prolonged60 Minutes–esque interview with Bubbles the Chimp—on the strength of the gloriously thin peg of the Michael Jackson movie being delayed—that felt like a so-goofy-it’s-brilliant bit you might see in latter-seriesAtlanta. Shortly after his monologue, Mulaney did one of his recurring bits, matter-of-factly reading dry trade-paper news about which celebrities signed with which agencies off of a clipboard. When he brought his guests out, he sat back down and apologetically read off one last name: “Emmy Rossum signed with WME.” Did he truly miss a name, or did he “forget” on purpose, then rectify as if it really mattered, to score a chuckle later? I can’t call it, and ultimately, it doesn’t matter; that gray area between the inadvertent and the inspired is where this show's brilliance lives.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris Has Been Quietly, Carefully Working the Phones and Plotting Her Next Move",
    "article_text": "Kamala Harriswas most definitely sayingI told you soaboutDonald Trump.Last week the former vice president made a surprise appearance at a women’s leadership conference in California’s Orange County, giving her first extended remarks since her November 6 concession speech. Harris’s tone was somber, with one major exception. “There were many things that we knew would happen,” she said before departing from her written text. “I’m not here to say I told you so! I swore I wasn’t gonna say that!” With that, Harris briefly backed away from the mic, laughing and grinning. “I thought she performed incredibly well—one of her best speeches,” saysAshley Etienne,who worked as Harris’s communications director during her first year as vice president and was in the room last week. “The way I read it was, she felt a little lighter in her presentation but heavier in the depth of what she was saying.” Those eight minutes may have also been a preview of what’s to come: Harris, according to an associate, is now writing a longer and broader speech that will address the chaotic moment the country is enduring, with a tentative aim of delivering it in the next several months. She is also at work on a book. Both moves will stoke even more speculation about Harris’s plans, which are already the subject of considerable debate in her own camp: Should she run for governor of California in 2026 or mount a third presidential bid in 2028? Or none of the above? “She’s taking a second to figure out how she can best serve in this moment,” a senior adviser says. “People are expecting her to only be guided by this blind ambition of, ‘I want to be in charge,’ when in fact a lot of the roles she’s played are because one, she wants to do the job, but two, she knows how she can make the biggest difference.” Harris has mostly been offstage during President Trump’s first 100 days, drawing some criticism from a Democratic Party in search of leadership. She certainly earned a break, having run a frantic 107-day presidential campaign, which saw her pile up 75 million votes but lose the Electoral College decisively. Harris took ashort vacationin Hawaii, put on a stoic face atTrump’s inauguration, andhelped distributefood in Altadena amid the January wildfires in Southern California. Harris has also, a friend says, been catching up on her passion for cooking, spending time with her nieces and nephews, and soliciting suggestions for TV shows to binge-watch. But even though Harris is out of elected office for the first time in 21 years, she is not entirely out of the game. She has been working the phones; focusing on how to improve the party’s state-level infrastructure and social media presence; chatting up donors; and congratulating activists for helping defeat four Republicanballot measuresin Louisiana. Harris has also been assessing the reasons for her defeat, if not dwelling on the what-ifs. “In my experience, she is not the kind of person who ruminates on the past,” saysJamal Simmons,who served as vice presidential communications director in the middle of Harris’s term. “Working for her, sometimes you want to spend time licking your wounds or celebrating your success. She’s thinking about, Here’s where we are—what do we need to do to get to the next place? You’re like, Can we have a cocktail first?” Her team’s early reading, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that Harris wasn’t the problem in 2024. “What she ran on—health care and housing and small businesses—that wasn’t the wrong message,” saysSheila Nix,Harris’s chief of staff during the campaign and now in private life. “The people who heard that message, they liked it. So it shouldn’t be, ‘Oh my God, throw your hands up in the air. We don’t even know what to say to people.’ No, that’s not true. The values she talked about and the things she cared about were important to the people who heard them.” One obvious place for Harris to go next is the 2026 California governor’s race—an option too obvious, in the view of some of her advisers, who see quickly jumping into the contest as the political equivalent of dating a rebound boyfriend. Others believe she’ll be unable to stay out of the action for long. “She hasn’t been out of public service during her entire career,” a Harris insider says. “I think it will be difficult for her to pass up a bird in the hand.” Harris has told allies she will make up her mind by the end of this summer. At least 10 Democrats have already declared their candidacy to succeed the term-limited current governor,Gavin Newsom.Harris would instantly become the front-runner if she were to join the field, and most of the other Democratic candidates would probably step aside, though former Los Angeles mayorAntonio Villaraigosahas said he’dstay inthe fight, and he could be formidable in a runoff. “He has a stronger relationship with Republicans in the state than Kamala does, and he has a more real relationship with Latino voters across the state than Kamala does,” saysMike Trujillo,a former strategist for Villaraigosa’s mayoral campaign. In March, former representativeKatie Porter,another Democrat in the gubernatorial race, also made anindirect digat Harris’s delayed decision-making: “No one should be waiting to lead. I think we need to make a case right now.” Yet Harris needs to determine whether she wants to run for president again in three years before deciding whether she wants to run for governor next year. Her keeping the national option open provided a not-so-subtle subtext for her speech last week: It came as possible 2028 Democratic primary rivals—including New Jersey senatorCory Booker,Illinois governorJB Pritzker,Connecticut senatorChris Murphy,New York congresswomanAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez,and even former Harris running mateTim Walz,the governor of Minnesota—have been aggressively promoting themselves. They are in the middle of the conversation that has been raging for the past few months, about how the Democratic Party can and should remake itself—a discussion from which Harris has been largely absent. “I think she deserves to be part of that conversation. She’s earned the right to put her thumb on the scale of what’s next here,” a Harris insider says. “Democrats, in general, are lacking messengers who have name ID and respect. And I think people need to remember that she only lost the popular vote by 1.5%.” Maybe Harris will benefit from maintaining a relatively low profile for now, allowing Trump to flail and giving voters space to forget what they disliked about her. But if she ramps up her visibility without a more potent message, she risks allowing an unflattering conventional wisdom to congeal. “Right after the election, people were like, ‘Oh, she did everything she could,’” a former high-ranking Biden-Harris campaign operative says. “Now the consensus is building that the future of the party isn’t someone like her—an overly cautious candidate who let other people define her and played things extremely, extremely safe. And even in 2028, the Biden baggage is gonna be an issue for her.” As thoroughly as Harris laughed at her own joke last week, she certainly can’t enjoy being proven right about Trump and watching from the sidelines as he demolishes the federal government and so many democratic norms. Harris closed her speech by vowing, “I’m not going anywhere.” Now she just needs to figure out where, exactly, she wants to go.
