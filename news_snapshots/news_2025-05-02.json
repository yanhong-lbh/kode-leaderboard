    "title": "Remains of domestic cats found in wreckage of ancient ship were likely first to arrive in United States",
    "article_text": "ASPCA Senior Behavior Manager Adi Hovav joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to explain the benefits of adopting kittens. Cats have lived alongside humans for thousands of years, and the remains of two domestic felines found in a nearly 500-year-oldSpanish shipwrecklikely represent the earliest example of the animal in what is now the United States, according to a new study. \"Cats accompanied sailors on ships where they were relied on to hunt rats and mice that were infesting ships’ holds,\" researchers wrote in a study published in American Antiquity last month. The Emanuel Point II, a Spanish conquistador ship, wrecked in Florida’s Pensacola Bay in 1559 during a hurricane. The shipwreck was discovered in 2006, and the researchers said the remains of an adult and juvenile cat were found in the wreckage.

The study said that analyses of the two cats and other historical cat remains showthe petsranged dramatically in size from normal house cats to much smaller. The researchers wrote that, based on a chemical analysis of the remains, the adult cat doesn’t seem to have relied on rats for food and mainly ate a diet of fish and possibly domestic meat. \"These pests were unintentionally introduced to the New World, and cats would have followed, hunting both native and invasive pests,\" the study said of rats. Cats have long accompanied sailors on ships.(Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Within the U.S., early cat remains have also been found in the colonial settlements in St. Augustine, Florida, and the British colony of Jamestown in Virginia and were possibly aboard the Mayflower. LOST CAT MAKES 900-MILE JOURNEY BACK HOME TO CALIFORNIA FROM YELLOWSTONE Cats aren’t native to the U.S. and are believed to have originated in the Middle East before they were brought to the Americas by Europeans. They were likely introduced to Europe for pest control, the scientists said. The researchers said they weren’t sure if the cats on the Emanuel Point II were brought on board intentionally, but study co-author John Bratten, an anthropologist at the University of West Florida, told Live Science the cats apparently ate a similar diet to the sailors, which showed that they were fed either because there weren’t enough rats or out of kindness. Cats were first brought to the Americas by Europeans.(Getty Images) \"It was interesting to think about the idea of the cat being a pet or one that was looked after by the Spanish sailors,\" Bratten told Live Science. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The study said, \"That cats were on board [the Emanuel Point II] suggests their primary role may have been as commensal ratters and mousers that kept the onboard rodent population in check. This does not, however, preclude the possibility that these cats were well liked and cared for by the sailors.\" Cats were also considered lucky by sailors, the researchers added. Today, one in three U.S. households has a pet cat.",

    "title": "Anthony Weiner says voters don't want what 'Democrats are selling,' talks about comeback as fiery centrist",
    "article_text": "Rep. Tom Suozzi spoke with Fox News Digital about Democrats' roadmap to winning back the House in 2026. Infamous ex-New York congressman Anthony Weiner argued in a new profile about his latest political comeback effort that there is a \"disconnect\" between New York Democrats’ brand and what voters actually want. Weiner launched acampaign for New York City Council,a position he held from 1992 to 1998, in December. Weiner was elected to represent New York's 9th Congressional District in 1998 and resigned in 2011 after he posted a photo of himself in his underwear on social media and initially lied about it. The incident was followed by years of sexting scandals, including one that derailed his 2013 New York City mayoral bid, and Weiner was charged with transferring obscene material to a minor in May 2017 after sexting a 15-year-old girl, leading to a prison sentence. The Atlantic’s Josh Tyrangiel, who lives in the Manhattan district Weiner hopes to represent,interviewedthe disgraced politician about his return to the campaign trail. \"Weirdly, the biggest obstacle to Weiner’s comeback may be not his past, but his politics,\" The Atlantic writer said. \"He’s lived in District 2 since 2011, but it’s far from the mostly white, middle-class parts of Queens and Brooklyn he represented as a congressman. Every District 2 council member since the early 1990s has been Hispanic. Just 8 percent of the district’s 175,000 residents are registered Republicans. Fresh Defund the Police graffiti appears regularly. Our rats share their pronouns.\" Former congressman Anthony Weiner seen on Times Square promoting public art. (Photo by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) ANTHONY WEINER MULLS RETURN: DISGRACED EX-POL SAYS NEW YORK CITY NEEDS NEW LEADERSHIP Weiner, described by Tyrangiel as a centrist who \"thinks the neighborhood needs more cops and fewer pot shops,\" argued that local Democrats are misguided. \"If this election is about the most anti-Trump, crazy-making person on the left, you’re not going to pick a [Andrew] Cuomo or a Weiner,\" Weiner said. \"Now, I could be completely wrong, but there seems to be a disconnect with the brand that New York Democrats are selling and what people want to buy right now.\" When asked what evidence he has to believe this, Weiner replied, \"I’m in New York with a head on my shoulders seeing what’s going on on 14th Street.\" Tyrangiel summarized that Weiner’s campaign is focused around two core assumptions, the first of which is the importance of quality of life issues, like addressing subway-fare evasion, sidewalk scaffolding and the recent proliferation of \"missile-like E-bikes in bike lanes.\" The writer observed, \"Technocratic intolerance for disorder was last a thing in New York City during the Bloomberg administration, but it’s hardly novel.\" Anthony Weiner, a former Democratic congressman leaves Federal Court in New York September 25, 2017 after being sentenced for sexting with a 15-year-old girl.(TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The second assumption, Tyrangiel said, is that, \"Given Democrats’ generally foul mood, it’s not enough to be moderate. To reach the electorate, moderates must also be angry.\" \"You know, usually we associate firebrands with an extreme kind of thing,\" Weiner said. \"Well, what if the fire is just, like,Ya gotta collect the f---ing garbage, man?\" One key aspect Tyrangiel observed from watching the candidate at forums and Zoom meetings is that Weiner is locking horns not just on the issues, but with core constituency groups within his own party. When a union representing medical residents and interns spoke about building more housing near hospitals, Weiner retorted, \"Am I going to do that for the firefighters also? Am I going to do that for the guys who work in the sanitation department? You tell me how you expect this to work.\" The Atlantic writer also noted another exchange where Weiner shredded progressive orthodoxy on homelessness. During one part of the interview, Weiner argued there is a certain authenticity in disagreeing with voters: \"Sometimes they actually kind of like it when you say, ‘F--- me? F--- you.’ That's more of an acknowledgment that you’re actually listening to them than just saying ‘Yes, I agree.’\" Former Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner (right) and his ex-wife Huma Abedin divorced earlier this year.(Getty) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the profile, Weiner revealed he was a sex addict. He and his ex-wife Huma Abedin separated in 2016 and officially divorced earlier this year. Abedin, who was a top aide to Hillary Clinton, is now dating billionaire Democratic megadonor Alex Soros.

As Ocasio-Cortez first began speaking, she pulled up a PowerPoint presentation for the night's event. She was then interrupted before even getting through her first slide discussing the Trump administration's budget cuts, including alleged cuts to local healthcare systems. \"I am ahealthcare workerand I want to know what you're doing about the genocide in Gaza!\" the protester started shouting at the congresswoman.

Mariano Rivera, who spent his entire storied MLB career with the New York Yankees, has been added as a defendant in a lawsuit. Rivera's wife, Clara Rivera, was also listed as a defendant in an amended sexual abuse suit filed by an unnamed girl and her mother. USA Today Sportsobtained a copy of the new complaint after it was filed in Westchester County Court April 25.

MARIANO RIVERA, WIFE BREAK SILENCE AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF COVERING UP CHILD SEX ABUSE In the previous filing, the Riveras were accused of taking inadequate measures to protect the girl listed as Jane Doe in the complaint.

    "article_text": "Chris Whipple, author of 'Uncharted,' shares key takeaways from his book after Democrats defended former President Biden's age and mental acuity before he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election. MSNBC host and former White House press secretaryJen Psakiinsisted in a new interview that she never saw signs that former President Joe Biden had declined while she worked for him. \"I never saw that person —not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day, that was on that debate stage,\" Psaki said on the \"Mixed Signals\" podcast about Biden's performance during the June 2024presidential debatewhich raised alarms about his fitness to serve another term. He dropped out the following month and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee. \"I'm not a doctor. Aging happens quite quickly,\"Psaki addedon the Semafor podcast that was published Friday. The former Biden aide, who left the White House in May 2022, said she hadn't seen him in person in the two-and-a-half years afterward leading up to the November election.

Psaki suggested one reason there may have been a reluctance to report on these concerns. \"While we know there were problematic things behind-the-scenes now in 2023 and 2024, there was an aggressive all-out pitching operation from the right-wing and from the Republicans about Joe Biden's age and how he was in decline….the majority of which wasn't true, in 2019-2022,\" Psaki claimed.

    "title": "New report warns NATO's data vulnerabilities could cost lives without US fix",
    "article_text": "U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker discusses progress in a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine under President Donald Trump on 'The Will Cain Show.’ A new report warns thatNATO is unpreparedfor modern digital warfare. Without stronger leadership, especially from the U.S., the alliance could face serious security risks. The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) released a study showing that many NATO members are failing to modernize their military data systems. Although NATO leaders talk about the importance of secure and shared cloud infrastructure, most countries still store critical military information in local servers that arevulnerable to cyberattacks. The report calls data the \"currency of warfare\" and urges NATO to improve how it stores and shares military information. FOR PUTIN, 'US IS THE MAIN ENEMY,' ESTONIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS President Donald Trump, left, and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, to his right, look on as Polish President Andrzej Duda speaks during a working lunch at the NATO leaders' summit in Watford, Britain, on Dec. 4, 2019.(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque) At the moment, most NATO countries are building separate national cloud systems. France uses Thales, Germany uses Arvato, and Italy is working with Leonardo to develop sovereign defense cloud services, according to the CEPA report Defend in the Cloud: Boost NATO Data Resilience. The U.S. has its own approach, using Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Oracle to build a sovereign cloud for the Department of Defense, as noted in the same CEPA report. This fragmented setup is creating major problems. The CEPA report explains that many of these national systems are not interoperable, which makes it difficult for NATO allies to share intelligence or respond rapidly in times of crisis. Although 22 NATO members have pledged to build shared cloud capabilities, progress has been slow. CEPA describes a gap between what leaders promise and what is actually getting done, and the process remains slow and overly bureaucratic. NORWAY RAISES SECURITY CONCERNS OVER MANHATTAN-SIZED ARCTIC LAND SALE AS TENSIONS RISE Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks with the media as he arrives for a meeting of NATO defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Feb. 13.(AP Photo/Harry Nakos) Some of the hesitation stems from political tensions. Since returning to office,President Donald Trumphas reinforced his long-standing position that NATO members must meet their defense spending commitments. In early 2025, Trump proposed raising the target above the current 2% benchmark and stated publicly that the U.S. would only defend NATO allies who meet what he considers their \"fair share\" of the burden. TRUMP PRAISED FOR GETTING NATO ALLIES TO BOLSTER DEFENSE SPENDING: ‘REALLY STAGGERING’ At the same time, Trump has taken credit for strengthening the alliance by pushing European governments to boost their defense budgets. In March, he pointed to what he called \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" in new allied defense spending as proof that his pressure was effective. His administration continues to engage in high-level NATO meetings and has publicly affirmed support for the alliance’s core mission. Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohas worked to reassure European partners. During an April meeting with NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, he stated that the U.S. is \"as active in NATO as it has ever been,\" pushing back on claims that the administration is disengaging. Secretary of State Marco Rubio addresses the audience during a final press conference as part of the meeting of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs at NATO's headquarters in Brussels on April 4.(Jacquelyn Martin/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) According to statements published by the State Department and reported by Reuters, Rubio emphasized that Trump is not opposed to NATO itself, but to an alliance that is under-prepared or underfunded. Rubio is also playing a central role in U.S. efforts to broker peace in Ukraine. In early 2025, he led direct talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia and presented Trump’s terms for a possible ceasefire, according to official State Department readouts and contemporaneous reporting by Reuters and other outlets. Rubio has emphasized that Ukraine and European allies will remain closely involved in the process. After a pause in U.S. aid earlier this year, he announced that military support would resume once Kyiv signaled agreement with the proposed framework for peace. Meanwhile, NATO continues to provide assistance to Ukraine through a trust fund valued at nearly $1 billion. This figure is based on NATO’s own reporting on its Comprehensive Assistance Package, as cited in CEPA’s April report. The alliance is also coordinating training and equipment donations, but the CEPA report makes it clear that efforts are being slowed by a lack of secure data sharing. The report points to Estonia as a model for digital resilience. Estonia backs up its government data in Luxembourg through a \"data embassy\" system, ensuring it remains protected even if local systems are attacked. NATO, according to CEPA, should encourage similar strategies across the alliance.

A transgender swimmer won five women's races at the U.S. Masters Swimming Spring National Championship last weekend. The swimmer, 47-year-old Ana Caldas, dominated all five races the athlete competed in, taking gold in the women's age 45-49 category in five races, including the 50- and 100-yard breaststroke, freestyle and the 100-yard individual medley. The controversy prompted backlash on social media. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM U.S. Masters Swimming has provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the controversy. \"USMS is aware of allegations regarding the eligibility of a swimmer who competed at our Spring National Championship. We have received an eligibility review request and will follow our formal process to make a determination,\" the statement read. \"USMS exists to empower adults to improve their lives through swimming. The health and fitness benefits of swimming are the primary focus of that mission, but we also strive to create a community that values fairness, competition, and inclusion. In that spirit, USMS has had a longstanding policy on transgender swimmers that was created, and periodically reviewed and updated, by relevant member committees with input from subject matter experts. The policy includes procedures to address questions of eligibility.\" U.S. Masters Swimming's gender eligibility policy allows transgender swimmers to participate in the gender competition category in which they identify, and they may also be recognized for accomplishments, granted certain conditions are met. One of those conditions requires that a \"hormonal therapy appropriate for the female gender has been administered continuously and uninterrupted in a verifiable manner for a sufficient length of time, no less than one year, to minimize gender-related advantages in sport competitions\" and subsequent proof of low enough testosterone levels. In June 2023, Texas passed the Save Women's Sports Act, which bans trans athletes from competing in girls and women's sports and only allows students to compete in the gender category listed on their birth certificate. The law only allows schools to recognize changes made to birth certificates that were made to correct a clerical error.

The show's websitecalls it a \"campy, surreal, funny\" and \"emotionally honest\" take on the cultural fascination surrounding Mangione's case that imagines him \"sharing a prison with real-life inmates Sam Bankman-Fried and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs.\" On the play's Instagram account, the actor playing Mangione is shown singing a line about the events that led up to his arrest that goes, \"flash those pearly whites, there were cameras there that night, and that’s what let the police take me in.\" TRUMP ADMIN USES LUIGI MANGIONE CASE TO ‘SEND A MESSAGE’ IN FIRST 100 DAYS: FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR The suspected gunman was shown smiling days before the murder in security camera footage.(Fox News) The 60-minute show will debut at Taylor Street Theater on June 13.

    "article_text": "Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., on House lawmakers considering raising the SALT tax cap and some Republicans calling for Medicaid reform. TheDemocratic National Committee(DNC) is launching a month of action to \"Fight to Save Medicaid,\" targeting four \"vulnerable\"House Republicans, who Democrats claim are \"poised to gut Medicaid and other critical programs.\" Republicans quickly fired back in statements to Fox News Digital on Friday. \"The dishonest Democrats should rename their campaign ‘the fight to save taxpayer-funded welfare benefits for illegal immigrants’ because that’s what they’re really trying to do,\" Rep. Mike Lawler's director of communications, Ciro Riccardi, told Fox News Digital. \"This is a desperate political stunt, plain and simple. The truth is that Congressman Lawler has been very clear on this: he will vote to protect and strengthen Medicaid for those who rely on this critical program.\" DAVID HOGG FACES CHALLENGE TO DNC ROLE AS PARTY TENSIONS ESCALATE Medicaid recipient Emily Gabriella protests outside the U.S. Supreme Court as oral arguments are delivered in the case of Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic on April 2, 2025, in Washington.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The DNC's multipronged pressure campaign, including digital, local and direct action, will target Republican Reps. Lawler of New York, Tom Barrett of Michigan, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. The DNC is advising voters to post \"accountability content\" on social media, host \"People's Town Halls\" in the Republicans' congressional districts, and call or email their representatives to \"make their outrage known.\" DNC ChairKen Martinsaid the four Congressional Republicans will \"seal their political fate if they go along with Trump’s disastrous budget.\" \"To ensure these Republicans understand that it’s either their vote or their job, the DNC is launching its first-ever distributed organizing program to offer voters a platform to join Democrats in taking direct action — from hosting town halls to mobilizing their personal networks — against the GOP’s budget, while building grassroots power for critical elections still ahead. Our representatives must serve the people — not ignore them. Republicans will either learn that lesson now or at the ballot box,\" Martin said. TRUMP SAYS PUBLIC ENTITLEMENTS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID WON'T BE TOUCHED IN GOP BUDGET BILL While Democrats have railed against potential cuts to Medicaid since PresidentDonald Trumpwas elected in November, theWhite House has maintainedthat public entitlements, including Social Security and Medicaid, will not be cut in the Republicans' budget bill. \"All national Democrats have are pathetic lies and fear-mongering tactics to distract from their failures. They were already forced to take down their dishonest Medicaid ads across the country because Americans know they’re full of crap, and voters aren't going to buy their latest publicity stunt,\" National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) Spokesman Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital in a response to the DNC's new pressure campaign. Last month, Democrats were forced to take down six billboards targeting Republican Reps. Gabe Evans, Don Bacon, Ryan Mackenzie, Monica De La Cruz, Jen Kiggans and Rob Wittman, as reported bythe Washington Examiner,after the NRCC sent a cease and desist letter to Lamar Advertising Company, accusing the vendor of spreading \"defamatory messages.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., center, during a news conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025.

Scott Applewhite/AP) \"What DC Democrats are saying when it comes to Medicaid is they oppose having work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, annual audits to ensure only eligible individuals receive benefits, and ensuring that only people who are here legally should qualify,\" Bacon told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The methods our group of 12 Republicans has identified to improve Medicaid are not controversial or cutting the quality of healthcare. We're protecting our children and those most vulnerable. Last time the DNC targeted me on this issue, the billboard companies pulled their ads for false information.\" While Bacon blamed the DNC for the billboards, the DNC was not affiliated with that ad campaign. House Majority Forward, a Super PAC focused on electing House Democrats, launched the billboard campaign. Despite Republicans' assurances that Medicaid services will be protected, there isdebate among the partyabout how to slash wasteful spending within the program. Those discussions come as Republicans seek to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and deliver Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which includes no taxes on tips and Social Security. But Democrats are warning \"vulnerable\" House Republicans that Medicaid cuts are a losing issue, and their new campaign will not just hold Republicans accountable but help them win back a Democratic majority in 2026. Governors Josh Green, D-Md; Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M.; Ned Lamont, D-Conn., Tina Kotek, D-Ore., and Matt Meyer, Del., hosted a press conference about protecting Medicaid on Thursday, February 20.(Paul Steinhauser - Fox News Digital ) \"House Republicans have lost the trust of the American people and are on track to lose in the midterms because of their record of broken promises.

    "article_text": "American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'FOX & Friends' to analyze the conservative party winning the chancellor's election in Germany. Germany’s domesticintelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution or BfV, on Friday classified the country’s popular Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as \"extremist.\" \"Central to our assessment is the ethnically and ancestrally defined concept of the people that shapes the AfD, which devalues entire segments of the population in Germany and violates their human dignity,\" the BfV said, explaining its decision. \"This concept is reflected in the party’s overall anti-migrant and anti-Muslim stance.\" The AfD slammed the decision, calling it a \"blow against democracy,\" claiming it was \"clearly politically motivated,\" which the BfV denied. The U.S. also criticized the designation, with Secretary ofState Marco Rubioclaiming it is \"tyranny in disguise.\" GERMANY ACCUSES ELON MUSK OF TRYING TO INTERFERE IN ITS NATIONAL ELECTIONS Alice Weidel, co-leader of the country's popular Alternative for Germany political party, speaks at an event in January.(Sean Gallup/Getty Images) \"Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,\"Rubio posted on X. \"That’s not democracy—it’s tyranny in disguise.

TRUMP CELEBRATES CONSERVATIVE PARTY WIN IN GERMANY An emblem of Germany's Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BfV), the country's domestic intelligence service.(Reuters/Wolfgang Rattay ) The BfV also classifies the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NDP), the Islamic State and other Islamist groups, and the far-left Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany as \"extremist.\" The classification allows the intelligence agency to closely surveil the AfD, which came in second in Germany’s February elections, winning a record number of seats in parliament. Germany’s intelligence agency is more legally constrained than other European countries in its ability to surveil political parties, which requires the \"extremist\" designation, because of its history under Nazi and Communist rule. The designation also allows the intelligence service to intercept party communications. The \"extremist\" designation followed a 1,100-page report by the intelligence agency, and a court case loss for AfD in challenging the BfV’s previous classification of the political party as one suspected of extremism. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the intelligence service's designation \"tyranny in disguise.\"(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Conservative leaderFriedrich Merz,who heads theChristian Democratic Union (CDU), will be confirmed as chancellor next week following the elections in a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats.

    "title": "US readies Russia sanctions over Ukraine, unclear if Trump will sign, sources say",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. U.S. officials have finalized new economic sanctionsagainst Russia, including banking and energy measures, to intensify pressure on Moscow to embrace U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to end its war on Ukraine, according to three U.S. officials and a source familiar with the issue. The targets include state-owned Russian energy giant Gazprom and major entities involved in the natural resources and banking sectors, said an administration official, who like the other sources requested anonymity to discuss the issue. US-UKRAINE INCHING TOWARD MINERAL DEAL AMID LAST-MINUTE ROADBLOCKS The official provided no further details. It was far from clear, however, whether the package will be approved by Trump, whose sympathy for Moscow's statements and actions have given way to frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spurning of his calls for a ceasefire and peace talks. The U.S. National Security Council \"is trying to coordinate some set of more punitive actions against Russia,\" said the source familiar with the issue. \"This will have to be signed off by Trump.\" \"It’s totally his call,\" confirmed a second U.S. official. \"From the beginning, the president has been clear about his commitment to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire,\" said National Security Council Spokesman James Hewitt. \"We do not comment on the details of ongoing negotiations.\" TheU.S. Treasury, which implements most U.S. sanctions, did not respond to a request for comment. An approval by Trump of new sanctions, which would follow the Wednesday signing of a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal that he heavily promoted as part of his peace effort, could signify a hardening of his stance towards the Kremlin. Rescuers work at the site of an apartment building hit by a Russian ballistic missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, April 24, 2025.(REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko) Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 theUnited Statesand its allies have added layer upon layer of sanctions on the country. While the measures have been painful for Russia's economy, Moscow has found ways to circumvent the sanctions and continue funding its war. Trump \"has been bending over backwards to give Putin every opportunity to say, 'Okay, we're going to have a ceasefire and an end to the war,' and Putin keeps rejecting him,\" said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to NATO who was U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump's first term. \"This is the next phase of putting some pressure on Russia.\" \"Putin has been escalating,\" he continued. Trump \"has got the U.S. and Ukraine now in alignment calling for an immediate and full ceasefire, and Putin is now the outlier.\" Since assuming office in January, Trump has taken steps seen as aimed at boosting Russian acceptance of his peace effort, including disbanding a Justice Department task force formed to enforce sanctions and target oligarchs close to the Kremlin. He also has made pro-Moscow statements, falsely blaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for starting the conflict and calling him a \"dictator.\" Meanwhile, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, has advocated a peace strategy that would cede four Ukrainian regions to Moscow, and has met Putin four times, most recently last week. But three days after that meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Putin's maximalist demands for a settlement and Moscow’s forces have pressed frontline attacks and missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities, claiming more civilian casualties. Reuters reported in March that the United States was drawing up a plan to potentially give Russia sanctions relief but Trump in recent weeks has expressed frustration with Putin's foot-dragging on ending the invasion and last Saturday held a \"very productive\" one-on-one meeting in the Vatican with Zelenskiy. The next day, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he was \"strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions and Tariffs on Russia\" that would remain until a ceasefire and final peace deal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Volker said that Russia has been earning hard currency that funds its military through oil and gas sales to countries like India and China and that it would be \"very significant\" if Trump slapped secondary sanctions on such deals. Secondary sanctions are those where one country seeks to punish a second country for trading with a third by barring access to its own market, a particularly powerful tool for the United States because of the size of its economy.",

FIRST ON FOX: The United Nations’UN80 Task Forceis examining multiple suggested methods for reorganizing the institution, according to a leaked, confidential document shared with Fox News Digital. The six-page paper cites multiple inefficiencies and areas of improvement needed to combat \"geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets\" which are \"challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organization.\" The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan, former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General António] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N.

As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\" Dugan said the document \"looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat.\" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting \"the very best in the world,\" or \"identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.\" Dugan said that the task force is also missing theimportant confidence-building measuresneeded to increase buy-in from members, to keep them \"impressed and enthusiastic\" about U.N. programs. \"They’re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time.\" Dugan said this is \"a real shortcoming.\" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres is shown on the screen while speaking at the opening ceremony of the UN Internet Governance Forum - IGF 2021 at the International Congress Center in Katowice, Poland, on December 7th, 2021.(Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto) \"I don’t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,\" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the \"Noah’s Ark management mentality\" of attempting to \"weather the storm,\" Dugan said that the U.N. must \"get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.\" Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a \"fall-off in relevance\" with its lack of involvement in \"real world dynamics between member states.\" He urged the organization to identify \"the multilateral collateral, meaning we’ve got to identify what’s good, and then we have to get rid of what’s damaged after eight years.\" DOGE USAID BUDGET CUTS HIT UN IN ‘WORST LIQUIDITY CRISIS SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT’ In response to concerns shared by Dugan, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, said that the memo \"is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the Secretary-General’s vision\" and is one \"of the three work streams that we are working on.\" Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.

He reiterated that \"the Secretary-General’s ‘Trust me’ window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. contributions to the U.N. may also take a hit. In April, a White House Office of Management and Budgetpassback to the State Departmentindicated the desire to end funding for international organizations, including the U.N.

    "article_text": "File footage from 2024 following a siege of the SYL Hotel, where a jihadist group carried out an attack on the building near the presidential palace in Mogadishu, Somalia. (Video: EFE via Reuters Connect.) FIRST ON FOX : Fox News Digital has learned that the U.S. could withhold funding for the war against Islamist terror in Somalia until Europe, the African Union (A.U.) andthe United Nations (U.N.)pay more of their \"fair\" share toward the cost of striking out and keeping the peace in the conflict-torn country. These plans to \"prohibit\" the use of U.S. funds are key details, shown first to Fox News Digital, of a new bill to be introduced by three prominent Republican senators. In line with PresidentDonald Trump’s administration’s widespread moves to tighten fiscal controls in the U.S. and overseas, Sens. Jim Risch, R-Idaho., Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., are to introduce \"the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) Funding Restriction Act of 2025.\" This is \"to safeguard U.S. taxpayer funds and hold the U.N. and A.U. accountable in African peace operations,\" Risch told Fox News Digital. TRUMP SAYS HE ORDERED AIRSTRIKES ON ISIS LEADERS IN SOMALIA Al-Shabab terrorists conduct military exercises in northern Mogadishu's Suqaholaha neighborhood of Somalia on Sunday, Sept. 5, 2010.(AP Photo/ Farah Abdi Warsameh, file) The bill also seeks to mandate the U.S. to oppose any U.N. Security Council action which enables such funding. The East African country of Somalia has been wracked for decades by attacks and insurgency from Islamist terrorists, both from ISIS and the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab. In just the past five weeks, U.S. Africa Command reported that it has carried out four airstrikes; three against ISIS terrorists and one against al-Shabaab. At least one of these strikes, the command stated, was against multiple targets. Chairman Risch told Fox News Digital, \"The Trump Administration has taken decisive action to counterterrorist groups across Africa, and I’m very supportive.\" However, officials from theEuropean Union, according to Risch, plan to skew payments for the AUSSOM peacekeeping and stablization operation more toward the U.S.; in other words, make the U.S. pay more than it should, he said. \"At the U.N., our European partners are looking to skirt their financial commitments to AUSSOM in Somalia by switching to a new imbalanced funding mechanism that pushes the burden on Americans,\" he stated.

Jim Risch (R-Idaho), speaks during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on April 26, 2022 in Washington, D.C.(Al Drago-Pool/Getty Images) \"We can’t let that stand,\" Risch continued. \"This bill will prohibit U.S. contributions to AUSSOM under this new funding scheme, until the A.U. and the U.N. can prove that they are using the funds they have responsibly, and prevent Americans from being locked into perpetually funding a broken system.\" Risch said, \"President Trump has ushered in a new era of American foreign policy where American taxpayer dollars will be used only to secure a safe and prosperous America. For far too long, our allies have taken America for a ride, and profited off of America paying the lion’s share for global security. Europe must continue to shoulder this burden.\" The other two senators sponsoring the bill, Cruz and Scott, also serve on theSenate Foreign Relations Committee.

    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins ‘Fox Report’ to break down China’s move to waive tariffs on certain U.S. goods and analyze the broader implications of the ongoing trade battle with the Trump administration. China is \"evaluating\"an offer from the U.S. to hold talks on tariffs, according to a Friday statement from the Chinese Commerce Ministry. This shift in tone could leave the door open for the world’s two largest economies to deescalate the trade war that has left global markets in turmoil. \"The U.S. has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information to China through relevant parties, saying it hopes to talk with China,\" the ministry said in a statement, according to aReuters translation. The ministry also said that Beijing was \"evaluating this.\" However, while Beijing appears to be open to negotiations, the Chinese Commerce Ministry warned that it would not be forced into making a bad deal. According to the Reuters translation, the ministry said that \"attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work.\" President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. TRUMP SAYS CHINA'S XI CALLED HIM AMID ONGOING CONFUSION OVER TRADE TALKS On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on \"Mornings with Maria\" that he believed Beijing was looking to reach an agreement with the U.S. \"I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process. First, we need to de-escalate. And then the over time we will start focusing on a larger trade deal,\"Bessent said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks during a briefing with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. TRUMP WAGERS US ECONOMY IN HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBLE AT 100-DAY MARK PresidentDonald Trumpannounced sweeping global tariffs last month. He slapped a 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Beijing put a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. However, the country recently waived the tariff on a host of American-made products. There were already exemptions for some pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines, but China added an exemption for ethane imports,according to Reuters. Beijing’s change in messaging regarding the tariffs comes in stark contrast to its April 23 comments during a U.N. Security Council Arria-formula meeting on \"The Impact of Unilateralism and Bullying Practices on International Relations.\" At that meeting, China accused the U.S. of using tariffsto bully the rest of the world.

Ambassador Fu Cong said in his opening remarks. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the meeting was \"a waste of U.N. Security Council members’ time.\" The spokesperson also slammed the meeting as an example of China’s manipulation of \"the multilateral system to support its economic, political, and security interests.\" Rachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.",

    "article_text": "DOGE leader Elon Musk, alongside his team, joins 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss efforts to slash government waste. As PresidentDonald Trumpcelebrated his 100th day in office this week,Elon Musk'sDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said it has cut at least $160 billion in waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. When Trump signed an executive order establishing the agency on his Inauguration Day, DOGE set an ambitious goal of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget. According to the Office of Government Ethics, \"special government employees\" like Musk can work for the federal government no more than 130 days a year, which in Musk's case will fall on May 30. He has already startedparing back his hoursleading the controversial agency. Fox News Channel's\"Jesse Watters Primetime\"had the opportunity to see behind the curtain of Musk's infamous DOGE, which Democrats have railed against and Republicans have celebrated since Trump returned to theWhite Housethis year. The \"DOGE boys\" reminded Watters on Thursday of some of the most shocking savings secured by the department this year. DOGE'S GREATEST HITS: LOOK BACK AT THE DEPARTMENT'S MOST HIGH-PROFILE CUTS DURING TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS DOGE leader Elon Musk has been hit with 96% negative coverage on ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts, according to the Media Research Center.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) Earlier this year,DOGE discoveredthe United States Institute of Peace (USIP) had transferred $132,000 to Mohammad Qasem Halimi, a former Taliban member who was Afghanistan's former Chief of Protocol. DOGE announced on March 31 that the contract was canceled. Halimi was detained by the U.S. and held at Bagram Air Base for a year beginning Jan. 2, 2002. He held several positions in Afghanistan's government following his release andwas appointedas the Minister of Hajj and Religious Affairs in Afghanistan in 2020. \"A small agency called the United States Institute of Peace is definitely the agency we've had the most fight at. We actually went into the agency and found they had loaded guns inside their headquarters — Institute for Peace,\" a DOGE staffer told Watters. \"So by far, the least peaceful agency that we've worked with, ironically. Additionally, we found that they were spending money on things like private jets, and they even had a $130,000 contract with a former member of the Taliban. This is real. We don't encounter that in most agencies.\" USIP did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's inquiry. ELON MUSK LOOKS BACK ON 100 DAYS OF DOGE, PREVIEWS FUTURE OF THE 'LONG-TERM ENTERPRISE' Elon Musk speaks during an event in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 11.(AP Images) Fox News Digital reported earlier this year that the nation's schools spent $200 billion in COVID-relief funds on expenses \"with little oversight or impact on students,\" such asLas Vegas hotel roomsand buying an ice cream truck, according to DOGE's audits. Granite School District in Utah spent their COVID-relief funds on $86,000 in hotel rooms for an educational conference at Caesars Palace, a ritzy Las Vegas casino, while Santa Ana Unified in California spent $393,000 to rent out a Major League Baseball stadium, according to a report by Parents Defending Education and shared by DOGE. Granite School District has since denied \"any impropriety for having our educators participate\" in the Las Vegas conference. The cost-cutting department also revealed that schools spent $60,000 of COVID-relief funds on swimming pool passes, while a California district used its funds to purchase an ice cream truck. \"They were basically partying on the taxpayers' dollars,\" Musk told Watters on Thursday.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is chairwoman of the Senate DOGE Caucus and who has collaborated closely with Musk to identify waste to cut, revealed that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) \"authorized a whopping $20 million to create a 'Sesame Street' in Iraq.\" Ernst said that under the Biden administration, USAID awarded the $20 million to a nonprofit called Sesame Workshopto produce a show called \"Ahlan Simsim Iraq\" in an effort to \"promote inclusion, mutual respect and understanding across ethnic, religious and sectarian groups.\" DOGE received a hand from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), whichreleased a report in Marchrevealing that federal agencies wasted $162 billion in \"improper payments,\" which was actually a decrease of $74 billion from the previous fiscal year. GAO's analysis revealed that of the 16 government agencies reporting improper payments, 75% of the waste found was concentrated in five programs: $54 billion from three Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Medicare programs; $31 billion in HHS Medicaid; $16 billion from the Department of the Treasury’s earned income tax credit; $11 billion from the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; and $9 billion from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Restaurant Revitalization Fund.

DOGE has announced over the last few months that it has cut hundreds of millions in DEI contracts. Earlier this month,DOGE announcedit had worked with the U.S. National Science Foundation to cancel 402 \"wasteful\" DEI grants, which will save $233 million, including $1 million for \"Antiracist Teacher Leadership for Statewide Transformation.\" The Department of Defense could save up to $80 million in wasteful spending by cutting loose a handful of DEI programs, the agencyannounced last month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Defense Department has been working with DOGE to slash wasteful spending, DOD spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video posted to social media. Parnell listed some of the initial findings flagged by DOGE, much of it consisting of millions of dollars given to support various DEI programs, including $1.9 million for holistic DEI transformation and training in the Air Force and $6 million to the University of Montana to \"strengthen American democracy by bridging divides.\" The Trump administration announced earlier this month it is slashing millions of dollars in DEI grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services as part of its overall DOGE push.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Virginia State Police arrested anillegal immigrantafter he was released as a result of a plea deal made by the Fairfax County Commonwealth Attorney’s Office. Guatemalan national Wilmer Osmany Ramos-Giron, 34, faced numerous felony charges in January, including abduction by force, assault on a family member and felony strangulation causing injury toa Virginia woman, according to ICE, which has Ramos-Giron in custody. Ramos-Giron spent only two months in an adult detention center in Fairfax County. The county attorney’s office, led by Democrat Steve Descano, arranged a plea deal dropping Ramos-Giron's charges to misdemeanors. Ramos-Giron would have faced up to 16 years behind bars on the felony charges if convicted, according toABC 7.

Ramos-Giron was deported two other times but found his way back into the U.S. despite being convicted in a federal gun case. But it’s not clear when he returned to the country, according to ICE. Republican Gov.Glenn Youngkin’soffice praised the April 24 arrest. \"It’s disappointing that the Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney’s Office has been more concerned about shielding dangerous illegal immigrants than ensuring the safety of Virginians,\" Peter Finocchio, Youngkin’s press secretary, told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Fortunately, Wilmer Osmany Ramos-Giron will no longer pose a threat to Virginia families, thanks to brave federal and state law enforcement heroes.\" Descano's campaign received over $627,000 between 2019 and 2023 from the Justice and Public Safety PAC, according to theVirginia Public Access Project.

He is a violent and recidivist threat to public safety that ICE Washington, D.C., cannot tolerate. Regardless of the obstacles placed in our way, we remain committed to prioritizing public safety.

    "title": "John Fetterman faces new spotlight on health, family drama, sparking online uproar",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gifts Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., a silver-plated pager commemorating the operation that used pagers against Hezbollah leaders and operatives. (GPO) A new exposé aboutSen. JohnFetterman's, D-Pa., time on Capitol Hill set social media ablaze on Friday. The report raised questions about alleged tensions with his wife, Gisele, over his health regimen, his stance on Israel and her reported run-ins with his staff. In \"All By Himself: John Fetterman insists he is in good health, but staffers past and present say they no longer recognize the man they once knew,\"New York Magazine’s Intelligencerlays out recollections from current and former staff members who worked for the Pennsylvania Democrat. In May 2022, Fetterman suffered a serious stroke mid-Senate campaign against Dr. Mehmet Oz. The article relates several reported instances, including a February 2023 situation at a Democratic caucus retreat at the Library of Congress. A staffer told the outlet that he received a message questioning how Fetterman was doing, as he was found sitting at a table alone, silently drinking a soda. FETTERMAN SPOKESWOMAN REAMED FOR REPORTEDLY CONTRADICTING BOSS ON ISRAEL: ‘UNPARALLELED HUBRIS’ The report went on to claim the lawmaker was \"nearly struck by a car\" and found \"wandering\" Capitol Hill. Physicians at George Washington University Hospital later determined he was severely dehydrated, and had not had a second stroke as feared. An ensuing discussion with then-Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, found Fetterman to be nearly \"catatonic\" when Brown tried to talk with him. Soon after, on Feb. 15, he was admitted toWalter Reed Medical Center. After being discharged, Fetterman \"threw himself into\" his Senate work and became more vociferous than ever on issues like the Israel-Gaza conflict and other topics that have rankled his Democratic colleagues. He also took a leading role in calling for the ouster of now-former Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., amid corruption allegations. \"Former and current staffers paint a picture of an erratic senator who has become almost impossible to work for and whose mental-health situation is more serious and complicated than previously reported,\" the article read. After staffers wrote a letter about Fetterman's \"gutting betrayal\"supporting Israel, the report went on to allege Gisele confronted him about Jerusalem \"bombing refugee camps — how can you support this?\" Gisele reportedly also went to staffers with her concerns, while a Senate physician in December 2023 reported him \"acting bizarrely\" near the Senate subway, while he had not had bloodwork in months. FETTERMAN TAKES SWIPE AT AOC: WE KEPT OUR GOVERNMENT OPEN, DEAL WITH IT The hulking lawmaker also reportedly nearly knocked over folks walking in the Capitol. Both types of incidents reportedly rankled his wife, who was vociferous on the matter, according to the magazine piece. Fox News Digital reached out to Fetterman for comment. Social media became abuzz after the article dropped, with Bloomberg columnist Matthew Yglesias calling it \"a very sad story here on a human level, but of course, it’s also politics and can’t be addressed purely on that level.\" Left-wing former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan wrote that the story and color from former staffers therein \"makes clear that Fetterman should not be serving in the Senate. Every Senate Democrat should read this and be asked about it.\" A California progressive group reacted by writing that the story is an indictment of populist lawmakers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Whether they're left or right, whether they agree with your preferred policies or not, populism will not get you the best leaders,\"Bay Area New Liberalswrote. Another user said the story showed Gisele as \"evil.\" \"These are not red flags, this is a siren going off. John Fetterman is not taking his meds… He needs inpatient care,\" commented another. \"Funny how they didn't run these hit pieces or question Fetterman's mental health during the campaign when he was barely able to speak or when he so spectacularly fumbled the debate against Dr. Oz. But now that he turned out not to be a deranged Trump hater, a psychotic terrorist lover, or an obedient progressive, suddenly they're starting to question his mental acuity,\" a differentuser wrote. \"Knocking him out early before he can do anything in 2028?\" wrote another, who conjectured that both Fetterman and Pennsylvania Gov.Josh Shapirocould end up battling each other in the next Democratic presidential primary.

    "title": "Pakistan warns of a 'nuclear flashpoint,' urges Trump to step in amid rising tensions with India over Kashmir",
    "article_text": "Pakistan’s ambassador to the U.S. says his country has not seen a ‘shred of evidence’ to suggest they were behind the Kashmir tourist attacks and called on President Donald Trump to step in and help alleviate worsening tensions with India. EXCLUSIVE:Pakistan’s ambassador to the U.S. is warning of potentially catastrophic consequencesif Indiafollows through with what Islamabad claims could be an imminent military strike in response to a recent attack in the disputed Kashmir region. War between the two nuclear-armed states could get ugly quickly, andPakistan’s Ambassador to the U.S.Rizwan Saeed Sheikh is calling on President Donald Trump to leverage his self-professed dealmaker credentials to hammer out an agreement with India. \"This is one nuclear flashpoint,\" the ambassador said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital. \"It could be an important part of President Trump’s legacy to attend to this situation — not with a Band-Aid solution, but by addressing the core issue: the Kashmir dispute.\" Saeed described India’s response to the attack in Pahalgam — which left several Indian security forces dead — as dangerously premature and inflammatory. \"Within minutes of the attack, India began leveling accusations against Pakistan,\" he said, noting that a post-investigation report was filed just 10 minutes after the incident occurred, despite the remote and rugged terrain near the scene. INDIA'S MODI GIVES ARMY FREEDOM TO ACT AS TENSIONS RISE WITH PAKISTAN AFTER DEADLY TERROR ATTACK Kashmiri Muslims offer prayers on a road as Indian security personnel stand guard in Srinagar, Kashmir on Friday.(Reuters/Adnan Abidi) Pakistan claimed this week to have \"credible intelligence\" that an Indian counter-attack on its territory is imminent. The Indian Embassy in the U.S. did not respond to requests for comment on this story before publication time. The dust-up began with a tourist massacre on April 22 in Belgaum, Kashmir. All but one of the victims were Indian citizens, and India swiftly pointed the finger at Pakistan, which rejected the charge. The attack occurred in a remote valley only accessible on foot or by horse, and survivors claimed after the attack that the gunmen had accused some of the victims of supporting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The ambassador warned that the region, home to over 1.5 billion people, is once again being held \"hostage to the war of hysteria\" by India’s government and media, who immediately \"began beating war drums.\" The pair of rivals have exchanged gunfire across their heavily militarized borders since the attack. He cited Pakistan’s request for evidence linking it to the attack and Islamabad’s offer to participate in a neutral, transparent inquiry — both of which he said have gone unanswered. \"Any misadventure or miscalculation can lead to anuclear interface,\" the ambassador said. \"That is certainly not desirable in such a densely populated region.\" PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURISON ‘IMMINENT’ AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTACK Indian paramilitary soldiers patrol the commercial hub of Srinagar, Kashmir, on Tuesday..(Faisal Khan/Middle East Images via AFP) While Pakistan denies any involvement in the attack, the ambassador said those suspected are reportedly Indian nationals whose homes have already been raided. He questioned why India is looking outside its borders rather than addressing what he characterized as \"administrative inadequacies\" in Jammu and Kashmir, a territory he repeatedly referred to as \"illegally occupied.\" He also criticized India’s broader policies in Kashmir, including the alleged settlement of non-residents into the region, and what he called threats to unilaterally block water flows from Pakistan’s rivers — a move he said violates the long-standing Indus Waters Treaty. \"That is as grossly illegal as it can get,\" said Saeed. \"This is one treaty that has withstood wars between India and Pakistan.\" Pakistan has said they would consider the cutting off of water supplies an act of war — and made pleas to The Hague, accusing New Delhi of waterterrorism. The ambassador called on nations around the globe to help with a lasting settlement. \"Previously, when the situation has been at this level or the tensions have escalated, the international community has attended to the situation, but taken their eyes, their attention away, even before the situation could fully diffuse,\" said Saeed. \"This time, perhaps it would be… timely in terms of the situation elsewhere on the globe, with similar instances, which one can note and see and are being attended to to perhaps not afford a Band-Aid solution, but to address the broader problem.\" PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURSION 'IMMINENT' AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTACK Activists and supporters of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference take part in an anti-India protest in Muzaffarabad on Friday following Pakistan and India's ongoing border tensions over the Kashmir tourist attack.(Farooq Naeem/AFP via Getty Images) India and Pakistan each control parts of the Kashmir region, but both claim it in full. They have fought three wars over the territory. In 2019, a cross-border attack carried out by militants killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary personnel in Kashmir. India responded by bombing targets inside Pakistan. Modi's government revoked Muslim-majority Kashmir's autonomy in 2019, bringing it back under Indian control and prompting protests. Kashmir has been a disputed region since both India and Pakistan gained their autonomy from Britain in 1947. The region is now one of the most militarized in the world. Violence by regional militant groups has left tens of thousands dead. But Modi's aggressive stance in Kashmir has precipitated relative peace over the past five years, boosting his popularity domestically. He may feel political pressure to respond with force to the most recent dust-up. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pakistan has been ravaged by terrorism for decades, and Saeed said the nation has lost anywhere between 70,000 and 90,000 lives over the past 20 years to terror attacks. \"We cannot afford any instability in the neighborhood,\" said Saeed. \"We want a peaceful neighborhood. But as we have been repeatedly mentioning at all levels, leadership level and all the other levels, that we want peace, but that should not in any way be misconstrued as a sign of weakness. We want peace with dignity.\"",

    "article_text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent responds to economic uncertainty, breaking down President Donald Trump's fiscal and cryptocurrency goals on ‘My View with Lara Trump.’ FIRST ON FOX:One of the major players in the crypto andartificial intelligence(AI) industries attempting to cozy up to the Trump administration is a longtime Democratic operative and donor who has backed anti-Trump efforts and candidates while working for companies stacked with Democratic activists. Chris Lehane, a veteran political strategist dating back to the Clinton administration, has donated over $150,000 to Democrats, FEC records show, and many of those Democrats have been outspoken Trump critics for several years. Lehane has been a major backer of Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, whovoted to convictTrump during his impeachment trial in 2021 and against several of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. He also hosted a San Francisco fundraiser for the Virginia senator, along with Open AI’s Sam Altman, in March. Warner has been a key figure in the resistance to the Trump administration, including being avocal criticof the Trump administration's \"sloppy\" Signal chat controversy and pushing back on the administration's DOGE push against waste, fraud and abuse in government. Lehane also donated thousands of dollars to the Biden and Harris campaigns. TRUMP CRYPTO CHIEF SAYS WE ARE IN THE 'GOLDEN AGE' FOR DIGITAL ASSETS, 'CLEARING THE DECK' OF BIDEN BARRIERS Chris Lehane and Donald Trump(Getty) In 2024, Lehane joined the board of Coinbase, which operates one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, and has taken an active role influencing crypto and AI policy in recent months. Coinbase’s Board of Directors and prominent investors have donated more than $22 million to Democratic candidates and committees while donating less than $5 million to Republicans, FEC records show. Those donations include almost $50,000 to Kamala Harris' campaign since 2009, including to her presidential campaign, from top Coinbase investor and Democratic donor Ron Conway. Conway has donated over $300,000 to the DNC, over $1.5 million to the DCCC and millions to the House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC, FEC records show. Since 1999, board member Fred Wilson has given over $2 million to political campaigns and committees, and only $17,600 of that went to Republicans, FEC records show. MR. WONDERFUL TALKS 'EXCITEMENT' AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY UNDER TRUMP: AMERICA IS IN A 'NEW PHASE' Additionally, Coinbase’s Global Advisory Council is laden with Trump critics, including John Anzelone, a pollster for Biden, Obama and Hillary Clinton; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper; former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa; former GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who said in September he would not vote for Trump; and former Democratic Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy, who served on the January 6th Select Committee. Julia Krieger, Coinbase's head of U.S. public affairs, previously worked for American Bridge, a Democratic opposition research firm, and Media Matters, known for organizing pressure campaigns against conservative voices it opposes. She also held multiple roles in the Biden administration and the 2020 Biden campaign. Coinbase does have two Trump allies on its advisory board — David Urban and recently appointed Chris LaCivita, who served as the Republican National Committee's chief operating officer and held multiple titles on the successful 2024 Trump campaign. Additionally, several members of Coinbase's executive team have donated to Republicans, including Brian Armstrong and Paul Grewal. President Donald Trump smiles after signing an executive order.(AP/Alex Brandon) Armstrong, the company's CEO, was present at the Trump White House crypto summit earlier this year. Open Secrets datafrom the 2024 election cycle shows a roughly 50-50 split between Coinbase's donations to congressional Democrats and Republicans. \"Our focus has always been mission first, to support candidates that support crypto and blockchain innovation, and we're proud to do so,\" Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, a former top NSC official under President George W. Bush, told Fox News Digital. Lehane also serves as the vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, a company that Fox News Digital reported on recently. It partnered with a new AI initiative led by a group co-founded with outgoingSpecial Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerrythat has pushed left-wing causes and has several board members aligned with Democrats. The longtime Democratic operative is also an operating partner at Haun Ventures, which is staffed by employees who appear to donate almost exclusively to Democrats. Since 2022, individuals listed as being employed by Haun Ventures have made 43 separate political contributions totaling over $110,000. All 43 of those were to Democratic candidates or organizations.

    "title": "Hegseth, Signal questions dog Waltz as potentially perilous UN ambassador confirmation hearings loom",
    "article_text": "‘All-Star’ panelists Shannon Bream, Harold Ford Jr. and Marc Thiessen discuss President Donald Trump’s nomination of Mike Waltz to serve as U.N. ambassador on ‘Special Report.’ The same day that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz exited his job at the White House, PresidentDonald Trumpannounced a new job offer for the former Florida congressman: United Nations ambassador. But there are some hurdles Waltz must clear first before the New York job is his — including undergoing a Senate confirmation process amid scrutiny after the Atlantic magazine exposed a Signal group chat that his team had set up to discuss strikes against the Houthis in March. And receiving full support from the slim Republican majority in the Senate isn’t guaranteed, and not all Republicans got on board backing Secretary of DefensePete Hegseth. Vice President JD Vance ultimately cast the tie-breaking votesecuring Hegseth’s nomination. Democrats appear hungry to use Waltz’s nomination as a forum to air grievances against other foreign policy leaders in the Trump administration — particularly Hegseth. NEXT US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR? HERE'S WHOM TRUMP MIGHT PICK TO REPLACE WALTZ U.S. national security advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stand, as U.S. President Donald Trump meets French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Feb. 24, 2025.(Reuters/Brian Snyder) Still, Waltz'snomination to represent the U.S. at the U.N. will likely attract support from establishment Republicans in the Senate who weren’t on board with Hegseth in the Pentagon, given that the ideological divide between these Republicans and Waltz is much smaller than it was in Hegseth’s case, according to one Florida GOP source. \"He's been able to thread the needle really, really well between traditional conservative foreign policy voices and the more populist America First policy voices,\" the Florida GOP source said of Waltz. Waltz, who previously represented Florida’s 6th congressional district, is a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret who served four deployments to Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars — the fourth-highest military combat award, issued for heroic service against an armed enemy. While Waltz and Hegseth both were embroiled in the Signal chat discussing strike plans against the Houthis, Hegseth has attracted more of the heat, at least publicly, stemming from the incident. Democrats have called for Hegseth’s resignation as a result of the chat, but staffers at the White House — including Waltz — have openly backed Hegseth and shut down reports that the administration is seeking his replacement. But Waltz could get his turn attracting the ire of lawmakers as Democrats find an opportunity to openly grill him in front of the Senate, amid displeasure with Trump’s foreign policy and national security agenda. \"The second hundred days of national security under President Trump will apparently be just as chaotic as the first hundred,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a statement to Fox News Digital about Waltz’s departure from the White House. \"President Trump’s consistent hirings, firings and upheaval sap morale from our warfighters and intelligence officers, degrade our military readiness, and leave us less prepared to respond to threats from our adversaries,\" Coons said. \"American citizens at home and around the world are less safe because of President Trump’s non-existent national security strategy.\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., also took aim at Waltz — although she labeled Hegseth the worst offender affiliated with \"Signalgate.\" MIKE WALTZ, OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFFERS OUT IN LATEST TRUMP PURGE FOLLOWING SIGNAL CHAT LEAK Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., also took aim at former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz — although she labeled Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth the worst offender affiliated with \"Signalgate.\"(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"Took them long enough. Mike Waltz knowingly made an unclassified chain to discuss classified matters,\" Duckworth said in a Thursday X post ahead of Waltz’s U.N. ambassador nomination. \"But of all the idiots in that chat, Hegseth is the biggest security risk of all—he leaked the info that put our troops in greater danger. Fire and investigate them all.\" In addition to the Signal chat, Waltz’s exit from the White House was tied to several other issues. For example, Axios reports that Waltz treated White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles like \"staff,\" and his disrespect rubbed her the wrong way. \"He treated her like staff and didn't realize he's the staff, she's the embodiment of the president,\" a White House official told Axios. \"Susie is a deeply loyal person and the disrespect was made all the worse because it was disloyal.\" Waltz reportedly discussed different roles he could take on following his stint at the White House with Wiles, according to CBS News. Waltz was reportedly offered jobs, including the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, but ultimately settled on U.N. ambassador. A spokesperson for the National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. With Waltz out as national security advisor, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily step into that role. While Trump originally nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to represent the U.S. at the U.N., he rescinded her nomination in March, citing that the House could not afford to lose another Republican seat. Stefanik’s nomination lagged in the Senate in comparison to other U.N. ambassador nominees, including Trump’s first U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. The Senate confirmed Haley in January, just after Trump’s first inauguration. While the exact timeline for a potential confirmation vote in the Senate is unclear, the first hurdle that Waltz must clear is a confirmation vote out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although it is uncertain when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will schedule the nomination hearing for Waltz and the subsequent vote, the committee said his nomination is a \"priority.\" \"The committee has been working at a historically fast pace and this nomination will be a priority moving forward,\" a GOP staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., meets with Republican Sen. John Barasso of Wyoming.(Office of Rep. Elise Stefanik) The 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled for September 9, so there are a few months for Waltz’s confirmation to play out, the Florida GOP source said. That means that Waltz could take a few months off, start the confirmation process in June or July and wrap up his confirmation by September at the latest, the source said. \"He's got plenty of time. So, this isn't a looming fight that's going to happen next week,\" the Florida GOP source said. \"This is going to play out probably in June or July, which by then, people are going to forget about the Signalgate stuff, or at the very, very least, they're going to forget about Mike Waltz's role in it.\" But there are a few Republican wildcards in the Senate who have voted against several of Trump’s nominees, most prominently Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who voted against Hegseth, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National IntelligenceTulsi Gabbardand Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., voted against Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in January.(J. Scott Applewhite/the Associated Press) A spokesperson for McConnell did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Other Republicans who have opposed Trump nominees include Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, both of whomvoted against Hegseth, as well as Sens. Ted Budd of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both of whom voted against Chavez-DeRemer. Aside from former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whom Trump initially nominated to serve as attorney general, Trump’s entire cabinet has been approved. Gaetz withdrew his nomination amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into sexual misconduct and drug-use allegations. Despite opposition from Democrats, and possibly a few Republicans, it appears unlikely that any fire that Waltz will face will sink his nomination. \"The reality of it is, the president can lose three votes in the Senate, and the vice president can still vote to break a tie,\" the Florida GOP source said. \"There's no way he's probably going to lose three votes.\" Meanwhile, other Republicans have openly stated they endorse Waltz’s nomination, including Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Risch, R-Idaho, who lauded Trump’s decision to nominate Waltz for the role. Vice President JD Vance sits for an interview with Fox News' chief political anchor Bret Baier in South Carolina, where he addressed Waltz's nomination to represent the U.S. at the United Nations.(Fox News/Special Report) \"Great choices. America is safer and stronger under President Trump and his national security team,\" Risch said in a Thursday X post. \"I thank Mike Waltz for his service as NSA, and look forward to taking up his nomination in our committee.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also posted on X on Friday that Waltz would be confirmed \"for sure.\" Vance also voiced support for Waltz and billed the nomination as a \"promotion,\" pushing back on any suggestions that Waltz’s removal amounted to a firing. \"Donald Trump has fired a lot of people,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier Thursday. \"He doesn’t give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterward. What he thinks is that Mike Waltz is going to better serve the administration, most importantly, the American people in that role.\" Fox News' Charles Creitz contributed to this report.

    "title": "Ex-Pelosi aide accuses Hakeem Jeffries of 'squandering' anti-Trump opportunities in stunning rebuke",
    "article_text": "Former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner and former Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor join 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the disarray within the Democratic Party despite Sen. Chuck Schumer's 'unity' claim. A former top advisor to ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is not meeting the moment in the current Trump era. \"Trump is just giving us all this incredible red meat. I mean, I've never seen anything like this before. It's like the biggest gift any party has been given by the opposition, and we're just squandering it, to a degree,\" former Pelosi advisor Ashley Etienne toldPolitico's Deep Divepodcast. Etienne helped Pelosi oversee Democrats' messaging during PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst impeachment. She also previously worked for former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. She said Jeffries was \"doing well\" in many areas and said she had \"a tremendous amount of respect\" for the New York Democrat but signaled that he was missing opportunities on anti-Trump messaging. WATCH: AOC LEAVES DOOR OPEN FOR 2028 PRESIDENTIAL BID AS CAMPAIGN BUZZ SOARS A former advisor to ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared criticism of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' leadership.(Getty/Reuters) \"He gave a speech this morning. I don't have any talking points in my phone about what he said. And I'm going to be doing TV and this interview all day. That's a failure,\" Etienne said. \"How do you get to discipline if you're not telling people what the hell you want them to say? At least emphatically, at least tonally.\" Jeffries' allies pushed back against that characterization, pointing out that intraparty friction was taking attention away from Trump's low poll numbers and Republicans' policies. \"Donald Trump’s approval ratings are plummeting, and he’s bringing House Republicans down with him. Extreme MAGA Republicans have been forced to delay their plans to advance Trump’s centerpiece legislative priority due to intense backlash against their scheme to enact the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and food assistance. Let’s keep the main thing, the main thing,\" Jeffries spokesperson Christiana Stephenson told Fox News Digital. Just Friday morning, Jeffries released a statement hammering House Republicans for having to delay part of their legislative work to advance Trump's agenda. But Etienne's comments are a notable rebuke from a former senior Democratic leadership aide to one of the party's most powerful current officials, which comes after months of Democrats being plagued by infighting over messaging woes. Etienne noted that Democrats had scored several wins on the messaging front, like having \"successfully demonized Elon Musk\" and Sen. Cory Booker's recent record-breaking filibuster speech. But she singled outliberals' protests duringTrump's speech to a joint session of Congress as an \"embarrassing\" setback for the party and Jeffries. Etienne said the Democratic protests during Trump's speech were ‘embarrassing.’(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP) \"If you look at the headlines post-the speech, even during the speech, it was more aboutDemocrats andDemocrats protesting rather than what Trump was actually saying. And in those kind of moments, you don't want to become the story. You want Trump to be the story,\" Etienne said. \"And I also thought it was a problem for Mr. Jeffries. I mean, it really says a lot about how people value his leadership. He asked for no protest. And what did they do? They protest 50 different ways.\" AOC CLAIMS 'WE ARE ONE' IN CAMPAIGN-STYLE VIDEO DESPITE YEARS OF INVOKING RACE, GENDER IN POLITICS Both Pelosi and Jeffries' offices told Politico that the latter often seeks the former's input, and Jeffries' spokesperson pushed back on Politico's reporting that House Democratic leaders were seeking to move past Pelosi and that Jeffries was not doing enough to help Democratic groups with messaging. One of those groups, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), pushed back on the assertion they were not hearing enough from Jeffries. PCCC sent out a press release that read, \"Today, in a POLITICO article we are not interested in dwelling on, a former Pelosi staffer attacked Hakeem Jeffries. PCCC co-founder Adam Green said, ‘We hear more from Jeffries than we ever heard from Pelosi.’\" Meanwhile, a House Democratic aide told Fox News Digital that Jeffries held \"multiple calls\" previewing his earlier speech on Trump's first 100 days in office, as well as talking points \"emphasizing the Leader’s message that President Trump’s first 100 days have been a disaster for the American people.\" Stephenson, Jeffries' spokesperson, also posted on X of Politico's report, \"Can anyone tell me how grandstanding like this is anything other than a gift to Republicans?\" But House Republicans' elections arm was quick to pounce on the discord as well. \"Hakeem Jeffries is the so-called leader of a team that doesn’t fear him, doesn’t follow him, and now, doesn’t even pretend to respect him,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Democratic strategist Julian Epstein, a former chief counsel of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Jeffries' leadership but said that Trump was not Democrats' main problem. \"He's not a particularly effective speaker, gives no sense of direction or purpose, seems intent on not offending anyone, and has a leadership style that seems extremely passive,\" Epstein said. \"The Democrats in the House just seem like a big blob that goes wherever gravity takes them, and right now gravity is taking them to the hard protest left. But no matter who the leader is, if the Democrats are selling a product that voters don't like, it won't matter.\" Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Susan Collins, R-Maine. \"For Defense spending, the President proposes an increase of 13 percent to $1.01 trillion for FY 2026; for Homeland Security, the Budget commits a historic $175 billion investment to, at long last, fully secure our border.

    "title": "A US judge partially blocked Trump's election integrity order from taking force. Is that legal?",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Last month, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of PresidentDonald Trump’s executive order on election integrity – a move that underscores how deeply divided the country remains over what \"election integrity\" really means.. Though the executive order Trump signed was titled, \"Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,\" theDemocratic National Party (DNC), which led a group of plaintiffs in challenging the order in federal court, argued that it was an attempt to encroach on elections and disenfranchise voters. In the end, both sides won out – sort of, and at least for now.  Here's what to know about the case in question: TRUMP ASKS SCOTUS TO STRIP PROTECTED STATUS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS President-elect Trump dancing at AmericaFest in Arizona following the election.(Rick Scuteri/Associated Press) U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ultimatelyleft in placethree key parts of Trump's executive order, including a provision requiring states not to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, in a partial victory for the Trump administration. But she sided with Democratic plaintiffs in blocking, for now, both a new proof-of-citizenship requirement for federal voter registration forms and a provision directing election officials to verify the citizenship of would-be voters. Voters work on their ballots at a polling place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in Simi Valley, Calif.(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) Unequivocally, yes. That’s exactly the problem modern presidents face when trying to make lasting policy changes through executive orders – a tactic increasingly favored by both Democrats and Republicans. It's a risky way to govern for two reasons. The first is that these orders can just as easily be overturned by the next commander-in-chief (as has been on display under the last four administrations). They also risk being halted in federal courts, where U.S. judges are explicitly tasked with serving as a check on the president, and are free to pause or halt such orders from taking force, should they determine they areoutside the scopeof the executive branch's authorities. That also doesn't mean that district courts need to have the final say on the matter. TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON VOTING BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGES AMID FLURRY OF LEGAL SETBACKS The E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House is seen early in the morning on Dec. 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C.(David Ake/Getty Images) Kollar-Kotelly stressed last month that voter registration laws and the ability to regulate elections areset by Congressand by individual states, not the executive branch. Both states and Congress can pass laws so long as they do not \"needlessly impose\" an undue burden on voters under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But the executive branch, which does not share in these abilities to make and pass election-related laws, is not entitled to the same standard of legal review, according to the judge. \"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the States – not the President – with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly said in her ruling. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA The Trump administration is, of course, free to appeal the decision to higher courts, should it choose to do so. \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in response to the ruling last month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But its next steps remain unclear. To date, the administration has not appealed the matter, and officials have not said definitively whether they plan to do so.

    "article_text": "Abigail Blanco, a University of Tampa professor, says defense contractors face \"small penalties\" for going over-budget and lawmakers are reticent to cut old weapons systems, leading to waste at DOD. The Senate’s top Armed Services Republican eviscerated PresidentDonald Trump’sOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) shortly after the White House released details of its government funding proposal for fiscal year 2026. \"President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda, but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,\" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said in a statement. \"The Big, Beautiful Reconciliation Bill was always meant to change fundamentally the direction of the Pentagon on programs like Golden Dome, border support, and unmanned capabilities – not to paper over OMB’s intent to shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members. House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers echoed Wicker's complaints. \"I am very concerned the requested base budget for defense does not reflect a realistic path to building the military capability we need to achieve President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda,\" the Alabama Republican said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with the President and the Senate to achieve real growth in the defense budget and put America on track to realize the President’s goal of investing five percent of GDP on defense for NATO countries.\" BILLIONS SPENT, WARFIGHTERS WAIT: INSIDE THE PENTAGON’S BROKEN BUYING SYSTEM AND THE PLAN TO FIX IT Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., tore into OMB for the Trump budget.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc. via Getty Images.) The Trump OMB's \"skinny budget,\" released on Friday, proposes cuts to non-defense funding by $163 billion but increases defense funding from $893 billion to $1.01 trillion – a 13% increase. That includes $892.6 billion in discretionary spending, but will be supplemented by $119.3 billion in mandatory spending that is expected to be passed in the upcoming reconciliation bill. Senior officials told Fox News the Trump administrationneeded to get creativeto get a $1 trillion-plus budget over the finish line: Republican majorities have historically been forced to offer one-to-one increases in non-defense spending to secure increases in defense spending. However, by keeping discretionary defense spending at $892.6 billion, the same level as fiscal year 2025, the budget that would be presented to Democrats would essentially reflect an unchanged defense discretionary budget with a smaller non-defense discretionary budget of about $557 billion – a 22.6% decrease. The White House and congressional Republicans would then pursue the reset of the defense spending through the budget reconciliation process that is linked to the tax cut package.

It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms. This budget would decrease President Trump’s military options and his negotiating leverage,\" he said. \"I have said for months that reconciliation defense spending does not replace the need for real growth in the military's base budget.\" OMB Director Russ Vought said in a post on X: \"The President wants to increase defense spending to $1 trillion, a 13% increase to keep our country secure. This budget provides that level while ensuring that only Republican-votes are needed by using reconciliation to secure those increases without Democrats insisting on increasing wasteful government.\" To account for spending decreases across government, all departments were asked to provide recommended budget cuts except for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Transportation, which were excluded to protect veterans' services as well as NASA and space exploration programs. Hegseth has yet to weigh in on OMB's defense spending proposal.( (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Congress will have to hammer out its own budget plan - which could take months - with the White House's framework as a suggestion. Both Wicker and Rogers have long aimed to grow U.S. defense spending to 5% of the GDP, up from around 3.5 percent. The Mississippi senator suggested he would ignore the OMB guidelines and work to achieve \"real growth\" within the defense budget.

    "title": "Brown University in GOP crosshairs after student's DOGE-like email kicks off frenzy",
    "article_text": "Alex Shieh is a student at Brown University. He is making waves and facing charges for asking the school's non-faculty employees what they do all day. FIRST ON FOX:A brewing controversy over a \"DOGE-like\" email at one of America’s top universities has gotten the attention of Capitol Hill. Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, wrote to Brown University on Friday morning urging the school to reconsider any disciplinary action againstAlex Shieh, a sophomore who sent an email mirroring the style of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that asked non-faculty university workers what they did \"all day.\" \"Reports indicate that Mr. Shieh engaged in a journalistic act of contacting university administrative employees to inquire about their roles and responsibilities. This action, it appears, stemmed from his perspective as a student paying a substantial tuition fee and experiencing concerns regarding university facilities, leading him to question the allocation of administrative resources,\" Nehls wrote. \"Penalizing a student for what appears to be an attempt to understand the university's administrative structure raises serious questions about the institution's commitment to open inquiry and the tolerance of dissenting viewpoints.\" BROWN UNIVERSITY STUDENT ANGERS NON-FACULTY EMPLOYEES BY ASKING ‘WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY,’ FACES PUNISHMENT Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, wrote to Brown University about student Alex Shieh.(Getty/Reuters) He also demanded more information on how Brown uses its $7.2 billion endowment to lower tuition and better the lives of students. It comes at a time when American Ivy Leagues have been thrust under the microscope by theTrump administration, both for their soaring tuition rates and controversies surrounding antisemitism on campus. Shieh had created a database of the 3,805 non-faculty employees who worked at Brown University and emailed them to ask, \"What do you do all day?\" He wrote on X that he had been given a disciplinary hearing after being \"charged with misrepresentation and violating the IT policy.\" Tuition alone at Brown University for the 2025-2026 academic year is $71,700. Fees, food, and housing charges bring that up to about $93,000 per year, according to the school’s website — and with indirect charges, annual costs are estimated at nearly $96,000. Alex Shieh, a sophomore at Brown University, said he sent a DOGE-like email to non-faculty employees asking them what they do all day to try to figure out why tuition has gotten so expensive. (Zoom screenshot) \"I urge you to reconsider any disciplinary action taken against Mr. Shieh and to reaffirm Brown University's commitment to protecting the free expression of all its students,\" Nehls wrote. \"Additionally, below you can see screenshots from Brown’s website showing the performance of its $7.2 billion endowment, boasting a 10% annual return. Please explain how these funds are used to improve the student experience or bring down the cost of tuition.\" Nehls previously introduced a bill that would significantly hike excise taxes on most larger colleges’ endowment funds from 1.4% to 21%, in line with the corporate tax rate. A Brown University official declined to comment on Nehls' letter directly when reached by Fox News Digital, but denied free speech was the larger issue. TRUMP ADMIN HALTING MORE THAN $500M IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO BROWN UNIVERSITY OVER ANTISEMITISM RESPONSE \"In spite of what has been reported publicly framing this as a free speech issue, it absolutely is not,\" Brian Clark, vice president for news and strategic campus communications, said in an email statement to Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"At the center of Brown's review are questions focused on whether improper use of non-public Brown data, non-public data systems and/or targeting of individual employees violated law or policy.\" \"Brown has detailed procedures in place to investigate alleged conduct code violations, resolve them and implement discipline in instances when students are found responsible, and these will continue to guide our actions,\" Clark added. \"Students have ample opportunity to provide information and participate directly in that process to ensure that all decisions are made with a complete understanding of the circumstances.\" Fox News Digital's Rachel del Guidice contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Former federal prosecutor Andrea Lewis discusses the impact of the Supreme Court on the Trump administration's immigration agenda, a Columbia student being released from ICE and how the highest court could redefine the First Amendment. The Trump administration on Thursday asked theSupreme Courtto override a lower court ruling and let it move forward with ending protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals in the U.S. The government is asking the high court to block, for now, a March ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen that delayed PresidentDonald Trump's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections for some 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the U.S. Those protections would have otherwise expired in April. U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer asked justices on Thursday to allow the administration to proceed, accusing Chen of improperly intruding on the executive branch’s authority over immigration policy. \"The district court’s reasoning is untenable,\" Sauer told the high court, adding that the program \"implicates particularly discretionary, sensitive, and foreign-policy-laden judgments of the Executive Branch regarding immigration policy.\" FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING A protester holds a sign protesting against ICE's deportation in front of City Hall in San Francisco on Feb. 16, 2025.(Minh Connors/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"The decision to delay the Secretary’s actions effectively nullifies them, tying them up in the very judicial second-guessing that Congress prohibited,\" he said of the lower court order. \"The district court’s ill-considered preliminary injunction should be stayed.\" At issue is the TPS program, which allows individuals to live and work in the U.S. legally if they cannot work safely in their home country due to a disaster, armed conflict or other \"extraordinary and temporary conditions.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visits the Mariposa Port of Entry on Saturday, Mar. 15, 2025 in Nogales, Arizona.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program forVenezuelan nationalson Feb. 1, prompting the emergency lawsuit and Chen's order that postponed it from taking force. The lower court judge sided with plaintiffs from the National TPS Alliance in ruling that the termination of the TPS program, which is extended in 18-month increments, is \"unprecedented,\" and suggested that the abrupt termination may have been \"predicated on negative stereotypes\" about Venezuelan migrants – something Sauer bitterly disputed in their appeal.

The law allows for misdemeanor charges against illegal immigrantswho enter Floridaand hope to avoid federal immigration officials. \"The judge wants meto put my stamp of approval on an order prohibiting all state law enforcement from enforcing Florida’s immigration laws when no law enforcement are party to the lawsuit,\" he said, as the ACLU’s suit is being adjudicated before Obama-appointed Miami federal judge Kathleen Williams. \"I’m just not going to do that. We believe the court has overstepped and lacks jurisdiction there, and I will not tell law enforcement to stop fulfilling their constitutional duties,\" Uthmeier, who is being threatened with contempt actions, told Fox News Digital. \"I do not believe an AG should be held in contempt for respecting the rule of law and appropriate separation of powers. The ACLU is dead set on obstructing PresidentDonald Trump’sefforts to detain and deport illegals, and we are going to fight back. We will vigorously defend our laws and advance President Trump’s agenda onillegal immigration.\" FLORIDA AG LAUNCHES OFFICE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS, LENDING LEGAL FIREPOWER TO DFEEND PARENTS' ‘GOD-GIVEN RIGHT’ Immigrant rights protesters, left, and FL AG James Uthmeier, right.(Getty) The lawsuit that spurred the injunction alleges Florida’s law violates the Supremacy Clause that designates federal laws and authorities as taking precedence over state laws. Bacardi Jackson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, told the AP that politicians in Tallahassee \"tried to turn fear into policy and made it a crime simply to exist as an immigrant in this state.\" \"The court rightly reminded them: immigration enforcement is a job for the federal government, not a political weapon for states to use,\" Jackson said in a statement. On Wednesday, Uthmeier asked the court to let FHP continue to enforce the law, after Williams was reportedly enraged that arrests continued to occur as the law awaits appeal in Atlanta’s 11th Circuit. FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STOP ENFORCING NEW IMMIGRATION LAW \"That law does nothing more than exercise Florida’s inherent sovereign authority to protect its citizens by aiding the enforcement of federal immigration law,\" Uthmeier wrote Wednesday. That circumstance was precipitated by an April 23 memo from Uthmeier to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, sheriffs and police chiefs, in which he wrote that Williams was incorrect in asserting all Florida law enforcement agencies were bound by the order. \"I explained that I believed her after-the-fact expansion of her order to nonparties was wrong, and that my office would be arguing as much in short order. Today, my office filed a brief explaining why her order cannot possibly restrain Florida’s law enforcement agencies from enforcing Florida Statutes Sections 811.102 and 811.103. We will continue to argue that position—including on appeal as soon as possible,\" Uthmeier wrote in the memo, obtained by Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP FL AG James Uthmeier, left and US Marshal Greg Leljedal, right(Office of Florida Attorney General) Uthmeier told the agencies that Williams ordered him to inform them of the \"evolving scope\" of the order, but added he cannot prevent them from enforcing the new law. Williams said Tuesday she planned to issue a preliminary injunction against the statute, adding that she was \"surprised and shocked\" by Uthmeier's actions. \"What I am offended by is someone suggesting you don’t have to follow my order, that it’s not legitimate,\" Williams said. A source familiar with the situation said the memo was sent after FHP was added to the court order despite plaintiffs not expressly including the police force in their original filing; suggesting that state police would not be party to any injunction in that case. If Uthmeier were to be brought before the judge, the court would likely need the assistance of U.S. Marshal Greg Leljedal of the Northern District of Florida. A Thursday tweet from Uthmeier showed the two men smiling in his office, with the AG commenting on their \"great meeting.\" Fox News Digital's Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Laura Ingraham and senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weigh in on President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as surgeon general. WASHINGTON — PresidentDonald Trump's pick for U.S. surgeon general,Dr. Janette Nesheiwat,has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, garnering support ahead of her upcoming confirmation hearing, with senators describing her as a \"fierce\" advocate for the \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) movement. Sources familiar with her confirmation hearing prep told Fox News Digitalthat Nesheiwathas had many \"productive meetings\" on Capitol Hill regarding her nomination. TRUMP PICKS DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT AS NATION'S NEXT SURGEON GENERAL Nesheiwat recently met with the staff for the Senate HELP Committee, along with all the health policy GOP staffers. Sources said those staffers have expressed support for her nomination as medical director in the Public Health Service and surgeon general. Nesheiwat also met with Democrat Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, along with Democrat Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. Sources told Fox News Digital that Blackburn is supportive of Nesheiwat. Details of Nesheiwat's meetings with Hickenlooper and Alsobrooks were not immediately clear. The sources said various topics were discussed during those meetings, including fighting chronic illness, diseases, opioids, the mission of MAHA, vaccines, good nutrition, educating Americans with science-backed data, combating healthcare provider shortages, mental health, food deserts and the government's role in tracking health crises and emerging health threats. Sources said the conversations have been \"positive, productive conversations.\" Nesheiwat has met, so far, with all the Republican senators on the Senate HELP Committee except for Sen. Josh Hawley. A source told Fox News Digital that Sen. Katie Brit of Alabama, who is not on the committee, wants to meet with Nesheiwat in early May.

    "title": "REAL ID renews America's age-old dread of the DMV",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent CB Cotton joins ‘America's Newsroom’ to give the latest on U.S. airports soon requiring REAL IDs to be shown for domestic flights. A stricter identity verification requirement for U.S. residents is slated to take force next week after 20 years of delay. And for many, the law will require a visit to one of the nation's most notorious, time-honored places of dread:the Department of Motor Vehicles. These facilities can vary slightly both in name and in acronym: Texans, for example, have a Department of Public Safety or DPS; Floridians dub theirs the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or HSMV. (Add to the mix the DDS, the BMV and the MVD, it's a veritable alphabet soup.) Despite the different names, each of these state-run facilities serves the same purpose: to license drivers and issue identification cards to residents living in the state. They share the same wait times and inspire the same feelings of burden and loathing. But for individuals in some states, things are about to get a lot worse, fast. 'DRACONIAN' AND DANGEROUS: FORMER TRUMP NAT SEC ADVISOR SOUNDS ALARM ON BIDEN-ERA DOJ'S PLANS FOR GOOGLE People wait in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco on May 11, 2020. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty) On May 7, all U.S. residents will be required to show a \"REAL ID-compliant\" form of identification to board any flights, including international and domestic travel, or to enter any federal buildings in compliance with a long-stalled federal law passed by Congress in 2005. A REAL ID is a state-issued driver's license or state-issued identification card that meets certain federal standards, and it requires individuals to provide additional documentation, such as several documents proving current state residency — a utility agreement and lease, for example — as well as a certified birth certificate, among other things. REAL IDs are now issued by allstate DMVs(or BMVs or HSMVs) in anticipation of the fast-approaching enforcement date. REAL ID-compliant ID cards and licenses are marked with a star or other symbol in the right-hand corner, and some states, including Texas and Florida, have been issuing them for years. But because DMVs are operated at a state and not federal level, compliance with the tighter verification standards has until recently been optional. That's prompted a patchwork of compliance across the U.S. and a recent, frenzied panic from residents in states whose DMVs have not met the REAL ID standards. NEED REAL ID IN A HURRY? HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS OUTSIDE THE DMV REAL ID enforcement begins May 7.(Fox News) In the final days before the new law takes effect, some U.S. residents are learning for the first time, to their horror, that their IDs are not up to snuff. That's prompted a surge of last-minute appointments in some states as drivers frantically look to obtain these new IDs. In others, appointments are nearly impossible to come by. New Jersey, for example, currently has no appointments available at any of its DMV facilities in the state. That could be a major problem for travelers in the Garden State, whose REAL ID compliance is the lowest in the country at 17% last month, according to data compiled byCBS News. Other nearby states are reporting similar compliance rates, with Pennsylvania at 26% compliance and New York with 43%, which is less than half of all residents living in the state. For individuals in these states, the REAL ID compliance standards amount to what could be a travel nightmare, especially ahead of the summer holiday season when airports brace for a sharp uptick in traffic. As of January 2024, just 56% of state-issued drivers' licenses and identification cards were compliant with the new REAL ID requirements, according to DHS estimates. It's unclear how much that percentage has changed in the last year. \"DHS anticipates that a significant number of individuals seeking to use their DL/ID for a REAL ID official purposes on and after May 7, 2025, may not have a compliant DL/ID,\" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a memo last September. Dozens wait in line at the San Francisco Department of Motor Vehicles on July 23, 2019.(Getty Images) In January, DHS issued a slightly more optimisticprojection in the Federal Register, anticipating that by May 7, up to 66% of U.S. ID holders would have the new legally required ID. But in the final days before the law takes force, it's hard to ascertain exactly where things stand. Horror stories persist in some states of drivers struggling to obtain the new ID, and in others, state lawmakers are hoping to be granted a delay. In Kentucky, a group of state lawmakers led by Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to delay the REAL ID enforcement date, citing \"growing concerns\" from state residents who have been unable to access driver’s licensing services due to \"limited appointment availability and long lines for walk-ins.\" \"This simple request is to protect Kentuckians from bureaucratic burdens,\" Higdon said in theletter. \"Rural residents, seniors, and families still have hurdles in front of them, and in a lot of cases, may not be aware of their options. Only about 40 percent of our residents have a REAL ID, but I would also like more time to help Kentuckians understand that they may not need a REAL ID. Kentucky has made a good faith effort, but we just aren’t there yet.\" The Transportation Security Administration has warned that individuals who don't have the right ID before that date could be subject to significantly longer wait times or other disruptions to travel. This could impact travel plans for millions of Americans ahead of what is expected to be a busy summer traveling season. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Others could be barred from accessing certain federal buildings. And the problem persists in other states as well: CBS News found in its April survey that at least 17 states have compliance rates of 50% or less, with 30 states at less than 70% compliance.

    "title": "Billions spent, warfighters wait: Inside the Pentagon’s broken buying system and the plan to fix it",
    "article_text": "Abigail Blanco, a University of Tampa professor, says defense contractors face \"small penalties\" for going over-budget and lawmakers are reticent to cut old weapons systems, leading to waste at DOD. The Pentagon'sprocurement system has kept American forces stocked with some of the most iconic military hardware in history – from the battle-hardened Humvee to the cutting-edge Apache helicopter. But according to the Army's top technology officer, it's also trapped in a cycle of outdated thinking and bloated paperwork that could hinder the U.S. in the next great-power conflict. \"We still have just over 100,000 Humvees,\" Alex Miller, theArmy’s Chief Technology Officer, told Fox News Digital, speaking about the legacy vehicle first introduced in the 1980s. \"Even though during the global War on Terror, we saw the threat change.\" Miller pointed to roadside bombs, or IEDs, which devastated troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as a turning point. \"There were lots of reports that if a Humvee rolled over an IED, it just was not a good situation for soldiers,\" he said. Still, the Army continued buying Humvees, even as it rushed to field more survivable vehicles like MRAPs and Strykers. That, Miller said, highlights the larger issue: not a single acquisition failure, but a systemwide problem in how the military does business. HEGSETH ORDERS SWEEPING ARMY OVERHAUL AND CONSOLIDATION AIMED AT COUNTERING CHINA AND GOLDEN DOME CAPABILITIES \"We still have just over 100,000 Humvees,\" Alex Miller, the Army’s Chief Technology Officer, told Fox News Digital, speaking about the now-obsolete legacy vehicle first introduced in the 1980s.(Reuters/Romeo Ranoco/File Photo) \"We’re playing by the same post-Cold War rules that told us if you have a requirement, you’re going to keep on buying it,\" Miller said. \"Because the requirements process and the acquisition process and the fielding process sort of never changed, we find ourselves in this conundrum where we still have just over 100,000 Humvees.\" Despite introducing newer vehicles like the JLTV – designed to replace the Humvee with better armor and mobility – Miller says the rapid pace of technological change and emerging threats have left even those newer systems at risk of becoming obsolete. \"Even though we continue to buy them and have them in the budget,\" he said, \"that might not be the right answer either.\" Miller laid out theArmy's plansto solve a decades-long issue at the Pentagon, bringing new weapons systems from the proposal stage to the battlefront before technology renders them outdated – just as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a new memo directing an overhaul of the Army's acquisitions process. \"To build a leaner, more lethal force, the Army must transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems,\" Hegseth wrote. NEW ARMY SECRETARY PRAISES TRUMP, HEGSETH FOR CREATING 'A LANE FOR CHANGE' AS HE ZEROES IN ON CUTTING WASTE \"Ukraine has not asked for a single Apache,\" he noted. \"Our Apaches are a great platform. It's amazing. But ... looking at more unmanned systems is probably the way to go\"(Getty Images) Miller warned that some of the Army’s marquee weapons platforms may not be suited for the battlefields of the future. \"Ukraine has not asked for a single Apache,\" he noted. \"Our Apaches are a great platform. It's amazing. But ... looking at more unmanned systems is probably the way to go.\" He also raised questions about the utility of legacy artillery platforms like the Paladin howitzer. Although artillery is dominating the war in Ukraine, the Army is stockpiling more Paladins largely to meet a \"minimum sustainment rate\" — not because commanders are asking for them. That kind of bureaucratic inertia, Miller suggested, is exactly what needs to be upended. In an effort to modernize more rapidly, the Army is now slashing red tape and rewriting regulations. Under a new initiative called \"Transforming in Contact,\" Army leaders have sent requirement writers into the field to live and train alongside soldiers, gathering real-time feedback instead of drafting 300-page documents back in Washington. \"Rather than trying to define what types of things they need, how about we just listen to them for a change?\" Miller said. \"We started that last year … and that has been wildly successful.\" Units heading to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Johnson, Louisiana next week will be equipped with some of the most advanced gear in the Army, including autonomous infantry vehicles built with Silicon Valley partners, advanced battery tech and hundreds of drones. \"All because our leadership just said, go do the right thing, rather than trying to check boxes,\" Miller said. The RQ-4 had an impressive payload capacity of 3,000 pounds and advanced reconnaissance capabilities - at an enormous cost.(Erik Hildebrandt/Northrop Grumman/Handout via Reuters.) Now, according to Miller, the requirements documentation for things like next-generation unmanned aerial vehicles has been whittled down from between 200 and 300 pages to 10. In other cases, modernization isn't always necessary, according to Abigail Blanco, defense expert and professor at the University of Tampa. Up until a few years ago when it was finally retired, one of the primary reconnaissance systems in the War on Terror was the RQ-4 Global Hawk. The RQ-4 had an impressive payload capacity of 3,000 pounds and advanced reconnaissance capabilities - at an enormous cost. Each one was originally slated to cost $20 million but wound up costing $220 million per unit. \"If you look at reports from the Air Force, they repeatedly stated that instead of the [RQ-4], they preferred the U-2 spy plane, which, to be clear, is a relic in military terms. It's from the Cold War period. And so it's not always clear that the modernization piece is desirable.\" Some lawmakers and defense officials initially resisted the Army’s push to streamline systems. \"The OSD comptroller pushed back really hard. Some parts of the Hill pushed back really hard,\" Miller said. \"But we ran a really aggressive ground game.… We’re not asking for more money. We’re asking to spend taxpayer dollars better.\" The problem, according to Blanco, is Congress has long continued to budget for equipment way beyond its point of usefulness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If you are an elected representative and your district manufactures Humvees or tanks, you have a really strong vested interest in ensuring that that technology continues to be produced, regardless whether or not it's operationally necessary.\" In the end, Miller said, acquisition reform isn’t about cutting corners – it’s about keeping pace with an adversary who doesn’t care about red tape. \"The environment, the threat, and the reality change so fast,\" he said. \"We have permission to just be ruthless about working with commercial entities ... and figuring out what can we get in the hands of soldiers faster.\"",

Doug Burgum discusses the Department of Interior’s first new oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of America and the Trump administration's energy agenda on ‘Fox & Friends.’ EXCLUSIVE:Interior SecretaryDoug Burgumon Friday will update a Biden-era federal rule regarding energy development as a major cost-saving measure to private firms, one day after taking a visit to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility on the Gulf Coast. A source familiar with the workings of the rule said it essentially will \"massively deregulate\" a rule passed between thetwo Trump administrationsand should further bolster Gulf Coast oil and gas production by providing lower startup costs for energy firms. The rule outlines criteria that producers and grantholders must provide as financial assurance, with a 2024 Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) estimate that $6.9 billion in new supplemental assurance would be required to protect against oil lessees' default. The Interior Department said that $6.9 billion added up to the $665 million in estimated additional insurance premiums for energy companies, which stifled how much they could spend to expand their operations and pursue what PresidentDonald Trumphas called \"American energy dominance.\" BURGUM SAYS INTERIOR DEPARTMENT COMPLETELY EMBRACING DOGE EFFORT Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, left, and President Donald Trump.(Getty) Burgum told Fox News Digital that the rule revision will \"enable our nation’s energy producers to redirect their capital toward future leasing, exploration, and production all while financially protecting the American taxpayer. \"Cutting red tape will level the playing field and allow American companies to make investments that strengthen domestic energy security and benefit Gulf of America states and their communities,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani explains how these chemicals are all around people on 'America Reports.' Chemicals found in plastics have been linked to a multitude of health risks — and nowheart diseasemortality has been added to the list. In an analysis of population surveys, researchers at NYU Langone Health discovered that daily exposure to chemicals in common household items could have been a factor in more than 356,000 heart disease deaths in 2018 alone. That number equates to more than 13% of heart disease-related deaths worldwide for people between 55 and 64 years of age. STUDY FINDS EVIDENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN BRAINS AND OTHER ORGANS The study, which was published in the journal Lancet eBioMedicine on April 29, explored the risks ofchemicals called phthalates, which are found in cosmetics, detergents, solvents, plastic pipes, bug repellents and other products, according to an NYU press release. Chemicals found in plastics have been linked to a multitude of health risks — and now heart disease mortality has been added to the list.(iStock) In this research, the focus was a specific type of phthalate called di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which is used to make softer, more flexible plastics like food containers and medical equipment, the release stated. DEHP has been linked to inflammation in the arteries of the heart, making people more susceptible toheart attack or stroke. CHEWING GUM MAY RELEASE THOUSANDS OF MICROPLASTICS INTO THE SALIVA, STUDY SAYS To determine levels of DEHP exposure, the researchers analyzed dozens of population surveys spanning 200 countries and territories. Mortality data was obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a research group in the U.S. that collects medical information worldwide to identify trends in public health. \"Our results underscore the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins.\" \"By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,\" said study lead author Sara Hyman, BS, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, in the release. The regions with the highest heart disease death tolls linked to phthalates include the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific. Daily exposure to chemicals in common household items could have been a factor in more than 356,000 heart disease deaths in 2018 alone.(iStock) \"Our results underscore the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins, especially in areas most affected by rapid industrialization and plastic consumption,\" said senior study author Dr. Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD,professor of pediatricsat NYU Grossman School of Medicine, in the release. Inflammation is a known cause of coronary artery disease, according to Dr. Jasdeep Dalawari, an Illinois-based interventional cardiologist and regional chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company. BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEMENTIA RISK SHARE SURPRISING LINK, STUDY SUGGESTS \"Our bodies release chemicals and hormones that give directions to the artery to open, close or change diameter,\" Dalawari, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"This study suggests that microplastics may interfere with those internal signals, so the artery doesn’t perform the way it should.\" The study explored the risks of chemicals called phthalates, which are found in cosmetics, detergents, solvents, plastic pipes, bug repellents and other products.(iStock) \"Microplastics are widely present in a variety of products we use every day, and it’s crucial to understand their long-term effects onhuman health,\" he added. Renato Apolito, M.D., medical director of cardiac catheterization at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center, agreed that manmade plastic products have long been known and suspected to be health risks. THIS ODD DENTAL HABIT COULD SPARK HEART HEALTH RISKS, EXPERTS WARN \"These often use highly engineered chemicals where the goal is not quality and safety, but instead cost-effectiveness and convenience,\" Apolito, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. The doctor shared that he stopped using non-stick pans long ago, and mostly uses glass storage and avoids eating and drinking from plastic containers. Apolito noted, however, that the \"longitudinal and observational\" nature of the study comes with limitations. \"It is generally used to see if there's any correlation between exposure and health risk, which is then used to study the topic further in a more controlled fashion,\" Apolito, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"It cannot control for unidentified variations in lifestyles among the people followed.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senior author Trasande also pointed out the potential limitations. The analysisdoes not establish that DEHP caused heart disease and that higher death risks did not take into account other types of phthalates, he stated. The study also did not include death rates in other age groups, the doctor pointed out, which means the overall death toll is \"likely much higher.\" Looking ahead, the researchers plan to investigate how reducing phthalate exposure affects mortality rates. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER They will also measure the chemical’s potential role in other health concerns. \"These studies are typically what are used to study the next step of elucidating cause and effect,\" Apolito said. \"This can lead to the FDA and other policymakers banning or outlawing the use of such products.\" \"Microplastics are widely present in a variety of products we use every day, and it’s crucial to understand their long-term effects on human health.\" The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Dalawari suggested that the researchers may want to look at other contributing factors, includingair pollution, which has proven to be a \"novel non-traditional risk factor\" for coronary disease.

    "title": "A common killer bug is endangering Americans: ‘Pandemic in plain sight’",
    "article_text": "Dr. Joshua Osowicki, team leader and senior research fellow at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, speaks about the risks of invasive Group A strep and the progress toward a vaccine. Five years after the worldwide hyperfocus on COVID-19 began, some are concerned about the next pandemic — whether it could be caused by influenza,bird fluor another pathogen. Too easily overlooked are non-influenza, non-COVID viruses and bacteria that are burgeoning and spreading unchecked — both in the U.S. and around the world. While they may not cause the next pandemic, they do cause a lot of illness and death. One such bacteria is Streptococcus Group A, an old enemy that colonizes the throat and tonsils of close to 20% ofU.S. children,according to Dr. Joshua Osowicki, team leader and senior research fellow at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. CDC WARNS OF INCREASE IN INVASIVE STRAIN OF STREP THROAT IN US This problematic bacterial strain is easily treated withpenicillin drugswhen it causes a clinical infection, Osowicki told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview.(See the video at the top of this article.) But the problem, he said, is that because the bacteria may be harbored, the diagnosis isn’t always found early enough. The Streptococcus Group A bacteria has been on the rise around the world, doctors warn.(iStock) Scarlet fever and rheumatic fever/rheumaticheart diseasecan result from recurrent or untreated strep — and they are on the increase again in areas without adequate medical care, including parts of the U.S. \"Rheumatic heart disease is a chronic, non-infectious illness that occurs after untreated group-based streptococcal infections — and almost certainly after multiple untreated, group-based streptoococcus infections,\" Osowicki said. STREP THROAT INFECTIONS HAVE SPIKED ABOVE PRE-COVID HIGHS, SAYS REPORT: 'WE'VE MISSED CASES' His research reveals that the prevalence of a life-threatening invasive version of strep Group A — which can include deep-rooted skin infections, sepsis, meningitis and deadly pneumonia — is on the rise around the world. The aggressive skin infections, which are associated withintravenous drug use,can lead to the need for repeated surgeries, along with antibiotics. A life-threatening invasive version of strep Group A can include deep-rooted skin infections, sepsis, meningitis and deadly pneumonia.(iStock) In the U.S., there have been more than double the annual incidents of invasive Group A strep in 10 states, with 21,000 cases and about 2,000 deaths between 2013 and 2022, according to Osowicki. \"In many ways, it’s a pandemic in plain sight,\" he said of Group A strep, adding that close to a billion people likely experience symptomatic diseasefrom the bacteriaeach year. \"It actually does its damage in severe, life-threatening cases before the patient receives antibiotics.\" The important thing with group A strep, according to the doctor, is that antibiotic resistance isn't the primary issue. \"Group A strep is reliably killed by penicillin — and has been since 1941 when penicillin was introduced,\" Osowicki noted. Strep A colonizes the throat and tonsils of close to 20% of U.S. children, according to the researcher.(iStock) \"The point is that it actually does its damage in severe, life-threatening cases before thepatient receives antibiotics. There's this period where it is too hard to diagnose and treatment comes too late.\" In those cases, he said, the patients need ICUs, surgery and \"the most intensive treatment we have to offer.\" Among patients over the age of 65 or so, a quarter of them will die with this form of the disease, according to Osowicki. There is not currently a vaccine for Group A strep. While the more common form of strep throat and minor skin infections are \"less scary,\" Osowicki warned of the dangers of overlooking the more invasive version of the disease. EXPOSURE TO TOXIN INCREASES COLORECTAL CANCER RISK AMONG YOUNGER ADULTS, STUDY FINDS \"We look away sometimes from thelife-threatening infectionsthat we struggle to prevent, diagnose and treat, (until) these become the front-page sepsis cases that you see in the newspaper many weeks of the year,\" he said. \"They're headline-catching cases. They're the cases like Rory Staunton in New York, whose tragic death (in 2012 from sepsis) really triggered the state sepsis mandates across the U.S.\" There are up to 10 different group-based strep vaccines in development, ranging from entirely pre-clinical vaccines that have never seen a person to vaccines that have been tested in phase 1 trials.(iStock) The need for an effective vaccine is clear — both for invasive strep and the more common variety. Osowicki and others in his group are working hard on developing them. \"The current thrust of my research is all vaccine-related,\" he shared. \"We do what are called human challenge trials, where we deliberately infecthealthy adult volunteerswith group A strep, painting it on their tonsils. And we do that in a very careful way, in an inpatient environment.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The researchers also provide early antibiotic treatments and collect throat swabs, blood and saliva to study how the human-only pathogen works and to explore ways to stop it. \"The ultimate goal is that it becomes a really high-powered platform to establish theefficacy of vaccines,\"said Osowicki. There are many vaccine candidates in various stages of development, from the protein-adjuvant kind (like Shingrix or the Novavax COVID vaccine) to the MRNA platform and various other kinds, the researcher said. \"We're working with every vaccine company that has a group-based streptococcal vaccine candidate in development,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER There are up to 10 different group-based strep vaccines in development, ranging from entirely pre-clinical vaccines that have never seen a person to vaccines that have been tested in phase 1 trials, Osowicki noted. The goal, the researcher said, is to \"create a vaccine that the world wants, that the world accepts, that the world says is safe, and that will help our children.\" He said he is concerned about vaccine skepticism, particularly after theCOVID pandemic,which can keep people from trusting the emerging science. Still, the researcher is excited about the future of the strep A vaccine and others, though he expects it could take at least five to 10 years before a worthy candidate reaches doctors’ offices.

    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. The state of Maine and PresidentDonald Trumpcame to one small agreement in their large-scale feud over the issue of trans athletes in girls' sports. In exchange for the U.S. Department of Agriculture agreeing to restore federal funds to Maine that it had frozen, the state droppedits lawsuitagainst the Trump administration over that issue. The lawsuitwas filed April 7 after a federal funding freeze in response to the state's refusal to keep trans athletes out of girls sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Federal Judge John Woodcock ordered the Trump administration to restore those funds April 12. Woodcock, a senior judge of the United States District Court for the District of Maine, was appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2003. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey's office released a statement addressing the settlement Friday afternoon. \"It’s unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations,\" Frey said. \"But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.\" However, the state is still facing other legal battles related to the issue. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER The U.S. Justice Department announced a lawsuit against the state of Maine for its continued defiance of Trump’s executive order to keep biological males out of girls and women’s sports and alleged violations of Title IX. Attorney GeneralPam Bondiannounced the lawsuit at a press conference April 16. \"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said at the press conference. \"What they have been through is horrific.\" Bondi said she was seeking an injunction and to have titles returned to the girls who \"rightfully\" won competitions in which trans athletes participated. The Justice Department accused the state of \"openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News. \"By prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine’s policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and psychological harm.\" Frey previously alleged the \"Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding, all of which are necessary to feed children and vulnerable adults\" after Rollins had signaled the funding freeze wouldn’t affect programs that keep children fed.

Libby sued Fecteau after she was censured by the state legislature's Democratic majority in February for a viral Facebook post that identified a trans athlete who won a girls competition. But Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose ruledagainst Libbyin her case April 22. DuBose, appointed by former President Joe Biden in January, presided over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Then, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled against Libby. So, now she is looking for intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court and expects to hear whether the court will hear the case April 12. The state is embroiled in its own internal conflict with residents too. Aschool districtin Maine is moving to comply with Trump instead of the state over the issue. The MSAD No. 70 School Board voted unanimously Monday night to comply with Title IX, and Superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital he will amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls sports. Maine parent Nick Blanchard recently drew national attention afterhe was interruptedat a school board meeting in Maine's capital city of Augusta while discussing the controversial issue and a petition he launched to have a school administrator removed from her position for supporting transgender inclusion. Maine high school athlete Cassidy Carlislespoke at a rally in Augusta opposing Gov. Janet Mills on the issue and made a trip to the White House to discuss the issue in her state Feb. 27.

The Ryder Cup was supposed to be played atBethpage Blacklast September, but the pandemic postponed it a year. But now, golf fans are finally in countdown mode untilTeam USA and Team Europebattle on Long Island. While golfers might not grow up necessarily wanting to win Ryder Cups (it's the majors that really make up a legacy), the emotions come out every other September.

People who don’t follow golf like to tune into the Ryder Cup for what it represents. It’s a fierce rivalry, it’s got a great story and history behind it, and all the golfers are motivated and pumped to play because of it. It’s been a huge part of my life and a massive focus for me, but I really enjoy the experience of doing that and preparing and trying to give the team the best opportunity for success.\" The road team have not won a Ryder Cup since Team Europe's Miracle at Medinah in 2012, when they overcame a 10-4 deficit on Sunday Singles (USA has not won on European soil since 1993). In five Ryder Cups since then, the home team has won the cup, all in rather convincing fashion. The closest matches in that span have been the five-point wins by Europe in 2014 at Gleneagles in Scotland and the 2023 victory in Rome.

We see it in all of sports. That was a big advantage in Rome, and it’ll be a disadvantage in New York. And I have to try to come up with ways to dissipate that,\" he said. The best way to do that, of course, is by building the best team possible. And although LIV Golf has forced its wrinkles into the event, the plan is to have the 2023 Team Europe hero and two-time major championJon Rahmat Bethpage later this year. \"Jon is a member of the European Tour, he’s eligible to be picked, and still one of our best players. Unless his form drastically takes off, I expect him to be there for us,\" he said. Brooks Koepka was a captain's pick in 2023, thanks to his win at the PGA Championship and second-place finish at the Masters. He narrowly qualified based on points alone, which is pretty impressive, considering LIV players trying for Team USA can only earn points in majors. Koepka, though, was the only LIV golfer in that year's tournament.

    "title": "NFL investigating phone calls but prankgate looks to be partially league's own doing",
    "article_text": "Keyshawn Johnson shares what he believes would define a successful rookie season for Shedeur Sanders with the Cleveland Browns. TheNFLbegan supplying select draft prospects with single-purpose phones, but that has become a problem for the players, teams, and, yes, the league itself, because the numbers are being leaked with unacceptable frequency now. You know about the leak ofShedeur Sanders'phone number. That one was quite public and ultimately easy to solve. It was all over social media and Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich had Sanders' number, supplied to him via email from the NFL, and that somehow got into the hands of his 21-year-old son Jax, who then facilitated a viral prank call to Sanders. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Oct 7, 2023; Tempe, Arizona, USA; Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium.(Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) What you may not know is that the phone Sanders got the call on was not his own. It was provided by the NFL only days prior to the draft. Even Sanders said in one of his released videos of the incident that the phone \"ain't in my name.\" Added Sanders: \"I just got this phone yesterday.\" That's true because the NFL provided the phone so that teams could be certain of immediately reaching Sanders and other prospects and not have lines of communication crossed while prospects might have otherwise been on their personal phones – perhaps communicating with friends and family or simply in a dead cell zone. And here's the kicker: The NFL began supplying these single-purpose phones to make sure its draft telecasts were not awkwardly interrupted or turned uncomfortable with phone calls that didn't reach the players, a former league official told OutKick on Thursday. So, basically, the league provided phones for select prospects to make sure the calls got through at the exact moment teams needed them and the exact moment television partners wanted them to get the calls on air to keep their broadcasts humming. WHO IS JORDON HUDSON? GIRLFRIEND STIRRING CONTROVERSY, BUILDING WEALTH WITH LEGENDARY COACH BILL BELICHICK Oct 19, 2024; Tucson, Arizona, USA; Colorado Buffalos quarterback Shedeur Sanders prior to the game against the Arizona Wildcats at Arizona Stadium.(Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images) The NFL provided the phones and then provided an estimated 2,000 NFL and club employees with the numbers via email, multiple sources confirmed. If this doesn't seem like an inefficient way of making sure anNFL draftbroadcast delivers the iconic prospect-answering-the-call-from-the-team moment, then consider these facts: Sanders was one of a double-digit number of prospects – some who have not been publicly identified – who got prank calls on their league-issued phones, one league source estimated Thursday. The NFL has been mum about this subject other than to say it is investigating. That's ironic because one supposes the investigation by the NFL would have to begin with none other than the NFL itself. Did the league send out the numbers to an unnecessarily wide group of people? That's possible because not only did general managers, their staff and coaches get the numbers, but secondary staffers and some media did as well, a source said. So public relations people, non-football executives, even some equipment managers and training staff may have gotten the delivered list of numbers. The league may have to pare the list of people who get the numbers to its single-purpose phones in the future because, well, it's got a problem that it doesn't like. And one reason the NFL doesn't like this problem is because it's gone public. In this draft alone, we know the list of players who received prank phone calls prior to being selected includes: Sanders,Giants edge rusherAbdul Carter, Browns defensive tackle Mason Graham, Colts tight end Tyler Warren, Commanders offensive lineman Josh Conerly, Bills offensive lineman Chase Lundt and Eagles quarterback Kyle McCord. FORMER NFL STAR STEVE SMITH SR FACES LAWSUIT OVER ALLEGED AFFAIR UNDER UNUSUAL STATE LAW: REPORT NFL Commissioner points out New York Giants fans to edge rusher Abdul Carter after the Giants select Carter with the third pick during the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft on Thursday, April 24, 2025, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The draft runs through April 26.(Tork Mason/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) There are others, according to a source. \"I got a few prank calls earlier in the day from 609 numbers and 215 numbers, so I'm like, alright, when I got that 215 phone call, I was thinking it was another prank call,\" McCord told Philadelphia area reporters. \"But picking up the phone and having [general manager] Howie [Roseman] on the other side, it was pretty cool.\" McCord actually got multiple prank calls before the draft even began. There were so many that when the legitimate call came fromthe Eagles, he expected it to be another prank. \"I didn't really think it was going to be legit, to be honest, because I got a bunch of 215 calls obviously leading up to the draft,\" McCord said. \"And, you know, obviously, sitting there anxious to see what area code pops up and it was 215. \"So, I'm thinking, you know, I don't know who it was going to be. And then I picked up the phone. I said, ‘Hello,’ and then to hear Howie's voice on the other side, alright, not what I expected, but I was super pumped that it happened.\" Prank phone calls are as old as, well, phone calls themselves. And they're not new to the NFL, either. In 2013, two 20-year-olds somehow gotthen-Bills general managerBuddy Nix and then-Buccaneers GM Mark Dominik on a conference call. And, amazingly, during the call, the two GMs proceeded to discuss free agency plans for six full minutes.

    "article_text": "Jackie Dorman, founder of the \"Last Year Single\" program, talks to Fox News Digital about the whirlwind romance between Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson. Bill Belichick andJordon Hudson’swhirlwind romance came to light last summer. Hudson posted about Belichick on her social media while the legendary NFL coach kept a toe in the spotlight as he remained on the sidelines looking for his next move in football. As Belichick took over as head coach for theNorth Carolina Tar Heelsfootball program in January, the curtain on his relationship with Hudson began to peel back a bit. Reports showed just how much influence he wanted Hudson to have, as he requested her to be copied in emails. It came to a head on Sunday as she appeared to take the form of a publicist and shot down a question from CBS about how her and Belichick’s relationship got started. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Former cheerleader Jordon Hudson arrives at Sports Illustrated's SI The Party at Mardi Gras World on Feb. 8, 2025 in New Orleans.(Skip Bolen/Getty Images) The awkward interview fully put the relationship between the 73-year-old Super Bowl champion football general and the 24-year-old state champion cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant. A reportfrom Realtor.comon Wednesday showed that Hudson had built up a multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio since the two began dating, which was reportedly in late 2023 before they went public. The questions and scrutiny over their relationship, specifically the near-50-year age gap and the real reasons why the two are together at all, hit a fever pitch. Jackie Dorman, a relationship expert with 25 years of experience in the field and the creator of \"Last Year Single,\" told Fox News Digital that the speculation about the nature of their relationship because it is not something that Belichick has ever done. \"There are influential men that date younger women all the time and no one thinks anything of it,\" Dorman explained. \"But this is not what Bill does. Bill married his childhood sweetheart. He had three decades of a marriage that produced three children, obviously a family man, all of his kids followed him into coaching.

And I’m sure people were heartbroken that he got divorced. People are rooting for the childhood sweetheart love story. People really want that to be successful. But then he has a really committed 16-year relationship with a woman that’s closer to being his peer. Someone who’s just 11 years younger than him and they work together. They run a foundation together. And that makes sense.\" Dorman said she believed a lot of people have kept a close eye on the relationship and wondered if Belichick was \"OK.\" Jackie Dorman, a relationship expert, gave her insights into an age-gap relationship.(Fox News Digital) \"You say he’s your twin flame, but we’re not buying it because it doesn’t feel like a fairy tale. It feels more like a fumble on Bill’s part because here he has this legacy and is it being tarnished? That’s what people are really asking right now, like, what’s happening? How does your family really feel about this? And the reason why is because once again, it’s not his M.O.,\" she said \"It’s not something we’re used to seeing from him. We’re used to seeing him on the field, really focused, the greatest of all time, one of the iconic coaches of football history. I mean, he had aSuper Bowlring before Jordan was born. And so, I think that’s why people are speculating, ‘hey, what’s really going on here?’\" Former New England Patriots starJulian Edelmansaid of the CBS interview that people were given an \"unfair reality\" of what was going on because Hudson was acting more like a publicist rather than a girlfriend at the time when she chimed in. Dorman suggested to Fox News Digital that with the choices that Hudson has made, she will have to expect opinions from all angles. \"I mean she’s not a child, so the narrative out there like, oh, she’s just a child. No, she’s 24 years old. She’s an adult woman,\" Dorman said. \"She can make her own choices. But with those choices come other people’s opinions, and she doesn’t seem to be bothered by it so that’s great, but of course, people are going to say those things.

It feels kind of icky to a lot of people.\" Dorman expressed that it is a long shot for making the relationship work if they do hear wedding bells ring. She said statistically, 95% of marriages with a more than 15-year age gap end in divorce. The two havereportedly discussed marriage. \"I don’t know if he’s marriage-minded at this season of his life. And that’s important to note. In your 70s, you’re thinking about family, and legacy, and health. And in your 20s, you’re thinking about exploration and discovery,\" she said. \"Like how much can we really have in common? Even though this relationship is, I believe, 1,000% consensual, is it compatible? \"And that’s why 95% May-December romances that have smaller age gaps than this one divorce if they would marry or they just break up if they’re not married. And so, statistics are against them fore sure. How can they make it work? I mean, if there truly is affection, if it really is truly a love story, then I guess they’re gonna have to figure that out.\" Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and girlfriend Jordon Hudson enter the field before the game between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Navy Midshipmen at MetLife Stadium.(Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images) The \"Married in 12 Months or Less\" and \"The Heart Work\" author stressed that she does believe age is just a number and what is more important is that they are on the same page with what they want in life.

Almost one full year ago,11-time LPGA winner Lexi Thompson, 29 years old at the time, announced that she was no longer going to be a full-time golfer. At the time, Thompsoncited her mental healthas one of the factors that contributed to her decision. \"A lot of people don't realize … what we go through as a professional athlete. I'll be the last one to say ‘throw me a pity party.’ That's the last thing I want. But we're doing what we love. We're trying the best every single day, and we're not perfect.

I’m excited to just be able to explore other things that life has to offer,\" Thompson said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital. \"I am comfortable with [my decision]. I still plan on playing here and there, but more sporadically and more on my time. I’m just trying to find my love for the game again. It’s something that’s been a part of my life since I was little. I‘ve always loved the competitive side of it and was always driven to be perfect at golf, but you can never be perfect at golf. So it’s an ongoing learning challenge. Sometimes that can be very difficult. But yeah, it’s been a good decision for me.

With women's sports gaining more and more popularity, perhaps some may have felt Thompson's job was to grow the game. However, self comes first, said Thompson. \"I think there’s always the outside pressures and expectations from the world and just people in the golfing industry. But I think what's most important, you just have to focus on yourself and why I got involved in the game in the first place and my dreams and everything.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The 151st running of theKentucky Derbywill take place at the famous Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, May 3, and returning for the first time in four years will be Hall of Fame horse trainer, Bob Baffert. Baffert, one of the most successful trainers in the history of the sport, returns this year after having missed the first leg of the Triple Crown for three consecutive years – a suspension that began with his record-breaking seventh victory at the race in 2021 that was later stripped because of a failed drug test. Baffert, one of only two trainers to ever win the covetedTriple Crownon two occasions, became considered by some an outcast in the horse racing community following the fallout of Medina Spirit’s Kentucky Derby victory in 2021. Trainer Bob Baffert motions to a visitor outside his barn at Churchill Downs on Tuesday, April 29, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky.(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Baffert secured his seventh Kentucky Derby win on May 1, 2021, when Medina Spirit, the 3-year-old colt owned by Zedan Racing Stables, won the first leg of the Triple Crown by a half-length. The victory at Churchill Downs broke the record previously shared between Baffert and fellow Hall of Fame trainer Ben Jones. Days after being declared the winner, it was announced on May 9, 2021, thatMedina Spirithad failed a postrace drug test after testing positive for an excessive amount of the steroid betamethasone. Churchill Downs immediately suspended Baffert, who denied any wrongdoing. \"It is our understanding that Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit’s post-race blood sample indicated a violation of the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s equine medication protocols,\" the racetrack said in a statement at the time. \"To be clear, if the findings are upheld, Medina Spirit’s results in the Kentucky Derby will be invalidated and Mandaloun will be declared the winner.\" Baffert was also later barred by the New York Racing Association, pending the investigation in Kentucky. Medina Spirit, ridden by jockey John Velazquez, #8, crosses the finish line to win the 147th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 1, 2021.(Sam Mallon/Getty Images) Churchill Downs announced on June 2, 2021 that Baffert would be suspended from entering a horse at the famed horse track for the next two years after a second postrace sample failed a drug test. On Feb. 21, 2022, Churchill Downs officially recognized Mandaloun as the winner of the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby after the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission announced that Medina Spirit was in violation of racing rules. Baffert was suspended and fined by the commission. BOB BAFFERT-TRAINED HORSE NOT ALLOWED TO RUN IN KENTUCKY DERBY, JUDGE RULES Baffert filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against Churchill Downs, CEO William C. Carstanjen and board Chair R. Alex Rankin on March 1, 2022 in an attempt to overturn the suspension, arguing that the famed horse trainer was not given the right to due process. \"The facts are clear, and Churchill Downs knows them but refuses to acknowledge them,\" an attorney for Baffert said at the time. \"Churchill Downs knows the post-race test report occurred as a result of the use of a harmless ointment known as Otomax. They know it was prescribed by Medina Spirit's treating veterinarian and properly and timely reported to the data bank the day it was dispensed. They know no rule was violated, and the ointment could never have enhanced Medina Spirit's performance. To maintain otherwise is absurd.\" Trainer Bob Baffert holds the trophy after Medina Spirit won the 147th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 1, 2021.(Andy Lyons/Getty Images) A federal judge dismissed the case against the Kentucky racetrack on May 25, 2023, after a previous attempt by Baffert’s legal team to lift the ban in February was denied. The decision came just days after aBaffert-trained horse won the Preakness Stakes,a record-breaking eighth victory in the race for Baffert. \"Our actions to suspend Mr. Baffert following Medina’s Spirit’s confirmed positive for a prohibited race-day substance, coupled with his extensive history of drug violations, was done in the best interest of protecting the integrity of horseracing (sic),\" Churchill Downs said in a statement following the ruling. \"Now more than ever, participants and operators in this industry must individually and collectively assume responsibility to take every reasonable measure to protect our equine and human athletes and reject any practice that jeopardizes that mission.\" Churchill Downs also said it reserved the right to extend Baffert’s suspension, a decision that would come at the end of his two-year ban. Baffert’s suspension was extended through 2024, Churchill Downs announced on July 3. \"Mr. Baffert continues to peddle a false narrative concerning the failed drug test of Medina Spirit at the 147th Kentucky Derby from which his horse was disqualified by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission in accordance with Kentucky law and regulations,\" the racetrack said in a statement. \"A trainer who is unwilling to accept responsibility for multiple drug test failures in our highest-profile races cannot be trusted to avoid future misconduct. Mr. Baffert will remain suspended from entering horses at all racetracks owned by CDI through 2024. After such time, we will re-evaluate his status.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trainer Bob Baffert looks on after winning the Sir Barton Stakes ahead of the 148th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore on May 20, 2023.(Patrick Smith/Getty Images) Baffert announced on social media earlier this year that he had instructed his attorneys to dismiss an appeal related to Medina Spirit’s disqualification in 2021. \"Zedan Racing owner, Amr Zedan, and I have decided that it is best to positively focus on the present and future that our great sport offers,\" he wrote in a statement posted to X. \"We thank the KHRC and Churchill Downs for listening and considering our point of view and we are grateful for the changes and clarity that HISA brings to our sport.\" This view shows the saddle cloth of trainer Bob Baffert's horse during morning workouts for the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore on May 12, 2021.(Rob Carr/Getty Images) A Kentucky appeals court judge denied an appeal from Zedan that sought an emergency relief hearing that would allow Arkansas Derby winner Muth to run in the Kentucky Derby on May 4. Baffert released a statement taking ownership of the positive test in 2021 and accepting Churchill Downs’ disciplinary actions that followed. \"I am responsible for any substance found in the horses that I train, and I have paid a very steep price with a three-year suspension and the disqualification of Medina Spirit’s performance,\" his statement read in part. \"I understand and appreciate that Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission took steps to enforce the rules that they believed were necessary to protect the safety and integrity of horse racing and the reputation of the Kentucky Derby.\" After taking ownership of his actions in the ordeal, Churchill Downs announced that it had rescinded Baffert’s suspension. \"We are satisfied that Mr. Baffert has taken responsibility for his actions, completed a substantial penalty and is committed to running in full compliance with the rules and regulations going forward,\" the statement read.  \"All parties agree that it is time to bring this chapter to a close and focus on the future. Mr. Baffert is welcome to return to any of CDI’s racetracks, including our flagship Churchill Downs Racetrack, and we wish him and his connections good luck in their future competitive endeavors.\" Wood Memorial winner Rodriguez and Citizen Bull, last year’s 2-year-old champion – both Baffert-trained horses – will be competing in this year's Kentucky Derby with the legend himself present. \"It’s one of those things where I’m just tired of talking about it,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"It’s been a tough three years and I’ve put that behind me.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Pro wrestling star Austin Aries made a surprise return toMajor League Wrestling(MLW) last month as he put a headset on and called Battle Riot VII instead of performing in the ring. Aries, whose real name is Daniel Healy, has been in several different promotions throughout his career, includingWWE, TNA and others. He was at MLW from 2018 to 2019. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Austin Aries talked to Fox News Digital about his new commentary endeavor.(MLW) Though battling an illness, Aries hopped on the mic with Joe Dombrowski to call the event. \"It feels good,\" Aries said of his return to MLW. \"Just kind of readjusting. I hadn’t been at MLW for a number of years, worked with them a few times over my career, never anything sustained. It’s just been exciting to watch the growth of the company, the momentum they’ve been building and a lot of the names they’ve been bringing in. \"And so when the opportunity presented itself for me to get back into the fold and to do it behind the commentary desk, it was definitely something I wanted to take them up on.\" Aries had previous experience at the announcer’s table.

Austin Aries briefly wrestled for MLW.(MLW) HULK HOGAN, ERIC BISCHOFF TEAM UP TO LAUNCH REAL AMERICAN FREESTYLE, BRING COMPETITIVE WRESTLING TO MAINSTREAM He told Fox News Digital he derived his inspiration from legendary commentators and managers Bobby Heenan and Jesse Ventura. \"I’m trying to be the version of myself, but those guys definitely influence my style as far as a heel commentator that’s going to add a little bit more of a slant,\" he said. \"I think the other thing I enjoyed about those guys, and I think as a color commentator, is when you can bring the perspective of actually being in the ring having competed. It’s a whole perspective that you can give the views that a commentator who hasn’t been in the ring can’t offer.\" Aries has been a decorated champion in the ring. He was a three-time TNA world heavyweight champion, a six-time TNA X-Division champion, a two-time Ring of Honor world champion, and he was ranked No. 12 on Pro Wrestling Illustrated’s Top 500 wrestlers list in 2013. Now 47 years old, Aries said the role to transition to a commentator was the right move. It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s finished in the ring just yet. \"I had an opportunity to do commentary when I was with WWE. It was something that opened up after I got injured, and I really enjoyed it and I felt comfortable doing it. And so it was something that – at the back of my mind, I thought maybe down the road, as I started to slow down my in-ring career – would maybe be an opportunity I’d like to pursue. \"MLW approached me and asked me if it was something I was interested in doing. So I felt, you know, I’m 47, I do still wrestle. I just kind of pick my spots carefully. There’s nothing saying that down the road I might not step in the ring with MLW. But for now, it’s a great way to get myself back into the fold with the company. The opportunity was to be a color commentator, so I’m going to take that role and do my best with it, and we’ll see what happens from there.\" Aries is set to be on the call for MLW’s next event, Azteca Lucha, on May 10 in Chicago.

    "title": "REAL ID rejection by Americans may come down to one surprising factor",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital asked travelers about REAL ID at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C., with some passengers sharing why they're skipping the new identification. WASHINGTON –As many Americans across the nation are rushing to obtain their REAL ID license, some are choosing to opt out – by either using their valid passport as their preferred form of ID for travel or waiting until their current driver's license expires and then renewing it. The REAL ID requirement takes effect on May 7, when Americans must have a new form of identification in order tofly domestically. The costs of obtaining the identification vary from state to state. Costs also vary according to whether travelers are obtaining a first-time REAL ID or looking to renew their existing license. MARRIED WOMEN FACE REAL ID DOCUMENTATION HURDLES: 'I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS' Other forms of identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. With the deadline looming, Fox News Digital spoke this week with travelers and asked those who do not have or do not plan to get a REAL ID any time soon why they made that decision. With the REAL ID deadline of May 7 looming just ahead, many Americans are choosing to use passports or are waiting until it's time to renew their license.(Ashley J. DiMella/Fox News Digital) At the Ronald ReaganNational Airport(DCA) in Washington, D.C., Lisa from Oregon said that it was a \"financial decision\" at this time. Lisa (no last name shared) said she had not yet gotten a REAL ID to date \"because it was an extra cost, and I knew that I would rather put that money toward the passport.\" She said that at a later date, she may decide to get a REAL ID. NEED REAL ID IN A HURRY? HERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS OUTSIDE THE DMV \"When I'm traveling later, I'll have to bring my passport and I may not want to do that for stateside travel,\" she said. Other forms of identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. The costs of obtaining the identification vary from state to state.(Fox News) Some states offer a reduced price for the REAL ID, such as California. The Golden State’s DMV website says, \"In certain circumstances, the fee may be waived or reduced.\" It adds, \"You may be eligible to pay a reduced application fee for an original or renewal ID card if you meet income requirements for selected governmental or nonprofit assistance programs.\" It also notes that a \"homeless person\" may be eligible for a no-fee ID card. LOOMING REAL ID DEADLINE CAUSES CHAOS AT DMVS AS CRITICS TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA And \"to qualify for a no-feesenior citizenID card, you must be at least 62 years old,\" according to California's DMV. Kelsey from Bloomington, Illinois, said she'd just arrived in D.C. She does not have a REAL ID, she said. \"I do not have a real ID yet because I have not made it to the DMV and our trip ends before May 7th, so I didn't feel an urgency to do so,\" she said. Paper flyers were handed out to travelers at DCA with a QR code so that people could pull up a list of acceptable IDs to use at TSA checkpoints.(Fox News Digital) She said that since shealready has a passport,she feels it makes more financial sense to use it at this time. \"My ID expires in November, so I plan on doing it all at once when I have to get one anyway,\" she said. \"I didn't feel an urgency to do so.\" A man named Nick, who is also from Bloomington, Illinois, told Fox News Digital, \"I travel with my passport, so I normally don't even use my ID.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"I would love to look into [REAL ID] more. I don't know enough about it,\" he said when asked if he will get one. A countdown is displayed at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., reminding travelers of the looming REAL ID deadline.(Ashley J. DiMella/ Fox News Digital) At DCA’s south security checkpoint this week, a countdown was displayed on a monitor reminding travelers of the deadline. Paper handouts were also given to travelers urging them to get the new identification. Victoria of Phoenix, Arizona, said she does not have a REAL ID. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"I just don't travel enough,\" she said. She has a passport and said that if it would save her more time at the airport, she would get one. Some travelers told Fox News Digital this week why they're skipping getting the new ID right now.(Fox News Digital) When asked if she knows anyone who does not have a passport or a REAL ID, she said her parents don’t. She said she wants her parents to get the REAL ID so that\"they can traveland enjoy retirement.\" She does not believe they are looking at making a DMV appointment as of right now. \"The DMVs are always pretty packed.\" Lesley from California commented that she has a REAL ID — but shared that a colleague who did not have the document had to rush to get one for a work trip. \"She didn't have the REAL ID, so she had to go and see them [the DMV] and get the REAL ID, and it was about like a two-to-four-hour wait … It was in California.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She added, \"The DMVs there are always pretty packed.\" While the DMVs in some states have added special Saturday hours or extended weekday hours to accommodate REAL ID requests, many motor vehicle bureaus are not open on weekends.",

    "title": "'Bold and fearless': Trump launches new wave of judicial nominations",
    "article_text": "‘Judicial Watch’ president Tom Fitton discusses the legal challenges facing the Trump administration and explains how many judges are aiding ‘left-wing activists’ on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ President Trumpannouncedhis first judicial nominee of his second term, kicking off what will be a historic next four years as he continues to build on the most consequential accomplishment of his first term by appointing even more bold and fearless judges. The stakes could not be higher as Democrat activist judges are actively sabotaging American voters, the presidency, our Constitution, and our country. Trump nominated Whitney Hermandorfer to a Tennessee-based seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. She is a brilliant legal mind and committed constitutionalist who has litigated critical First Amendment issues. Trump's first nomination stands in stark contrast to the Obama- and Biden-appointed Democrat activist judges who have repeatedly attempted to sabotage the president’s core Article II executive powers during these first months of Trump’s historic second term. These anti-American judges, who side with Hamas supporters, MS-13 gang members, and no-show federal bureaucrats leeching on the taxpayer, need to be countered. Trump’s nominees promise a return to the original vision of a judiciary grounded in constitutionalism and judicial restraint. TRUMP-BACKED BILL TO STOP ‘ROGUE’ JUDGES PASSES HOUSE During his 2016 campaign, Trump boldly and brilliantly ran on the issue of judicial nominations in an unprecedented way. He released a list of potential Supreme Court candidates from which he would choose to fill the vacancy arising from Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. This list of nominees set him apart from his rival at the time, Hillary Clinton. Had Clinton won, we would have been subjected to leftist judicial tyranny for at least a generation. Fortunately for the Constitution and the American people, Trump prevailed, and the country was rewarded with Justice Neil Gorsuch instead of Justice Merrick Garland. Given his horrendous and truly shameful service as attorney general, Garland would have been an unmitigated disaster had he received a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Trump did not stop after the confirmation of Gorsuch. Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation shifted the balance of the Court in 2018, as he replaced Anthony Kennedy, the pivotal justice in countless landmark cases. The coup de gras came in 2020, when Trump replaced liberal lion Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the more conservative Amy Coney Barrett. This dramatic shift paid dividends in short order and in many consequential ways. Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch speaks about his brand-new book \"Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law\" at the Reagan Library on August 8, 2024 in Simi Valley, California.(Apu Gomes/Getty Images) In 2022, the Court overruledRoe v. Wade(1973) inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organizationand restored the issue of abortion to its rightful place: the states. The justices also strengthened the Second Amendment inNew York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, ruling that the Second Amendment requires \"shall-issue\" concealed-carry permits. No longer can states have foggy standards where bureaucrats whimsically decide whether to allow citizens to carry concealed weapons. States must set forth standards, and citizens who satisfy those standards will be able to carry such firearms. The next year, the Court put a stop to the practice of race-based college admissions policies in two cases involving Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Thanks to the rulings inStudents for Fair Admissions, students must be evaluated based on merit. Conservatives had been trying for decades to eliminate affirmative action, just as they had abortion. Trump made these dreams come true. Last year, the Court struck a giant blow against the administrative state inLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, a decision that overturned the requirement that courts defer to administrative agencies when a statute is ambiguous. He will look beyond the garden-variety Federalist Society choices and install a new generation of judicial titans who will change the landscape for generations to come in line with our Founders’ intent. Just days afterLoper Bright, the justices strengthened the presidency inTrump v. United States. There, the Court held that presidents are absolutely immune when exercising core Article II powers like pardons and at least presumptively immune for acts done within the outer perimeters of their official duties. This ruling enormously aided Trump against the lawfare perpetrated by the Biden Justice Department. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett speaks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation in Simi Valley, Calif., Monday, April 4, 2022.(AP) Trump’s judicial impact extended beyond the Supreme Court. He appointed54 circuit judgesin his first term, second only to President Jimmy Carter’s 56 in a single term. Carter benefited enormously from the Democrat-controlled Congress’s creation of 35 new circuit judgeships during his term. Congress created none for Trump. More importantly, Carter did not appoint any Supreme Court justices. Trump’s impact on the judiciary dwarfs Carter’s by any reasonable metric. Trump appointed only one fewer circuit judge in one term than did President Obama in two, and several of Obama’s appointees were to the Federal Circuit, a court with comparatively less impact than the other circuits on crucial issues. More importantly, Obama’s two Supreme Court appointments did not shift the balance of the Court; he replaced two leftist justices with two others. Trump also has an excellent chance to surpass President Ronald Reagan’s record for circuit confirmations of 83. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The accomplishments of Trump’s first term were excellent, but there is still work to be done. At times, the Supreme Court has been frustrating with rulings, mainly on the emergency docket with respect to Trump’s policies and the leftist inferior court judges who have enjoined them. Thanks to the Republican-controlled Senate—and a wider majority than existed in the first two years of his first term—Trump will select even more bold and fearless nominees. He will look beyond the garden-variety Federalist Society choices and install a new generation of judicial titans who will change the landscape for generations to come in line with our Founders’ intent. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has assembled an excellent judicial nominations team in Attorney General Pam Bondi, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, White House counsel Dave Warrington, and his deputy Steve Kenny to help him identify, vet, and nominate bold and fearless judges. The Article III Project, which I founded, is proud to support and assist their efforts and these excellent nominees, who will uphold the law and Constitution without fear or political consideration. We will continue to dedicate our resources and expertise to ensure only the most bold and fearless judges are nominated and confirmed to the bench.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: How I stumbled on the secret to overcoming political division in today's fractious USA",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Over the past eight months, as I have been traversing the country, there is one inescapable but silent issue that I hear over and over again. Put bluntly, we don’t like each other very much. In every state I’ve traveled to, I hear stories of family members and friends lost to the swarming waves of political anger, and I’m not here to say one side is to blame, though I have suspicions. I am here to say that I think I might have recently met the solution. In Morgantown, West Virginia, having dinner one night recently, I met Mack and Michael, among the most unique pair of friends I have ever come across. DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS MATTER. BUT THE NEXT 100 DAYS WILL TELL THE TALE OF THE TRUMP ERA Mack the elder, at 79, and Mike, a sprightly 52, met years ago when they both worked in the area for a major corporation. Mack is a Democrat and no fan of President Donald Trump, Mike on the other hand votes GOP and sees Trump as a godsend. \"We talk about politics a lot,\" Mike told me over some ramp deviled eggs, (ramp is an Appalachian delicacy, a kind of garlicky wild green onion) \"but we try to stick to facts, not get too emotional.\" Mack added, \"There are more important things than politics.\" In the hour or so that we spent talking, political issues did creep in, the tariffs, immigration, and one of the things I noted was that every time things started to seem a bit heated, Mike and Mack had nonverbal cues that kept things light, and on track. \"West Virginiawas a Democratic state for a long time,\" Mack correctly told Mike and I, \"now it's Republican, but the people are still the people.\" \"I live outside of Morgantown, because it's so liberal here, but people get along,\" Mike added, his oldest boy is serving with 101st Airborne at Ft Campbell, something both men clearly took great pride in. \"My dad served in World War II,\" Mack said, adding, \"he was a hard man but loved his family and his country.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION What came across, and I mean this in the manliest possible way, is that these two guys, this unlikely pair, really love each other. They know each other’s families. Mike would constantly say, \"Mack, tell him that story about JFK, or the old days.\" Ultimately, a friend is not the person who can tell you what you want to hear. Anyone can do that. It is the person who can question your judgment while still valuing you as a person, but this is something the American left, and increasingly the right, have lost sight of. I wish I could bottle whatever these guys have that let them rise above their political differences. The next night, I found myself in Charleston, and like most state capitals, you can smell the power, a fragrant mix of lobbying cash, steak houses and strip clubs. There I met Brandon, who was passing through town for work. I asked why he thought so many people in our country areso divided by politics, why so many friendships have been fractured and families frayed, why it’s not like the 90s when politics was an afterthought. \"Well, we didn’t define each other by our political views back then,\" he told me. \"We defined each other by how we treated each other, number one. Number two, I think the reason it happened so quickly, wasCOVID, and people lost their *****ing minds, lost their ability to define a human being, by who they are instead of their political views.\" Brandon finished by saying this is what happens: \"When you put somebody in a house and all they have is constant bombardment of bullsh*t, and the division of a country, on purpose.\" What struck me about both of these West Virginia encounters is that the essential element to overcoming political division is physical human interaction. And at a time whenMark Zuckerbergand Meta want to give us all, and our kids, artificial intelligence friends, this gets scary. Ultimately, a friend is not the person who can tell you what you want to hear. Anyone can do that. It is the person who can question your judgment while still valuing you as a person, but this is something the American left, and increasingly the right, have lost sight of. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When you sit in a town you’ve never been to as darkness falls and light a cigarette, you see quiet lives drift beyond corners, and know that everywhere, everyone is just as important to themselves as you are to you. Mike and Mack realized that about each other a long time ago, and what flourished from it, what I saw clearly, was a model of friendship for all of us, and maybe, it is friendship, not politics, that can pave a better way forward.

    "title": "The surprising way the FBI is adapting to modern crime fighting",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The FBI has alwayshad a complicated relationship with public messaging. During my time as a supervisory special agent, deputy unit chief in the National Press Office, and later as special assistant to the assistant director of Public Affairs, I saw firsthand how communication could either build public trust — or erode it — depending on timing, tone and transparency. For years, theBureau treated social medialike a legal filing: formal, cautious and painfully slow. Messages were tightly controlled, centralized and stripped of any emotion. That culture reflected a deep-rooted aversion to risk — understandable in law enforcement — but it also left a vacuum. Today, the FBI’s approach looks different. Under current leadership, the Bureau has stepped more confidently into the digital arena, using social media to highlight the real work of FBI agents protecting Americans every day — fighting cybercriminals, stopping domestic terrorism, rescuing kidnapped children. The messaging is faster, clearer, and more human. It’s less about bureaucracy and more about mission. That shift actually started back in 2008, when I created @FBIPressOffice on Twitter. FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE At the time, the FBI had almost no real presence online. The news cycle was speeding up, and a few of us in the Office of Public Affairs knew that if we didn’t start telling our own story, someone else would — and they wouldn’t always get it right. The FBI learned it was better to get out in front of the news by having an active social media presence. FILE: The opening page of X is displayed on a computer and phone in Sydney on Oct. 16, 2023.(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft, File) Our idea was simple: use Twitter like community policing. Get out in front, not only when something went wrong, but every day. Be part of the conversation. Let the American people see the men and women behind the badge, doing the hard work that usually stays out of sight. Even then, theFBI’s use of social medialeaned heavily one-way — more of a bullhorn than a real conversation with the public. Engaging directly with online comments wasn’t practical, and today, with trolls, misinformation and coordinated attacks so common, it's even tougher. Genuine engagement in a digital world is daunting. But trust isn’t built through press releases alone. It’s earned by being visible, being real, and showing up consistently, even when it’s hard. Since then, the FBI’s digital voice has evolved. The unified @FBI account now delivers news, safety alerts, and behind-the-scenes glimpses that would have been unimaginable years ago. It’s a major step forward — but it comes with real risks. When I helped lead communications efforts, one rule guided everything: never compromise a case for the sake of a headline. Department of Justice policies were clear — don’t discuss active investigations, don’t leak sensitive details and don’t jeopardize a fair trial. Protecting the system of justice always came first. Several U.S. attorneys I worked with made that point plain: poison the jury pool, and you can destroy a case before it ever reaches a courtroom. Balancing transparency with protecting justice has never been tougher. News, rumors and lies spread instantly. Staying silent risks losing the public’s trust. Saying too much risks losing a case. Navigating that tension takes experience, discipline and judgment. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Some will say the FBI’s new digital push is just spin — and frankly, sometimes it looks that way. When messaging strays into self-promotion, it’s a real problem. But modern communication isn't optional anymore. It’s necessary — and it’s complicated. The Bureau must adapt while fiercely protecting the integrity of its investigations. Americans deserve to see the real FBI — not just leadership in Washington, but the rank-and-file brick agents, analysts and professionals across the country who get up every morning, put on the badge, and quietly defend our freedoms. Most didn’t take this job for attention. But showing their work helps the public understand and trust the Bureau’s mission. Our idea was simple: use Twitter like community policing. Get out in front, not only when something went wrong, but every day. Be part of the conversation. Building trust today means reaching people where they are — and for most Americans, that means on the phones in their pockets. For now, social media shouldn't replace traditional media, but it has to complement it. If the FBI wants to remain credible and connected, it has to show up across platforms — and do it with the same commitment to ethics and standards that defines real justice. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mission hasn’t changed: protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. But the battlefield has expanded. Law enforcement today isn’t only fighting physical threats — it’s also fighting disinformation and distrust. In this fight, silence isn’t an option.

    "title": "SEC MARCO RUBIO: Alien Enemies Act exists to protect Americans, defend against Tren de Aragua and others",
    "article_text": "Secretary of State and interim National Security Advisor Marco Rubio breaks down the decision President Donald Trump faces in the Russia-Ukraine war and conditions for a nuclear deal with Iran on 'Hannity.' When the Founding Fathers drafted the Aliens Act of 1798, they intended it to act as an antibody against foreign armies, criminal networks, and individuals who sought to do America harm. They understood something we have forgotten. Every nation has not just a right to act in self-defense, but a duty to do so. When a nation neglects that duty, it risks becoming a haven for vile criminal elements from across the globe, and a battleground in other nation’s conflicts.  No nation is obligated to harbor foreign criminals from justice in their home nations, much less allow them to continue their crime spree right here in the United States. Until PresidentDonald Trumpinvoked the Alien Enemies Act, that was what the United States was doing. Harboring criminals like Adrian Rafael Gamez Finol, Miguel Oyola Jimenez, and Edgar Javier Benitez Rubio, the three members of Tren de Aragua charged with kidnapping, torturing, and murdering Ronald Ojeda in Chile. Ojeda was a genuine political refugee, a lieutenant in the Venezuelan army, who protested the criminal tyranny of Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship and dreamed of one day returning home. That day would never come. Rather than facing justice for those crimes, Ojeda’s three murderers currently reside in the United States, making a mockery of an asylum process designed for men like Ronald Ojeda. TRUMP DHS SLAMS MORE ‘SOB STORY’ REPORTING AFTER TREN DE ARAGUA GANG MEMBERS SEND SOS SIGNAL Thanks to President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, Ojeda’s family may finally receive justice in Chile, and these murderers will no longer threaten the American people in their midst. Ojeda’s murderers and their fellow members ofTren de Araguaare exactly who the Founding Fathers had in mind when they passed the Alien Enemies Act in 1798. They are not merely murderers, but members of a hostile Foreign Terrorist Organization that has committed \"a predatory incursion\" into the territory of the United States and engaged in \"crime against the public safety,\" while in league with a foreign government. By deporting TdA members under the Alien Enemies Act, the United States government is not making judgments about the contributions of individual TdA members but rather deferring to the organization itself. The evidence is clear. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Maduro regime’s-sponsored narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela and was closely aligned with Tareck El Aissami, the Venezuelan regime’s former Vice President. Whether TdA exclusively murders, smuggles drugs, and traffics illegal immigrants over our borders on the orders of Venezuelan leaders, or freelances for self-enrichment is beside the point. It has killed on behalf of a hostile foreign government, that government has fostered its growth, and that government has encouraged it to invade the United States to advance its interests. FEDERAL JUDGE OPENS DOOR TO ALIEN ENEMIES ACT TARGETS SUING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Critics argue that the Aliens Act is unnecessary and unjust and that it is possible to deport criminals individually. That Adrian Rafael Gamez Finol, Miguel Oyola Jimenez, and Edgar Javier Benitez Rubio remain in the country reflect poorly on such arguments. Still, those making them also fail to understand how organized crime works. Whileliberal law professorsmay quibble over whether every member of Tren de Aragua is guilty of every act, that is like pointing out that the mafia included getaway drivers and accomplices who did not take part in breaking the legs of extortion victims but merely drove other mafia members around and handled the paperwork afterward. TdA does not allow people to join for fun because they want neat tattoos or as a form of welfare. It allows entry only to those who can contribute to its criminal campaign against the United States. By deporting TdA members under the Alien Enemies Act, the United States government is not making judgments about the contributions of individual TdA members but rather deferring to the organization itself. RUBIO PASSIONATELY DEFENDS IMMIGRATION ACTIONS TO WEED OUT 'PERVERTS AND PEDOPHILES AND CHILD RAPISTS' The Alien Enemies Act was passed precisely because our Founding Fathers understood that the president would need to be able to take decisive action in response to threats from hostile foreign actors. In the 1790s, French revolutionary politicians raised criminal gangs in their struggles for power in Paris, many of which then relocated to America, where they supplemented their efforts to murder one another, and criminality for self-enrichment. The United States government recognized the impossibility of differentiating between subgroups, which represented ever-shifting factions in Paris, and decided the question was ultimately unimportant. Every one of these individuals was a de facto member of a private army, and members of foreign private armies had no business operating on American soil. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That is also why the exact nature of the connections between organizations such as Tren de Aragua and foreign governments is irrelevant. Some critics, thinking they are clever, will argue that one of Tren de Aragua’s key patrons, the Venezuelan regime’s former Vice President Tareck El Aissami, was arrested and charged with treason in 2023. The private army of a foreign warlord does not cease to be a foreign army just because that warlord loses a battle. Theassassination of Mexican politiciansby drug cartels is precisely how those cartels exercise control of Mexican politics, not evidence against their political ambitions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Alien Enemies Act was designed to ensure that the politics of foreign nations would not spread to our shores. Whether they are currently winning or losing, Tren de Aragua is waging a terrorist campaign of murder across our hemisphere in the service of theVenezuelan regime, and we have the duty to expel anyone involved from our nation consistent with all other applicable laws. As Secretary of State, I will continue to use every power at my disposal to protect the American people and defend our nation from foreign invasion. The Founding Fathers recognized the threat posed by foreign terrorist armies invading this nation and wisely provided the president with the power to defend America through the Alien Enemies Act. As long as it exists, I will use it to the fullest. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO Marco Rubio serves as the 72nd U.S. secretary of state.

    "title": "KELLYANNE CONWAY: The Democrats' disastrous first 100 days",
    "article_text": "Panelists Kellyanne Conway and Mark Meadows discuss how the approval ratings for Democrats continues to decrease on ‘Hannity.’ As pundits, pollsters, and op-ed writers turn to their assessment of PresidentDonald Trump’sfirst 100 days -- an \"artificial metric,\" White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles once said -- it seems fitting to examine what the Democrats have done (and failed to do) over the same period. The Democratic Party is in complete disarray. With only 27% saying they view their own party positively, the Democrats are suffering their lowest positive rating in NBC tracking in 35 years. They continue to openly blame, name and shame each other for lying to the nation about Joe Biden’s ability to function as a successful president (and frankly,Kamala Harris’ability, too), for not stopping Donald J. Trump from winning a second term, and for being a rudderless, leaderless, visionless mess since. With GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House, Democrats are the party out of power. Yet they are also the party out of touch with most Americans, out of excuses as to why they lost last fall, out of reasons why core Democratic constituencies that went for President Trump in 2024 should give Democrats another look, and often out of their minds in the hateful rhetoric they use. DAVID HOGG FACES CHALLENGE TO DNC ROLE AS PARTY TENSIONS ESCALATE Lately, the causes and characters they champion include hulking men in girls’ sports and a Salvadorean national \"Maryland man\" with gang affiliations, whose wife filed abuse charges against him. Because nothing says \"we care about women\" quite like stuntman and sometime Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who has dishonored the memory of constituent Rachel Morin, a mother of five who was raped and murdered in his state by an illegal immigrant, but hightailed it toEl Salvadorto whine about \"due process\" for someone whose wife detailed multiple violent assaults. Van Hollen has been awkward, but not alone. Congressional Democrats like Ayanna Pressley, who have done nothing to prevent or punish anti-Semitism on college campuses, have glorified antisemitic protesters, visited them in ICE detention centers, and referred to them as \"political prisoners.\" Same with Teslas. Democrats want to force us all to drive electric vehicles, \"EVs,\" but not if Elon Musk’s company produced it. Those can be destroyed by arsonists. Democrats’ obsession with Trump continues. He’s persisting while they're resisting. Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is as incurable as it is insatiable. They are fighting the last war and poised to lose it again. They yell \"bipartisanship\" and vote as a pack. They talk too much and do too little. As President Trump transforms the GOP into the party of the worker, Democrats represent the elite and effete. With each passing week, the Democratic Party finds new ways to insult, neglect, and alienate Americans, who would prefer they get on board with border security, tax cuts, deregulation, energy independence, minerals deals, trade deals and peace deals. Democrats seem more focused on running for POTUS in 2028 than on helping the country in 2025. For four years they lied about the president’s acuity and ability. The least they can do for the next four years is lean into a president who is trying to fix what has been broken and tackle what’s been ignored. As President Trump reflects on promises kept in his first 100 days in office, here are 25 mind-numbing things Democrats did and said in 2025 (so far): CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KELLYANNE CONWAY Kellyanne Conway is a Fox News contributor.

    "title": "DAN GAINOR: Don’t dare say, ‘This is Sparta,’ and six other foolish stories from April",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the 'Gutfeld!' panel discuss Katy Perry reportedly regretting her space flight. Spring has sprung and April was a month marked byout-of-control judgesand a leftist writer from the Nation calling the U.S. Constitution, \"a piece of crap.\" On the upside, the wonderful people at Caterpillar celebrated their 100th anniversary. (Men love construction vehicles, so sue me.) We also saw a gaggle of famous women flying to near space in the Blue Origin spaceship. Don’t blame me that it became a fashion story. Actual New York Times headlines: \"Their Space Suit, Their Way\" and \"Lauren Sánchez teamed up with Monse to redesign the Blue Origin flight suits with its all-female launch in mind.\" There was lots more and, thanks to singer Katy Perry, that flight makes an added appearance below. You’d have to live off the grid to have never heard of the movie \"300\" or Gerard Butler’s famous scene where he kicks the Persian ambassador into a massive pit with a bombastic declaration, \"This is Sparta!\" (The pit didn’t have guardrails. Ancient Greece predates OSHA.) The somewhat historical hit meant that men were suddenly thinking of Rome and Greece. The 2006 film, \"300,\" starring Gerard Butler, is a fictional retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae in ancient Greece, where 300 Spartans battled the Persian army.(Warner Bros. Pictures/YouTube Screenshot) Apparently,that’s just too European.So, when a New York school was forced to ditch its Native American mascot, it chose the Spartans as a replacement, likely because students watched the film. The Islip Town NAACP president filed suit because that was all Greek to him. The complaint accused the school of picking a symbol of \"White supremacy\" and \"male misogynists.\" Lawyers and Karens are why so many teams have stupid mascot names now. BEWARE THE BULLDOZERS OF MARCH DIGGING UP THE MONTH’S 6 CRAZIEST STORIES Ex-Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenzwas interviewed by CNN \"MisinfoNation\" host Donie O’Sullivan and it’s hard to tell who did worse. Lorenz rationalized people who support Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. She went viral for this epic quote: \"Here’s this man who’s a revolutionary, who’s famous, who’s handsome, who’s young, who’s smart, he’s a person who seems like he’s this morally good man, which is hard to find.\" I almost expected her to start performing an updated version of the meme \"song,\" \"I’m looking for a man in finance…\" And O’Sullivan didn’t bat an eye, instead joking that, \"Yeah, I just realized women will literally date an assassin before they swipe right on me. That’s where we’re at.\" The press that treats every comment on the right like it’s the end times discussing an accused assassin like he’s a folk hero. Disgusting? Yes. Surprising? No. Jeff Bezos, the second-richest man on earth, likes his women spacey – literally. The billionaire owner of the Washington Post and Blue Origin sent his fiancée Lauren Sanchez and five other famous women into near space in a cool stunt thatKaty Perrydid her best to ruin. The singer had vowed to\"put the ‘a--’ in astronaut\"and she certainly managed that much. When she landed, she declared, \"I feel super connected to love,\" after kneeling and kissing the ground because she flew in a rocket for 11 minutes. KATY PERRY RIDICULED FOR SPACE COSTUME ON LIFETIMES TOUR FOLLOWING BLUE ORIGIN FLIGHT DEBACLE Her air-headedness generated bipartisan critique. The Atlantic headlined its slam, \"The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt.\" The Guardian’s Moira Donegan called it, \"the utter defeat of American feminism.\" Perry even got fast-food mockery. Ad Week wrote up how, \"Pop Crave announced that ‘Katy Perry has returned from space,’ Wendy’s replied: \"Can we send her back.\" Who knew Wendy’s was that spicey? Fans of the 1984 hit \"Ghostbusters,\" remember when Ray had to choose his \"form of the Destructor,\" he summoned the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. That’s because Ray said he was, \"something I loved from my childhood.\" Forty-one years later, kids still love marshmallows and, in that spirit, the fabulous folks in Royal Oak, Michigan, hold a marshmallow drop every year. For the kids. (I guarantee the parents enjoy this just as much.) Helicopters drop mountains of marshmallows, and the kids pick them up to trade them in for prize bags. The choppers rained down 15,000 marshmallows in all. Now, someone needs a giant cup of hot chocolate to go with it. Dan Aykroyd played Ray, who summoned the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in \"Ghostbusters.\"(Robin Platzer/Getty Images) Organizers of theannual concert fest Coachellawere allegedly \"blindsided\" when a band named after a violent act by the IRA (The Irish one, not your retirement.) took the side of Palestinian terrorists. The obscure Irish band Kneecap declared \"F--- Israel, Free Palestine\" in big bold letters during their set. According to the BBC, \"Their name is derived from so-called kneecapping - where young people are shot in the legs by paramilitaries in republican and loyalist communities in Northern Ireland.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Coachella incident caused people to do a little digging on the band. According to GBN from the U.K., \"Footage emerged earlier this week from a 2024 gig showing one band member apparently shouting ‘up Hamas, up Hezbollah’ while draped in the terror organisation's flag.\" I am shocked that gambling is going on in this casino. This month’s liberal outrage is thePETA peoplesuing for the First Amendment rights of monkeys. (I could write this whole column about PETA but that’s not good for my health.) PETA’s legal lunacy stems from their concern \"about macaques and their communications, including specific insight into Beamish, Sam Smith, Nick Nack, and Guinness.\" According to PETA, \"No lawsuit has ever tried to enforce the constitutional right to receive communications from animals who are undoubtedly willing speakers.\" Maybe someone could just show them a couple Dr. Doolittle movies and they’d go away. If not, maybe we can hire Nick Nack to run to Peta. It would probably be more rational. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Amid theleft’s anti-Tesla madness, the Washington Post ran this story: \"Clean energy exec, ex-federal worker charged with defacing Tesla vehicles.\" That’s right, Justin and Emily Fisher were charged with \"defacing private property, police said in a statement,\" according to the Post. But here’s the best part, \"Emily Fisher is listed in a biography posted on the website of the nonprofit Smart Electric Power Alliance as its chief strategy officer.\" Yep, a top exec for a smart power organization was accused of vandalizing Teslas, which are electric vehicles. If true, that’s hardly smart. The alliance represents some of the biggest names in energy. Her name isn’t on their website now, but she still lists the job on LinkedIn.

    "title": "Abrego Garcia: The poster child for the Left’s demands of endless ‘due process’",
    "article_text": "Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., says Democrats' defense of accused gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia is about \"freedom,\" adding that the situation is \"not going to end well\" for Trump because he is \"undermining\" due process. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy) During theBiden administration, the Left and its media allies tried to erase the line between legal and illegal aliens, calling all aliens \"noncitizens.\" Now they’re attempting to confuse the distinction between criminal and civil proceedings and rights regarding deportable aliens to stoke opposition to the Trump administration’s actions. In so doing, the Left is usingKilmar Abrego Garciaas their poster child to demand \"more due process.\" It’s time to correct this intended confusion and show just how much due process aliens receive. When an alien becomes deportable – either because they entered the U.S. illegally, overstayed their temporary visa, committed a crime, committed fraud, participated in terrorist activity, or other reasons – ICE charges the alien with ground(s) of deportability, which initiates removal proceedings with the Justice Department’s administrative immigration court system. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen speaks to Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.(Reuters) These are civil proceedings, not criminal. The administrativeimmigration judgesare Justice Department employees in the executive branch; they are not federal judges under the Article III Judiciary of the U.S. Constitution. MY DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. SEN. VAN HOLLEN'S EL SALVADOR VISIT WAS A SLAP IN THE FACE That means deportable aliens in deportation proceedings do not have the same rights as a person in a criminal trial, such as being innocent until proven guilty, the right to a taxpayer funded public defendant, etc. Removing a deportable alien is not a criminal sentence. Within the civil, immigration context, Congress, on behalf of the American people, has legislated scores of ways to temporarily and permanently come to the U.S. – lawfully. Foreigners abroad can apply for visas to visit, study, work or join family here in the U.S. If they are fleeing persecution, they can apply for refugee protection through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Once in the U.S., aliens can also apply to DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for asylum, work authorization, \"green cards\" (permanent immigrant visas), naturalization and more immigration benefits. What will surprise most Americans is thatdeportable aliensin immigration court proceedings have yet athirdopportunity to apply for immigration benefits. After an immigration judge finds the alien is deportable as charged (most deportable aliens concede their charges), the alien can request \"relief from deportation\" by applying for asylum or a green card with the judge. If granted, ICE’s request for removal is denied, the alien is given the immigration benefit and remains in the country. That is, unless the alien subsequently commits another deportable offense. Then, ICE can repeat the process. THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE COURTS MUST COME TO A COMMON SENSE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS Now consider Abrego Garcia’s case. He didn’t follow Congress’ \"due process\" by applying for a visa or refugee protection before coming to the U.S. Instead, he snuck across the border around 2011. He did not go to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to seek asylum within his first year in the U.S., an important and commonsense time-limitation Congress imposed to prevent asylum fraud. If you were really fleeing for your life, one would reasonably expect you would request protection soon after arriving here. But Garcia didn’t follow that due process either. Eight years later, he was arrested in aMaryland Home Depot parking lot, after police suspected suspicious activity by a small group of men and found discarded marijuana under a vehicle. The Gang Unit assisting at the scene filled out a Gang Field Interview Sheet and alleged that Abrego Garcia was an active member of the MS-13 gang. The police turned him over to ICE, which detained him, initiated deportation proceedings, and opposed his release on bond, arguing he was a danger to the community based on the gang report. An immigration judge denied bond in April 2019, citing the gang report as trustworthy evidence. IF WE CAN’T DEPORT ILLEGALS, HERE'S HOW WE CAN MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY Then, Garcia sought asylum and withholding of removal with an immigration judge as a defense from removal. He claimed he would be persecuted by another gang in El Salvador, Barrio 18. The immigration judge denied asylum because he violated the one-year time bar, but granted the more limited withholding of removal, released him from ICE custody, and issued a final order of removal to any country except \"Guatemala.\" This was the clerical error – the order should have read \"El Salvador.\" Despite that due process, Garcia continued to violate the law. In May 2021, his wife sought a temporary protective order against him in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Then, in December 2022, the Tennessee Highway Patrol stopped him for speeding and failing to maintain his lane. The officer suspected human trafficking due to eight other individuals in the SUV with no luggage, despite traveling from Houston to Maryland. The owner of the SUV was a confessed human smuggler. Garcia was released with a warning for an expired license after the FBI instructed that he be released. PresidentDonald Trumphas designated MS-13 a foreign terrorist organization. This negated Garcia’s limited protection from being removed to El Salvador under the Immigration and Nationality Act. And so, the Trump administration removed him to El Salvador. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Left demands Abrego Garcia be returned to the U.S. and receive his due process. Once again, they are being dishonest with the American public. They ignore the fact that Garcia didn’t follow the process due Americans to seek a visa or refugee protection to come here lawfully. Nor do they admit that he failed to request asylum soon after his illegal entry. And they fail to acknowledge that Garcia already received due process at his third opportunity. He is owed no more. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Abrego Garcia’s immigration case is not at all unique. Too many aliens ignore lawful processes to come to the U.S. or to follow it once here. Instead, they demand process if and when they are eventually caught by ICE. The fact that the Left has made thiscriminal gang membertheir poster child for due process has only opened more Americans’ eyes to the complete abuse of our immigration system.

Systrom said the tactics represent “a force that’s hurting us,” comparing them to those used by social media companies to expand aggressively. “You can see some of these companies going down the rabbit hole that all the consumer companies have gone down in trying to juice engagement,” hesaidat StartupGrind this week. “Every time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me.” The comments come amidcriticism of ChatGPT for being too nice to usersinstead of directly answering their questions. OpenAI hasapologized for the problemandblamed “short-term feedback” from usersfor it. Systrom suggested that chatbots being overly engaging is not a bug but an intentional feature designed for AI companies to show off metrics like time spent and daily active users. AI companies should be “laser-focused” on providing high-quality answers rather than moving metrics in the easiest way possible, he said. Systrom didn’t name any specific AI companies in his remarks. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In response, OpenAI pointed TechCrunchto its user specs, which state that its AI model “often does not have all of the information” to provide a good answer and may ask for “clarification or more details.” But unless questions are too vague or difficult to answer, the AI should “take a stab at fulfilling the request and tell the user that it could be more helpful with certain information,” the specs read.

Aurora plans to build up to “tens of self-driving trucks” and expand to El Paso and Phoenix by the end of 2025 as it continues to run more freight for customers with its fleet of supervised autonomous trucks.

The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization late last yearpushedfor governments to regulate the use of generative AI in education, including implementing age limits for users and guardrails on data protection and user privacy.

In atechnical reportpublished this week, Google reveals that its Gemini 2.5 Flash model is more likely to generate text that violates its safety guidelines than Gemini 2.0 Flash. On two metrics, “text-to-text safety” and “image-to-text safety,” Gemini 2.5 Flash regresses 4.1% and 9.6%, respectively. Text-to-text safety measures how frequently a model violates Google’s guidelines given a prompt, while image-to-text safety evaluates how closely the model adheres to these boundaries when prompted using an image. Both tests are automated, not human-supervised. In an emailed statement, a Google spokesperson confirmed that Gemini 2.5 Flash “performs worse on text-to-text and image-to-text safety.” These surprising benchmark results come as AI companies move to make their models more permissive — in other words, less likely to refuse to respond to controversial or sensitive subjects.For its latest crop of Llama models, Meta said it tuned the models not to endorse “some views over others” and to reply to more “debated” political prompts. OpenAI said earlier this year that it wouldtweak future modelsto not take an editorial stance and offer multiple perspectives on controversial topics. Sometimes, those permissiveness efforts have backfired.TechCrunch reported Mondaythat the default model powering OpenAI’s ChatGPT allowed minors to generate erotic conversations. OpenAI blamed the behavior on a “bug.” According to Google’s technical report, Gemini 2.5 Flash, which is still in preview, follows instructions more faithfully than Gemini 2.0 Flash, inclusive of instructions that cross problematic lines. The company claims that the regressions can be attributed partly to false positives, but it also admits that Gemini 2.5 Flash sometimes generates “violative content” when explicitly asked. “Naturally, there is tension between [instruction following] on sensitive topics and safety policy violations, which is reflected across our evaluations,” reads the report. Scores from SpeechMap, a benchmark that probes how models respond to sensitive and controversial prompts, also suggest that Gemini 2.5 Flash is far less likely to refuse to answer contentious questions than Gemini 2.0 Flash. TechCrunch’s testing of the model via AI platform OpenRouter found that it’ll uncomplainingly write essays in support of replacing human judges with AI, weakening due process protections in the U.S., and implementing widespread warrantless government surveillance programs. Thomas Woodside, co-founder of the Secure AI Project, said the limited details Google gave in its technical report demonstrates the need for more transparency in model testing. “There’s a trade-off between instruction-following and policy following, because some users may ask for content that would violate policies,” Woodside told TechCrunch. “In this case, Google’s latest Flash model complies with instructions more while also violating policies more. Google doesn’t provide much detail on the specific cases where policies were violated, although they say they are not severe. Without knowing more, it’s hard for independent analysts to know whether there’s a problem.” Google has come under fire for its model safety reporting practices before. It took the companyweeksto publish a technical report for its most capable model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. When the report eventually was published, it initiallyomitted key safety testing details. On Monday, Google released a more detailed report with additional safety information.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A security lapse at dating app Raw publicly exposed the personal data and private location data of its users, TechCrunch has found. The exposed data included users’ display names, dates of birth, dating and sexual preferences associated with the Raw app, as well as users’ locations. Some of the location data included coordinates that were specific enough to locate Raw app users with street-level accuracy. Raw, which launched in 2023, isa dating appthat claims to offer more genuine interactions with others in part by asking users to upload daily selfie photos. The company does not disclose how many users it has, but its app listing on the Google Play Store notes more than 500,000 Android downloads to date. News of the security lapse comes in the same week that the startup announced a hardware extension of its dating app, the Raw Ring, anunreleased wearable devicethat it claims will allow app users to track their partner’s heart rate and other sensor data to receive AI-generated insights, ostensibly to detect infidelity. Notwithstanding themoral and ethical issues of tracking romantic partnersandthe risks of emotional surveillance, Raw claims on its website and in its privacy policy that its app, and its unreleased device, both useend-to-end encryption, a security feature that prevents anyone other than the user — including the company — from accessing the data. When we tried the app this week, which included an analysis of the app’s network traffic, TechCrunch found no evidence that the app uses end-to-end encryption. Instead, we found that the app was publicly spilling data about its users to anyone with a web browser. Raw fixed the data exposure on Wednesday, shortly after TechCrunch contacted the company with details of the bug. “All previously exposed endpoints have been secured, and we’ve implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future,” Marina Anderson, the co-founder of Raw dating app, told TechCrunch by email. When asked by TechCrunch, Anderson confirmed that the company had not performed a third-party security audit of its app, adding that its “focus remains on building a high-quality product and engaging meaningfully with our growing community.” Anderson would not commit to proactively notifying affected users that their information was exposed, but said the company would “submit a detailed report to the relevant data protection authorities under applicable regulations.” It’s not immediately known how long the app was publicly spilling its users’ data. Anderson said that the company was still investigating the incident. Regarding its claim that the app uses end-to-end encryption, Anderson said Raw “uses encryption in transit and enforces access controls for sensitive data within our infrastructure. Further steps will be clear after thoroughly analyzing the situation.” Anderson would not say, when asked, whether the company plans to adjust its privacy policy, and Anderson did not respond to a follow-up email from TechCrunch. TechCrunch discovered the bug on Wednesday during a brief test of the app. As part of our test, we installed the Raw dating app on a virtualized Android device, which allows us to use the app without having to provide any real-world data, such as our physical location. We created a new user account with dummy data, such as a name and date of birth, and configured our virtual device’s location to appear as though we were at a museum in Mountain View, California. When the app requested our virtual device’s location, we allowed the app access to our precise location down to a few meters. We used a network traffic analysis tool to monitor and inspect the data flowing in and out of the Raw app, which allowed us to understand how the app works and what kinds of data the app was uploading about its users. TechCrunch discovered the data exposure within a few minutes of using the Raw app. When we first loaded the app, we found that it was pulling the user’s profile information directly from the company’s servers, but that the server was not protecting the returned data with any authentication. In practice, that meant anyone could access any other user’s private information by using a web browser to visit the web address of the exposed server —api.raw.app/users/followed by a unique 11-digit number corresponding to another app user. Changing the digits to correspond with any other user’s 11-digit identifier returned private information from that user’s profile, including their location data. This kind of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a type of bug that can allow someone to access or modify data on someone else’s server because of a lack of proper security checks on the user accessing the data. Aswe’ve explained before, IDOR bugs are akin to having a key to a private mailbox, for example, but that key can also unlock every other mailbox on that same street. As such, IDOR bugs can be exploited with ease and in some cases enumerated, allowing access to record after record of user data. U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA has long warned of the risks that IDOR bugs present, including the ability to access typically sensitive data “at scale.” As part of itsSecure by Designinitiative, CISA saidin a 2023 advisorythat developers should ensure their apps perform proper authentication and authorization checks. Since Raw fixed the bug, the exposed server no longer returns user data in the browser.

For startups specializing in industrial-scale hardware, which includes many climate tech companies, the problem is especially acute because the capital requirements are so large. Infrastructure funds have long filled that gap, but many have been hesitant to dive into climate tech. One firm thinks that spells opportunity, though.Ara Partnersrecently raised an $800 million infrastructure fund focused on reducing carbon emissions in industrial sectors, which historically have been hard to decarbonize. Ara had initially targeted $500 million, the firm told TechCrunch, but saw strong support from new and existing investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds from around the world. The new fund has already made three investments, including in an Ireland-based household organic waste recycler and a biofuels terminal developer. The fund’s decarbonization strategy focuses on repurposing existing assets for new low-carbon developments. This significant fundraise arrives at a time of political uncertainty over decarbonization in the U.S. but increasing clarity around its economics. Many companies have been able to drive down costs of low- and zero-carbon technologies in recent years, making them cost competitive with existing approaches. Ara, for example,previously invested in Divertthrough one of its private equity funds. The company donates food that’s still good and, for food that isn’t edible, turns the waste into biogas that can be sold or used to generate electricity and heat on-site. Compared with the alternative — sending the waste to a landfill where it generates methane pollution — Divert’s approach makes a lot of sense environmentally and financially.

Last weekend, after OpenAI rolled out a tweakedGPT-4o— the default model powering ChatGPT — users on social media noted that ChatGPT began responding in an overly validating and agreeable way. It quickly became a meme. Users posted screenshots of ChatGPT applauding all sorts of problematic,dangerousdecisionsandideas. In a post on X last Sunday, CEO Sam Altmanacknowledgedthe problem and said that OpenAI would work on fixes “ASAP.” On Tuesday, Altmanannouncedthe GPT-4o update was being rolled back and that OpenAI was working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. The company published apostmortemon Tuesday, and in a blog post Friday, OpenAI expanded on specific adjustments it plans to make to its model deployment process. OpenAI says it plans to introduce an opt-in “alpha phase” for some models that would allow certain ChatGPT users to test the models and give feedback prior to launch. The company also says it’ll include explanations of “known limitations” for future incremental updates to models in ChatGPT, and adjust its safety review process to formally consider “model behavior issues” like personality, deception, reliability, and hallucination (i.e., when a model makes things up) as “launch-blocking” concerns. “Going forward, we’ll proactively communicate about the updates we’re making to the models in ChatGPT, whether ‘subtle’ or not,” wrote OpenAI in the blog post. “Even if these issues aren’t perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.” we missed the mark with last week's GPT-4o update.what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future:https://t.co/ER1GmRYrIC The pledged fixes come as more people turn to ChatGPT for advice.According to one recent surveyby lawsuit financier Express Legal Funding, 60% of U.S. adults have used ChatGPT to seek counsel or information. The growing reliance on ChatGPT — and the platform’s enormous user base — raises the stakes when issues like extreme sycophancy emerge, not to mention hallucinations and other technical shortcomings. As one mitigating step, earlier this week, OpenAI said it would experiment with ways to let users give “real-time feedback” to “directly influence their interactions” with ChatGPT. The company also said it would refine techniques to steer models away from sycophancy, potentially allow people to choose from multiple model personalities in ChatGPT, build additional safety guardrails, and expand evaluations to help identify issues beyond sycophancy. “One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn’t see as much even a year ago,” continued OpenAI in its blog post. “At the time, this wasn’t a primary focus, but as AI and society have co-evolved, it’s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care. It’s now going to be a more meaningful part of our safety work.” Topics AI Editor Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

The approval comes days after aU.S. judge ordered Appleto stop charging commissions on purchases through iPhone apps. “In a victory for consumers, artists, creators, and authors, Apple has approved Spotify’s U.S. app update,” Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran said in a statement to TechCrunch. “After nearly a decade, this willfinallyallow us to freely show clear pricing information and links to purchase, fostering transparency and choice for U.S. consumers.” She continued. “We can now give consumers lower prices, more control, and easier access to the Spotify experience. There is more work to do, but today represents a significant milestone for developers and entrepreneurs everywhere who want to build and compete on a more level playing field. It’s the opening act of a new era, and we could not be more ready for the show.” The updated app, version 9.0.40, is rolling out now on the App Store. Spotify is now one of the first major apps to get a new update, opening up purchases. Spotify submitted the update to Apple yesterday, noting that it could tell customers about different subscription options and how much each one costs right within the iPhone app. Users will also be able to link out to purchase or change their Spotify subscription plan on the company’s website, where its transactions won’t be subject to Apple’s 30% service charge on in-app payments. Plus, Spotify said it would now be able to tell U.S. customers about promotional offers in the app. Apple said on Wednesday that it will comply with the court’s order but that it strongly disagrees with the decision and will appeal. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said on Wednesday that Apple violated an order to reform its App Store to allow developers to send customers to their websites to make purchases. According to the ruling, Apple not only failed to comply with the order but also did so willfully, with the intention of establishing new anticompetitive barriers.

Chesky said 50% of Airbnb’s U.S. users are already using the AI bot for customer service, adding that the company plans to roll out the feature to all its users in the country this month. “One thing I’ll say about AI [is that] it is definitely making the customer experience easier … It has already led to a 15% reduction in people needing to contact live human agents,” he noted during the analyst call. Last year, the company told TechCrunch that it wastesting the technology, but in a limited manner and only for certain queries. “I think there is a lot of potential for applying AI to the business. We think a lot about how AI is going to change the experience at the consumer layer over time,” Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk told TechCrunch at that time. Unlike companies likeOpenAI,Google,Perplexity, and theslew of startupsbuilding AI agents (AI tools that can perform tasks on a user’s behalf), Airbnb seems to be taking a more measured approach with AI.

This change comes aftera U.S. court ruled in favor of Epic Gamesin a case against the iPhone maker, ordering the latter not to prohibit apps from including features that couldredirect users to their own websites for making digital purchases. “The App Review Guidelines have been updated for compliance with a United States court decision regarding buttons, external links, and other calls to action in apps,” Applesaid in a blog post. The lawsuit that Epic Games brought in 2020 concerned the amount of control Apple had over transactions done in apps hosted on its App Store. In 2021, the game studio won an injunction that ordered Apple to give developers more options to redirect users to their own websites so they could avoid paying the tech giant a 30% cut. After its appeal against the injunction failed, Apple last year started allowing other apps tolink out and use non-Apple payment mechanisms, but it still took a 27% commission and added what critics called “scare screens.” This week’s ruling means Apple must stop showing these “scare screens,” and the company has already removed guidelines aroundhow these screens and links should contain certain language. We have asked Apple to confirm if it would stop charging apps a commission on payments made via external links, and we will update the story if we hear back. As for Apple, it’s not happy with the ruling. “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal,” the company said in a statement.

    "title": "Prince Harry tells BBC he wants reconciliation with royals but King will not speak to him",
    "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which he said he was \"devastated\" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK. Prince Harry said the King \"won't speak to me because of this security stuff\", but that he did not want to fight anymore and did \"not know how much longer my father has\". The prince spoke to BBC News in Californiaafter losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK. Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\" After Friday's court ruling, the prince said: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\" \"There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,\" he added, but had now \"forgiven\" them. \"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,\" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had \"always been the sticking point\". The prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States. Saying that he felt \"let down\", he described his court defeat as a \"good old fashioned establishment stitch up\" and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security. Asked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: \"I never asked him to intervene - I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\" The prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had \"uncovered my worst fears\". He said of the decision: \"I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\" He continued: \"I'm sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\" Prince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him \"every single day\", and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family - as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances. The prince said changes to his security status in 2020 had impacted not just him, but his wife and, later, his children too. He went on to say: \"Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020 and they hoped that me knowing that risk would force us to come back. \"But then when you realise that didn't work, do you not want to keep us safe? \"Whether you're the government, the Royal Household, whether you're my dad, my family - despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety?\" Asked whether he missed the UK, he added: \"I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done... and I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show my children my homeland.\" Prince Harry said he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Friday's ruling had \"proven that there was no way to win this through the courts\". \"I wish someone had told me that beforehand,\" he said, adding that the ruling had been a \"surprise\". He continued: \"This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute, and it makes me really, really sad that we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\" Prince Harry spoke to the BBC shortly afterlosing his latest legal challenge against the UK governmentover the level of security he and his family are entitled to when visiting. The Court of Appeal dismissed the prince's case, which hinged on how an official committee made the decision to remove his eligibility for automatic, full-scale protection in line with what other senior royals receive. On Friday, the court ruled that Prince Harry had made \"powerful\" arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, but said his \"sense of grievance\" did not \"translate into a legal argument\". His legal complaint centred around a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and was chaired at the time by Sir Richard Mottram. Under the committee's regulations, Prince Harry argued, his case should have been put before Ravec's Risk Management Board (RMB), which would have assessed the threats to his and family's security - but that did not happen. On Friday, senior judges said the committee had diverged from policy when making its 2020 decision over the prince's security, but concluded it had been \"sensible\" to do so because of the complexity of his circumstances. Prince Harry said his \"jaw hit the floor\" when he found out a representative of the Royal Household sat on the Ravec committee, and claimed Friday's ruling had proved its decision-making process was more influenced by the Royal Household than by legal constraints. He claimed there had been \"interference\" by the Royal Household in the 2020 decision, which he said resulted in his status as the most at-risk royal being downgraded to the least at risk \"overnight\". \"So one does question how that is even possible and also the motive behind that at the time,\" he added. Prince Harry called on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to intervene in his security case, and to overhaul how the Ravec committee operates. In a statement released later on Friday, the prince said he would write to Cooper to \"ask her to urgently examine the matter and review the Ravec process\".

    "title": "Harry's emotional avalanche hits the Royal Family",
    "article_text": "This BBC interview with Prince Harry will become one of those famous moments when television collides with the world of the royals. It was like an emotional avalanche. It began with some stones being kicked over with questions about security and then the interview turned into a spectacular release of what seemed to be a rolling mountain of pent-up frustration and a poignant sense of separation. The starting point was Prince Harry's defeat in the courts as he sought to overturn a downgrading of his security in the UK. He seemed wounded. Had he decided it was time to have his say? And then really say some more? A conversation about security was suddenly becoming about a whole range of insecurities. Prince Harry looked upset, it seemed a cry from the heart when he said that his father \"won't speak to me because of this security stuff\", even though he didn't know \"how much longer my father has\". This was a first-hand confirmation of the scale of the rift in the Royal Family. There was also the lack of contact between his children and their wider family in the UK. He was \"gutted\" and \"devastated\" and tired of only coming home for funerals and court cases. And like all family rows, there was a balancing act between wanting to air grievances, to throw emotional punches, and then still want to get back together and hug and make friends. So Prince Harry talked of the downgrading in his security in terms of this family dispute, suggesting that the Royal Household had influenced the decision, using security as leverage to keep him within the Royal Family. Then he talked with great frankness, sounding like a slightly homesick son stuck overseas, when he spoke about wanting reconciliation. \"There's no point continuing to fight any more. Life is precious,\" he said, holding out an olive branch the size of a small palace. The \"sticking point\" for reconciliation is security when he visits the UK, said Prince Harry. And as well as calling on his father the King to help resolve this, he also called on the prime minister and home secretary to intervene. At that point, it's worth stepping away from the drama and taking a cold draught of unemotive legal air, from the judge who ruled against Prince Harry on Friday afternoon. Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" did not add up to the same thing as a legal argument. He upheld the decision that security arrangements had been changed because Prince Harry's circumstances had changed, he was no longer a working royal and no longer living in the UK. It might have annoyed Prince Harry, but the courts had again rejected his claim about unfair treatment. There was also a response from Buckingham Palace that sounded like a weary parent. \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\" It wouldn't be right for the King to wade into issues being reviewed by the courts and considered by government departments, suggested the Palace. While Prince Harry wore his frustration on his sleeve in this interview, you have to wonder how the rest of his family will privately respond to this outburst, with this story ricocheting around the world, on billions of mobile phones and TV screens. These clips are going to be seen again and again. Netflix would have spun it out into a mini-series. VE Day 80 is coming up next week, with the Royal Family prominent at commemorations. But the public might still be thinking of Prince Harry's accusations about them. How will that work alongside messages of togetherness and unity? Like in all families, arguments can go back a long way. And Prince Harry's testimony was disarmingly candid, restlessly baring his feelings, and suggesting that his departure from the UK was still unresolved. He was looking back with some uncertainty at home, and the question now will be how people at home look back at him.

    "title": "'Unparalleled' snake antivenom made from man bitten 200 times",
    "article_text": "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists. Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by. But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 14,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability. In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits. He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube. But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma. \"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC. Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\". Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy. But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another. There is even wide variety within the same species – antivenom made from snakes in Indiais less effectiveagainst the same species in Sri Lanka. A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin. That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede. \"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said. \"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\" Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom. The research focused on elapids – one of the two families of venomous snakes – such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits. Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe. Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences. Their work,detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail. In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six. This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\". The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom. The other class of snake – the vipers – rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells. \"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University. And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples. \"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong. The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers. Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach. \"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\" But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people. But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\". \"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\" Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?

    "title": "Teaching union launches legal action against Ofsted",
    "article_text": "A school leaders' union says it is taking legal action against Ofsted over proposed changes to the way it inspects schools in England. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has asked for a judge to review plans for new school report cards, which are due to be introduced in the autumn after Ofsted got rid of its old one or two-word judgements. Its general secretary, Paul Whiteman, said the plans amounted to \"another crude grading system to hang over the heads of leaders\", and should be scrapped. Ofsted said supporting mental health was an important part of the proposals, and that the union's legal claims were \"plainly untenable\". The NAHT said it had issued a claim with the High Court for a judicial review on Saturday, as school leaders gathered for its national conference in Harrogate. The decision comes after the sister of head teacher Ruth Perry,who took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, called for the new system to be delayed. A letter signed by Prof Julia Waters with more than 30 others last week, including the general secretaries of four teaching unions, warned the changes would \"continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of education staff and hence on students' school experience\". On Friday, Mr Whiteman told NAHT members: \"Following Ruth's death, we were promised change. \"What we've been offered, if you scratch beneath the surface, is more of the same - another crude grading system to hang over the heads of leaders.\" Mr Whiteman said school leaders embraced accountability, but said it was \"utter nonsense\" that Ofsted's proposed model was the only viable way to assess schools. He called on Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver to \"scrap these proposals\" and \"think again\". A debate by NAHT representatives on the proposed changes was scheduled to take place on Saturday, the second day of the union's conference. Ofsted's report cards are set to assess key aspects of each school, including quality of education, behaviour and attendance, personal development, and leadership and management. There will be five possible grades for each area: A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said the new system will provide \"rich, granular insight\" to help deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools. Ofsted's consultation on the changes ended this week. An Ofsted spokesperson said: \"Supporting the mental health of those we inspect is an important part of the development of our proposals and we are already hearing positive feedback through our inspection tests. \"Our legal team have responded robustly to NAHT. Their suggested claims are plainly untenable. If legal action is launched, we will resist and seek costs.\" The temporary registration suspensions have been imposed by Ofsted on the Black Country nurseries. Kids Planet Day Nursery Apley is now rated as good by Ofsted. An open letter calls on the education secretary to delay proposed changes to Ofsted inspections. The system is changing after the death of head Ruth Perry highlighted the pressure of inspections. Nursery places can difficult to find, particularly in certain areas - so why have successive governments not yet found a solution?",

    "title": "Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC",
    "article_text": "Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted. Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data. After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers \"accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members\". Co-op had previously said that it had taken \"proactive measures\" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a \"small impact\" on its operations. It also assured the public that there was \"no evidence that customer data was compromised\". The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number. The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods. The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to \"treat cyber security as an absolute priority\". The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April. \"Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,\" the chat says. \"We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.\" They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago. The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm. Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business. It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide. The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday. On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff. The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls. DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees. They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers. The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents. The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company. Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market. \"This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,\" a spokesperson said. DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money. But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid. They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer. DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics. DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions. It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest. The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young – in some cases only teenagers. Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.

    "title": "Assisted deaths could top 4,000 in 10th year after law change",
    "article_text": "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says. The estimate forms part of the officialimpact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying. It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time. The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029. The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said. The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved – it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy. It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June. In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around £919,000 to £10.3m. This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need. By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from £5.84m to £59.6m. But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of £10m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over £11m. One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours. It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain. And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost £2,000 a day. Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties. The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\". Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment. She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\". But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\" A bill, which is at the earliest stage of the legislative process, is to be voted on by MSPs next month. An assisted dying debate hosted by Southampton Council of Faiths hears a range of views. Two MND patients hold opposing views on the assisted dying bill due to be debated again this week. Lisa Davenport admitted the manslaughter of her father Barrie Davenport, 88, in his retirement home. The Commissioner for Older People said it was a \"very divisive\" subject but opinions should be aired.",

    "title": "Seven things we have learnt so far from the results",
    "article_text": "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons. Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests: Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions. \"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\" That's not so much the vibe these days. Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least athaving lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever. Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace. It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though. Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening. \"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\" That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-testthe winter fuel allowanceand the more recent announcement that eligibility for thePersonal Independence Paymentwill be tightened. Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel. There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise. To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut. That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week. And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else – the argument goes. The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away. Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians. Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start. I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK. But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such asStaffordshireandLincolnshirefalling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are. Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10. The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\". There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment. Whoever is leader, a Conservative Party performing at this level is a Conservative Party in an existential crisis. It's hard to come up with the right superlatives for Nigel Farage's political achievement. Suffice to say the Reform surge evident in opinion polling has turned out to be real. Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019. Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt. Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility. When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed. Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer. The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory, which is essentially local politics catching up with what happened at the general election last July. In Devon they gained 18 council seats, mostly at the Conservatives' expense, to become the largest party, and have won control of Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Cambridgeshire. They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share. The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come secondin the West of England mayoral contestwill sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections. Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too. If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change. It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government. The task facing each opposition party in their different ways is to stop him doing so and convince voters that they have the best shot of improving their lives. The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable. Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again. As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose? It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister. The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.

    "title": "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
    "article_text": "\"We are losing to everyone, everywhere.\" That could be a quote from a Conservative, as the previous party of government struggles to rebuild trust with the electorate. But it isn't. It's a despairing message from a new Labour MP, elected in last year's general election landslide. Labour had a terrible night when many of the county council seats up for grabs in Thursday's English local elections were last contested in 2021. So far, today's results are even worse. Labour should have been within shouting distance of regaining control of Durham -but their vote tumbled. Before the result was announced, a former Labour MP texted to say - in colourful language – just how grim the political landscape was in the North East. And where voters were determined to oust the Conservatives in Staffordshire, they turned to Reform UK not Labour to do so. This has prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to change direction. The Labour Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones - who had her majority slashed - blamed the withdrawal of winter fuel allowance from most pensioners, and urged a rethink on the forthcoming cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) fordisabled people. Labour MP Richard Burgon – a shadow minister under Sir Keir's left wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn – agreed. He said the current party leadership needed to \"change course\" and suggested that these policies were \"driving away our own voters, and letting Reform squeeze through.\" The Labour leadership won't be quaking in its boots when attacked by the Left. But what is noteworthy is that - off the record  - some MPs from across the party are making not dissimilar points, and have been contacting the BBC (and not vice versa) to make them. One of the new intake of Labour MPs told me \"this is not a verdict on our failure to deliver. \"It is a verdict on what we have delivered. People on the doorsteps are using the word 'betrayal.' \"It's winter fuel. It's fear of Pips, it's a bit of immigration.\" \"People voted for change – voted for Labour – but the government isn't looking Labour enough, and people are asking 'what's the point?'\". Another new MP - very much not on the left of the party - described the withdrawal of winter fuel payments as \"Labour's poll tax\". And a longer-standing Labour politician said to me it was \"more to do with uninspiring leadership\". \"And it turns out that cutting disability and winter fuel payments comes at a cost – these are not Labour things to do,\" they added. Another said that fellow backbenchers tend to panic close to general election time if their party is behind in the polls but \"we are panicking in less than a year\". A defeated Labour councillor from Lancashire, Matthew Tomlinson, described himself as \"an extremely loyal Labour Party supporter\". But he told the BBC when certain policies were taken together – and he included national insurance increases for employers and the lack of compensation for some women pensioners to the welfare cuts -  \"it feels like a Labour Party that just isn't Labour enough.\" I have also had reports of difficulties in motivating activists and a dearth of Labour door-knockers in some areas. So what changes do some of Keir Starmer's MPs wish to see? Well, one former frontbencher predicted a \"bloody battle\" over the disability benefit cuts when MPs vote in a month or so. It doesn't look like the government will back down on that issue. But I have been told some potential rebels are being assured that they won't lose the party whip if they abstain – or make themselves scarce – when the vote comes. Some are calling for a bigger rethink, with more focus on social issues and less on adjusting policies to meet economic forecasts. And there are calls for Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"fiscal rules\"-  which restrict debt levels but also constrain investment – to be loosened. The Treasury has already rejected this – arguing that it would lead to higher interest rates and therefore mortgages. The 40 MPs in Labour's Red Wall group want to see a tougher line on immigration but also more investment in \"left behind\" areas in the Midlands and North of England. That has prompted demands for the shredding of the \"Green Book\" – the Treasury bible used to assess the costs and benefits of new projects. The belief is that this document tends to emphasise the cost and downplay the benefits. Jo White from Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who represents a group of backbenchers from 'Red Wall' areas in England, said the voices of \"people from the outside\" hadn't been listened to. She also called for schools and hospitals to be \"lifted from the shackles of debt\" so the party could deliver on its priorities. One Red Wall MP has suggested that if the chancellor won't contemplate a \"reset\" then she should be reshuffled, \"otherwise she'll bring Starmer down with her\". The prime minister said today that he \"gets\" the message of the election results – to go forward faster with his plan for change. I haven't got any sense that this involves a further change of direction. The party has already cut overseas aid to fund an increase in defence spending. This might have been expected to appeal to Reform-minded voters,  but the election results don't tend to suggest that it has worked. An array of announcements and initiatives are on the way – an immigration white paper in a matter of weeks; a long-awaited industrial strategy; the outcome a defence review; more on workers' rights; one or more trade deals. Labour will seek to get on the front foot. But much is either outside the government's control or is difficult to control, such as a stubbornly stagnant economy and an international trade war. Ministers point to progress on a number of fronts, from rising wages to falling NHS waiting lists. Yet the election results were an expression of voters' \"first impressions\" of Labour back in power. Some of its MPs worry that it will be difficult to change the negative prism through which the government is viewed.

    "title": "Sir John Curtice: Reform's sweeping election wins shake Tory and Labour dominance",
    "article_text": "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections. Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests. Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire. The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote. The party seemed able across the country to tap into voters' widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and Labour. In the BBC's projection of what would have happened if a nationwide election had been held on Thursday, Reform were credited with 30% of the vote. That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first. Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014. For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire. In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low. Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats. Before Thursday, commentators were asking whether the local elections would herald the end of Conservative and Labour's joint dominance of British politics. We certainly cannot rule out the possibility that this proves to be the case.

    "title": "Six key moments from Prince Harry's BBC interview",
    "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex has spoken exclusively to the BBC about his prospects of returning to the UK, relationship with his family and anger at losing his right to automatic full security protection when visiting from the US. He made the comments afterlosing his latest legal challenge against the governmentover his security - a decision which he says has left him vulnerable to threats on his life. Here are six key moments from his interview with the BBC's Nada Tawfik in California. Any prospect of a return to the UK for Prince Harry, Meghan and their children - Archie, five, and Lilibet, three - is \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, the royal told the BBC. Prince Harry, who relocated to the US in 2020, said he \"can't see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point\". \"The things that they're going to miss is, well, everything,\" he continued. He told the BBC: \"I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done... \"So I miss the UK, I miss parts of the UK, of course I do - and I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show my children my homeland.\" Prince Harry said there had been \"so many disagreements\" in the family, but the \"only thing that's left\" is the row over his security - which he said had \"always been the sticking point\". \"There is no point in continuing to fight anymore, life is precious,\" he added. Prince Harry also touched on the health of King Charles. The 76-year-old is undergoing treatment for cancer. The prince said: \"I don't know how much longer my father has - he won't speak to me because of this security stuff but it would be nice to reconcile.\" He added \"some members of my family will never forgive me\" for writing his memoir Spare, and went on to say: \"It would be nice to have that reconciliation part now. \"If they don't want that, that's entirely up to them.\" Prince Harry claimed that the downgrading of his security arrangements in 2020 was used as \"leverage\" over him after his decision to step down from front line royal duties and move to the US. He said the court's decision this week, which said the way his security was removed was lawful, had \"set a new precedent that security can be used to control\", and would \"imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life\". Prince Harry said he had only been to the UK for funerals or court hearings since 2020, plus some charity engagements, claiming that he only receives full protection if he is visiting on official business. \"I can only come to the UK safely if I'm invited... there is a lot of control and ability in my father's hands,\" he added. Asked if he wanted the King to take steps to guarantee his security, he said: \"I've never asked him to intervene - I've asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their job.\" He suggested the withdrawal of security had been an attempt to prevent him and Meghan leaving the royal fold, saying: \"This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute. \"And it makes me really, really sad that we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\" The prince said that, regardless of whether he is carrying out royal duties, the security risks he face remain the same - and have gotten worse in recent years. Prince Harry said: \"My status hasn't changed. It can't change. I am who I am. \"I am part of what I'm part of, and I can never escape that. My circumstances will always be the same.\" Harry also said: \"I've given 35 years of service to this country, two tours of Afghanistan. \"I was born into these risks, they've only increased over time.\" Prince Harry railed against the committee responsible for keeping senior royals safe, the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec). Ravec, which takes decision on behalf of the government, decided the prince would not automatically receive comprehensive security when in the UK as he stepped back from royal duties in 2020. The committee's then-chair Sir Richard Mottram made that decision without carrying out a full review into threats Prince Harry faced at the time - but the Court of Appeal concluded he had done so for \"sensible\" reasons, and that a review would not have changed the outcome. Prince Harry said his \"jaw hit the floor\" when he learned a representative of the Royal Household sits on the Ravec committee, and claimed that allowed it to exercise influence over what security members of the Royal Family get. Prince Harry claimed Sir Richard \"abandoned\" a full review of his security arrangements after speaking to the Royal Household. The prince also said: \"I have had it described to me, once people knew about the facts, that this is a good old fashioned establishment stitch up - and that's what it feels like.\" Prince Harry confirmed he would not be taking his legal challenge against the government to the Supreme Court, the only option left to him after Friday's ruling. He said the decision had \"proven that there was no way to win this through the courts\", adding: \"I don't want any battles to continue. \"There is way too much suffering and way too much conflict in the world.\" However, he did call on the government to directly intervene in how decisions are made by Ravec, which he said was \"not constrained by law\". He said: \"I'd ask the prime minister to step in. I would ask Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, to look at this very, very carefully. \"And I would ask her to review Ravec and its members... because if it is an expert body, then what is the royal household's role there if it isn't to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?\" Commenting after the BBC interview, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\" The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family. The Duke of Sussex says the downgrading of taxpayer-funded protection makes visiting the UK too risky. The Duke of Sussex launched a challenge in the Court of Appeal over a dispute with the government about his security. They told the BBC they want to ensure \"no more kids are lost to social media\" in unveiling a memorial. The Duke of Sussex visits an orthopaedic clinic in the western city of Lviv.",

In a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: \"In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.\" That means back to \"pen and paper\", he said. Greencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas. \"They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,\" said Mr Philips. \"There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well. \"With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.\" George, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been \"a nightmare\". \"We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct. \"Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).\" Jeannette Pellen, 76, in Doncaster who retired from her role as an M&S customer assistant in a Scunthorpe store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack. \"There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,\" she told the BBC. M&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual. As a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under. \"They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are. \"I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.\" Greencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support. M&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores. One food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items. \"The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.\" But he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well. Ged Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions. \"If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.\" But the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases. The company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer. The chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was \"imperative\" to understand what had happened. One person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple. \"Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.\" M&S has been contacted for comment. Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell The firm previously said there was \"no evidence that customer data was compromised\". The pricing error allowed some shoppers to get pasta sauce, coffee and cookies for free. The boss of the retailer says he is \"really sorry\" for the disruption which caused it to pause its online operations. The regulator is considering a range of measures to limit vets bills including price caps. Experts say the instruction suggests the company fears hackers could be lurking on calls.",

    "title": "Has the UK become a nation of runners?",
    "article_text": "More than 56,000 people finished the London Marathon last Sunday A record number of people have applied to take part in the 2026 London Marathon. Event organisers said more than 1.1 million applications had been received, smashing the previous record of 840,318 set by last year's ballot. Last Sunday, more than 90,000 people took on 26.2 miles across both London and Manchester marathons - the largest day of marathon running ever to take place in the UK. So, is the UK experiencing a running boom? And, if so, why and who is driving it? Events like Friday Night Lights are sold with the promise of attending \"the UK's healthiest night out\" When you dig into what's happening, some aspects really stand out: The increase in runners is driven by women. The UK's most popular distance is 10km, and events are widespread across the country. Parkrun has grown to 450,000 participants per week. Run clubs have popped up around the country as younger generations focus on fitness and shun traditional drinking cultures. And as for the truly dedicated, more than 2,000 people - up from 97 a decade ago - have now completed a sweep of six prestigious marathons. But let's start with that female boom. Believe it or not, until 1975 women in Britain were banned from competing in running road races longer than 6km, with female runners making up just 4% of the 7,000-strong field at the inaugural London Marathon. In this year's edition, 45% of the 56,640 participants were women - and women made up 49.55% of UK applications for the 2026 ballot. Molly Slater-Davison set up women-only run club These Girls Run in 2021, driven by her own struggle to find a welcoming local club and some negative running experiences including catcalling and being followed. Operating under the slogan \"safe, sweaty and supportive\", These Girls Run has seen much of its growth through social media and now has record attendance numbers at all nine of its locations across the UK. \"It's that social effect - 'if my friend's doing it, then I can',\" said Slater-Davison. \"People starting to do 5km and sharing it on social media, then sharing their journey to a longer distance run has really helped women to feel like, 'oh, this is something that I can do'. \"For a lot of women, you do PE at school and you usually have a terrible time, then you go through puberty and you don't really exercise. There's lots of research that shows us women and girls drop out of sport at an early age and then don't pick it back up again. Whereas with running, if you're with a group of women, it can just feel much more friendly, safe and supportive.\" A key reason for the surge in running is the increased number of events on offer, with more people than ever taking part in them. Parkrun has played a huge role in turning us into a nation of runners. Twenty-one years ago, it launched its first run with just 13 runners and five volunteers at London's Bushy Park. Now, there are more than 2,500 events globally with an average of 450,000 participants every week. The appeal of Parkrun is the emphasis on participation - everyone is equal, whether you walk or run. As more people take part, the average finish time continues to slow. Last month it was 33 minutes, compared with 22 minutes in 2005 - something organisers say they are \"really proud of\". But away from a 5km in your local park, the number of applicants for the London Marathon suggests we are particularly enthusiastic about endurance. According to England Athletics, the most popular running distance is 10km, closely followed by half marathons, then ultramarathons - defined as any distance beyond the traditional 26.2 miles. The number of registered grassroots athletics clubs is also at an all-time high, with England Athletics telling BBC Sport the grassroots athletics scene is \"flourishing\" and \"stronger than ever\". At the marathon distance, the chance to earn the covetedSix Star Medalawarded to runners who complete all six of the world marathon majors - Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York City - has exploded in demand over the past 10 years. In 2015, there were just 97 Six Star finishers from the UK. After last week's London Marathon, there were 2,023. But don't worry if pavement-pounding is not your thing - there really is a race for everyone somewhere in the world. You could join a Santa run on the Isle of Skye, race horses or even a train in Wales, or carry 50kg of coal on your back uphill in Yorkshire. Or, if you like the finer things in life, how does traversing 26.2 miles through Bordeaux's vineyards in fancy dress, sampling wine and cheese at each fuelling station, sound? The benefits of running are well documented, for both physical fitness and mental health. Many people turned to running during the pandemic as a way to stay active, but five years on the trend has stuck around, in turn becoming more of a lifestyle than a sport. The younger generations are embracing that lifestyle more than anyone else. Gen Z and millennials are increasingly trading late alcohol-fuelled nights for early-morning endorphin highs to take part in run clubs and earn virtual kudos on fitness apps like Strava. Friday Night Lights stage 5km and 10km events in cities across the country for tens of thousands of people, sold with the promise of attending \"the UK's healthiest night out\". Such is the demand among 18-34 year olds for running that London Marathon Events has recently invested in the concept. \"The growth has been rapid and proof that people are crying out for something social that doesn't wreck their weekend with crippling hangovers,\" Friday Night Lights founder Charlie A told BBC Sport. \"We're not about running fast, far or doing reps. We're just running for the sake of it. Running to have fun. Running to make friends. Running to enjoy some loud music.\" Running hasn't always been popular. It wasn't until the mid-late 1970s when a jogging boom took off across the UK. Inspired by trends in the United States, there was a surge in interest in road running as a leisure activity and way of keeping fit and healthy. An estimated one million people now consider themselves to be runners, taking part in new events from fun runs to marathons. This growth is underlined by the London Marathon ballot today. In the first London Marathon in 1981 just over 7,000 people took part. Fast-forward four decades and more than one million people have entered the 2026 London Marathon ballot alone. The growth in demand reflects the nationwide trend for being active. As a society, we are generally moving more now than ever before. According to last month's Sport England Active Lives survey, the number of people playing sport and taking part in physical activity between November 2023 and November 2024 in England was at the highest level on record. And while the number of adults who run is under the pre-pandemic peak of seven million, according to Sport England, it has grown 350,000 year on year to six and a half million. This suggests that, while the overall number is not as high as it has been, many of those who run do with more fervour than before, given the growth in the participation at events. Elite runner Phily Bowden, who was the third British female home in last Sunday's London Marathon elite race, said: \"I like to say I was there before it was cool. \"It's definitely growing. \"When you first start running, if you're not fit and you don't do any cardio, it is hard and it's not necessarily going to be super fun for the first six to eight weeks. \"But once you get a level of fitness and you can actually just go outside and enjoy a run or enjoy a session, it's the best thing. So I love that other people have tapped into that and discovered that.\" So is just a fad or will it stick around? Bowden, who has her sights set on another marathon major this year, thinks it's here to stay. \"We've all seen how running can help our mental health and how it can be a really great part of our routine. So I hope as long as the memories of that live on, the running stays. \"I think now that the running clubs are bigger, there are more people doing it and there are more people sharing on social media, hopefully that's enough to keep that trend going.\"",

    "title": "Military parade to honour US Army will fall on Trump's birthday",
    "article_text": "The White House has confirmed a military parade will be held to mark the US Army's 250th anniversary on 14 June, which falls on the same day as President Donald Trump's birthday. A \"day-long festival\" will be held on the National Mall in Washington DC, an army spokesperson said, adding that the event would feature 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles and 50 aircraft. Trump first floated a military parade during his first term, but he scrapped the ideaafter reports it would have cost about $90 million (£71m). Earlier on Friday, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day - known as Remembrance Day in the UK - as \"Victory Day for World War I\" to celebrate American contributions to the conflict. The army said planning for the military parade was \"actively underway\", and it was exploring \"options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.\" Trump turns 79 that day. He first proposed a military parade for Veterans Day in 2018. He said he wanted the US to \"top\" France's Bastille Day parade,which he attended on a visit to Paris in 2017. Local politicians asked for a \"ridiculously high\" price, he said, and the idea was abandoned. Meanwhile, in addition to renaming Veterans Day, Trump has said he wants to name VE Day on 8 May as \"Victory Day for World War II\". The announcement was not accompanied by an executive order, and it is unclear whether he intends for 8 May to become a federal holiday - a power that rests with the US Congress. The days mark the end of World War I in 1918 and Germany's surrender to the allies in 1945, respectively. In his late-night post, Trump said that \"many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other country, by far, in producing a victorious result\" in the Second World War. \"We won both wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,\" he added. \"That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! So we are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" Later on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to deny reports the name of Veterans Day would be changing, writing on X: \"We will always honor Veterans Day AND we should commemorate the end of WWI and WWII as VICTORY DAYS!\" VE Day celebrations being held in the UK, France, Canada and other parts of the world this year mark 80 years since World War Two formally ended in Europe with Germany's unconditional surrender shortly after Berlin fell to Soviet forces. Russia commemorates the occasion as the end of what it calls the \"Great Patriotic War\". It is one of the most important holidays in the country and is marked by a massive parade. About 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, which started in 1939 when Germany, alongside the Soviets, invaded Poland. According to statistics published online by the US National WWII Museum in New Orleans, about 418,500 Americans were killed in both the European and Pacific theatres of the conflict. Of the total, about 416,000 were military casualties. The US has not historically recognised VE Day. The country was still at war with Japan on the Pacific front for several more months after conflict ended in Europe. Veterans Day, known as Remembrance Day in the UK, was formerly known as Armistice Day in the US to mark the end of fighting in Europe on 11 November 1918. After World War Two and the Korean War, it was renamed to honour all US military veterans. Memorial Day, which always falls on the last Monday in May, honours Americans who were killed in battle.

    "title": "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed until May 2026",
    "article_text": "Grand Theft Auto 6 - one of the most eagerly awaited releases of all time - has been delayed until May 2026. The sequel in developer Rockstar Games' record-breaking video game series was due to be released on consoles later this year. But it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\". The previous game in the series, GTA 5, is the second-best selling video game of all time and remains extremely popular thanks to its online mode. Little official information on GTA 6 has emerged since a trailer for the game was released in December 2023, quickly reaching over 100m views. The 90-second clip revealed two main protagonists, and a glimpse of the game's fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida. In its statement, Rockstar said the \"interest and excitement\" in the game had been \"truly humbling for our entire team\". The company is known for its long development cycles and the 12-year gap since GTA 5's release has sparked a wave of jokes and memes online. It also has a track record of delaying major releases, such as 2018's Red Dead Redemption 2 - the studio's last big new game. But Rockstar is also known for its perfectionist approach and Straus Zelnick, CEO of parent company Take Two Interactive, previously said each new game from the developer \"needs to be something you've never seen before\". News of the delay has landed hard with fans such as Dienne Kawende, 27. \"I'm absolutely furious right now,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"There's fire flowing through my body right now.\" GTA 6 will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox at launch, meaning owners of older consoles will need to upgrade to play it. Sony and Microsoft recently announced price increases for both machines. \"This year, I literally got a job just to save up to get a Playstation 5,\" says Dienne. \"It's all ruined now.\" Although he praises Rockstar for making \"amazing\" and complex games, the 12-year wait is getting too much for him. \"I'm getting really impatient at this point,\" he says. \"When GTA 5 came out, I was in school. I was a teenager. I might start having kids soon. \"I might not even have time to play GTA 6 when it comes out.\" GTA 6 is expected to break sales records when it is released, possibly surpassing its predecessor, thehighest-grossing video game launch of all time. The global video games industry has been hit by waves of studio closures and layoffs over the past two years. It was hoped that a new Rockstar release might inspire more people to buy a new console, ordrive interest in gaming more widely. However, it does mean that other publishers who might have been holding off on announcing new games out of fear of clashing with GTA 6 might now look to release theirs before the end of this year.

    "title": "'I've shown I can still play here' - is De Bruyne leaving too soon?",
    "article_text": "Kevin de Bruyne became the first player since Lionel Messi to register 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola As the White Stripes hit Seven Nation Army pumped out over the Etihad Stadium speakers at full-time on Friday night, Manchester City supporters sang the name of hero Kevin de Bruyne to that very tune. The midfielder is bidding an emotional farewell after 10 trophy-laden years at the club, and the Belgian soaked up the acclaim by taking the long route around the pitch before heading down the tunnel. The 33-year-old will be disappearing for good when his City contract expires in the summer, but here he was able to enjoy another deserved moment in the limelight -  his penultimate game at the Etihad. De Bruyne struck the only goal in the 1-0 Premier League victory against in-form Wolves, which may ensure City play Champions League football next season. The midfielder saidlast monthhe was surprised not to be offered a new contract - and wanted to make a point about his abilities after the game. \"I don't know about the future unfortunately,\" a serious-looking De Bruyne told Sky Sports. \"I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don't do what I do these last four or five weeks. \"A lot of team-mates have spoken to me, they are sad also that I have to go. It goes like this in life, but the way I am performing is the way I should be. \"I just try to play as well as I can. I have one game left here. I try to do my job as always and I did that. I am proud of what I am doing.\" De Bruyne gives Man City win against Wolves to move third 'One of the greatest' - De Bruyne to leave Man City De Bruyne will undoubtedly go down as one of the Premier League's best midfielders when he departs in the summer. The former Chelsea and Wolfsburg player has stacked his trophy cabinet by winning all there is to win at City - an impressive haul of 16 trophies. A succession of injuries have taken their toll, and De Bruyne's influence on the pitch appears to be waning by not being the pass-master of old. But he showed a glimpse of what he is still capable off by converting a cool, first-time finish from Jeremy Doku's cross. The skipper was afforded a standing ovation when he was replaced by Phil Foden with six minutes to go, and was given a pat on the head by Guardiola after coming off. \"Just thank you,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers, and today the goal again. \"I am happy that it is finishing that way, and we have one more game in the Etihad. \"I want the best for Kevin so it cannot be possible to have done these many years without him. He has been an incredible player - but the situation is what it is. \"It's almost impossible to replace this kind of player. It is not just the performance, it is what he means to the heart for our fans for many, many years. The success we have belongs to the players.\" Guardiola added: \"I am pretty sure it is not easy for him but the goal was massively important for us - it lifted our spirits. \"He does not have to prove anything. I know his quality, his level.\" De Bruyne's final home game will come against Bournemouth on 20 May, with away matches to play at Southampton and Fulham. And he can ensure a dream ending if City beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley. \"Maybe he is still good enough to play here,\" said former Manchester City defender Micah Richards. \"Maybe he hasn't the press, but quality - he believes he can still play at the top level. He has said he is playing injury-free now. \"Age catches up though with you, and your body can't do what you want to do. But he keeps the ball and his football intelligence is still there. He is telling the club 'I can still play at this level'. \"I am talking as a fan, and I am a fan of KDB. Something in me just says 'one more year' - he can still do it. Maybe it is just a business decision.\" Does Richards have a point? De Bruyne has scored 30 Premier League goals since turning 30 years old, with Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure the only players to score more for City with 41 apiece. He became the first player since the great Lionel Messi to register 250 goal involvements under Guardiola, with 92 goals and 158 assists in nine seasons. Meanwhile, Wolves will be glad to see the back of De Bruyne as the midfielder has now scored six goals and provided five assists in 11 league games against them. But over the past two seasons, the Belgian has made just 43 Premier League appearances because of a series of injuries. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said De Bruyne is still \"levels above the elite players in the world\", adding: \"He doesn't think he has finished at the top level. \"He still thinks he can play at the top level of European football. I thought maybe he would go to Saudi Arabia or America, but after hearing him speak, it sounds like he isn't ready for that. \"He is one of the highest-paid players in world football and has been injured a lot. It has been hard to justify giving him a new deal from a business point of view. He is still a star player but he is not going to play every week. \"Let's talk about the statue - for me he is Manchester City's greatest ever player.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Rookie Antonelli, 18, youngest to take F1 pole",
    "article_text": "Kimi Antonelli passed his driving test earlier this year Miami Grand Prix Venue:Miami International AutodromeDates:2-4 MayRace start:21:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Live commentary of sprint race and qualifying online; race on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00 BST and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to take a Formula 1 pole position in the sprint event at the Miami Grand Prix. The 18-year-old beat McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the championship leader, by 0.045 seconds. The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate. Antonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie. It was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year. 'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell Antonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton How to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC Antonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend. But at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying. \"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it. \"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\" Antonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly. \"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added. \"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\" Starting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1. This video can not be played Five things to watch at Miami Grand Prix Antonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth. Piastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole. Norris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there. \"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\" Antonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap. The idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second. But it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri. Verstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\" His lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance. Verstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\" Russell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive. \"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\" Hamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate. Neither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed. Keep working on it.\" Williams' Alex Albon, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completed the top 10, only the second time the two-time champion's team has made it that high up this season, after team-mate Lance Stroll achieved it in the sprint in China. Albon's team-mate Carlos Sainz should also have been in the top 10 but he made a mistake on his final lap in the second session and will line up 15th. Verstappen's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session and will start the sprint 18th. The Japanese complained of being held up by a car coming out of the pits on his first lap, and he did not get around his warm-up lap in time to complete a second run. Fernando Alonso was among those to congratulate Max Verstappen on the birth of his daughter Lily The youngest driver to take pole position for a full grand prix is Sebastian Vettel, at the 2008 Italian GP at Monza when he was 21 years and two months old McLaren's Piastri fastest in Miami practice 'It's so bad' - who has got their Miami GP livery right?

Zhao, 28, becomes only the second player from Asia to reach a Crucible final, nine years after his Chinese compatriot Ding Junhui was runner-up to Mark Selby in 2016. Leading 12-4, Zhao compiled breaks of 62 and 128 to dash any hopes O'Sullivan had of building some momentum after taking the first two frames of Friday's evening session. While O'Sullivan, who is level on seven Crucible crowns in the modern era with Stephen Hendry, took the first frame after the mid-session interval, Zhao exhibited an incredible temperament to round off the match. In front of a crowd overwhelmingly urging 49-year-old O'Sullivan to take the contest into Saturday, Zhao compiled breaks of 85, 63 and 88 to seal the most famous victory of his career. \"I can't believe that. I need to say thank you to Ronnie because he has helped me a lot before. He's my idol,\" Zhao told BBC Sport. \"It's my first time playing on the single table here, it's an amazing time for me and I just want to enjoy it because I don't know how many times I can try to enjoy it here. \"I've played here and sometimes the crowd is helpful for Ronnie and he deserves that, he is a legend here so I needed to control myself.\" Zhao's scintillating showing on Friday morning laid the platform when he became only the fourth player to win a session 8-0 against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. It was reminiscent of the form he displayed on his way to the UK title in 2021 and he was able to maintain that later in the day to become only the second player since John Parrott in 1994 to defeat O'Sullivan with a session to spare at snooker's most famous venue. O'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking events, has made no secret about struggling with his cue since snapping his old one at the Championship League in January. He turned up for his first-round match against Ali Carter with two cues from different manufacturers and has been constantly tinkering ever since. That included two mid-match changes to his tip against Zhao and switching his ferrule from titanium to brass. However, it did not have the desired impact as he missed a series of regulation pots against an opponent who punished him in ruthless fashion. \"I just felt like I never gave him a game so that's a bit disappointing,\" said O'Sullivan. \"Zhao deserved his victory. I think he's done brilliantly all tournament and all credit to Zhao. He played better than me.\" Ronnie O'Sullivan has only lost one other match at the Crucible before the scheduled final session In the afternoon session in Sheffield, Judd Trump looked set to establish a big lead when he pulled 7-3 ahead of Mark Williams, but the veteran Welshman reined in the 2019 champion to leave the pair at 8-8 overnight. Trump, whose glory run six years ago gave him his only Crucible crown to date, extended his overnight lead from 5-3 by taking the opening two frames. But Welshman Williams, 50, who is aiming to become the oldest ever Crucible finalist, rallied to take five of the next six frames on offer. Just as in their keenly-contested 2022 semi-final, which Trump edged 17-16, the tension was palpable. It was underlined by Williams uncharacteristically hitting his own cue in frustration when he thought he had given up the opportunity to win the 15th frame, in which he eventually triumphed before rounding off the session with a composed 96. \"Absolute carnage. Amazing snooker,\" said six-time world champion Steve Davis on BBC Two. \"Mark Williams looked edgy early on, but as the session panned out he got calmer and calmer. Judd Trump must be wondering what is going on - it's not his fault, but Mark Williams is playing the best snooker he has all week.\" Their semi-final will get back under way at 10:00 BST on Saturday and finish in the evening session. Recap: How Zhao beat O'Sullivan to reach World Championship final 'Looking for the holy grail' â O'Sullivan's master cue craftsman 'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title Zhao Xintong will return to the professional tour next season John Higgins and Graeme Dott both whitewashed O'Sullivan in sessions on their way to Crucible titles in 1998 and 2006, while Parrott did the same back in 1994 on only O'Sullivan's second appearance in snooker's blue-riband event. However, to see it happen on O'Sullivan's 33rd appearance at the event only served to underline his comments - dismissed in some quarters - that he had only reached this last-four stage because of shortcomings of his previous opponents. His problems from long range were particularly evident against Carter, Pang Junxu and Si Jiahui, but he also toiled when presented with good opportunities to make sizeable contributions of his own. The decision to change the ferrule on his cue - the metal part of the cue near the top which affects the amount of side and swerve you can apply to the white - from titanium to the more traditional brass did not reap any rewards. Instead, Zhao, who O'Sullivan has mentored at times, showcased his full repertoire of shots and by the end of Friday had remarkably achieved his 46th victory from 48 matches since returning from a 20-month ban. He was one10 players from China sanctionedin a match-fixing scandal. While Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself. As a result of that suspension he lost his place on the World Snooker Tour, and he had to win four qualifying matches to earn a Crucible spot. On this evidence he could return to the professional tour as world champion next term. O'Sullivan called his decision to compete in Sheffield the \"bravest\" of his careerafter suffering \"stage fright\"and not playing competitively since snapping his cue at the Championship League in January. He pulled out of the Masters at Alexandra Palace on medical grounds, missed the German Masters in Berlin and apologised to fans after electing not to play at the Welsh Open. He also withdrew from the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong in March and previously said he has had to take medication to deal with anxiety. His candid studio discussionwith Mark Selby on TNT Sports,externalearlier this season also shone a light on the mental health pressures faced by snooker players. Yet despite preparation that was far from ideal and his own protestations over his form, O'Sullivan deserves huge credit for finding his way through into a record-extending 14th appearance in the last four. O'Sullivan memorably defended his world crown in 2013, despite playing one competitive match prior to the showpiece event after taking an extended break from snooker that season. However, aside from having to try to play himself into form at an event that is regarded the sport's acid test, one of his major obstacles this time has been his dissatisfaction with his cue. Ken Doherty, 1997 world champion:\"They [Trump and Williams] will look on the other side of the draw and think that the greatest player to ever play the game is out - and well beaten. \"They will have watched how well Zhao played and they'll know whoever gets through will be up against a tough opponent, one who's playing so carefree, very relaxed and probably doesn't realise the situation he's in - because he's just absolutely loving it.\" Hearn 'a little more hopeful' over Crucible future World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "GB's Draper beats Musetti to reach Madrid Open final",
    "article_text": "Jack Draper is yet to drop a set at the Madrid Open Jack Draper booked his spot in the Madrid Open final with a hard-fought 6-3 7-6 (7-4) victory against Lorenzo Musetti. The British number one will contest his third ATP final of the year against Norway's Casper Ruud on Sunday. Draper, 23, was broken in the opening set but claimed a double break of his own to come through comfortably. It is the first time the 2024 US Open semi-finalist has reached the final of a clay-court event. He is the first Englishman to reach the final of the Madrid Open and the second Briton after Scotland's Andy Murray, who appeared in three finals and won two titles. Draper is aiming for his second ATP title of the year after beating Holger Rune at Indian Wells in March. \"It felt like a key moment every point. The level was high from both of us. I've played Lorenzo all through the juniors and it has always been tough but he is a different animal on the clay,\" Draper told Sky Sports. \"Sometimes in the key moments now I think about the pain I go through on a daily basis - all the sacrifices.\" He has won all four meetings with Musetti as a professional and his perfect record even extends back to their days in the juniors. That might have been playing on Musetti's mind in the opening stages when he dropped his first service game. The Italian struck back immediately but was unable to force his way into the first set after a second break as Draper's forehand once again proved to be a key factor. Musetti was much improved in the second set and it made for a more competitive spectacle. The Madrid crowd were firmly behind Musetti and chanted his name in the fifth game after a perfectly placed drop shot left Draper scrambling. Both players refused to budge on serve - each saving one break point - before heading to a tie-break. Again, it proved to be a tense battle but Draper earned a break on the fifth point to steal control and went on to serve out for victory - finishing with an authoritative cross-court backhand. Casper Ruud is a three-time Grand Slam finalist Ruud booked his spot in Sunday's showpiece with a 6-4 7-5 win over Francisco Cerundolo, despite struggling with a rib injury. The world number 15 required treatment three games into the opening set but still managed to save 15 of the 18 break points he faced. \"I wasn't sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly. I felt something in my rib during the warm-up, just towards the end before going out [on court],\" Ruud said. \"I felt it in nearly every shot, especially the serve. Luckily, I got some quick treatment on it. There's not too much you can do, you only have three minutes [with the physio]. So I will go and check it out more now.\" Sunday's final will be the first time Draper, who is set to climb into the top five in the world for the first time in his career next week, and Ruud have met in the professional ranks. It will be Ruud's 18th final on clay, with Novak Djokovic the only active player to have reached more finals - 34 - on the surface. The 26-year-old has won 11 titles on the red dirt with his most recent success coming in May 2024 at the Geneva Open. \"Casper is a two-time Roland Garros finalist and very accustomed to the clay,\" Draper said of his opponent. \"He is always tough to beat so it will be a challenge for me - but I'm ready for it.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "article_text": "Manchester City have won 13 major trophies under Pep Guardiola Pep Guardiola says he will take a break from management after he leaves Manchester City, though he does not know when he will retire. Guardiola signed a two-year contract extension in November, extending his stay at the club until June 2027. By that time the 54-year-old will have been at City for 11 years - he spent four years as Barcelona manager before taking charge of Bayern Munich for three. \"After my contract with City, I'm going to stop. I'm sure,\" Guardiola toldESPN,external. \"I don't know if I'm going to retire, but I'm going to take a break.\" Speaking to Sky Sports on Friday, Guardiola clarified that he won't necessarily leave City at the end of his current contract. \"I didn't say I'm leaving now or at the end of season or the end of contract,\" he said. \"I said when I finish my time here, be it one, two, three, four, five years, I will take a break. \"I won't retire but I will take a break. What I am saying is when I am finished here I will take a break,\" Guardiola has overseen the most successful period in City's history, with his side winning six of the past nine Premier League titles as well as the club's first Champions League as part of a Treble in 2022-23. This season City have failed to reach their previous heights and are currently fourth in the table with four games left to play. \"How I want to be remembered, I don't know,\" Guardiola said. \"I want people to remember me however they want. \"All coaches want to win so we can have a memorable job, but I believe that the fans of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City had fun watching my teams play. \"I don't think we should ever live thinking about whether we're going to be remembered. \"When we die, our families cry for two or three days and then that's it - you're forgotten.

    "article_text": "Ange Postecoglou hopes to guide Spurs to a first trophy since 2008 Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou has bemoaned the \"negative narrative\" around the club despite their success in the Europa League. On Thursday, Spurs defeatedBodo/Glimt 3-1in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, but in the Premier League they sit 16th having lost 19 of their 34 games. Tottenham's struggles this season have heaped pressure on Postecoglou and sparked protests against club chairman Daniel Levy. \"I've said before, the narrative around the club is not positive at all,\" Postecoglou said before his side's league trip toWest Ham on Sunday(14:00 BST). \"Whether you follow the club or not, there's always some sort of negative connotations to everything that happens at the club, but that's existed for a very long time - you need to break through that.\" Postecoglou felt the atmosphere inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium became nervous and tense after Bodo/Glimt pulled a goal back in the 84th minute, but believes his players will stay positive as they try to win silverware for the first time since 2008. \"Tottenham supporters have had some real near misses for a long time, so there's always this safeguard of not getting too excited about what's happening, but part of creating a winning culture is not to fall into that trap,\" he said. \"Winners don't think about things in that way. They don't think about what could possibly go wrong. They have a real clarity around what they need to do to win and I'm trying to create that with this group of players. \"If you expect something to go wrong, it will. So you try to rail against that, but how you do that is just a clear-eyed focus on what's important.\" This is not the first time the Australian manager has commented on the culture at the club - last month he said thatsomeone inside Spurs is leaking injury news. Postecoglou confirmed that Lucas Bergvall will likely miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury, while James Maddison will have a scan after injuring his knee on Thursday. Dominic Solanke picked up a thigh injury against the Norwegian side and is a doubt to face West Ham on Sunday.

    "title": "Ugandan ​​activist​ asks HSBC to put ‘lives before profit’ as campaigners target bank’s AGM",
    "article_text": "At nine years old, Patience Nabukalu was devastated when her friend, Kevin, died in severe flooding that hit their Kampala suburb, Nateete, a former wetland. Witnessing deaths and the destruction of homes and livelihoods in floods made worse by extreme rainfall has had a profound impact on her. She decided to try to bring about change – to do what she could to amplify the voices of those in the Ugandan communities worst affected by the climate crisis. Now 27, Nabukalu is one ofseveral young climate activistswho travelled to London this week to attend what has been predicted to bethe last in-person AGM held by HSBC. They will deliver a letter to the bank’s CEO, Georges Elhedery, urging him to stop financing the expansion of oil, gas and coal projects and harmful industrial agribusiness, and to stop providing money to companies that forcibly remove people from their homes to make way for such infrastructure. “This is an opportunity to talk to real people, not just anHSBCoffice,” said Nabukalu, speaking before the meeting at the Intercontinental hotel. “I will be so happy to get the chance to hand over the letter and to ask: ‘Has HSBC measured the damage they have done by financing corporations that are driving the climate crisis?’” The letter refers to a2023 Action Aid report, which identifies HSBC as “the largest European financier of fossil fuels in the global south”, channelling $63.5bn (£48bn) into fossil fuel activities between 2016 and 2022. The letter to Elhedery, from young people all over the world, refers to HSBC’s plans, announced earlier this year, to review its commitment toscaling back its financing of fossil fuels. “This has made something very clear: you value profit margins and boardroom agendas more than the lives of millions of people bearing the full brunt of your decisions,” the letter reads. Environmentalists criticisedHSBC after it delayed key parts of its climate goalsby 20 years, and watered down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for Elhedery that could be worth up to 600% of his salary.In February, the lender said it was reviewing its net zero emissions policies and targets – which are split between its own operations and those of the companies it finances – after realising its clients and suppliers had “seen more challenges” in cutting their carbon footprint than expected. The activists’ letter asks “that you not only stand by your commitments to end your support for the fossil fuel industry in line with what the science requires, but also put an end to all lending and underwriting for corporations involved in fossil fuel expansion”. Nabukalu will also urge the bank to stop funding corporations that are backing the east African crude oil pipeline from Uganda to Tanzania. Once constructed, the pipeline would produce an estimated379m tonnes of CO2over 25 years. The main backers of the multimillion-dollar pipeline are the French oil company TotalEnergies and the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Nabukalu, who has visited people living along the proposed route, said: “This pipeline is already causing damage even before its construction. Thousands and thousands of people have been displaced. They were promised land titles, but have none. Their livelihoods have been sabotaged. They cannot build agriculture, the water table is low, so they have little access to water. “These people should be at the centre of the bank’s decisions.” “We will talk to HSBC and ask them to stop financing fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis,” said Nabukalu. “By continuing to finance TotalEnergies they are destroying our future.” A report published in Aprilfound that those displaced along the pipeline’s proposed route had reported being inadequately compensated and rehoused. Some western banks have declined to fund itafter pressurefrom a coalition of organisations and community groups. A spokesperson for HSBC said: “We follow a clear set of sustainability risk policies which support our ambition to align the financed emissions in our portfolio to net zero by 2050. We do not comment on client relationships.”",

    "title": "US designates two powerful Haitian gangs as terrorist groups",
    "article_text": "The United States has designated a powerfulHaitiangang alliance, whose members have taken control of almost all the capital city as a “transnational terrorist group”. The criminal coalition known as Viv Ansanm (Live Together), and another faction, the Gran Grif gang, which in Octobertook responsibility for a shocking massacreof at least 115 people in the agricultural town of Pont-Sondé, were both covered by the move on Friday. “They are a direct threat to US national security interests in our region,” the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said in a statement, adding that providing material support or resources to the gangs could lead to “criminal charges and inadmissibility or removal from the United States”. Theconflict in Haitihas been met with little international response, while neighboring countries, including the US, have continued to deport migrants back to the Caribbean country despite United Nations pleas not to due to humanitarian concerns. More than 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict, and tens of thousands more in recent weeks, as the violence has spread to central Haiti, forcing more health facilities to shut their doors and pushing more people intosevere food insecurity. Frozen US funding for security efforts and thedismantlingof the US Agency for International Development, as well as other cuts, also complicate the situation. The latest designations come after the US in FebruarydesignatedVenezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang, alongside a number of other organized crime groups across Latin America, including Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, as global terrorist organizations. It was unclear what, if any, impact the terrorist designation would have regardingHaiti. Those who do business in Haiti also could be affected by the new designation.Gangscontrol the areas surrounding a key fuel depot and the country’s biggest and most important port, as well as the main roads that lead in and out of the capital, where they charge tolls. “It could function as a de facto embargo,” said Jake Johnston, the international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. “The gangs exercise tremendous control over the commerce of the country,” he said. “Doing any kind of business with Haiti or in Haiti is going to carry much greater risk.” Armed groups in Haiti have made significant gains in the first part of 2025, as an underresourced, UN-backed security mission has stalled, and along with police has been unable to hold off advances of the heavily armed and well-funded gangs. The UN has called for tougher measures to prevent guns being trafficked to the Haitian gangs, especially from the US, which it said was the major source of illegal firearms in Haiti via ports in Florida. Haiti has not held an election since 2016 and the man elected president then, Jovenel Moïse, wasassassinatedin 2021.",

    "title": "Venezuela rejects UN ruling to refrain from holding election in disputed region",
    "article_text": "Venezuela’s government has said it “categorically” rejected a ruling from the U N’s top court ordering the South American country to refrain from holding elections for officials who supposedly would oversee a resource-rich region in neighboring Guyana that both countries claim as their own. The government ofNicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president, in a statement underscored its historical position to not recognize the jurisdiction of the international court of justice and asserted that international law does not allow the body to “interfere” or “attempt to prohibit” an election. The government’s statement came a day after the court, based in The Hague, issued the ruling at the request ofGuyana, which accused Venezuela of violating an earlier order by planning to hold elections on 25 May for a governor and other officials to administer the Essequibo region. “Nothing in international law allows the International Court of Justice to interfere in matters that are the exclusive domain of Venezuelan domestic law, nor to seek to prohibit a sovereign act,” the Venezuelan statement read. In its petition to the ICJ,Guyanahad said that the elections would cause “irreparable harm” to the Essequibo region, which makes up two-thirds of its territory and is home to 125,000 of its 800,000 citizens. The Essequibo “is an inalienable part of the Venezuelan territory and a legacy of our liberators”, according to Venezuela’s statement on Friday. “Its defense is a historical, constitutional, and a moral mandate that unites the entire Bolivarian Homeland. No international pressure, judicial blackmail, or foreign tribunal will make us back down from this conviction.” The sparsely populated area under dispute represents two-thirds of Guyana and is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources. It also is located close to huge offshore oil deposits, with current production averaging about 650,000 barrels a day. Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period. It has long dismissed the border drawn by international arbitrators in 1899, when Guyana was still a British colony. After years of fruitless mediation, Guyana asked the world court in 2018 to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding. Venezuela argues that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute in effect nullified the original arbitration. The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising. In late 2023,Maduro threatened to annex the region by forceafter holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. Days later, Caribbean leaders, joined by Brazil and the UN, held an emergency summit where Guyana and Venezuela agreed to refrain from using force. But the dispute continues. In March, Guyana’s president, Irfaan Ali, denounced anincursion by an armed Venezuelan naval vesselin disputed waters that are home to a major offshore oil deposit being developed by ExxonMobil. The Venezuelan vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, disputed Ali’s claims and called ExxonMobil’s oil installations “illegal”. Venezuelan voters will head to the polls later this month to elect governors and lawmakers.",

    "title": "King Charles to open Canada parliament as PM Carney reacts to Trump threats",
    "article_text": "King Charleshas accepted an invitation to open Canada’s parliament on 27 May, in “an historic honour that matches the weight of our times”, the country’s prime minister,Mark Carney, said on Friday. In his first news conference since an election dominated byDonald Trump’s threats toCanada’s sovereignty, the prime minister also confirmed he would meet the US president at the White House on Tuesday. Trump has repeatedly suggested annexingCanadato the US and imposed tariffs on some Canadian goods, moves which Carney has described as a “betrayal”. “As I’ve stressed repeatedly, our old relationship, based on steadily increasing integration, is over,” he said, adding he would “fight” to get the best deal for the country. “The questions now are how our nations will cooperate in the future.” Carney’s Liberals are set to form a minority government after Monday’s election, and are projected to hold at least 168 seats, with recounts pending in at least two electoral districts. The Conservatives will form the official opposition with a projected 144 seats, while the Bloc Québecois won 23, the progressive New Democratic party seven and the Greens one. Carney praised the strength of the country’s democracy amid high turnout, telling reporters all party leaders “quickly and graciously” accepted the results. The prime minister said he would call a byelection immediately after Conservatives decide which member of parliament will step aside to give leader Pierre Poilievre, whofailed to win his own seat, the chance to run for a new seat. “No games,” he said. But Carney rejected the idea of signing a formal pact with the NDP in order to guarantee the survival of his minority government,as his predecessor Justin Trudeau didfollowing his narrow electoral victory in 2021. Carney said the Liberals had received a strong mandate “and the most votes in Canadian history”, adding: “Canadians elected a new government to stand up to President Trump and build a strong economy.” Carney told reporters he would announce a cabinet with gender parity on 12 May and parliament would return on 27 May in a move that “clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country”. The visit of a monarch to give the speech from the throne marks the first in more than half a century. The last time a sovereign opened parliament was in 1957, when Queen Elizabeth II came to Ottawa. The prime minister also acknowledged that a large portion of the voter base had concerns they felt the Liberals had so far failed to fully address. Ahead of the election, the Conservatives had emphasized a “tough on crime” message and Carney said on Friday that his party would strengthen both the criminal code and bail laws “for those threatening the safety of Canadians”, making it more difficult for those accused of auto theft, home invasion and human trafficking to obtain bail. Carney also pledged to build more houses and to cut taxes on new builds in an attempt to make the real estate market more accessible. “I’ve been clear since day one of my leadership campaign in January, I’m in politics to do big things, not to be something,” he said. “Now that Canadians have honoured me with a mandate to bring about big changes quickly, I will work relentlessly to fulfil that trust.” Much of the press conference, however, focused on Carney’s upcoming meeting with Trump. The prime minister told reporters he would not negotiate in public amid questions over how he might approach a possible trade deal with the president, as well as the presence of tariffs on Canadian goods that violate current trade rules. “Do not expect white smoke out of that meeting,” he said, a reference to the upcoming papal conclave. The White House has cited the alleged flow of fentanyl from Canada for imposing tariffs, even though only minimal amounts of the drug have been seized at the northern border in recent months. “There will be difficult discussions,” Carney said in French. “The fentanyl-related tariffs, we don’t understand why they’re still in place.” When pressed on Trump’s musing on making Canada the 51st state, Carney said any such proposal would be rejected by Canada. “It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” he said.",

    "article_text": "A mother deported toCubareportedly had to hand over her 17-month-old daughter to a lawyer while her husband, a US citizen, stood outside unable to say goodbye. Heidy Sánchez was told she was being detained for deportation to Cuba when she turned up at her scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) check-in appointment in Tampa,Florida, last week. She was told her child, who has health problems and is still breastfeeding, had to stay in the US but could visit her in Cuba,NBC reported. The Trump administration is embroiled in controversy forremoving children who are US citizensfrom the United States with a parent when the adult is deported. In this case, the child was reportedly not allowed to leave with her mother even though it was what both parents said they wanted. The administration’santi-immigration crackdownhas put many people in a difficult position becausethey riskbeing summarily detained and deported when turning up for routine Ice check-ins. Many people have followed this process without issue for years, and do not have a criminal record – but failing to turn up can bring an order for forcible removal from the US. “They never gave me the option to take my daughter,” Sánchez told NBC. Sánchez’s husband, Carlos Valle, is a US citizen. Both parents separately told NBC that their daughter is now crying all the time and calling for her mother, while Sánchez struggles to get wifi service inCubato sing her daughter to sleep. Valle was not allowed into the room where Sánchez was being interviewed by Ice agents with their daughter, attorneys told NBC. When told she was being deported, she was denied the chance to see her husband or hand over their daughter to him, with a lawyer having to fulfil that role instead. Claudia Cañizares, a Miami-based attorney for the family, said she tried to prevent the deportation but was given “the runaround” by the authorities. The Florida Democratic congresswoman Kathy Castor has said she is lobbying the administration on the family’s behalf. Ice did not respond to a request for commentfrom NBC. The Guardian has submitted a request for comment.",

    "title": "‘World’s largest’ electric ship measuring 130 metres launched by Tasmanian boatbuilder",
    "article_text": "An Australian boatbuilder has launched what it describes as the world’s largest battery-power ship, describing it as a “a giant leap forward in sustainable shipping” and the “most important” project it has ever done. Incat, a manufacturer based inTasmania, constructed the ship – called Hull 096 – after being contracted by the South American ferry operator Buquebus to build a vessel to run between the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, and Uruguay. Launching the ship in Hobart on Friday, the company said it would operate entirely on battery-electric power, carrying up to 2,100 passengers and 225 vehicles across the River Plate, which forms the border betweenArgentinaand Uruguay. . “We’ve been building world-leading vessels here in Tasmania for more than four decades, and Hull 096 is the most ambitious, most complex, and most important project we’ve ever delivered,” the chairman of Incat, Robert Clifford, said. Clifford said Incat hoped to build “as many sustainable ships as possible for the global market, both here in Australia and overseas”. The company said at 130 metres, Hull 096 was not only the largest electric ship in the world, but also “the largest electric vehicle of its kind ever built”. The ship is equipped with more than 250 tonnes of batteries and has more than 40 megawatt-hours of installed capacity. Incat said the energy storage system was connected to eight electric-driven water jets and its capacity is four times larger than any previous maritime installation. “Hull 096 proves that large-scale, low-emission transport solutions are not only possible, they are ready now,” Incat’s chief executive, Stephen Casey, said. The global shipping industry accounts for 3% of the world’s annual emissions, according to theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Dr Liam Davies, a lecturer in sustainability and urban planning at RMIT University, said because the new ship would service a regular ferry route, it could be a “good use case” to monitor what was effective in shipping electrification. “That is something that seems like a good use case and a good way to find what works and what doesn’t in terms of electric vehicle shipping,” he said. “Using that to learn how we effectively do electric shipping could act as a stepping stone towards container ships and cargo ships.”",

    "title": "Why is Trump ending the ‘de minimis’ tariff loophole on low-value imports?",
    "article_text": "At one minute past midnight on Friday, eastern time, a US tariff exemption that has fuelled the rise of companies such as Shein and Temu, and stocked the wardrobes of millions of Americans with cheap fast fashion and other household goods, closed. As part of Donald Trump’sflurry of tariffson China, the US is closing a loophole that allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US without paying any import fees. The “de minimis” loophole, known by the Latin phrase for “of little importance”, was “a big scam going on against our country”, the US president said on Wednesday. “We put an end to it.” “De minimis” refers to a trade policy introduced in the 1930s that allowed travellers returning to the US to bring goods with them worth up to $5 without declaring them to customs. Since 2016, the threshold has been $800 (£600). The term “de minimis” may mean “of little importance”, but the policy is responsible for a huge volume of consumer goods. About 1.36bn shipments entered the US via the loophole in the fiscal year 2024, more than double the number four years earlier, according to the US customs agency. That represents more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US. About 60% of those packagescome from China. As of Friday, parcels worth less than $800 will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee of $100, rising to $200 from June. That is on top of the 145% tariffs already placed on all Chinese imports, as part of thewider US-China trade war. The White House has accused sellers in China of “deceptive shipping practices” to take advantage of the loophole. Industry associations in the US have complained of unfair competition from Chinese sellers and have beenpushing for yearsfor the loophole to be closed. Trump also argues that the free flow of small packages into the US has allowed deadly drugs, especiallyfentanyland the chemicals used to make it, to arrive unchecked into the country. “These exports play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the United States,” Trump said in anexecutive orderin April. Prices will probably increase and some options have become unavailable. The Chinese e-commerce company Temu announced on Friday that it would stop shipping low-cost items from China and sell directly to US consumers. The fast-fashion company Shein has also reportedly already started increasing the prices of some goods. Data compiled byBloombergfound that the average price for the top 100 products sold by Shein in the beauty and health category increased by 51% in the past week, while a 10-piece set of kitchen towels increased in price by 377%. The average increase for women’s clothing was 8%. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion A spokesperson for Temu said the company had recently transitioned to a local fulfilment model, meaning that all US sales were handled by sellers within the country. “Despite the operational shift, Temu’s pricing for US consumers remains unchanged,” the company said. The White House says that the US customs agency apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at the border in the last fiscal year, enough to kill 4 billion people. It is hoped that increased checks on small packages will allow more illicit imports to be apprehended. Before 2020, the year after China cracked down onfentanyl suppliers, 90% of the fentanyl consumed in the US came directly from China. Now nearly all of the supply comes across the US-Mexico border, not from packages shipped directly from China. China’s government and trade associations say the pain will be felt by American consumers rather than Chinese exporters. He Yongqian, a spokesperson for the commerce ministry, said earlier this year that the US tariff hikes “will undoubtedly increase costs for American consumers and degrade their shopping experience”. Industry groups, including the China textiles association, have backed the government’s position and accused the US of “hegemonic actions”, according to Chinese state media. Shein is reportedly considering pausing its widely anticipated London IPO, amid uncertainty around how the tariffs will affect its business. The company did not respond to a request for comment. JD.com, one of China’s e-commerce companies, has promise to buy 2bn yuan (£206.6m) worth of products from Chinese exporters to sell in the domestic market.",

    "title": "China ‘evaluating’ US offer to engage in trade negotiations",
    "article_text": "Beijing is “evaluating” an offer from the US to engage in trade negotiations, the Chinese government has said, a week afterDonald Trumpclaimed talks were already under way. China’s commerce ministry said on Friday: “The US has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information toChinathrough relevant parties, saying it hopes to talk with China.” On Thursday,influential commentatorsin China said the country was ready to engage in talks. The suggestion that Beijing was potentially willing to negotiate with Washington – along with a better than expected report on US jobs - sent markets higher on Friday on both sides of the Atlantic. Ren Yi, a nationalist blogger who writes under the nickname Chairman Rabbit, wrote that he had learned from sources that the US had “frequently and proactively contacted the Chinese side through various channels, hoping to negotiate with the Chinese government on economic and trade issues”. China has denied claims made by US officials that talks were already under way, or that China had initiated them. Trump said last week thatXi Jinping, China’s leader, had called him. China’s foreign ministry accused the US of “misleading the public” on the status of negotiations. Ren wrote: “If China had given in and taken the initiative to give in to the United States, then naturally there would not have been the United States taking the initiative to contact China.” The commerce ministry said on Friday that Washington needed to show “sincerity” in negotiations and that it should not engage in “coercion and extortion”. China has repeatedly accused the US of bullying in its approach to trade policies. The two countries have been at loggerheads since Trump launched a new US-China trade war in early April, with US tariffs on Chinese goods now at 145% while China’s retaliatory tariffs have reached 125%. But although neither side wants to be seen to blink first, the US and China have already introduced a number of exceptions to their respective tariffs tosoften the blowof a trade war that risksupending the global economy. Chinesefactory activity slowed in April. The statistics bureau blamed “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment” for the decline. This week Xi called on officials to adjust to changes in the international environment, although he did not mention the US by name. Elsewhere, Chinese propaganda has been more explicit. This week the foreign ministry releaseda videothat accused the US of bullying and said that bowing to such behaviour would be like “drinking poison”. A US executive order to close a multibillion-dollar tariff loophole, known as “de minimis”, came into effect on Friday.The ending of the de minimis regime, which allowed low-value goods to be shipped to the US without paying customs fees, primarily affects Chinese exporters. Scott Bessent said this week he was confident that China would want to reach a deal. The US treasury secretary said: “First, we need to de-escalate, and then over time, we will start focusing on a larger trade deal.”",

    "article_text": "Over the past three months, Guardian Australia has been speaking to ordinary people about their everyday lives – their families, work, hobbies, stressors and hopes. These interviews have formed ourAnywhere But Canberraseries – a portrait of what different people across the country are dealing with in the lead up to the federal election. We wanted to see how people’s lives and perspectives shaped their votes. And while we spoke to a range of Australians – teachers and students in metropolitan areas, farmers and small business owners in the regions, young and old voters across Labor, Liberal and Green seats in all six states – what they had to say wasn’t as diverse. In fact, many of their experiences and stressors were very much the same. Cost-of-living pressures were mentioned by every person we spoke to, with an overwhelming feeling of stress about the lack of affordable housing, the price of groceries, the cost of healthcare and Hecs debt among the younger voters.

    "title": "The polls point to a Labor win, but its primary vote is barely moving – can both things be true?",
    "article_text": "Australia’s major parties are headed for a historically low primary vote, continuing a downward trend of several decades, according to the latest from Guardian Australia’spoll tracker. Labor leads the Coalition 51.5-48.5 on the two-party-preferred measure according to our latest average, although there is still uncertainty in the polling. The two-party-preferred vote has been trending towards a repeat of the last election, but this masks a more than two-point primary vote drop for both major parties. The votes lost by the major parties have gone “everywhere”, according to pollsters who spoke to Guardian Australia. Our model estimates the support for independents and minor parties is four points higher than at the last election. With an estimated primary vote of about 33%, a Coalition win on Saturday would represent a “major polling failure”, says Luke Mansillo, the political scientist who builtGuardian’s Australia’s poll averaging model, which amalgamates data from a number of published polls. The model factors in sample sizes, previous results and the “house effects” (inadvertent bias towards a party) of each pollster.Research showspollsters systematically overestimated the support for Labor in the 2019 and 2022 elections, which is one reason the model estimates Labor’s primary vote is slightly lower than the published polls themselves report. Some published polls in the final week haveput Labor on course to comfortably attain majority government, even with a primary vote similar to 2022, or even lower. Mansillo says it remains very unlikely that theCoalitioncould win enough seats to form minority government, let alone win an overall majority, but it is pinning its hopes on minor parties to its right taking votes from Labor and sending preferences to the Coalition. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “They would have to rely on preference votes from One Nation and a rag tag of rightwing parties,” Mansillo says. One Nation has risen in the polls in recent months, but that appears to be mostly at the expense of the Coalition’s primary vote. Inprevious electionsonly about 62-64% of preferences from One Nation and the United Australia party ended up with the Coalition. By contrast, 86% of Greens preferences went to Labor at the last election. All the polls have shown a steady decline in the Coalition’s position in recent months, mostly thanks to its primary vote falling rather than Labor’s increasing. The Coalition first took a two-party-preferred lead in our poll tracker early last year, and really started to pull away around November. The lead continued into the new year, but has slowly fallen away ever since. As polls can be intermittent and noisy, it’s hard to pinpoint when exactly the Coalition peaked. “I really noticed the change in February,” says Shaun Ratcliff, who has been modelling and running polls with Redbridge throughout the campaign. “There were a couple of weeks there where you had the Labor party’sMedicare announcement, theWhyalla announcement, and the Reserve Bankcutting interest rates. “It felt like they were in campaign mode and they were making all these announcements in areas that were clearly researched. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “It all happened quite quickly and almost immediately it showed up in the polling.” By contrast, the Coalition was less focused on cost of living, housing and healthcare, according to Ratcliff’s research. “The Coalition was kind of caught flat-footed. They didn’t seem to really have a response to this messaging. Certainly through February and March.” Guardian Australia’s poll tracker shows Labor overtaking the Coalition towards the end of March, not long afterCyclone Alfred hit the Queensland coast. This is when Mansillo thinks the race flipped. “It was all a collapse in the Coalition primary vote,” Mansillo says. “There was nothing happening for Labor. More recently there has been an increase for One Nation.” Early in the campaign pollsters identified a number of seats to watch. These included seats to the north and south of greater Sydney, and on the fringes of Melbourne, the new seat of Bullwinkel in Perth, Lyons in Tasmania, and some seats in and around Brisbane. As the Coalition has struggled in the polls, its path to victory in these suburban and regional areas has started to close. “At the start of the year [the Coalition] were looking very well placed,” says Ratcliff, who has been polling a collection of key seats. “In the first wave of the tracker in early February we had the Coalition at 52% two-party preferred, which was a three-point swing since the last election. “Our last wave has them losing ground since the last election. If anything we are seeing the Coalition going backwards in these key seats.” Josh Nicholas is a data journalist for Guardian Australia",

    "title": "Coalition braces for tough result as Albanese hopes to be first PM to win re-election since Howard",
    "article_text": "Anthony Albanese is on the cusp of winning a second term but hopes of retaining majority government hang on a knife-edge as Peter Dutton attempts to overcome a chaotic campaign to win enough seats to force Labor “deep” into minority. The prime minister and opposition leader will return to their home cities of Sydney and Brisbane on Saturday to cast their vote and await the election results, after a multi-state blitz of battleground seats in the final day of the campaign. The published national opinion polls show Labor on track to form government but party strategists expect it will need to gain ground to retain a 76-seat majority as they brace for losses, including in suburban Melbourne and regional New South Wales. Dutton is adamant he can pull off a surprise win, drawing hope from Scott Morrison’s “miracle” 2019 election victory against Bill Shorten. But seniorCoalitioncampaign sources are downplaying that prospect, acknowledging that forcing Labor “deep” into minority is likely the best-case scenario after a tumultuous five-week campaign. The two leaders made their last pitch to the remaining undecided voters on Friday in a frenetic final full-day of campaigning. Albanese made an 11th-hour visit to Dutton’s own electorate of Dickson in Brisbane in a further sign Labor believes the opposition leader’s seat is winnable. Almost 40% of ballots were already cast as ofmid-morning on Friday,surpassing the early voting figure from 2022. Albanese insisted Labor still had a “mountain to climb” as he urged voters to grant him a second-term to fulfil promises in health, housing and cutting student debt. If successful, he would be the first prime minister to win re-election since John Howard in 2004 and the first Labor leader to achieve the feat since Bob Hawke in 1990. “In uncertain times you can be certain that Labor has a plan to build Australia’s future and you can be certain that the Coalition have cuts and chaos, as the way that they’ve run this campaign,” Albanese told reporters in the seat of Longman north of Brisbane. Dutton, who campaigned in Adelaide and Perth on Friday, said the election had echoes of 2019, when Morrison defied the polls to defeat Shorten. “I think we’re seeing a 2019 situation, where you’ve got a lot of interesting contests playing on the ground, where we’ve had a very significant effort by great candidates,” Dutton told ABC’s AM. “And I think there’ll be some big surprises on election night, because people have had enough.” Labor insiders believe Albanese and the party national secretary, Paul Erickson, have run a “textbook campaign”, capitalising on the Coalition’s missteps and voters’ negative perceptions of Dutton to prosecute the case for continuity in a period of global upheaval. But the government – which holds a notional 78 seats – remains in a fight to retain a majority amid the threat of a voter backlash from outer suburban and regional voters over the cost of living. The worst fears of an electoral “bloodbath” in Victoria, where half-a-dozen seats were once considered at serious risk, have subsided in recent weeks. Nevertheless, one strategist said the party was bracing for “one of the toughest results we’ve had in a very long time” in the traditionally safe Labor state. Both sides expect Labor to loseAston while Chisholm and McEwen are considered tight races. The Coalition believes it is in contention in the western Melbourne seats of Hawke and Gorton, although Labor is confident of holding both. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The expectation of several losses has Labor anticipating it will need to pick up seats to govern in its own right for a second term. The party is targeting Brisbane, Griffith and Bonner in Brisbane, Leichhardt in Cairns, Sturt in South Australia, Deakin and Menzies in Melbourne and Bass and Braddon in Tasmania. Albanese campaigned in Devonport, in the seat of Braddon, on Friday before flying to Melbourne. Labor is confident of retaining all four seats it won in Western Australia in 2022,including the marginal electorate of Tangney, although theLiberals are considered the frontrunners in newly formed Bullwinkel. Coalition campaigners are dismissive of thepublished national polls, adamant their internal research indicates much tighter contests in marginal seats. Senior campaign sources accept the odds of even forming a minority government are slim, as the focus narrows to forcing Labor below 70 seats. The opposition are hopeful of picking up between six and 12 Labor seats, the teal-held seats of Goldstein and Kooyong in Melbourne and Curtin in Perth and Greens-held Brisbane in the Queensland capital. The list of target Labor seats include Gilmore andPatersonin regional NSW. Campaign sources believePenny Wong’s voice to parliament commentscould shift votes in the final days, particularly in Labor-held seats that recorded a high “no” votes at the 2023 referendum. Labor has ruled out reviving the Indigenous advisory body, including through legislation. The Coalition’s challenge is not just to win seats but also defend them, including against Climate-200 backed independents inLiberal-held Bradfieldand Wannon and Nationals-held Cowper. An outcome in which the Coalition fail to build on their notional 57 seats would be considered a disaster and place Dutton’s future as leader in immediate doubt. Adam Bandt’s Greens are confident of holding Griffith and Ryan in Brisbane and believe they are favourites in Labor-held Wills in inner-city Melbourne. The Greens-held seat of Brisbane and target seats ofMacnamara in Melbourneand Richmond in northern NSW are three-cornered contests and therefore harder to gauge, according to party insiders. “If you’re concerned about the housing and rental crisis, you can’t keep voting for the same two parties and expecting a different result,” Bandt said in his final pitch to voters.",

    "article_text": "TheNew South Waleseducation department has apologised after riot police were called to manage out-of-control crowds at the state’s selective school exams. Police were called to Canterbury Park Racecourse, south-west of Sydney’s CBD, at about midday on Friday following reports of traffic and crowd control issues. About 1,300 students had finished exams at the Canterbury site and were trying to leave with their parents, as another 1,300 students plus their parents attempted to enter the facility. About 90 minutes after the second exam’s scheduled start at 1.30pm, children waiting were told it had been cancelled. The tests – which qualify students for accelerated streams in public primary and secondary schools – are normally sat in high schools but the department had organised this year’s sessions in bigger venues because the test was online. Murat Dizdar, the education department secretary, apologised for the “inconvenience and stress” caused to students and their parents. “What occurred was unacceptable and fell well short of the department’s expectations,” he said. “I understand the frustration of families who had made arrangements to attend the tests.” Dizdar said that further tests scheduled across the weekend at Randwick, Homebush and Canterbury had all been cancelled due to concerns around crowd control. “Testing will go ahead as planned at the other 104 testing sites across the state,” he said. “I want parents and carers to know that we are committed to rectifying this situation. “The department will be in direct contact with a range of options for make up tests.”",

    "title": "Labor far outspends Coalition and Clive Palmer on Google and Meta ads amid calls for change to blackout laws",
    "article_text": "Labor splurged more than $11m across Google and Meta platforms to win votes, far surpassing its opponents – including billionaireClive Palmer– and outstripping political foes in key seats in the lead-up to polling day. New data showed the major parties have poured cash into boosting targeted messages to social media users in tightly contested electorates, including marginal seats in Bennelong, Brisbane, Boothby, Blair and Bullwinkel. Political advertising on social media will continue even as polling booths open on Saturday morning. Electoral advertising laws only impose a blackout period on broadcast TV and radio. Advocates have pushed for changes to the decades-old laws, which stop legacy media outlets airing political ads two days before the election, but do not extend toFacebook, Google, YouTube, the TV catch-up services and podcasts. Guardian Australia analysis, using data from Populares’ ad tracker, showed political parties and affiliated groups spent more than $39m for political ads since 28 March across Facebook,YouTubeand Google search. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Labor’s pages – including candidate and MP accounts – totalled $11.4m, about 29% of that bill, booking $4.2m worth of Meta ads, $6.8m on YouTube and more than $400,000 in ads onGooglesearch and display. The Liberal party’s pages trailed Labor, spending $7.1m – about $3.8m onMetaads and $3m on YouTube. Palmer is no stranger to splashing cash at federal elections and his new minor party,Trumpet of Patriots, racked up a big ad bill. While the mining billionaire spent a comparatively small $1.2m on Meta ads, he spent almost $5.5m on boosting hundreds of YouTube ads. The ads primarily featured the Hunter candidate, Suellen Wrightson, speaking about the party’s “commonsense” policies. Teal independents, which includes Climate 200’s page and their candidates, amassed a $3.5m bill with $2.6m on Meta ads. The Greens and Nationals gave no advertising money to Meta, instead booking ads on YouTube worth $316,400 and $212,150 respectively. Third-party groups spent big trying to influence the election’s results. Progressive groups including It’s Not a Race and the Clean Energy Council spent close to $2m on online political ads. Unions, including Australian Unions and the United Workers Union, followed closely behind with $1.6m on Meta and Google ad placements. The rightwing advocacy group Advance has asked supporters to dig deep tounseat the Greensand Labor. Analysis showed Advance spent about $1.6m on online political ads. Other rightwing groups, such asBetter Australiaand the Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance, spent a cumulative $1.5m promoting their ideas to social media users. Redbridge pollster Kos Samaras said political parties might spend large on social media but without adapting to the online world, it could end up as “burnt money”. “You can spend an enormous amount of money selling a beer that no one wants to drink,” he said. While the overall figures demonstrate political parties are willing to spend more than ever on online campaigns, further analysis shows their advertising is increasingly targeted to influence battleground seats. And it was Labor again spending most on that front. At the top of the list is Bennelong in Sydney’s inner north. Labor and the Liberals are fiercely contesting the marginal electorate on the ground and online. Labor spent $270,000 on targeted Google advertising to those living in the seat, more than double the Liberals. Unions and Advance have also boosted their messages in Bennelong, spending $49,200 and $8,250 respectively. Political parties and groups have spent more than $350,000 on YouTube advertising in five other seats too: Blair, Brisbane, Bruce, Chisholm and McEwen. Boothby and Paterson are among the few seats where the Liberals have outspent Labor. The opposition has boosted $165,700 worth of ads compared with Labor’s $140,600 in Boothby while Labor spent $10,000 less than the Liberals’ $84,350 in Paterson. In Melbourne’s inner-north seat of Wills, where the Labor incumbent Peter Khalil is fighting off the Greens, Labor has spent $268,300 on Google ads while the Greens have spent just $600. Targeted advertising was effective for influencing local battles but still had to consider the audience’s values, Samaras said. While the Trumpet of Patriots spent $5.5m on YouTube and Google, it paid $69,000 in targeted advertising for one seat – Hunter. In the 2022 federal election, the Australian Communications and Media Authority received 34 complaints alleging election ads were shown during the blackout period. The majority of these complaints were for ads shown on streaming services, where the blackout rules do not apply. Free TV Australia, which represents the broadcasters, this week called for the blackout period to be removed. Its chief executive, Bridget Fair, called it “a relic of the 1980s”. “It’s absurd that broadcasters are banned from airing political ads in the final days before an election” she said. “It creates an uneven playing field.” The University of Canberra’s News and Media Research Centre told a parliamentary inquiry into the 2022 election it was “crazy” that restrictions on election ads did not also apply to online services.

    "title": "AfD ‘extremist’ label sets up political high-wire act for Friedrich Merz",
    "article_text": "The decision by Germany’s domestic spy agency tocall the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party “extremist”amounts to the starkest move yet by authorities to try to stop the advance of the populist political force. Friday’s classification by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) will open up the possibility for the security services to monitor the country’s largest opposition party, including by recruiting people to inform against it and enabling interception of its communications. AfD leaders denounced it as a “blow against democracy”, and nothing short of an attempt to disfranchise the more than 10 million people who voted for it in February’s election. Its leaders vowed to take legal action against what they called “defamatory” and “politically motivated attacks”. According to the experts who compiled the BfV’s 1,100-page report, the AfD is “a racist and anti-Muslim organisation”, which, through its strict, ethnically and ancestrally defined version of who is German and who is not, “deprecates whole sections of the population inGermanyand infringes their human dignity”. It has also “incited irrational fears and hostility” in society, steering the blame towards individuals and groups, the report said. In itself, the step is not much of a surprise, although the timing is. The outgoing interior minister, Nancy Faeser, made the bombshell announcement on what is effectively her last day in office. Faeser said “there was no political influence on the assessment”, despite the AfD’s insistence to the contrary. But the move puts the incoming conservative-led government ofFriedrich Merzunder great pressure, as well as Faeser’s Social Democrat colleagues, who will be the junior partners in the new coalition that gets to work next Tuesday. On the back of the decision, Merz will now be responsible – on top of the myriad other challenges in his in-tray – for deciding whether and how to ban the AfD, a decision that will involve the most precarious of political tightrope walks. Migration, Ukraine, Trump and an ailing economy are among the burgeoning issues that he will also have to tackle with urgency. The growing mood of dissatisfaction over these and other issues, exacerbated by the six months of political deadlock that followed the premature collapse of the previous government – which induced an added layer of nationwide ennui – has already caused the AfD to creep up in the polls. Having won second place in February’s election– doubling its previous result and making it the strongest opposition party, second only to the conservative CDU/CSU – in recent days the AfD has come top of the polls for the first time ever. The ruling by the BfV is unlikely to put people off supporting the AfD. Finding a way to reduce the AfD has been at top of the agenda among all of the political parties since it emerged as a protest force of professors and academics in 2013on the back of anger over the euro bailouts. The challenge has only grown in importance, as the populists – morphing from anti-euro to anti-migrant over time – have grown their success at the ballot box. Merz would like to be seen as a pragmatic rationalist, aiming to reduce the AfD to what he refers to as the “marginal phenomenon” it once was by addressing the nation’s concerns, taking the wind out of the sails of the AfD’s successful modus operandi of inciting fear and insecurity. Tackling “irregular” immigration is therefore at the top of his domestic agenda, as he seeks to address the topic viewed as having added the most fuel to the AfD’s fire. But many others believe it is too late for that, arguing that an extremist classification, followed by a ban, would be the only way to stop the flourishing party. Others say such a move would be in grave danger of backfiring, arguing that the AfD would turn such a branding by the state into its own “seal of approval”, which would serve to enhance its already strong sense of victimhood or martyrdom. Merz’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, has been torn over how to deal with the AfD. Merztacitly cooperated with the party earlier this year– despite insisting he would not – to push migration policies through parliament. And on the local level, his party and the AfD have cooperated on issues such as a ruling that the German flag should be hoisted in schools. Jens Spahn, Merz’s close ally, recently prompted scorn by suggesting the AfD should be treated as a “normal opposition party”, arguing that excluding the party from parliamentary procedures only boosted its popularity. Those who reject that approach say Friday’s ruling will now give them more justification to block the party at every opportunity – but they argue that this will only work if a cross-party consensus prevails.",

    "title": "Gaza humanitarian aid ship ‘bombed by drones’ in waters off Malta",
    "article_text": "A ship carrying humanitarian aid and activists to Gaza has been bombed by drones and disabled while in international waters offMaltaas it headed towards the Palestinian territory, its organisers have said. “At 00:23 Maltese time, the Conscience, a Freedom Flotilla Coalition ship came under direct attack in international waters,” the groupsaid in a statement. “Armed drones attacked the front of an unarmed civilian vessel twice, causing a fire and a substantial breach in the hull,” it added, blamingIsrael. The strike appeared to target the boat’s generator early on Friday, leaving the boat without power and at risk of sinking, the activists said. Images posted to social media by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition showed a fierce blaze onboard the ship and two explosions. There was no confirmation or further evidence of the claim that drones caused the blasts, but images of the Conscience provided by Cypriot authorities showed significant damage. Twelve crew members and four civilians were “confirmed safe”, the Maltese government said in a statement on Friday. “The vessel had 12 crew members onboard and four civilian passengers; no casualties were reported,” the statement said, adding that a nearby tug had been directed to aid the vessel. The group said activists from 21 countries were onboard on a “mission to challenge Israel’s illegal and deadly siege ofGazaand to deliver desperately needed, life-saving aid”. The statement read: “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters.” Israel has not commented on the allegation. According to the monitoring website MarineTraffic, the Conscience left the Tunisian port of Bizerte on Tuesday and arrived in the area where it reported being attacked on Thursday morning. The ship was heading to a point near Malta where it was to pick up activists, including the climate-change campaigner Greta Thunberg, from a smaller vessel. Thunberg confirmed to Reuters she was in Malta and had been supposed to board the ship. “I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza,” she said. “This attack caused an explosion and major damage to the vessel, which made it impossible to continue the mission.” The group said it had been organising a non-violent action under a media blackout in order to avoid any potential sabotage. A previous sailing launched by the coalition from southern Turkey in 2010 ended in bloodshed when Israeli forces stormed the Mavi Marmara vessel,killing 10 people and wounding 28. Turkey’s foreign ministry said Turkish nationals were on board the Conscience at the time of the incident. “We condemn in the strongest terms this attack on a civilian ship,” it said, noting that there were “allegations that the ship was targeted by Israeli drones”. “All necessary efforts will be made to reveal the details of the attack as soon as possible and to bring the perpetrators to justice,” it said. Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza two months ago, allowing no food, fuel, medicine or other item into the territory, and resumed intense military operations in Gaza in mid-March after a fragile ceasefire collapsed. Humanitarian organisations in Gaza have distributed the last of their stocks of flour and other foodstuffs. Officials in the devastated Palestinian territory said on Friday that the kitchens that serve basic meals to those with no other option would be forced to close within a week to 10 days. On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it would not have access to food, medicine and life-saving supplies needed for many of its Gaza programmes unless aid deliveries resumed immediately. “Aid must be allowed to enter Gaza. Hostages must be released. Civilians must be protected,” it said. “Without immediate action, Gaza will descend further into chaos that humanitarian efforts will not be able to mitigate.” Medical workers in Gaza’s remaining health facilities said they were now prioritising cases to make sure available medical stocks were reserved for the most serious. Medicine for chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure is virtually unobtainable, officials said. “I don’t know how people are managing. They have lost everything. The displacement continues every day and more people are searching for shelter and whatever they need to survive,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza. A UN team has been sent to the devastated Palestinian territory to assess levels of malnutrition and the risk of famine. Israeli officials justify the blockade with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months. Media in Israel have reported a plan to use private contractors to distribute food from centralised hubs protected by the Israeli military to Palestinians who have been vetted. Humanitarian officials in Gaza say the plan is unworkable and potentially illegal. The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Thursday that at least 2,326 people had been killed since Israel resumed strikes, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, also mostly civilians.",

    "article_text": "Co-leaders say party is ‘being publicly discredited and criminalised’ by intelligence agency’s move to change classification. This live blog is closed The co-leaders of theAlternative for Germany(AfD) said theywould take legal action against the domestic intelligence agency’s classificationof the party as extremist, describing the decision as a“severe blow to German democracy”. “The AfD is being publicly discredited and criminalised shortly before change of government,”Alice WeidelandTino Chrupallasaidin a statement, translated by Reuters. The party “willcontinue to defend itself legallyagainst these defamatory statements that endanger democracy,” the statement added. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, for today. Germany’sFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the country’s domestic intelligence agency, has just issued an update on its investigation into the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland, classifying it as “confirmed right-wing extremist organisation” (10:27). The agency said that its view, based on a review spanning three years, is thatthe party’s “ethnic-based” policy seeks to “devalue entire population groups” by treating them as second-class citizens(10:41,13:10). The party rejected the classification as defamatory and said it would legally challenge the agency’s findings (12:43). The assessment is“likely to reignite the debate about banning the AfD,”although that is not an automatic process and involves a complex mix of political and judicial elements (10:49), with senior politicians urging caution in jumping to conclusions (12:03,13:32). Elsewhere, TikTokhas been fined €530m for violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation after the Irish Data Protection Commission’s inquiry into its data transfers to China (12:17).

Swedish police arrested four menin connection witha triple murderin Uppsala earlier this week and have released a teen previously detained over the shooting, prosecutors said (15:48). The Vatican has installed its iconic chimney atop Sistine Chapel, which will be used during the process of electing the next pope, starting next week (9:15,14:50).

I am also on Bluesky at@jakubkrupa.bsky.socialand on X at@jakubkrupa. Elsewhere,Swedish police arrested four menin connection witha triple murderin Uppsala earlier this week and have released a teen previously detained over the shooting, prosecutors said. AFP reported that the prosecutors’ previous suspicions against the 16-year-old arrested earlier “have weakened during his time in custody,” and he “is no longer suspected of a crime.” On Thursday, authorities arrested two men suspected of “incitement to murder”, while a third man in his 20s was arrested overnight Thursday to Friday suspected of murder, the statement said. A fourth man around the age of 45 was arrested on Friday, also suspected of incitement to murder, AFP added. Let me now bring you an update fromthe Vatican, as thattemporary chimneythat was going up this morning (9:15) is now firmly in place andready for conclave next week. In other news,Greekauthorities have arrested a man in the strategic port city ofAlexandroupolison suspicion of photographing supply convoys on behalf ofRussia, AFP reported, quoting police. The suspect, a 59-year-old Greek of Georgian descent, was arrested in the northeastern city on Tuesday and on Friday was taken before an investigating magistrate, according to police and media reports. The man “confessed to taking photos and video of military material,acting on behalf of another person to whom he sent the footage via an encrypted application,” the police statement said, as per AFP. A police source told AFP this week that the man, who has identified himself as a house painter, wastargeting military convoys toUkraine,according to footage retrieved from his cellphone. The source added that the suspect, who had served in the Russian army in his youth,had apparently been enlisted by Russia’s GRU military intelligence service via an intermediary– although AFP reported a source as saying that the man told police that he had declined payment and was sending the footage voluntarily. The outgoing interior ministerNancy Faeseralso joined Scholz in warning against jumping to conclusions on a potential AfD ban (12:03), saying in comments reported by Reuters: “A party ban procedure has very high constitutional hurdles for good reasons. That should not be ruled out but we should continue to handle it very carefully. In any case, there is no automatism.” TheBfVhad worked for several months to compile a case against theAfD. The news magazine Der Spiegel said the file presented to the interior ministry this week weighed in at1,100 pages outlining the party’s efforts to erode German democracy. This includedviewing German citizens “with a background of migration from predominantly Muslim countries” as inferiorwhileinciting hostility toward asylum seekers and immigrants. Political analysts and security authorities saythe AfD, which was founded 12 years ago by a group of Eurosceptic professors,has radicalised further with each change in leadership as it ousted more moderate figures. It is now led byAlice WeidelandTino Chrupalla, who during the recent campaignsopenly called for the “remigration”of people they deemed to be “poorly integrated”, including German citizens with foreign roots. The AfD also calls for a break with Germany’s sacrosanct culture of historical remembrance of the Holocaust, repeatedlyusingthinly veiled Nazi slogans, which are outlawed inGermany. In an online chat with Musk in January, Weidel referred toAdolf Hitler as a communist. Full story: The co-leaders of theAlternative for Germany(AfD) said theywould take legal action against the domestic intelligence agency’s classificationof the party as extremist, describing the decision as a“severe blow to German democracy”. “The AfD is being publicly discredited and criminalised shortly before change of government,”Alice WeidelandTino Chrupallasaidin a statement, translated by Reuters. The party “willcontinue to defend itself legallyagainst these defamatory statements that endanger democracy,” the statement added. Elsewhere,TikTokhas been fined €530m for violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation after the Irish Data Protection Commission’s inquiry into its data transfers to China. DPC deputy commissionerGraham Doylesaid in a press statement: “The GDPR requires that the high level of protection provided within the European Union continues where personal data is transferred to other countries. TikTok’s personal data transfers to China infringed the GDPR because TikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of EEA users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU. As a result of TikTok’s failure to undertake the necessary assessments, TikTok did not address potential access by Chinese authorities to EEA personal data under Chinese anti-terrorism, counter-espionage and other laws identified by TikTok as materially diverging from EU standards.” It’s the third highest GDPR fine ever issued since the rulebook’s entry into force in 2018,according to CMS law firm’s enforcement tracker. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency provided very detailed justification for classifying the far-rightAlternative forGermanyas extremist but possible proceedings to ban the party must not be rushed, outgoing chancellorOlaf Scholzsaid, Reuters said. “I am against a quick shot, we have to evaluate the classification carefully,” he said at a church convention in the northern city of Hanover. Deutsche Wellereported a separate statement from outgoing German interior ministerNancy Faeser,who said the party was running a campaign against democratic order. “The AfD represents an ethnic concept that discriminates against entire population groups andtreats citizens with a history of migration as second-class Germans,” she was quoted as saying. The outgoing minister – set to be replaced next week – insistedthere was “no political influence whatsoever”on the findings of the intelligence agency. ARD’sTagesschaunoted that the assessment is“likely to reignite the debate about banning the AfD,”although that is not an automatic process as it requires the Bundestag, the Bundesrat or the government to initiate it by applying to the federal constitutional court. The sensitivity of any such move is obvious giventhe party came second in February’s federal parliamentary electionwith the highest vote share in its history andhas even topped some of the polls sinceamid growing frustration with the delay in formation of the new government. Spiegel reported that the intelligence agency had originally wanted to announce its decision late last year, but decided to delay it to not interfere with the electoral processes triggered by the collapse of Olaf Scholz’s governing coalition. Thepress release on the domestic intelligence agency’s findingexplains that “the finding is based on an extremely careful expert review spanning a period of approximately three years,” with detailed analysis of “numerous statements and positions” from high-level AfD officials. It said that the party’s “ethnic-based” policy “devalues entire population groups inGermanyand violates their human dignity,” as it called out “numerous anti-xenophobic, anti-minority, anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim statements continually made by leading party officials.” Germany’sFederal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the country’s domestic intelligence agency, has just issued an update on its investigation into the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland, classifying it as “confirmed right-wing extremist organisation.” As German media noted, previously only the AfD’s state associations in certain parts of Germany were classified as such, but the national party was given a lower, “suspected” status. Der Spiegelexplainsthat the change in classification – underpinned by a 1,100-page report on the party – lowers the threshold for monitoring the party through intelligence means. “The ethnicity- and ancestry-based conception of the people that predominates within the party is not compatible with the free democratic order,” the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. “It aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, to subject them to treatment that violates the constitution, and thereby assign them a legally subordinate status,” Reuters quoted the statement. The AfD does not consider German citizens of immigrant background from predominantly Muslim countries as equal members of the German people, it added. Elsewhere, a group of activists organisingan aid boat for Gazaclaimed it was attacked by Israeli drones in international waters offMaltaas they headed towards the Palestinian territory, AFP reported. Israel has not commented on the allegation, the agency said. The Maltese government said thateveryone aboardan aid flotilla for Gaza that was hit by droneswas “confirmed safe”. Ukraine’s prime ministerDenys Shmyhaltold parliament that two of the three documents related to a minerals deal with the United States would not need to be ratified, lawmakerYaroslav Zheleznyakwrote on Telegram. In the post, he also claimed that Shmyhalasked parliamentarians to complete the ratification process as soon as possible. Reuters reported that Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers registered the law project to ratify the minerals deal with the US late on Thursday, according to the parliamentary database. Over in theVatican,photographers captured workers installing chimney atop Sistine Chapel this morning, ahead of the conclave that starts on Wednesday. As per tradition, aftereach round of voting, the ballot cards are burned.Chemicals are added to make the smoke black or white. Black smoke emerging from the 60ft chimney indicates an inconclusive ballot; white smoke announces to the world that a new pope has been elected. Russianstrikeswounded more than 30 people in Ukraineovernight, AFP reported, a day after Kyiv and Washington signed a landmark minerals deal. The Russian attacks continue amidgrowing signs from Washington that the Trump administration will approve its first sale of military equipment to Ukraine since Donald Trump took office, in an indication that theminerals deal signed by the two countries this weekmay open a path to renewed weapons shipments. The state department hascertified a proposed licence to export “$50m or more” (£37.6m) of defence hardware and services to Ukraine, according to a communication sent to the US committee on foreign relations. My colleaguesShaun WalkerandAndrew Rothnoted that it would mark the first permission of its kind since Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office. Amid all of this, a sudden departure ofMike Waltzfrom the post of US national security adviser will prompt further questions about what to expect from the Trump administration, with state secretaryMarco Rubiotaking the role on an interim basis. Elsewhere, withlarge parts of Europe in bank holiday weekend mode, I don’t expect too many story lines elsewhere.

    "title": "UK sand eel fishing ban remains in place despite EU legal challenge",
    "article_text": "A ban on fishing for sand eels in UK waters will remain in place despite a legal challenge from the EU. The small, silvery eels make up the bulk of the diet of seabirds, but they are fished for commercial pig food. A lack of sand eels means seabirds such as puffins can starve to death. After the UK left the EU, the previous Conservative government banned European countries from fishing for sand eels in British waters. The EU took the UK to court over the decision in order to support Denmark, which has the largest sand eel fishing fleet. Lawyers argued ministers did not consider the “economic and social” effects of the ban. They used the dispute settlement mechanism of the EU-UK trade and cooperation agreement to contest the ban. The ruling found the decision to close Scottish waters to sand eel fishing was fully upheld, but that during the decision-making process to close English waters to sand eel fishing, the UK did not have sufficient regard to the principle of proportionality, specifically in relation to EU rights during the adjustment period. Ministers said they would bring the process back into compliance but that they did not need to reopen the fishery while they did so. Nature campaigners celebrated the decision. Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sand eel fishing is sound. Also, that UK governments are within their rights to restrict sand eel fishing in UK waters to protect this valuable food source for declining seabirds. “This has been a great example of collaboration between the UK and Scottish governments, and all those in civil society across the UK and the EU that have campaigned long and hard for our threatened seabirds. We now expect the UK government and the EU to move forward and make this closure permanent. Safeguarding sand eel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins,kittiwakesand the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.” Ben Reynolds, executive director of green thinktank IEEP UK, said: “The decision of the tribunal is welcome news for the environment, and for the finding that there is no legal obligation to reverse the closures despite the procedural error being found in the English case. This is one of only a handful of issues where the UK has used its post-Brexit powers to go further than the EU on tightening up protection of the environment.” Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the clarity provided by this decision, and we will undertake a process in good faith to bring the UK into compliance on the specific issues raised by the tribunal.

    "title": "German spy agency labels AfD as ‘confirmed rightwing extremist’ force",
    "article_text": "Germany’s domestic intelligence service has designated the far-rightAlternative für Deutschland(AfD), the biggest opposition party, as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force, meaning authorities can step up their surveillance as critics call for it to be legally banned. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) previously considered the anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin party a “suspected” threat to Germany’s democratic order, with three of the AfD’s regional chapters in eastern statesand its youth wing classed as confirmed extremist. The AfD, which came second in theFebruary general electionwith just over 20% of the vote, said it would challenge the BfV’s decision in court. The BfV said it had concluded that racist and anti-Muslim stances advanced by the AfD, based on an “ethnic-ancestry-based understanding” of German identity, were “incompatible with the free democratic basic order” set out in the country’s constitution. It said the party “aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, to subject them to unconstitutional unequal treatment and thus to assign them a legally devalued status”. The decision will clear the way for tougher measures to monitor the party for suspected illegal activity, including tapping telephone communications, observing its meetings and recruiting secret informants. The AfD is led byAlice Weideland Tino Chrupalla, who have called for the “remigration” of people they deemed to be “poorly integrated”, including German citizens with roots abroad. In a joint statement, Weidel and Chrupalla called the BfV’s decision “politically motivated” and a “severe blow against Germany’s federal democracy”. They said: “The AfD will continue to defend itself legally against these defamatory statements that endanger democracy.” Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, described the BfV ruling as “tyranny in disguise”. Posting on social media, Rubio said: “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies.” The AfD has faced growing calls from opponents for it to be outlawed on the grounds that it seeks to undermine democratic values, including protection of minority rights. Such a ban can be sought by either house of parliament – the Bundestag or the Bundesrat – or by the government itself. The German parliament may use the BfV decision to justify an attempt to cut or block public funding for the party. But Olaf Scholz, the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, warned against rushing to outlaw the AfD. Some opponents of a ban say it could backfire and help promote a victim narrative within the party. Next week,Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democratic Union leader, will be sworn in as Germany’s new chancellor, after his conservative bloc won February’s snap election. However, his party has lost ground since the vote, with several recent polls showing the AfD in first place. Merz will lead a centre-right government with the Social Democrats. Theircoalition agreementbars any explicit or tacit cooperation with the AfD, a policy that all the mainstream parties have called a critical “firewall” to protect German democracy. However, Merz has faced calls from within his party to treat the AfD as a normal opposition force in order to prevent it from casting itself as a political martyr. Merz himself faced fierce criticism in Januaryfor accepting AfD supportfor motions in parliament to restrict migration, which Scholz before the election called an “unforgivable mistake”. The AfD won a record number of seats in the election, theoretically entitling it to chair several key parliamentary committees. However, the BfV’s decision could make other parties less willing to lend their support for such an outcome. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Analysts say the new government will have a limited window to win back voters’ trust or risk the AfD winning outright at the next general election, planned for 2029. The party, which has about 51,000 members, has made strong gains over the last year on the back of voter frustration with immigration policy and an ailing economy. It camefirst in Thuringia’s regional electionin September, marking the first time since the Nazi period that a far-right party had won a state poll. In the same month, it also performed well in two other former communist regions. Afteractive endorsement by Elon Muskduring the campaign, the AfD achieved the best national result for a hard-right party in Germany since the second world war. The Cologne-based BfV based its decision on a 1,100-page report that was presented to the interior ministry this week. The report outlined the party’s efforts to erode democracy, including inciting hostility toward asylum seekers and migrants and viewing German citizens “with a background of migration from predominantly Muslim countries” as inferior. Political analysts and security authorities say the AfD, which was founded 12 years ago by a group of Eurosceptic professors, has become more radicalised with each change in leadership, and particularly when the country faced an influx of refugees in 2015-16. Benjamin Winkler, of the anti-extremist Amadeu Antonio Foundation, welcomed the BfV’s decision, blaming the AfD for increasing the influence of radical groups while stoking racist and anti-migrant sentiment in the wider population. “We see it in the large number of reports about attacks, and in police data about the record number of rightwing extremist crimes in Germany,” he told the news channel n-tv. The AfD has also called repeatedly for a break with Germany’s culture of historical remembrance of the Holocaust, using thinly veiled Nazi slogans, which are outlawed in Germany. In an online chat with Musk in January,Weidel referred to Adolf Hitler as a communist.",

    "title": "Weather tracker: State of emergency as high winds and floods hit New Zealand",
    "article_text": "Strong winds and flooding spread acrossNew Zealandlast week, with a state of emergency declared in Christchurch, after the country was battered by a destructive area of low pressure. A red warning, the highest warning level, was issued by the MetService (the national meteorological service). The area of low pressure quickly deepened in the Tasman Sea off the west coast of New Zealand and travelled eastwards, with the centre of low pressure moving across the northern island and creating very strong winds, particularly through the Cook Strait, the body of water that separates the two islands. The wind direction was a south-easterly to southerly, which caused the winds to strengthen as they were funnelled between the islands. New Zealand’s capital, Wellington, recorded some of the strongest winds, with gusts exceeding 90mph.Floodingwas also an issue, especially for the southern island as the winds brought in moist air from the sea which rapidly rose over the Southern Alps producing heavy rain. More than 100mm of rain fell in less than 12 hours across some eastern areas and the local government called a state of emergency in Christchurch, the largest city in the southern island, as rivers burst their banks and roads closed. Snow warnings were issued across mountainous areas, with some parts experiencing more than 50cm of snowfall in 24 hours. Large swell was produced by the area of low pressure, with waves of almost 6 metres through the Cook Strait. Meanwhile, large areas ofEuropeare experiencing above-average temperatures, particularly in central and north-west regions. Temperatures in Vienna in Austria are expected to soar above 30C through the weekend, more than 10C above the average. Some cities in Germany and France are also expected to experience temperatures of about 30C. The high temperatures are a result of a low-pressure system over Portugal that will continue to drive a warm southerly flow across Europe. However, the high temperatures are not forecast to last, as a cooler northerly flow develops across Europe into next week. This will cause temperatures to drop to about 10C below average, with places that were reaching high 20C this week struggling to get maximum temperatures much above low teens.",

    "title": "Israel says airstrikes in Syria are ‘message’ to protect Druze minority",
    "article_text": "Israeli warplanes have carried out a series of airstrikes outside Damascus and across Syria, after warnings from Israeli officials that the country would intervene to protect the Syria’s minority Druze sect. The airstrikes targeted a Syrian military site in the Damascus suburb of Harasta, as well as hitting unknown targets in Deraa province in southSyriaand Hama province in north-west Syria. At least one civilian was killed and four people were injured as a result of the Israeli bombings late Friday night, according to Syrian state media. The latest round of strikes come after Israel killed four civilians earlier on Friday in a bombing in southern Syria and struck the vicinity of Syria’s presidential palace. Syria’s new rulers hadangrily denounced the raids launched by Israel’s air force against unidentified targets near the presidential palace earlier in the day, warning of a “dangerous escalation”. Syria’s presidency called the strike “a dangerous escalation against state institutions and its sovereignty” and accused Israel of destabilising the country. Israeli officials said the attacks were intended to send a message to the Syrian government after days of bloody clashes near Damascus between pro-government militia forces and fighters from the Druze minority sect. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, said in a joint statement that the attack early on Friday, the second this week in Syria, was intended to deter the country’s new leadership from any hostile move against the Druze. “This is a clear message to the Syrian regime. We will not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community,” the statement said. The Israeli army confirmed in a statement that fighter jets struck near to the area of the palace of the president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Damascus but gave no further details. Israel has said that it will protect the Druze religious minority in Syria, a declaration that most Druze leaders have rebuffed. The head of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria condemned the Israeli strikes in an interview with Al Jazeera on Friday.”The Israeli attacks on Syria are absolutely unacceptable. There is nothing in international law that allows for pre-emptive bombing,” said Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, the chair of the commission. The government in Damascus took power after ousting Bashar al-Assad in December last year and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in the al-Qaida jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multi-confessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks. Clashes broke out in Druze-majority areas outside Damascuson Tuesday after an audio clip circulated on social media of a man making derogatory comments about the prophet Muhammad. The clip, which was falsely attributed to a Druze cleric, angered many Sunni Muslims, but may have been fabricated. On Thursday, one of the three Syrian Druze spiritual leaders, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, accused Syria’s government of what he called an “unjustified genocidal attack” on the minority community. Hijri released a statement calling for international protection for the Druze in southern Syria, asking international forces to “intervene immediately”.

The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shia Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria, largely in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus.

The Syrian government has denied that any of its security forces were involved in the clashes with the Druze, which followed a wave of massacres in March whensecurity forces and allied groups killed more than 1,700 civilians, mostly from Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite community, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since the fall of Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria, destroying military hardware and stockpiles, in what it says is defence of the Druze. Israel has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed. Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country.

Underlining the regional dimension of the conflicts involving Israel, Qatar, a main backer of Syria’s new rulers, called Friday’s Israeli airstrike “blatant aggression against the sovereignty” of the country, while warning alarms sounded across much of northern Israel on Friday before air defence systems intercepted a missile that military officials said had been launched from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel since the outbreak of the war in Gaza 18 months ago.",

    "title": "Gaza blockade: a Palestinian widow, her children and a cupboard that is almost bare",
    "article_text": "Every day, Ibtisam Ghalia and her four children count their remaining stocks of food. These are meagre: a kilo or so of beans, a bag of lentils, a little salt, some herbs, spices, and enough flour for half a dozen flatbreads cooked on a griddle over a fire of wood splinters, waste plastic and cardboard. In the two months sinceIsraelimposed a total blockade on Gaza, stopping food, medicine, fuel and anything else from entering the devastated territory, Ghalia’s “cupboard” has slowly diminished. There have been better days, when Ghalia has received a cash distribution from an NGO and has been able to buy fresh vegetables or fruit on the market, or been given a kilogram of flour by a relative or friend. But prices have risen steadily as the blockade has gone on and basic foodstuffs become scarcer. Sugar that once cost a dollar a kilo now costs 20 times that. A sack of old, poor-quality flour costs far more money than Ghalia can muster. The bakeries run by the World Food Programme shut down weeks ago, all out of flour or fuel. The kitchens that hand out nearly 1 million meals every day in Gaza have limited supplies left.The warehouses of the UN are empty.The family has not eaten meat or dairy products for months. “We are trying as much as possible to stretch our food since the crossings closed … We now eat just one or two meals a day. I divide the bread among my children just to curb their hunger. I try to eat less so there’s enough for them,” Ghalia said. Every day since the ceasefire definitively collapsed six weeks ago, the sound of airstrikes and shelling has been clearly audible in the small tented encampment in farmland near the devastated town of Beit Lahia where Ghalia and her family have pitched their tent. This terrifies her. In December 2023, her husband, Hamza, was killed in an Israeli drone strike along with an uncle and a cousin as they searched for food in the ruins of their former home. “I didn’t scream or fall apart when I found them. I thanked God that I was able to find and bury them. The hospital refused to receive or shroud them, saying they were already decomposing and there were no burial shrouds. So we wrapped them in blankets and buried them ourselves,” Ghalia, 32, remembered. “My children cried every day, asking to see their father. The older two [now 10 and nine] wept constantly, wanting to see him again. I kept comforting them, saying we’ll reunite with him in heaven.” Last week, Ghalia’s sister was hit in the leg by a stray bullet while she was cooking beside the tent. Every day her eldest son, 10-year-old Hossam, heads out into the surrounding wasteland to search for firewood. There is no other fuel, with no cooking gas available and benzene supplies so low that two-thirds of Gaza’s remaining battered fleet of ambulances have been immobilised and only a third of generators in the territory are working. “If he is just a little late coming back, I panic. I cannot lose a son as well as my husband. But we have to cook somehow so I have to send him off. He is only 10 but like an adult now with all his duties and worries.” Her daughter Jinan, 9, has recurrent nightmares about explosions and scattered body parts. “I miss my old life so much. I miss my father – his voice and his smell. He used to take us for kebabs at the weekend. Now, there’s nothing to buy in the markets. Water we get from the nearby school or from water trucks that come to the camp. My older brother and I carry it to our tent,” she said. “I miss school so much. My mother told me that when I grow up, I will become a teacher because I love learning, and I hope I succeed in that … All I fear now is losing one of my siblings. I have nightmares in which I see people being killed, and lots of blood.” About10,000 cases of acute malnutritionamong children have been identified across Gaza, including 1,600 cases of severe acute malnutrition, since the start of 2025, the UN said in a report last week. Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza, said the humanitarian system in the territory was collapsing.“We just have a few days of supplies left. Each day is worse than the one before,” Shawa said. Israeli officials justify the blockade on Gaza with claims that Hamas routinely steals aid, distributing it to its fighters or selling it to raise vital funds. Aid officials in Gaza deny any widespread theft of aid in recent months, though say looting is on the increase since hostilities recommenced “due to the desperate humanitarian situation”. The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel in October 2023, in which militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Israeli officials say one aim of the blockade is to pressure Hamas to release the 59 hostages who remain in Gaza, more than half of whom are thought to be dead. According to the ministry of health in Gaza, between 22 and 30 April, 437 Palestinians were killed and 1,023 were injured. In all, 52,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war, including more than 2,300 since Israel renewed its offensive in mid-March after reneging on a promise to move to a second phase of the fragile ceasefire which came into force in January. “We just want to live in safety. We want the fear to end, the war to stop, life to return to how it used to be. We want our homes back,” Ghalia said, then turned back to counting her dwindling supplies. On Friday, her flour will run out, leaving just the beans and the packet of lentils.",

    "title": "Prince Harry says king ‘won’t speak to him’ and he would ‘love’ to be reconciled",
    "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex has said it is “impossible” for him to bring his wife and children back to the UK after losing his legal challenge over personal security, and revealed he would “love” a reconciliation with his family. In an emotional interview with the BBC,Prince Harrysaid his father, King Charles, would not speak to him “because of the security stuff”, but said he wanted reconciliation as life was “precious” and he did not know how long his father, who has been diagnosed with cancer, had left to live. Speaking in California, where he now lives, Harry, 40, said: “For the time being, it’s impossible for me to take my family back to the UK safely.” He added: “I can’t see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point … I love my country. I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done. I miss the UK. And it’s really quite sad I won’t be able to show my children my homeland.” Harry had sought to overturn changes to his security provision while in the UK, which were made after he and the Duchess of Sussex stepped away from royal duties in 2020. He was offered “bespoke” security, which he felt was inferior and claimed the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (known as Ravec), which authorises security measures, had breached its own terms of reference by not conducting a risk management board (RMB) before making the decision. He insisted his father could help resolve the issue, though he had not asked him to intervene. “I can only come to the UK safely if I am invited, and there is a lot of control and ability in my father’s hands. “Ultimately, this whole thing could be resolved through him, not by intervening, but by stepping aside and allowing the experts to do what is necessary and to carry out an RMB,” he said. It is understood it would have been constitutionally improper for the king to intervene while the matter was being considered by the government and reviewed by the courts. Although the royal household provides representation and input into the Ravec decision, Friday’s judgment laid out that the chair of the Ravec committee was the decision maker on the provision of security. Royal private offices and private secretaries should be consulted as to the practicalities of the protection measures agreed, the ruling said. Harry appealed to the prime minister, Keir Starmer, saying: “This all was initiated under a previous government. There is now a new government. I have had it described to me by people who know about the facts that this is a good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up. And that’s what it feels like.” Asked whether the prime minister should “step in”, he replied: “Yes, I would ask the prime minister to step in. “I would ask Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, to look at this very, very carefully and I would ask her to review Ravec and its members, because if it is an expert body, then what is the royal household’s role there if it is not to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?” The prime minister would be “quite reluctant” to become involved in decisions about Harry’s security, a senior cabinet minister said on Friday night. Pat McFadden told Sky News: “I think he would be quite reluctant to make a judgment about someone’s personal security needs. We have experts who do that for a reason, and I’m not sure it’s a good idea for any politician to be saying that that person requires this level or that level of security.” On his family rift, Harry said: “There have been so manydisagreements, differences between me and some of my family. This current situation, that has been ongoing now for five years with regard to human life and safety as the sticking point. It is the only thing that’s left. “Of course some members of my family will never forgive me forwriting a book, of course they will never forgive me for lots of things, but … I would love reconciliation with my family. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “There’s no point in continuing to fight any more. Life is precious. I don’t know how much longer my father has. He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff. But it would be nice to reconcile.” He added: “If they want that, it’s entirely up to them.” Harry said he could never leave the royal family, though he had left the “institution” because “I had to”. He continued: “Whether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the threats, risk and impact on the reputation of the UK if something was to happen. What really worries me more than anything else about today’s decision [is that] it set a new precedent that security can be used to control members of the family, and effectively, what it does is imprison other members of the family from being able to choose a different life.” He claimed that, through the court disclosure process, he had “discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, which is pretty dark”. Asked who he meant, Harry declined to answer. In astatement released on the Sussexes’ website, Harry said: “Ravec’s ability to make decisions outside of its own policies and the so-called political sensitivities of my case have prevailed over the need for fair and consistent decision-making. The court has decided to defer to this, revealing a sad truth: my hands are tied in seeking legal recourse against the establishment. “This all comes from the same institutions that preyed upon my mother, that openly campaigned for the removal of our security, and that continue to incite hatred towards me, my wife and even our children, while at the same time protecting the very power that they should be holding accountable.” He told the BBC he was “devastated” by the court’s decision, adding: “Not so much devastated with the loss [as] about the people behind the decision feeling as though this is OK. Is it a win for them? I’m sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.” He indicated that he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Friday’s ruling had “proven that there was no way to win this through the courts”. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.”",

    "title": "Co-op apologises after hackers extract ‘significant’ amount of customer data",
    "article_text": "The Co-op has apologised after hackers accessed and extracted data relating to a “significant number” of its customers from one of its systems. The group, which owns more than 2,000 grocery stores and more than 800 funeral parlours and offers legal and financial services, said hackers had been able to access personal data including names and contact details relating to an undisclosed number of the mutual’s current and past members – of which there are more than 6.2 million. The Co-op wasforced to shut downparts of its IT system on Wednesday after discovering an attempted hack days after Marks & Spencer faced aserious cyber-incident. It said the hackers had not been able to access passwords or financial information such as bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members’ or customers’ products or services with the Co-op Group. However, in a message to Co-op members, Shirine Khoury-Haq, the chief executive of the group, recommended that members “take the usual steps to keep their passwords safe”. “While we have been able to protect our Co-op from significant trading disruption, which is often the intent of these sorts of attacks, I am very sorry that this member information was accessed,” she wrote. “While there is no impact to your account, and you can continue to trade with us as normal, I appreciate that members will be concerned.” The National Cyber Security Centre and the National Crime Agency are assisting with the investigation, the company said. A Co-op spokesperson said: “We are continuing to experience sustained malicious attempts by hackers to access our systems. This is a highly complex situation, which we continue to investigate in conjunction with the NCSC and the NCA. “We have implemented measures to ensure that we prevent unauthorised access to our systems whilst minimising disruption for our members, customers, colleagues and partners. “We now know that the hackers were able to access and extract data from one of our systems. The accessed data included information relating to a significant number of our current and past members. “This data includes Co-op Group members’ personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members’ passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members’ or customers’ products or services with the Co-op Group. “We appreciate that our members have placed their trust in our Co-op when providing information to us. Protecting the security of our members’ and customers’ data is a priority, and we are very sorry that this situation has arisen.” The leak of data from the Co-op emerged after the data protection regulator said it was “making inquiries” with the Co-op and Marks & Spencer. It is understood that M&S customer data has not been accessed. Stephen Bonner, deputy commissioner of the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We recognise that seeing cyber-attacks in the news can be concerning, especially if you are a customer. “If you are worried about your personal information, you can visit our website foradvice and support. Make sure your accounts are protected by a strong password and that you are not using the same password across multiple accounts. “We also advise checking regularly for updates from the organisation and following their advice if they confirm that your personal information has been impacted by a cyber-attack.”",

    "title": "Prince Harry loses legal challenge over police protection in UK",
    "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex has lost a legal challenge over the level of taxpayer-funded security he is entitled to while in the UK, allowing the government to proceed with a “bespoke”, and cheaper, level of protection for his family. Three senior judges at the court of appeal rejected Prince Harry’s claim that he had been “singled out” for “inferior treatment” and that his safety and life were “at stake” after a change in security arrangements that occurred when he stepped down as a working royal and moved abroad. He had challenged the dismissal of his high court claim against theHome Officeover the decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known as Ravec, that he should receive a different degree of protection when in the country. Sir Geoffrey Vos, the master of the rolls, said: “I concluded, having studied the detailed documents, I could not say the duke’s sense of grievance translated into a legal argument for a challenge to Ravec’s decision.” The ruling will be a personal blow to Harry who said he was “overwhelmed” by the case when he flew back for the two-day hearing last month. Speaking to a Daily Telegraph reporter outside the hearing, he suggested he considered the appeal more important than his other legal battle against tabloids, saying “this one always mattered the most”. Barristers for Harry, 40, told the appeal court that Ravec did not follow its own “terms of reference” when deciding his security. Shaheed Fatima KC said his safety, security and life were “at stake”, and that the “human dimension” of the case should not be forgotten. “We do say that his presence here, and throughout this appeal, is a potent illustration, were one needed, of how much this appeal means to him and his family,” said Fatima. The Home Office, which is legally responsible for Ravec’s decisions, opposed the appeal. Sir James Eadie KC, for the Home Office, said Ravec was faced with a “unique set of circumstances”. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.” In a ruling on Friday, Vos, Lord Justice Bean and Lord Justice Edis dismissed Harry’s appeal. Reading a summary of the decision, Vos said:”The Duke was in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec. “Outside the UK, he was outside the cohort, but when in the UK, his security would be considered as appropriate.” He continued: “It was impossible to say that this reasoning was illogical or inappropriate, indeed it seemed sensible.” A high court judge ruled last year that Ravec’s decision, taken in early 2020 after Harry andMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped down as senior working royals, was lawful. Harry’s legal team argued the judge had erred in his judgment. Ravec’s final decision, shared on 28 February 2020, stated thatMetropolitan policeprotection would no longer be appropriate after the Sussexes’ departure, and that they should receive a different degree of protection when in the UK. The Sussexes would instead receive a “bespoke” security service, whereby they would be required to give 30 days’ notice of any plans to travel to the UK, with each visit being assessed for threat levels and whether protection is needed. Critics of Harry have said he raised his own profile as a possible terrorist target in 2023 after disclosing in his memoir Spare that he had killed 25 Taliban fighters. Harry could appeal, but would need permission to do so, according to the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. “There wasn’t an application for permission just now from the court of appeal. There might be one in writing. If permission is refused, then Prince Harry’s lawyers could go and ask the supreme court for permission,” Rozenberg told Sky News. “But what the supreme court will look at is whether this is a case of general public interest, general public importance. It seems to me it’s one of very, very specific importance to Prince Harry.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.”",

    "article_text": "This liveblog is now closed. See all of our local elections coveragehere Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has claimed that these elections mark “the beginning of the end of the Conservative party”. Speaking at a rally in Consett in Country Durham, he said: [This is] the beginning of the end of the Conservative party. They may well have been around since 1832 and the Great Reform Act, but they’ve been wiped out in the shires of England, wiped out in those West Midlands, southern, south-western areas where they’ve got their members, they’ve got their councillors, they’ve got their base, they raise the money. They all frankly cease to exist. And they now become an obstacle. Because what is perfectly clear, given those mayoral contests in both Donny [Doncaster] and indeed North Tyneside, is that whilst we clearly are the main challenges to Labour in the Midlands and the north, if you vote Conservative you stop our chances of winning. If you vote Conservative, you get Labour. But if you vote Reform in the Midlands and the north, from now up until the general election, you get Reform.

There are still some council results to come in and you can keep up to date with those in our results tracker: You can also find all our local elections 2025 coveragehereand take a look at how the big parties fared inPeter Walker’s verdict: Below is a summary of the key events from today: Nigel Farage claimed he had broken the grip of Britain’s two main political partiesas Reform UK gained an MP and swept to a string of victories in England’s local elections, making deep inroads into Labour and Conservative heartlands.On a sobering day for Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch that broughtimmediate recriminations, Reform UK took hundreds of councillors from the struggling Tories and won the Runcorn and Helsby byelection by just six votes ahead of Labour. Of the six mayoral elections, Labour won three of them, Reform UK won two and theConservativeswon one. In further signs of fracturing political loyalties, a BBC projection of how the voting would have looked in a UK-wide election put Reform first on 30%, Labour on 20%, theLiberal Democratson 17%, the Conservatives fourth with 15% and the Greens on 11%. Speaking at a rally, Farage said the elections marked “the beginning of the end of the Conservative party”.Toasting newly elected councillors in Staffordshire, Farage said the results of the local and mayoral elections represented a “seismic” change in British politics. He said the next target for Reform UK would be the Welsh and Scottish parliamentary elections. The Liberal Democrats made renewed gains in previously Conservative heartlands, taking control in Oxfordshire as the Tories lost 15 seats, and also taking over in Cambridgeshire and Shropshire.The Greens picked up dozens of new councillors and came third in the West of England mayoral race, one they had harboured hopes of winning. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey claimed Friday’s results had put his party on track to overtake the Tories at the next general election. He also said the Lib Dems had replaced the Tories as the “party of middle England”. More surprising was the scale of Labour losses, with the party losing proportionally fewer seats than the Tories, but with some major localised drubbings, such as a net loss of 38 seats in Durham and 27 in Lancashire. Speaking on a visit to a defence factory in Luton, Starmer said: “What I want to say is, my response is, we get it. We were elected in last year to bring about change … I am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.” Kemi Badenoch apologised to Conservative councillors who lost their seats on Friday. The Conservative party leader said that while the public were “fed up” with Labour, they were not yet ready to trust the Tories.Earlier on Friday Badenoch said the elections were always going to be difficult for Tories, and renewal of her party had “only just begun”. Ros Jones held off Reform UK to keep the Doncaster mayoralty but was among the most vocal critics of Starmer’s record on Friday, highlighting cuts to the winter fuel allowance as a subject stoking voters’ anger, as well as reductions in disability payments and a rise in national insurance. There was also criticism from a number of Labour MPs, albeit with those going public tending to be from the left of the party. Nigel Farage suggested thatReform UKcould cut diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and climate change policy jobs, as well as ending working from home.He told the BBC: “If you work from home, forget it. If you’re a DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] officer, I suggest you look for another job.” Speaking in Staffordshire, the Reform UK leader said: “Maybe a bit of a warning if you do work for Staffordshire county council and you are involved in climate change policy, or involved with DEI, or anything like that. It may be time to go and look for a different job because we want county councils to do what they are there to do.” Labour will have to take Thursday’s local election results “on the chin”, a senior cabinet minister has said. Pat McFaddentold Sky News: I think when you get poor results, there’s no point in soft soaping it or trying to dance around it, they are poor results, anybody can see that looking at them. You’ve got to take that on the chin when you’re in government. This happens at local elections sometimes and you’ve got to respond to them. Saying he could “understand people’s sense of anger and frustration”, he insisted that the government was bringing change to the country, reports the PA news agency. He added: We have got to keep our foot on the gas, keep changing things and the critical heart of it is people want to see their living standards go up and those waiting lists go down. Staffordshire county councilunder the Conservatives was “very woke”, Reform UK leaderNigel Faragehas said, as he celebrated his party taking control. Speaking to reporters atStaffordshire county showgroundon Friday, Farage said: Here in Staffordshire we are now in charge. I have been perfectly clear about the excesses of expenditure, about the different areas that this very woke county council under the Conservatives have been involved in. County councils are there to perform basic functions for taxpayers. We want to slim down the size of local government and re-prioritise it on what its job really is. And you will judge us, quite rightly, on how we do. The government now has a “real problem” after Reform UK’s local and mayoral election wins, Farage added. He said: They’ve got a bit of headache now haven’t they? In the House of Commons the other day, Keir Starmer said ‘Nigel Farage will eat the Conservatives for breakfast’. I think he forgot – we’re going to eat the Labour party for lunch as well. He’s got a real problem. He added: There is a sense of unfairness, bordering on resentment, that tens of thousands of young men come into our country, get put up in hotels, get given everything. In Staffordshire they even get given driving lessons, and it’s the people with alarm clocks that get up in the morning, go to work and pay ever more tax to fund it. I think with this government, this issue could do them as much harm as it did the last Conservative government. Before this week’s local elections,John Harriswas on the road inDoncaster. You can listen to his reporting in the podcast linked below: Reform UK leaderNigel Faragesaid the results of the local and mayoral elections represents “seismic” change in British politics. Speaking inStaffordshire, he said: I have been doing this game for about 30 years and in many ways what happened last night is without a doubt the most significant day in my political career. It is a seismic change in British politics. It is of a proportion nobody could even have dreamt of. We want our country back, we want to reestablish the right values around family, community and country. AsReform UKcouncillors proposed a toast to the party leader, Farage was offered someone’s half-finished glass of champagne, which he finished. He joked: “Having not been to bed yet, that does taste rather good.” The next target for Reform UK will be the Welsh and Scottish parliamentary elections, leaderNigel Faragehas said, as he celebrated the party taking control ofStaffordshire county council. The PA news agency reports him saying: I honestly believe, we have cleared this hurdle, next year we will go for the Welsh and Scottish parliamentary elections, and I believe we can and we will win that next general election. Farage gave a warning to those working in certain policy areas at Staffordshire county council. He said: Maybe a bit of a warning if you do work for Staffordshire county council and you are involved in climate change policy, or involved with DEI, or anything like that. It may be time to go and look for a different job because we want county councils to do what they are there to do. They are not there to fight climate change, they are not there to waste money the way they have been. He added: Why don’t we say no to the massive wind farm proposed at Staffordshire Moorlands? Why don’t we say no to the huge 120 football pitch solar farm proposed at Cheadle? And we must say no to spending £18,000 on giving asylum seekers driving lessons. I wish you all the luck in the world – it won’t be easy, it will be a learning curve, but it is an incredible opportunity. Nigel Faragesays he believes Reform UK can win the next general election after witnessing “historic” local election gains for the party. Speaking to newly elected Reform UK councillors atStaffordshire county showgroundon Friday, the party leader said he did not want to hear any more about any deals with the Conservatives. He said: About half an hour ago John Curtice on the BBC has put out his projection of what these elections would mean had a general election taken place across the whole of the UK. The figures are remarkable. They show us at the general election on 30%, the Labour party on 20%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and the Conservatives on 15%. That would mean the Conservatives would only win 12 seats. We would have a massive majority. I don’t want to hear any more about deals with the Conservative party. They betrayed trust over the course of 14 years, we are going to chart our own course. It is truly a historic day. Nigel Faragehas said the Conservative party is “over” and will never be able to recover as he addressed new Reform councillors inStaffordshire. Speaking atStaffordshire county showgroundon Friday evening, theReform UKleader said: Forty three years ago today, the British submarine sunk the pride of the Argentinian fleet, the Belgrano. Yesterday, a motor torpedo boat with me at the helm and all of you on the back, sunk HMS the Conservative party. They are over, they are finished, they have literally been gutted in these counties, it is a position from which they will never, ever recover. Up north what we have seen is that if you vote Conservative, you get Labour. We clearly are now the second place party, we clearly are the challengers to the government, so that is something we will be pushing over the course of the next couple of years. Reform UK’s successes in the local elections “spell the end of two-party politics”, Farage said. The Reform UK leader visited Staffordshire to congratulate the party’s newly elected councillors on Friday and celebrated the party taking control of the county council with champagne. He told councillors: The result clearly spells the end of two-party politics as we’ve known it all our life. But actually there is something much more significant happening in these shires. Here in the heart of England and in many other places too, these are the areas the Conservative party has relied on for ever. These are the areas where they have councillors, these area are where the activists work with the councillors, areas where they have strong fundraising, strong branches, strong membership. He added: We are witnessing the death of a party that has been around for almost 200 years. They cannot, they will not recover from that position. Reform UK have won control ofDoncaster councilfrom Labour, in another blow toKeir Starmerin his party’s traditional heartlands. Reform UK have taken 29 seats on the council, with Labour on three andConservativestwo, with several results still to be declared, according to the PA news agency. Labour previously controlled the council with 41 seats, with Conservatives on 11 and independents on three. TheLiberal Democratshave taken control ofShropshire councilafter winning the 38 seats needed for a majority. The council was previously in no overall control (NOC) with theConservativeson 37 seats and the Lib Dems 18. TheLiberal Democratsbelieve they have won control ofShropshire county councilfor the first time, but there hasn’t been an official declaration yet. The Lib Dems need 38 seats for an overall majority here. I’ll update once there is a confirmation of the results. Nigel Faragehas declared a new dawn before, but this time things could really be different, writes my colleagueKiran Stacey. You can read his analysis here: The government needs “a change of plan”, a long-servingLabourMP has said following the local elections. Emma Lewell, who has representedSouth Shieldssince 2013, said in a post on X: Trust matters. If you promise people that you will be focused on serving the public and then do not listen to them, do not expect them to vote for you. Withdrawal of winter fuel, denial of compensation for the Waspi women, and proposed disability cuts, have all broken that trust. And, referring to Starmer’s post-election comments (see11.35amBST), Lewell wrote: It is tone deaf to keep repeating we will move further and faster on our plan for change. What is needed is a change of plan. Nigel Faragehas told BBC Look North that Reform UK will be a “radical, a breath of fresh air in county hall” and that his party will have a “very different approach to local government”. He also suggested thatReform UKcould cut diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) jobs and working from home. Farage told the BBC: There is too much wasteful expenditure, and trying to do too many things, we want to try and change that. If you work from home, forget it. If you’re a DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] officer, I suggest you look for another job. Voters have “chosen our community politics over the Conservative party’s neglect and disdain”, Liberal Democrat leaderEd Daveyhas said. Davey said: We have overtaken the Conservatives at these local elections, putting us on track to overtake them at the next general election too. From Wiltshire to Oxfordshire, from Shropshire to Devon, the Liberal Democrats have replaced the Conservatives as the party of middle England. Lifelong Conservative voters have put their faith in the Liberal Democrats because they are appalled by the Conservatives lurching to the extremes and cosying up to Nigel Farage. Kemi Badenoch sneered at the Liberal Democrats for being the party that will fix your church roof. Today voters across the country have chosen our community politics over the Conservative party’s neglect and disdain.” The Conservatives lost control ofHertfordshireto no overall control (NOC) after losing 21 seats as Reform UK gained 13 and theLiberal Democratsnine, reports the PA news agency. The new council has the Lib Dems as the largest party with 31,Conservativeson 22, Reform UK on 14, Labour and Greens five each and one independent. After final results were in from16 of the 23 English councils holding elections, Reform UK had almost 500 councillors, after gaining 476 seats, with theLiberal Democratsin second place with 237, up 86. TheConservativeshad 199 seats, down 411, and Labour 56, after losing 137 seats, leavingKeir Starmer’s party one behind the Greens, who were up 29, while independents had 55 councillors, down 61. Kemi Badenochhas said that Labour, theLiberal Democratsand Reform UK are all threats to the Conservatives. Speaking to reporters, Badenoch said: This is a very competitive political environment, all of the parties have always been competitors to us. They are all threats, whether it’s Labour, Lib Dem or Reform, and the way we win is by making sure that people can see that this is an authentic Conservative party that stays true to its principles and its values, and that those values reflect the values of the majority of people in the country. TheLiberal Democratshave said they have replaced the Tories as the “party of middle England” after winning control ofOxfordshire county councilfor the first time. A Lib Dem spokesperson shared the following statement: We have replaced the Conservatives as the party of middle England. Kemi Badenoch’s party have taken a pasting at these elections in a set of results that can only been described as a humiliation. The Lib Dems also won control ofCambridgeshire county councilfor the first time (see 5.27pm BST). The Lib Dems gained 16 seats in Oxfordshire to win the council from no overall control (NOC), with Greens up four,Conservativesdown eight, independents down three, Labour down two and Reform UK down one. The new council is Lib Dem 36, Labour 12, Conservative 10, Green seven, independent two, resident one and Reform UK one. The Lib Dems also gained control of Cambridgeshire from NOC after picking up eight seats, withReform UKgaining 10 and Greens three, as the Conservatives lost 10, independents six and Labour five. The new council is Lib Dem 31, Conservative and Reform UK both 10, Labour five, Green three and independents two.",

    "title": "Farage claims Reform UK local election gains ‘beginning of the end’ for Tories",
    "article_text": "Nigel Farage claimed he had broken the grip of Britain’s two main political parties as Reform UK gained an MP and swept to a string of victories in England’s local elections, making deep inroads into Labour and Conservative heartlands. On a sobering day for Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch that broughtimmediate recriminations, Reform took hundreds of councillors from the struggling Tories and won the Runcorn and Helsby byelection by just six votes ahead of Labour. In further signs of fracturing political loyalties, a BBC projection of how the voting would have looked in a UK-wide election put Reform first on 30%, Labour on 20%, theLiberal Democratson 17%, the Conservatives fourth with 15% and the Greens on 11%. An increasingly jubilant Farage said his hard-right populist party had now supplanted theConservatives, as he pledged that Reform-run councils and mayoralties would block asylum seeker accommodation and, in a direct echo of Donald Trump, dismantle equalities programmes. “We’ve dug very deep into theLabourvote and in other parts of England we’ve dug deep into the Conservative vote, and we are now, after tonight there’s no question, in most of the country, we are now the main opposition party to this government,” Farage said. Speaking at a later rally, Farage said the elections marked “the beginning of the end of the Conservative party”. Reform won in Runcorn and Helsby with a 17-point swing away from Labour, overturning a majority of more than 14,000. Its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister, easily won the new mayoralty of Greater Lincolnshire, and the party also took the mayoralty in Hull and East Yorkshire. By late on Friday, Reform had taken control of 10 councils – Durham, Kent, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North Northamptonshire, Doncaster and West Northamptonshire – with a gain of 648 seats. The Tories lost all 15 of the councils they were defending. While moving from a protest party to one with responsibility for policy and delivery could bring risks, Farage used a victory rally in County Durham to pledge a pushback against equality and diversity programmes and allowing council staff to work from home. “I would advise anyone who’s working for Durham county council on climate change initiatives, or diversity, equity and inclusion, or thinks they can go on working from home, I think you had all better really be seeking alternative careers very, very quickly,” he warned. Farage also said Reform would resist asylum seekers being accommodated in Reform-run areas, while Jenkyns called for them to be placed in tents. “I say no to putting people in hotels. Tents are good enough for France, they should be good enough for here in Britain,” Jenkyns said, an apparent reference to the makeshift camps used by asylum seekers along the French coast. A rout of Conservative councillors had been widely predicted, including by Badenoch, in part because the party had done so well the last time the seats were contested, during the short-lived Covid “vaccine bounce” under Boris Johnson in 2021. But the shedding of so many seats – by late Friday there was a net loss above 50% – plus the fourth place in the projected vote share will place renewed pressure on Badenoch, whose insistence of a slow buildup on policy ideas has worried some of her MPs. The Liberal Democrats made renewed gains in previously Conservative heartlands, taking control in Oxfordshire as the Tories lost 15 seats, and also taking over in Cambridgeshire and Shropshire. The Greens picked up dozens of new councillors and came third in the West of England mayoral race, one they had harboured hopes of winning. More surprising was the scale of Labour losses, with the party losing proportionally fewer seats than the Tories, but with some major localised drubbings, such as a net loss of 38 seats in Durham and 27 in Lancashire. Speaking on a visit to a defence factory in Luton, Starmer said: “What I want to say is, my response is, we get it. We were elected in last year to bring about change … I am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.” Labour officials accepted that some results had been bad but in part blamed a greater-than-expected collapse in the Tory vote, which helped Reform make gains in three-way contests. A Labour source said there were some signs of government policies starting to resonate with voters, pointing to Ros Jones holding off Reform to keep the Doncaster mayoralty following central investment to reopen the local airport. “Doncaster is a good example of the sort of muscular government that voters notice,” the source said. “When the PM says further and faster, it’s about positive change, now we’ve made the difficult fiscal decisions.” It was nonetheless notable that Jones was among the most vocal critics of Starmer’s record on Friday, highlighting cuts to the winter fuel allowance as a subject stoking voters’ anger, as well as reductions in disability payments and a rise in national insurance. Asked whether the prime minister was listening to her voters, Jones said: “I would say no. They haven’t actually realised, because the people of Doncaster know how hard life can be, and it’s about delivering for them.” Pat McFadden, a senior cabinet member, said late on Friday that Labour would “welcome” a contest with a Reform party that wants to “rewind the clock”. Pointing to comments from Jenkyns, who saidReform UKwould “reset Britain to its glorious past”, McFadden said: “We’re in a fast-changing world, we’ve got a changing security situation here in Europe, a changing trade picture, massive technological change. “If the battle in the future is one side saying they want to rewind the clock and another side saying we’re going to lead you into the future, we will make the most of these changes, we’re going to try to have Britain best placed in this changing world, then that’s a battle that we will welcome.” There was criticism from a number of Labour MPs, albeit with those going public tending to be from the left of the party. Others did join in. Ayesha Hazarika, a Labour peer and former adviser, said the party needed to “admit that some mistakes were made, like the winter fuel allowance”. Speaking on Times Radio, she said the result in Runcorn would “throw up some big questions about the strategy and the operation”. When given anonymously, the verdict was particularly damning. One seniorLabourMP said: “I was quite shocked at how complacent the campaign was, especially in Runcorn but nationally as well. Everyone seemed convinced we were going to win by a reasonably comfortable margin. “The NHS message does not work against Farage, but the centre wouldn’t hear it, or the fact that Keir’s unpopularity was brought up on almost every door.” A second Labour MP said: “The boys in No 10 should spend less time briefing about who’s driving the train and more time actually getting on with building the tracks.” A third said: “It’s all very well for No 10 to say we’ve got to keep delivering. The problem is that it’s the stuff we’ve delivered that people hate.”",

    "title": "Six Swarthmore College students suspended over pro-Palestinian camp",
    "article_text": "Over the first two days of May, a total of six Swarthmore College students were interim suspended for the creation of a campus encampment earlier in the week. The students in Swarthmore,Pennsylvania, were suspended without due process and were told to evacuate from campus, said Swarthmore’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) in a2 May statement. Of the six students who were temporarily suspended, four werepeople of colorand three were first-generation, low-income students, the statement continued: “This is part of a disturbing trend of Swarthmore exploiting the vulnerabilities of student protesters on the basis of racialized discrimination.” The students on interim suspension are banned from attending college events or stepping foot on campus. Swarthmore SJP did not respond to a request for comment by the publication date. In a 1 Maystatementto the campus community, Swarthmore College’s president, Valerie Smith, said that the protesters had vandalized campus property. “Should they continue to fail to disperse and violate the college’s policies and the law,” Smith said, “we will have no choice but to escalate our response as we consider all actions to bring the encampment to an end.” SJP used social media to encourage activists outside of the college to join the encampment, Smith said, and they ignored repeated requests to vacate Trotter Lawn, where they erected the camp. “We informed students multiple times, both verbally and in writing, that they were violating several policies in the student code of conduct. Students were instructed to disband the encampment and leave Trotter Lawn, and repeatedly warned that failure to do so would lead to interim suspensions.” Swarthmore College isone of 60 schoolsunder investigation for what the Trump administration considers antisemitic harassment on campus. A handful of higher-education institutions have started campus encampments this spring in a revival of last year’s pro-Palestinian movement in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza, where at least62,000 Palestinianshave been killed since 7 October 2023, when roughly 1,100 Israelis were killed. But this year, pro-Palestinian campus protests have been dampened by crackdowns and punitive measures from theTrump administration. On Yale University’s campus in late April, hundreds of student protesters set up an encampment thatdispersedwithin a couple of days. On 22 April,44 Yale studentswere arrested, with some of them facingdisciplinary actionfrom the university. And at Tulane University, seven students arefacing punitive measuresincluding suspension or expulsion for attending an off-campus protest in New Orleans demanding the release of the pro-Palestinian former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil. On Swarthmore College’s campus, SJP memberssaidthat they plan to remain in their encampment: “These repudiations are inconsequential when we remember what we are here for: the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people who have been martyred and displaced yet continue to resist in the face of genocidal violence.”",

    "title": "Win for Maine as Trump officials agree to halt school funding freeze",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas agreed not to freeze funds to Maine schools, a win for a state that was targeted by the president over its support of transgender rights. In a settlement disclosed on Friday, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said it would halt all efforts to withhold funds for a child nutrition program in Maine. The USDA had suspended those dollars after Maine officialssaidthe state would not comply with Donald Trump’s demands that trans girls be barred from participating in girls’ sports. In February, when the president directly threatened to revoke funding from the state at a White House meeting with governors, Janet Mills, Maine’s Democratic governor,had responded, “We’ll see you in court,” in a widely shared exchange. Maine thensued the USDA last monthto maintain its funding and agreed on Friday to drop its lawsuit in exchange for the restoration of funds. “It’s good to feel a victory like this,” the governor said a press conference, thePortland Press Herald reported. “I stood in the White House and when confronted by the president of the United States, I told him I’d see him in court. Well, we did see him in court, and we won.” The governor said USDA had frozen funds for a program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state, the paper reported. The USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement says the USDA and Brooke Rollins, the secretary of agriculture, “agree to refrain from freezing, termination, or otherwise interfering with the state of Maine’s access to United States Department of Agriculture funds … based on alleged violations of Title IX without first following all legally required procedures”. The Trump administration had alleged that Maine’s policy of allowing transgender youth’s participation in sports violated Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law. Maine’s attorneys argued that the child nutrition program received or was due to receive more than $1.8m for the current fiscal year. Prior year funds that were awarded but are currently inaccessible total more than $900,000, the lawsuit said. The complaint also said that the program was anticipating about $3m that is typically awarded every July for summer meal program sponsor administration and meal reimbursement. A federal judge had ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funds last month after finding that Maine was likely to succeed in its legal challenge. Aaron Frey, the Maine attorney general, said in a statement on Friday: “It’s unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations. “But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.” The settlement does not affectanother ongoing lawsuitfiled by the Trump administration against the Maine department of education over its policy for trans athletes. Mills said Friday she was “confident” the state would also prevail in that case, the Portland Press Herald reported. The governor, who has said the dispute was aboutdefending states’ rights, added: “These bullying tactics, we will not tolerate them.”",

    "title": "Idaho: seven people killed in highway crash near Yellowstone, police say",
    "article_text": "A pickup truck and a tour van collided on a highway leading to Yellowstone national park, leaving seven people dead and eight others injured,Idahostate police said. The crash happened just before 7.15pm on Thursday near Henry’s Lake state park in eastern Idaho, police said in a press release. The state park is roughly 16 miles (26km) west of Yellowstone. Authorities have not said what led to the crash. Both vehicles caught fire, the Idaho state police said in a press release. The driver of the Dodge Ram pickup and six people inside the Mercedes passenger van died. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the surviving occupants were taken to hospitals with injuries, a police spokesman, Aaron Snell, said. Air ambulances and emergency paramedics responded to the collision, which remains under investigation. The Fremont county coroner, Brenda Dye, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that the pickup driver was from Texas and that all six occupants of the van who died were from outside the United States, two of them from Italy. Roger Merrill, 60, was driving home when he saw the flames engulfing the two vehicles as bystanders tried to care for survivors from the van on the side of the highway. Merrill said he often saw tourist vans on the highway that leads to Yellowstone. “It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone national park,” he said. “It’s extremely busy.” Merrill captured video of the wreckage with smoke blanketing the van. Due to the remote location, Merrill said he anxiously awaited the help of first responders. “It took an unnervingly long time for help to arrive just because of the location,” he said. According to Dye, two eyewitnesses to the crash jumped out of their vehicle to pull victims from the van, and managed to extract eight people from the wreckage, including a child, before the van caught fire, the Times reported. The Idaho transportation department has identified the highway for safety improvements designed to reduce the severity of crashes, but the project is still in the research and planning phase. That portion of the highway had an average of about 10,500 vehicles traveling it daily in 2023, according to the agency. State police said the highway was closed in both directions for nearly seven hours while emergency and transportation crews worked to manage the scene and clear the roadway.

    "article_text": "AnIllinoislandlord who killed asix-year-old Muslim boyand severely injured his mother in a vicious hate-crime attack days after the war in Gaza began was sentenced on Friday to 53 years in prison. Joseph Czuba, 73, wasfound guiltyin February of murder, attempted murder and hate-crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen. Czuba targeted them in October 2023 because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war betweenIsrael and Hamas. The Palestinian American family were renting rooms from Czuba at a suburban Chicago house at the time of the attack. “No sentence can restore what was taken, but today’s outcome delivers a necessary measure of justice,” said Ahmed Rehab, executive director of Cair-Chicago. “Wadee was an innocent child. He was targeted because of who he was – Muslim, Palestinian, and loved.” The boy’s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member who spoke during the hearing. He said that no matter the sentence length it wouldn’t be enough. The boy’s parents had plans for him and Czuba robbed them of that, he said. Yousef asked Czuba to explain why he attacked the boy and his mother, asking him what news he heard that provoked him, but Czuba did not respond, the Chicago Tribune reported. Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated for less than 90 minutes on Friday before handing in a verdict.Illinoisdoes not have the death penalty. The family had been renting rooms in Czuba’s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (65km) from Chicago. Central to prosecutors’ case was harrowing testimony from the boy’s mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba’s wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about theIsrael-Gaza war, which had erupted days earlier. Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child’s body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee’s relatives. “He could not escape,” Michael Fitzgerald, a Will county assistant state’s attorney, had told jurors at trial. The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Separately, lawsuits have been filed over the boy’s death and the US Department of Justicehas launcheda federal hate-crimes investigation.",

    "title": "Singapore election a test for ruling party against rejuvenated opposition",
    "article_text": "Singapore– David Wee has lived in the same terrace house with his family in the east of Singapore his entire life. But over more than 40 years, the Wee family have been a part of five different electoral constituencies. Singaporean electoral boundary changes occurring shortly before every general election have led government critics to raise accusations of gerrymandering – deliberately manipulating constituency boundaries to favour a particular political party. According to Singapore’s Elections Department, which is overseen by the Prime Minister’s Office, the latest boundary changes – the most extensive in years – were driven by voter growth and future housing developments. Despite the criticism,Saturday’s electionin Singapore – where some 2.76 million people are scheduled to vote – is set to return the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) to power. The PAP has won every election in this prosperous global financial centre since declaring independence in 1965. While there is little danger of the PAP losing power, elections here are seen as a test of public sentiment towards the ruling party. This election is also seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took over from former premier Lee Hsien Loong last year. Voting is also compulsory in Singapore – where elections are held every five years, and though modelled after the United Kingdom’s Westminster parliamentary system, one of the quirks of Singapore is that voters are either part of a single-member voting constituency or a Group Representation Constituency (GRC). People in a GRC, rather than vote for individual candidates, cast their ballots for teams of up to five politicians. Within each team, at least one candidate must be from a minority ethnic group. Authorities say the team vote is to ensure minority representation in the city-state’s parliament, but critics say it is a means of parachuting new candidates into the legislature as part of a group. The vote will see 97 members of parliament elected in 33 constituencies made up of 15 single-member constituencies and 18 GRCs. But with no opposition to contest one of the GRCs, the PAP has already scored a walkover for a five-member team, meaning just 92 seats will be contested today. For David Wee, constituency boundaries are not really an issue. “It’s something that can happen to anybody, especially if you live in a Single Member Constituency, which can be easily absorbed” into a GRC, he told Al Jazeera. What is an issue though, he says, is the rising cost of living, inflation, and other concerns around life and work in one of the world’s richest nations. “I will support whomever I think can serve the residents well,” he said, adding that Singapore’s voters are more discerning now and should not be taken for granted. “Our voters have become more educated,” he said. Singapore, after all, is “a developed country, not a developing country”, he added. Singapore isone of the world’s most expensivecities, with some of thehighest living standardsglobally. Alongside a world-class public transport system, it also has the most expensive cars in the world, thanks to a licensing system that sees owners shell out tens of thousands of dollars simply for the right to own a vehicle, alongside congestion pricing, road tax and other expenses. “If you can’t afford it, you can’t afford it,” said Lim Meng Wee, 57, a consultant in the local real estate capital field who has owned several cars over the years. “A car is a very expensive luxury. It eats into your balance sheet and you will have to keep working harder. I know of people who bought a car, and within two to three years, they were back to public transport,” he said. Singapore’s economic success, generally low crime and expectation of personal safety for citizens has come in tandem with a low tolerance for dissent. That has been enforced by wide-ranging laws that allow for, among others, penalties for wounding racial and religious feelings, as well as detention without trial. Labour strikes are outlawed too, and a permit is required for demonstrations, which is strictly observed. One prominent dissident who held up a cardboard sign with a smiley face outside the State Courts in 2020 to make a symbolic point about the administration of justice was fined for illegal assembly. In February, six people in their 20s were questioned by police and had their electronic devices seized over a protest at a local university against Israel’s war on Gaza. Critics and media outlets have been the subject of defamation lawsuits by government ministers, while many politicians and activists were imprisoned from the 1960s into the 1980s. In addition, the mainstream media is solidly pro-establishment while the country is ranked 123rd in the world in terms of press freedom. All media outlets must tread carefully with a government accustomed to taking matters to court when unhappy with coverage. Two ministers recently launched a defamation lawsuit against Bloomberg News – which is continuing – over an article about multimillion-dollar property transactions in the country. In August, this multicultural, multilingual island nation of about six million celebrates its 60th year of independence. It turns 60 as an economic heavyweight, and one of the cleanest, safest, least corrupt places in the world. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 1965 was about $500. Last year, figures from the International Monetary Fund showed the figure was about $93,000. All this has been accomplished under the PAP, which was co-founded by the country’s first premier Lee Kuan Yew, and which remains the only governing party Singaporeans have ever known. Over those six decades, Singapore’s version of the social compact has seen its citizens accepting fewer freedoms in exchange for the PAP ensuring stable economic growth and the availability of good jobs. But that appears to be changing. The PAP has held a parliamentary supermajority for decades, though the 10 opposition politicians elected at the last election in 2020 represented an all-time high in parliament and forced some soul-searching among the governing party’s leadership. “All that we see here in Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew’s (generation) delivered,” political analyst and former newspaper editor PN Balji said. “He was a great statesman,” he told Al Jazeera. However, increasingly, Singaporean voters want a greater say in governance and eschew the “fist in velvet glove” approach to government, along with the authorities’ willingness to intervene in citizens’ lives, leading to the label of “nanny state”. An example of the PAP’s gloved-fist approach was social housing, said Balji. For years, the PAP openly told voters that their residential public housing properties would not be prioritised for upgrading if they voted for the opposition. “All these policies were introduced at a time when the leadership’s mentality was, ‘we’ll just push it through’. You don’t vote PAP, you don’t get upgrading? Let them try this now,” Balji said. Social media has emboldened Singaporeans to the point where the “fear factor” no longer exists, he said. Bread-and-butter issues, along with the longstanding argument that more opposition voices are needed in Singapore, are also dominating in high-tech Singapore. Cost-of-living concerns, exacerbated by a two-step rise in a goods and services tax (GST) – now at 9 percent – since 2023, have dominated the political debate. In addition to previous handouts, authorities have already earmarked just under $1bn in handouts and rebates to help defray the cost of daily expenses, in the wake of a $4.9bn fiscal surplus for 2024. But the larger-than-expected surplus led many to question the government’s need for the GST hike, with the main opposition Workers’ Party (WP) asserting that it had “turbocharged” inflation. United States-imposed tariffs have also heightened economic unease. Former WP lawmaker Leon Perera noted that with slowing economic growth in recent years, the claim of Singaporean exceptionalism is being cited less by the PAP. “Three generations of Singaporeans grew up with an exceptional leadership that delivered outcomes of a higher standard than other developed countries,” Perera said. “Now, increasingly, the narrative is that other developed countries are facing the same problems we have, be it inflation, sluggish real wage growth or high levels of inequality,” he said. “The PAP is at an inflection point because it is the transition to the new prime minister that I think is a catalyst for voters,” he added. Former PAP lawmaker Inderjit Singh, who served for almost two decades in parliament, said previously people “saw their lives improve tremendously”, and, therefore, “people were willing to allow the government to play a dominant role” in their lives. But Singh acknowledged that the cracks have been showing, with a cross-section of Singaporeans who feel they are “sliding backwards” in terms of the cost of living and the affordability of public housing. “The younger Singaporeans have had a good life, and they see the future as tougher than the present,” Singh said. He also pointed to the “huge surge” of new immigrants at a rapid pace that has diluted national identity. “The fact that Singapore has remained a cohesive and prosperous nation should be a matter of pride for all Singaporeans,” he noted. Neophyte Prime MinisterLawrence Wong, who came to power last May, is part of the current fourth generation of leaders, dubbed the “4G” leadership, which still lives under the shadow of the late, great Lee Kuan Yew. “One of the biggest issues for Singapore at 60 is leadership,” said Balji, who believes the current PAP leaders cannot be compared with Lee’s generation. Judging by online chatter, many Singaporeans appear to agree. A long-runningpublic dispute between Lee’s children, including Wong’s predecessor as PM Lee Hsien Loong, also continues to divide Singaporeans and generate international headlines. A high-profile corruption case that saw aformer transport minister jailedhas not helped matters. Another point of contention for many: Singapore has the highest-paid ministers in the world, thanks to the PAP’s insistence that competitive salaries were essential for guarding against corruption. At almost$1.69m per annum, Wong himself is the best-paid world leader. A junior minister gets about $845,000 while a backbencher is paid about $148,000. Wong, who is also finance minister but was not the PAP’s first choice to succeed Lee, made his name as co-chair of the government’s COVID task force. While the 52-year-old has enjoyed high approval ratings and there is little danger of the PAP losing power in this election, he is expected to improve on or maintain the party’s vote share of more than 61 percent from the last election in 2020 – which was one of its worst performances ever. The PAP is also facing a resurgent opposition with a slate of young, highly credentialled WP candidates, and the governing party has looked rattled and vulnerable during the campaign. The former PAP lawmaker Singh said that while Singapore’s management of the COVID pandemic was exemplary compared with many other countries, the jury is still out on Wong and his peers. “I think the 4G leaders have yet to show that they can handle these issues to the satisfaction of Singaporeans. Some of the trust in the PAP has eroded in the last 10 years or so,” he said. “Just saying ‘believe me’ will not be enough – showing a convincing plan that people can believe will be key,” he said. “If the PAP can do it, they should be able to win a good mandate. If not, we can expect further erosion of votes.”",

    "title": "Former Tunisian PM handed 34-year sentence, rejects ‘terrorism’ charges",
    "article_text": "A Tunisian court has sentenced former Prime Minister Ali Larayedh to 34 years in prison over accusations he facilitated the departure of fighters to Syria – a charge the opposition figure strongly denies. “I was neither sympathetic, nor complicit, nor neutral, nor lenient towards violence, terrorism,” Larayedh told the judge on Friday, rejecting what he and his Ennahdha party have called a politically motivated prosecution. The ruling is the latest blow to the Ennahdha party, a major opposition force to President Kais Saied. Larayedh, who served as prime minister from 2013 to 2014, has been in detention since 2022. His sentencing comes just a week after the arrest of vocal Saied criticAhmed Souaband new prison terms handed down to political opponents, media figures and businesspeople on various conspiracy charges. According to state news agency TAP, the sentences apply to eight individuals, with prison terms ranging from 18 to 36 years. The court did not name those convicted alongside Larayedh. Ennahdha denies all terrorism-related allegations, arguing that the case is part of a broader campaign against dissent that has intensified since Saied suspended parliament and assumed sweeping powers in 2021. The government maintains that Tunisia’s judiciary is independent, rejecting claims of political interference. Human rights groups, however, say thecrackdownon opposition voices – including the jailing of Souab – marks a dangerous escalation. Many warn that democratic gains in the birthplace of the Arab Spring in the years since the 2011 revolution are being steadily rolled back. Saied faced protests on Thursday as opponents took to the streets of Tunis, accusing him of using the judiciary and police to silence dissent. The demonstration, the second in a week, comes amid growing alarm over what critics see as an authoritarian drift in the country that sparked the Arab Spring. Marching down Habib Bourguiba Avenue, anti-Saied protesters chanted slogans including “Saied go away, you are a dictator” and “The people want the fall of the regime” – echoing the calls that fuelled the 2011 uprising that ousted former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Supporters of Saied held a counter-rally on the same boulevard, shouting, “No to foreign interference” and “The people want Saied again”. The opposition accuses Saied of undermining the democracy won in the 2011 revolution, since he seized extra powers in 2021 when he shut down the elected parliament and moved to rule by decree before assuming authority over the judiciary.",

    "title": "Trump administration designates two Haitian gangs as ‘terrorist groups’",
    "article_text": "The United States has labelled the Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif gangs in Haiti “foreign terrorist organisations”, a move that follows a trend under President Donald Trump ofissuing terrorist designationsagainst criminal groups in Latin America. As part of Friday’s announcement, Secretary of StateMarco Rubioexplained that the two gangs have spread violence and chaos in Haiti, where armed groups exert substantial control over much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. “The age of impunity for those supporting violence in Haiti is over,” Rubio said in a news statement. “Haitian gangs, including the Viv Ansanm coalition and Gran Grif, are the primary source of instability and violence in Haiti. They are a direct threat to US national security interests in our region.” The Trump administration has projected a hard line againstcriminal groupsin Latin America, often connecting those efforts to domestic priorities like stemming irregular migration and drug trafficking. In February, the US also designated eight drug-trafficking and criminal groups as “terrorist organisations”, including gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13),Tren de Araguaand several Mexican drug cartels. While such groups carry out acts of violence and intimidation, experts have typically differentiated between them and traditional “terrorist” organisations that typically have explicit political goals. The designation of “foreign terrorist organisation” makes any member of a given group inadmissible for entry into the US. It also bars offering “material support or resources” to the group — an element of legal jeopardy that could inadvertently penalise individuals in areas where gangs are deeply embedded in the local economy and government. But Trump and his allies have sought to up the ante against criminal organisations and cartels, blaming them for the flow of undocumented migration and illicit drug-trafficking into the US. In the past, he and other Republican leaders have even suggested the US could carry outmilitary strikeson countries such as Mexico to address the threat of gangs, causing alarm about possible violations of territorial sovereignty. While US-Mexico relations remain strong, critics fear aggressive moves — including the use of the terrorism designation for Mexican cartels — could undermine cooperation as the two countries address organised crime. In Haiti, the threat of gangs is widespread. For instance, the Viv Ansanm coalition, whose name translates to “Live Together”, is thought to control as much as 85 percent of Port-au-Prince, preventing commercial flights from arriving and restricting necessary supplies like food and medicine. With many Haitian civilians facing hunger, displacement and violence, critics fear the new designation could make it even harder to send necessary supplies to the country, given the need to negotiate with the gangs. “The first consequences will be on the humanitarian and international cooperation, which is basically the only thing preventing the people in Haiti from starving,” Romain Le Cour, an expert with Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, told The Associated Press. Experts point out that the gangs often charge tolls for movement in and around their territory. The “terrorist” designation could make payment a criminal offence in the US. “It could function as a de facto embargo,” said Jake Johnston, international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. “The gangs exercise tremendous control over the commerce of the country,” he added. “Doing any kind of business with Haiti or in Haiti is going to carry much greater risk.” Gang control over Haiti has increased in recent years, particularly after the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. His death led to a power vacuum, and no federal election has been held since, eroding public trust in state institutions. The gangs have exploited that vacuum to exert control. More thanone millionpeople have been internally displaced by the resulting violence, and the United Nations estimates that 5.7 million residents — nearly half the country — do not have enough food to eat. Kenya has led a UN-backed international security mission tasked with bolstering local police as they combat the gangs. But that mission has been heavily reliant on US support, some of which Trump has frozen since taking office. That task force has struggled to make an impact thus far, and in February, one of the Kenyan police officers was shot and killed as part of the mission, its first known death. Sceptics have also questioned the efficacy of the international group, given the long and disastrous history offoreign interventionsin Haiti, including by the US. Trump has also attempted to scrap programmes like Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and humanitarian parole that allow Haitians to live legally in the US. An estimated 520,694 Haitians are protected under TPS alone. But under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security plans to fold the TPS programme for Haitians by August.",

    "title": "Palestinian children face starvation under Israel’s total Gaza blockade",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip are facing an increased threat of starvation, the United Nations has warned, asIsrael’s continued blockadeof food, water and other critical supplies to the besieged and bombarded coastal territory enters its third month. The UN’s child rights agency (UNICEF) said on Friday that more than 9,000 children had been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition since the start of the year. But the situationhas worsenedsince Israel imposed a total blockade on the Palestinian enclave in early March. “For two months, children in the Gaza Strip have faced relentless bombardments while being deprived of essential goods, services and lifesaving care,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said ina statement. “With each passing day of the aid blockade, they face the growing risk of starvation, illness and death – nothing can justify this.” Israel has blocked all humanitarian assistance from reaching Palestinians in Gaza since March 2, spurring international condemnation. The UN’s World Food Programmesaid last weekthat its food supplies had been “depleted” amid the siege, warning that community kitchens upon which thousands of Palestinians rely would be forced to close. “We don’t ask if food is nutritious or not, if it’s fresh or good; that’s a luxury, we just want to fill the stomachs of our children,” a displaced Palestinian parent recentlytold Amnesty Internationalabout the crisis. “I don’t want my child to die hungry.” The Israeli government has said its blockade is intended to put pressure on Palestinian group Hamas to release captives held in Gaza. But it has not led to any more releases since the fleeting ceasefire earlier this year, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives. Meanwhile, Hamas official Abdel Rahman Shadid on Friday accused Israel of using starvation as a “deliberate weapon of war” against Palestinians. “Children are dying from the lack of milk, not just from bombs,” Shadid said in a statement published on the group’s Telegram channel. Legal experts and human rights groups have noted that, as an occupying power, Israel has anobligation under international lawto provide food and other assistance to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. They have condemned the blockade as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of all ages are experiencing high levels of food insecurity in Gaza,according tothe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, a global hunger watchdog. Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, told Al Jazeera that the situation is worsening quickly as health facilities lack the supplies needed to treat children grappling with malnutrition. “We have no food supplies or supplementary materials or medications for these children,” Shawa told Al Jazeera from Gaza City. “There is high concern that we will witness more casualties in the coming few days,” he added. At Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, Dr Ahmed Abu Nasir said the situation has become worse than ever due to the blockade. “Children are in their growing stage and badly need certain nutrients, including proteins and fats,” the paediatrician told Al Jazeera. “These are not available in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north.” More than 52,400 Palestinians have been killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, according to figures from the Gaza Health Ministry.",

    "title": "US man sentenced to 53 years for the murder of a Palestinian American child",
    "article_text": "A United States man has been sentenced to 53 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian American boy, after being found guilty of hate crime charges and murder. Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak announced the sentence on Friday in the case of 73-year-old Illinois landlordJoseph Czuba. On October 14, 2023, just days after the start of Israel’s war in Gaza, Czuba attacked two of his tenants, Hanan Shaheen and her young sonWadee Alfayoumi. Police say Czuba arrived at their door angry about the war and proceeded to force his way inside, strangling Shaheen and holding her down before pulling out a military-style knife. Shaheen suffered more than a dozen stab wounds before escaping to a bathroom to call 911 for help. Alfayoumi, meanwhile, was stabbed 26 times. He did not survive. Czuba’s trial featured audio from Shaheen’s panicked 911 call, as well as testimony from the mother herself. Speaking from the witness stand in English and Arabic, she described Czuba becoming increasingly paranoid and Islamophobic as the war progressed. For nearly two years before the attack, the family had rented a pair of bedrooms in Czuba’s house in Plainville, Illinois, just outside of Chicago. But after the war began on October 7, Shaheen recalled Czuba telling her to move out of her lodgings because Muslims were not welcome. Then, during the attack, she once again heard him citing her Muslim faith. “He told me ‘You, as a Muslim, must die,’” said Shaheen. The incident was one of the highest-profile acts of anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim violence in the US after the war in Gaza broke out. But advocates say it is part of a trend of anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic hate that has swept the country in recent months. After the attack, police found Czuba sitting on the ground outside of the home, his hands and body bloody. Czuba pleaded not guilty, and his defence team has sought to vacate his conviction on the grounds that the prosecution played to the jury’s emotions. Some of the images of the crime scene were so graphic that the judge ordered the court’s television screens to be turned away from the audience. Jury members heard Shaheen telling 911 operators in fear, “The landlord is killing me and my baby!” During his opening statements, Michael Fitzgerald, the assistant state’s attorney for Will County, described Alfayoumi’s final moments as full of horror. “He could not escape,” Fitzgerald said. “If it wasn’t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy’s body.” In February, the jury took less than 90 minutes to return a guilty verdict. On Friday, Judge Bertani-Tomczak rejected the defence’s bid to overturn the conviction. In announcing the sentence, she called Czuba’s actions “brutal” and “heinous”. She said a 30-year prison sentence was given for Alfayoumi’s murder, plus another 20 years for the attack on his mother and three years for committing a hate crime. Alfayoumi’s great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member to speak at the sentencing hearing. He said no amount of prison time could ever make up for the loss his family has suffered. He also explained that Alfayoumi had seen Czuba as a grandfather figure, and he questioned what “fake news” about the war in Gaza could have prompted such violence. “Some people are bringing this war to this country,” Yousef said. “We cannot do that. We can’t bring the war here. We cannot bring hatred to this country.” The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) also responded to the sentencing by calling on Americans to reject hate and prejudice. “This sentencing brings closure to the case, and a measure of accountability and justice to a tragedy that has shaken our community,” the group’s executive director Abed Ayoub said in a statement. “We must come together to ensure that tragedies fueled by anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian hate, and Islamophobia are never accepted as the norm in our society.” In March, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)issued a reportsaying it had received 8,658 complaints of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab incidents in the last year alone, a 7.6 percent rise. It was the highest tally the group had recorded since it began collecting data in 1996.",

    "title": "ICJ hearing on Israel’s obligation to allow aid to Palestine: Key takeaways",
    "article_text": "On May 2, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded public hearings into what Israel’s obligations are regarding allowing United Nations agencies and other relief groups to work in the Palestinian territory it occupies. A panel of judges has heard oral arguments from 40 countries since Monday, including China, France, Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia and the United Kingdom. The court will likely deliberate for months before making a ruling, requested of it in December by the UN General Assembly. Many of the participating states rebuked Israel for acutely restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza since launching a genocidal war on the enclave on October 7, 2023. Israel has cut off all aid – food or medicine – entirely for the last two months, accelerating the starvation and medical crises. Here are the key takeaways from the hearings: There was broad consensus that Israel, as an occupying power, would be obliged to allow aid organisations to deliver assistance to the people it occupies, particularly in Gaza, which Israel is also bombing. Israel has weakened human rights norms through its violations in Gaza, Juliette McIntyre, a legal scholar at the University of South Australia, argued. She pointed out that nearly all the states speaking at the hearings affirmed that the ability of Palestinians to receive humanitarian relief is necessary for their survival, to guard their right to eventual self-determination and safeguard the entire UN system and the treaties underpinning it. Put bluntly, she said most states agree that Israel should not be allowed to starve civilians it occupies nor impede the relief work of UN agencies. “Every state, except for two, agrees that Israel is an occupier and it owes certain obligations,” she told Al Jazeera. Israel submitted written statements which called the hearings a “circus” and accused the court of anti-Semitism. On top of that, it claimed that it has no obligation to work with what it described as compromised UN organs or aid groups and that its sovereign right to “defend itself” takes priority over its responsibility to deliver aid to the people it occupies. This is not the first time Israel has refused to attend ICJ sessions leading to an advisory opinion. The US defended Israel, said Heidi Matthews, assistant professor of law at York University, Canada. She added that the US tried to deny the severity of the situation and shield Israel from accountability by deliberately not speaking about the facts on the ground. According to Matthews, while the US mainly said the ICJ should advise Israel to uphold its legal obligations under international law, it did not provide details of Israel’s conduct or call for Israel to take concrete steps to mitigate the humanitarian crisis it created. “This kind of highly formalist and factually empty approach to law is characteristic of one form of fascist engagement with legal argument,” Matthews told Al Jazeera. The US also tried to “spook” the court by bringing up Israel’s unsupported allegations that the UN relief agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) had been infiltrated by Hamas, said Adel Haque, a legal scholar at Rutgers University. In October 2024,Israel banned UNRWA, which aids the Palestinians made refugees by the Zionist ethnic cleansing that made way for the declaration of Israel as a state in 1948. The US is betting that the court can be swayed, Haque said, and so it is trying to encourage a more “general” advisory opinion. “Basically, if the advisory opinion is made at such a high level of generality, then it wouldn’t say anything about Israel’s conduct at all,” he told Al Jazeera. More than two million Palestinians in Gaza are starving as they face genocidal levels of violence at Israel’s hands. While ICJ advisory opinions reaffirm international laws and norms, its non-binding opinions cannot change facts on the ground, and some countries may be seeking ICJ opinions rather than take concrete, coordinated action against Israel, said Haque. “Many [European states] have come before the ICJ in these hearings to say Israel is not fulfilling its obligations. But the question, now, is what are these states going to do about it?” he told Al Jazeera. He noted the UK had used the recent hearings to denounce Israel’s obstruction of aid and to speak about its decision to halt arms sales to Israel, not enough of an action, he added. France also spoke about the need for Israel to quickly facilitate aid into Gaza. But the statements appear to be attempts to substitute for Europe’s collective failure to take urgent action against Israel for its conduct in Gaza, said Haque. “The onus is on states to decide what they are going to do about [Israel’s actions] and not to wait for the court to rule on what they already know,” Haque added. The ICJ is not expected to issue an advisory opinion for months. The non-binding advisory opinion will likely not compel Israel or member states to change course, according to legal scholars. Israel has ignored an earlierbinding provisional measures by the ICJordering it to scale up humanitarian aid and end acts of genocide in Gaza as a result of a genocide case brought against Israel by South Africa in December 2023. No state has taken any action against Israel for failing to implement the provisional measures. McIntyre believes the court will eventually issue a narrow ruling that outlines Israel’s responsibilities to facilitate aid and cooperate with UNRWA. By the time the court issues its opinion, tens of thousands of Palestinians may have already starved to death, or been ethnically cleansed by Israel. “The advisory opinion won’t solve the problem on the ground and genuine action [by states] needs to be taken,” warned McIntyre.",

    "title": "Australia’s election will show if PM Anthony Albanese has won back voters",
    "article_text": "Australians areheading to the pollsshortly in parliamentary elections which will decide if Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s centre-left Labor government will return for a second term. Labor’s main rival is the country’s conservative coalition, led by opposition leader Peter Dutton, which came into the election campaign polling strongly but is now lagging slightly behind Labor. If Albanese does win, it could mean Australia is following in similar footsteps to Canada, where the Liberal party reversed its prospects in recent weeks,amid concernsabout the effect of United States President Donald Trump’s policies on Canada’s economy. Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute, an independent research centre, told Al Jazeera that polls indicate President Trump is “an increasing concern for Australian voters” and that “Labor’s gamble of holding a later election to allow some of Trump’s policies to start to impact has paid off.” In comparison with Canada, where both major parties tried to distance themselves from Trump, Remeikis notes that Australia’s opposition leader Dutton has courted “favourable comparisons” to Trump for months. But, he has been “badly damaged by the ‘Temu Trump’ label” – a reference to the Chinese online shopping website known for selling cheap copies of original brands. War on Gaza and the price of eggs Uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs on Australia has only compounded the concerns of many Australians around the cost of essential items, includinghousing, food, healthcare and childcare. In the final televised leaders’ debate, a week before the election, both Dutton and Albanese stumbled when asked to guess how much a dozen eggs might cost at a supermarket. Albanese was closer, guessing 7 Australian dollars, nearly two dollars less than the actual price of $8.80, while Dutton guessed $4.20, less than half the actual price. Cost of living has “trumped everything” leading into the election, says Josie Hess, who comes from the Latrobe Valley, a coal-mining region in Victoria, and who also works for advocacy group Environment Victoria. For a number of Australians, the most important issue on election day will be beyond Australia’s borders, says Nasser Mashni, the president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN). Mashni told Al Jazeera that “the genocide that is occurring in Palestine” has seen a “new constituency” emerge in Australia that understands that Israel is “a settler colonialist movement doing exactly what occurred here [in Australia] 238 years ago”. APAN has developed a scorecard of where the major parties stand on Palestine. Of those, only the Greens received a tick from APAN on every issue. The scorecard for Labor was mixed, while the conservative Liberal-National coalition did not meet a single criterion. “We’ve asked for people to make Palestine their number one issue and to find a candidate that best reflects a just and humane position for Palestine,” Mashni said. “Certainly, the easiest candidates to find will be in the Senate, but I am sure there’ll be somebody in every seat where they can vote a little bit better for Palestine, and in some cases, very well for Palestine,” he added. Dozens of minor parties and independents from across the political spectrum are also vying for votes. Remeikis said there is a “late surge to the nationalistic, far-right, One Nation party”, which has been aided by Dutton’s conservative coalition preferencing votes for One Nation, and vice versa, in outer suburban and inner regional seats. Next year marks 30 years since One Nation’s leader Pauline Hanson was first elected to federal office in Australia. But Remeikis says the late surge is unlikely to affect the outcome of the election, with polls suggesting Labor will win with a minority government. The Greens, along with some independents running on pro-climate action platforms, will also be hoping to repeat successes inAustralia’s 2022 election, which followed many months of devastating fires and floods. With climate change remaining a key concern for many Australians, Dutton, whose party has long delayed taking action on climate, has chosen to focus on campaigning to build Australia’s first-ever nuclear power stations in areas where coal power stations are closing down, such as the Latrobe Valley, in Victoria. This week, organisations representing more than 350,000 emergency and health services workers released a letter calling on Dutton to drop his plan to introduce nuclear energy to Australia, saying “Australia’s current emergency services do not have the support or resources to respond to nuclear disasters.” Josie Hess, a Latrobe Valley local who works for Environment Victoria, told Al Jazeera that people there still have questions about the viability of Dutton’s proposal. She says people in the valley “desperately need jobs” but the timeline to build nuclear means that it would do little to help workers now. “We have some people who support nuclear but for the most part, the Latrobe Valley is not a monolith, and there is clear and demonstrable opposition to the proposal,” she said. And while economic issues are a concern, she added, there is also an “intrinsic link between climate security and cost of living and housing”. Melissa Sweet, who runs public health news site Croakey, told Al Jazeera that climate change remains a key issue for Australian health workers heading into the election. “Heatwaves, floods, and bushfires are already driving up demand for emergency care, mental health services, and chronic disease management,” Sweet said. The recent US cuts to “public health, global health and climate action and science generally” under Trump mean it’s “more important than ever” that the next Australian government invests in these areas, Sweet added.",

    "title": "Donald Trump renews threats against Harvard University’s tax exempt status",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to strip Harvard University of its tax exempt status, a move that could cost the Ivy League institution billions of dollars if implemented. “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!” Trump wrote on Friday, in aposton his social media platform Truth Social. The statement is the latest threat in acontinuing feudbetween the Republican president and Harvard, the country’s oldest higher-education institution. Since taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump has sought to increase his control over US universities and crack down on what he considers “illegal protests” on campus. But Harvard has been a focal point for his public ire, particularly after school leaders refused a list of demands the Trump administration sent on April 11. In a five-page letter (PDF), Trump officials called on Harvard to reform its student disciplinary system, investigate protesters involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, commission an external audit of programmes deemedanti-Semiticand eliminate its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes. The letter also required Harvard to commit to “viewpoint diversity” in its hiring and admissions practices, something it was expected to accomplish through “structural and personnel changes”. Critics said this mandate was tantamount to Trump attempting to impose a political litmus test on the school. By April 14, Harvard’s President Alan Garber had rejected the letter. In astatementpublished to Harvard’s website, he explained that Trump’s demands infringed upon Harvard’s academic freedom, among other rights. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.” The Trump administration swiftly responded bysuspending nearly $2.2bnin grants and contracts to the school. It has since filed a lawsuit (PDF) challenging Trump’sattempts to withhold federal fundingfrom the school, calling the move “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard”. Shortly after halting the grants and contracts, Trump turned his attention to Harvard’s tax exempt status, ratcheting up the pressure on the school. Educational institutions, charities, nonprofits and institutions of scientific research are among the entities eligible to apply for tax exempt status under US law. That status offers those organisations relief from paying federal income and property taxes. But on April 15, Trump mused on social media that Harvard should lose that exemption, on account of its handling of pro-Palestinian student protests. “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax-Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’” Trump wrote. US media reports later indicated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was having internal deliberations about whether to revoke the school’s IRS status, despite such action being relatively rare. But under the US Code, it is illegal for the president, vice president or any of their employees to petition the IRS — even indirectly — to conduct an audit of any taxpayer. Democrats have seized on that fact to push for an investigation into the Trump administration’s actions towards Harvard. “The President is targeting the non-profit status of Harvard University for blatantly political purposes,” Democratic senators including Chuck Schumer, Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren wrote in ajoint letteron Friday. “The president’s call for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status raises troubling constitutional questions, including whether the president is trying to squelch Harvard’s free speech rights and whether the revocation of its tax-exempt status will deprive the university of its due process rights.”",

    "title": "Prince Harry says he wants to reconcile but King Charles won’t speak to him",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom’s Prince Harry has said he wants to reconcile with his family, but his father, King Charles III, will not speak to him amid a row over his security detail, as the fallout from his quitting theBritish royal familyin 2020 continues. In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Harry, who moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, said he did not think he would be able to bring his family back to the UK. The interview aired just hours after Harry lost a legal battle to try to restore his full police protection when visiting the UK. “I would love reconciliation with my family,” the prince said. “Life is precious. I don’t know how much longer my father has. He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile.” Buckingham Palacerevealed last yearthat Charles was diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer, although aides have been upbeat about how his treatment is progressing. In response to Harry’s interview, Buckingham Palace released a statement, saying, “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.” London’s Court of Appeal earlier rejected Harry’s attempt to overturn a 2020 decision by the Home Office, the ministry responsible for policing, that said he would not automatically receive personal police protection in the UK. Three judges on the appellate court ruled unanimously that the government’s decision was not unreasonable. Justice Geoffrey Vos acknowledged in a 21-page judgement that Harry felt badly treated and his lawyer had made powerful and moving arguments on his behalf. But he said that the prince’s grievance was not legal grounds to challenge the decision to deny him regular security. “From the Duke of Sussex’s point of view, something may indeed have gone wrong, in that an unintended consequence of his decision to step back from royal duties and spend the majority of his time abroad has been that he has been provided with a more bespoke, and generally lesser, level of protection than when he was in the UK,” Vos said. “But that does not, of itself, give rise to a legal complaint.” In his interview with the BBC,Harrycalled Friday’s ruling a “good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up” and accused the Royal Household of influencing the decision. He said the security issue had been “used as leverage” to control him and urged his father and the government to help. “There is a lot of control and ability in my father’s hands,” said the prince, also known as the duke of Sussex. “Ultimately, this whole thing could be resolved through him, not necessarily by intervening, but by stepping aside, allowing the experts to do what is necessary.” Harry, 40, the younger son of Charles and the late Princess Diana, has bucked royal family convention by taking the government and tabloid press to court. Since quitting the royal family, both he and his wife Meghan have been highly critical of the royals in TV documentaries, an explosive interview with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey, and most notably in Harry’s biography, Spare.",

    "title": "US labour market holds steady despite tariffs, adding 177,000 jobs in April",
    "article_text": "The United States economy has added 177,000 jobs in April, topping analysts’ expectations despite economic turmoil in the early months of Donald Trump’s second term as president. Thedata, released on Friday by the Labor Department, suggests the job market is holding steady despite uncertainty driven by Trump’s tariff campaign. The healthcare industry added 51,000 jobs, the highest total gain, but a sum that is consistent with the average monthly growth over the last 12 months. The transportation and warehousing sectors also increased significantly, gaining 29,000 jobs in April. But experts say that growth in those sectors in particular could be a signal that industries are stockpiling before Trump’s high tariffs kick in, driving up the price of imports. “People wanted to front-load and bring in more material before the tariff hike,” said Stuart Mackintosh, the executive director of the Group of Thirty, a financial think tank. While Friday’s labour report contains positive signs, Mackintosh added that other economic indicators signal uncertainty in the market at large, and that could eventually dampen future employment statistics. “Companies large and small have put warnings on their forward projections of earnings going forward. That’s companies telling us, ‘We don’t know. We are uncertain. And we expect [earnings] are going to fall,'” Mackintosh said. “I suspect that will soon trickle down to employment.” Still, Friday’s labour report showed that employment in the US remains steady despite a suite of changes since Trump took office in January. Over the last four months, Trump has pursued an aggressive trade policy designed to drive down trade deficits, largely through the threat of tariffs. Currently, the US has a blanket policy of 10-percent tariffs on imports, with the possibility of higher tariffs for individual countries within the next three months. China, however, currently faces tariffs of 145 percent, due to an ongoing trade war with the US. Canada and Mexico, meanwhile, are shouldering tariffs of 25 percent on all products not covered by a regional free-trade agreement Trump brokered during his first term. Experts have warned that Trump’s erratic trade policies could have negative knock-on effects over the long term, including slowing economic growth and the possibility of a recession. But Friday’s report shows that the US labour market has yet to reflect any widespread harms. The unemployment rate held steady in April at 4.2 percent. The number of underemployed workers who hold part-time jobs for economic reasons also showed little change, holding at 4.7 million people. The labour force participation rate came in at 62.6 percent. Wages ticked up as well: The average hourly wage rose by six cents to $36.06 since last month. Average hourly earnings have increased by 3.8 percent on an annual basis. However, the number of Americans who have been unemployed over the long term, classified as 27 weeks or longer, has increased by 179,000 for a total of 1.7 million people. Other reports, however, do not show the same strong job growth. ADP Research, a company that tracks private sector payrolls, found only62,000 jobswere added in April, marking the smallest monthly gains since July 2024. In a news release accompanying the findings, ADP’s chief economist Nela Richardson said “unease” was the prevailing sentiment. “Employers are trying to reconcile policy and consumer uncertainty with a run of mostly positive economic data,” she explained. Meanwhile, a separate report from the employment services firm Challenger, Grey & Christmas showed that, while there were hiring gains, the US economy cutmore than 105,000 jobsin April. One area in Friday’s report that did show significant losses was in government employment. The Labor Department’s report showed a decline of 9,000 jobs in April alone. Overall, since January, it found that 26,000 government workers have lost their jobs. While the report did not speculate about the reasons for this downward trend, the Trump administration has been vocal in its mission of downsizing the federal government. As the country’s single largest employer, the federal government boasted upwards of2,925,000employees as of 2023. But Trump has pursued a policy of mass layoffs, on the premise that the government is “bloated” with “waste, fraud and abuse”. The newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been put in charge of streamlining the federal workforce under the leadership of tech billionaire Elon Musk. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to be laid off by year’s end, but many DOGE cuts are currently being challenged in federal court, as well as through programmes like the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects employee rights. As a result, some employees are on paid leave. Others are currently receiving severance pay. Neither group would be categorised as “unemployed” for the purposes of April’s job report. In its report,Challenger, Grey & Christmasfound that a total of 282,227 federal jobs were slashed so far this year, the majority of which could be attributed to DOGE’s cuts. That marked a 680-percent increase in government sector job cuts from April 2024. The downsizing has already hit key government functions. Earlier this month, the news agency Reuters reported that the Food and Drug Administration was suspending a quality control programme in its Food Emergency Response Network due to staffing cuts. But government cuts could have ramifications for the employment market even beyond the federal workforce. The Trump administration has also sought to roll back government spending, slashing grants, contracts and foreign aid programmes that use US companies as private contractors. Experts believe this month’s gains in the healthcare sector, for example, could be short-lived amid cuts to government bodies like the Department of Health and Human Services. Those departments often fund universities and private companies to do research on their behalf. “The administration has been cutting funding for institutions, like in higher education, in research institutions. They’ve been cutting grants that have gone out for grants for particular communities, for mental health services for children,” said Jessica Fulton, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank that focuses on Black communities. “Those are job-sustaining investments,” Fulton explained. “We will see the impact of those [cuts] in future jobs reports.” She also pointed to legislation in Congress that could also lead to employment in the healthcare sector shrinking. Critics argue the current Republican-led budget bill would require cuts to Medicaid — a government insurance programme for low-income individuals — in order to fund tax cuts and other party priorities. “Any potential cuts to programme like Medicaid could threaten those jobs in the future,” Fulton said. “We are in a wait-and-see posture.” Other industries are likewise bracing for economic turbulence ahead. This week, several companies, including the social media giant Snap andcarmaker Stellantis, suspended future guidance for investors. Stellantis already furloughed 900 workers in early April amid tariff-driven uncertainty. The Commerce Department released areportthat showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by an annual rate of 0.3 percent during the first quarter of 2025, compared with 2.4 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. On Tuesday, a separatereportreleased by The Conference Board, an economic nonprofit, showed consumer confidence fell 7.9 points in April. “Consumer confidence declined for a fifth consecutive month in April, falling to levels not seen since the onset of the COVID pandemic,” Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement. The report also noted growing fears about the state of the job market. An estimated 32 percent of Americans expect fewer jobs to be available over the next six months, a rate similar to what the board found in April 2009, at the height of the Great Recession.",

    "title": "US attacks Yemen port again; Houthis launch missiles at Israel",
    "article_text": "The Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV media outlet has reported that seven US strikes hit the Ras Isa oil port in al-Salif district in Hodeidah in the last few hours, where aUS strike at the same portlast month killed at least 80 people and wounded 150 in one of the deadliest attacks on the country byUS forces. Earlier Friday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for launching two missiles towards northern Israel, targeting the Ramat David military airbase and the Tel Aviv area, as the group continues its military pressure in solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli fire. The Israeli military said on Friday it intercepted the first missile and launched another interceptor at the second, which was also fired from Yemen. Alarms were triggered in several locations, though authorities reported no casualties or damage. The military added that the outcome of the second interception was still under review. Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the Houthis – also known as Ansar Allah – confirmed the group had carried a “military operation” against a key Israeli military target. Saree said hypersonic missiles were used and had successfully hit their intended destination. The Israeli army responded that “interception attempts were made” without providing further details. The Houthi group has repeatedly said its attacks on Israel as well as United States and British ships in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandeb Strait will only cease if Israel agrees to a permanent Gaza truce. The Houthis did not carry out attacks during the Gaza ceasefire earlier this year until Israel blocked all aid into the besieged enclave in early March and followed that with a full resumption of the war. The attacks come as the US escalates its military operations in Yemen. On Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth extended the USS Harry S Truman’s deployment in the Middle East for an additional week, ensuring two carrier strike groups remain operational in the region, a Pentagon official confirmed anonymously to The Associated Press news agency. Since March, the US has launched large-scale attacks not only on infrastructure but increasingly on individuals linked to the Houthi leadership. Civilian casualties are mounting, with UK-based monitor Airwars estimating between 27 and 55 civilians were killed in March alone, and suggesting April’s toll is even higher. On Monday, at least68 peoplewere killed in the overnight strike on detained African migrants, and eight people were killed around the capital, Houthi media reported. Rights advocates have been alarmed about the growing civilian death toll. Three US Democratic senators recently wrote to Hegseth, demanding an accounting of civilian lives lost. “Strikes pose a growing risk to the civilian population in Yemen,” United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. “We continue to call on all parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.”",

    "title": "Why does DRC want to end ex-President Kabila’s immunity for war crimes?",
    "article_text": "The army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) asked the Senate this week to revoke former President Joseph Kabila’s immunity from prosecution. Removal of Kabila’s immunity would pave the way for him to be prosecuted on charges of “supporting a rebel insurgency” in the country’s troubled eastern region, Justice Minister Constant Mutamba said. Last week, the government placed travel restrictions on Kabila’s family, signalling a deepening rift between Kabila, who led the country for more than a decade until 2019, and current President Felix Tshisekedi, who took over from him that year. Tension between the two has kept Kabila away from the country for several years, living for the most part in South Africa. But his reported reappearance last month in the rebel-held Goma territory in DRC’s eastern Kivu region has led to speculation that he may have allied himself with the armed rebel group, M23. His reappearance in DRC appears also to have angered the government, which has been battling the Rwanda-backed M23 group in a deadly conflict in the country’s east for months. Last week, the rebelsannounced a ceasefirefollowing mediation talks in Qatar. Kambale Musavuli, a researcher at the Center for Research on Congo-Kinshasa, a think tank, said the DRC’s move to prosecute the ex-leader was a positive step. “Putting him on trial could be a pivotal moment for the DRC, not only in seeking justice for past crimes but also in breaking the cycle of impunity that has plagued our leadership since independence,” he said. Joseph Kabila, 53, is a former military officer who was fourth president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001 to 2019. Although his term was supposed to end in 2016, he controversially delayed elections until huge protests broke out. Presidents in the DRC are elected for a five-year term and are only permitted to serve two terms. A new constitution, adopted in 2006, reset Kabila’s two-term tenure. He took over leadership of the country in 2001 at the age of just 29, after his father and former coup leader, President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated. DRC presidents, former presidents and senators are immune from prosecution unless they commit “gross misconduct” according to the country’s constitution. Kabila’s relationship with President Tshisekedi, a former opposition leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), is fraught. Although the two men agreed in 2019 to an awkward power-sharing pact that allowed members of Kabila’s People’s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) to take part in the new government, they clashed over who could appoint which officials to office. Their alliance broke down a year later, in 2020. Tensions were also mounting over the M23 rebellion which began in 2012. Kabila has accused Tshisekedi of failing to tackle the matter with tact, complaining that the president has relied on external mediation rather than engaging in direct dialogue with the rebels. In a recent opinion piece in South Africa’s Sunday Times, Kabila wrote that under Tshisekedi, the DRC “is close to imploding as a result of the civil war”. He also accused the president of attempting to hang onto power, referring to Tshisekedi’s plans to push for a constitutional review. Tshisekedi said in 2023 his government would review the constitution and leave the matter of term limits “for the people to decide”, without expanding further. Kabila has held talks with opposition leaders, including Moise Katumbi, leader of the Together for the Republic party, although it is unclear what was discussed. Observers say Kabila is angling to act as a lead negotiator between M23 and Kinshasa, but he has not publicly made that claim himself. For his part, Tshisekedi blames Kabila for undermining his government and accuses him of supporting M23, citing his close links to former election chairman-turned-rebel-leader, Corneille Nangaa. Nangaa, who declared his alliance with the rebels in 2023, was head of the country’s electoral commission from 2015 to 2021 and oversaw the disputed 2018 elections that brought Tshisekedi into office. The two later fell out over how the elections were run, causing Nangaa to publicly criticise Tshisekedi and eventually join a rebel group. On April 20, the DRC’s government suspended Kabila’s party, PPRD, and ordered his assets to be seized on charges of supporting M23. It is not clear if those assets are yet under state control. DRC Justice Minister Constant Mutamba told reporters on Wednesday that the state has amassed evidence implicating Kabila in “war crimes, crimes against humanity and massacres of peaceful civilians and military personnel” in the country’s east. He did not give specific details of these crimes. Swaths of the eastern region are currently under control of the M23 group, which seeks control of mineral wealth and has ambitions to take power in Kinshasa. The United Nations and United States claim the group isbacked by neighbouring Rwanda. In relation to this, Kabila is accused of “treason, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and participation in an insurrectional movement”, the justice minister said. It’s not clear when the Senate will approve the army’s demand, or when a trial might begin. The M23 armed group is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern DRC’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, critical for the production of much of the world’s technology. According to UN experts and the US, M23 rebels are supported by about 4,000 soldiers from neighbouring Rwanda. Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame has not explicitly denied supporting the group.In February, he told a CNN reporter he did “not know” if Rwandan troops had boots on the ground in the DRC. The group, which is largely composed of Tutsi fighters, says it wants to protect Congolese Tutsis of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform the DRC from a failed state into a modern one, though critics say this is a pretext for Rwanda’s involvement. Many M23 members were indeed former ethnic Tutsi rebels who integrated into the DRC army following the Congo Wars (1996-2003) but later defected, citing discrimination and broken peace deals. Those wars had roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide of minority Tutsis and centrist Hutus. Thousands of genocidaires fled over the border into refugee camps in the DRC following the fall of the Hutu government, and from there, launched attacks on Rwanda. That conflict led to fighting in an already unstable DRC. President Kagame’s government, meanwhile, accuses the DRC of enlisting remnant Hutu forces in the form of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which fights alongside the Congolese army. In a previous uprising in 2012, M23 briefly seized Goma, a strategic regional hub, but withdrew after international pressure. Since January, the group, which analysts say is eyeing political power this time, has again captured Goma as well as Bukavu, a city of 1.3 million people. At least 3,000 people were reported killed and thousands displaced in the Goma fighting in January. Kabila has not responded to the DRC government’s recent allegations or its moves to prosecute him. However, his allies have criticised these moves. Ferdinand Kambere, a senior member of Kabila’s PPRD, said Kinshasa’s actions were a “relentless persecution” of the former president. “For us, these mistakes that those in power keep making against the former president, thinking they are humiliating or intimidating him, actually show that the regime is nearing its end. They have nothing left to use against Kabila,” Kambere told The Associated Press news agency. But some say the move is necessary for justice. Kabila’s reported appearance in Goma should not be seen as a coincidence, Musavuli, the researcher, said, but rather indicates that he may be shoring up alliances or defying Kinshasa. Kabila and any others implicated in crimes should be tried, he said. “His regime is deeply implicated in enabling armed groups, particularly in the east. Many of these crimes occurred under his watch, if not with his direct complicity, certainly with his strategic silence. The people want a transparent and credible judicial process, one that doesn’t just scapegoat one individual but exposes the broader networks of power, both domestic and international, that have profited from the suffering of the Congolese people,” he added. Meanwhile, an opposition alliance against President Tshisekedi is forming. On Thursday, opposition leaders Moise Katumbi, Martin Fayulu and Delly Sesanga, together with Kabila, issued a joint call for national dialogue in what looked like a united front. In a statement, they questioned the strength of the Qatar-led ceasefire deal and instead called for a return to Congolese-led mediation mechanisms, including one being led by the country’s Catholic Church leaders, to deal with the “root causes” of the crisis, among them “bad governance”.",

    "title": "Uganda’s military chief says holding opposition activist ‘in my basement’",
    "article_text": "Uganda’s military chief, the son of longtime PresidentYoweri Museveni, says he is holding a missing opposition activist in his basement and threatened violence against him, after the man’s party said he was abducted. Eddie Mutwe went missing on April 27 after being grabbed near the capital Kampala by armed men, the National Unity Platform (NUP) party has said. Mutwe acts as the chief bodyguard for Uganda’s leading opposition figure,Bobi Wine. In a social media post late on Thursday, Ugandan General Muhoozi Kainerugaba said Mutwe had been captured “like a grasshopper”. “He is in my basement … You are next!” Kainerugaba wrote on X in response to a post by Wine saying that Mutwe had been abducted. Kainerugaba, who is known for his incendiary social media posts, also alluded to Mutwe being tortured, saying he had beaten him and shaved his head. “If they keep on provoking us, we shall discipline them even more,” he said of the opposition. He is in my basement. Learning Runyankore. You are next!https://t.co/8pMgdGCru2 — Muhoozi Kainerugaba (@mkainerugaba)May 1, 2025 Kainerugaba’s comments come amid an escalating crackdown on the Ugandan opposition and as Wine was set to launch a “protest vote” campaign in advance of a general election in January. Spokespeople for the Ugandan government, military and police did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Reuters news agency. On Friday, Wine – aformer singerwhose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi and who has become the leading opponent to Museveni – said on X that security forces had “just raided and cordoned off our headquarters”. He also condemned the abduction of Mutwe, telling the AFP news agency that it was “a reminder to the world as to how law and order has broken down in Uganda”. The Ugandan government has faced international condemnation over the abduction of opposition figures, including veteran leader Kizza Besigye, who wasseized in Kenya last yearand forcibly returned to face treason charges. Museveni, who has ruled since 1986 and plans to seek re-election in January, has denied allegations of human rights abuses. But the Uganda Law Society said the abduction of Mutwe, Wine’s chief bodyguard, was not an isolated incident. Instead, it is “part of a systematic campaign to silence dissent and crush the aspirations of young people yearning for freedom”, the group said in a statement. The Uganda Human Rights Commission, which is tasked with investigating abuses and monitoring the government’s human rights record, said it issued a release order directing the authorities to release Mutwe on Friday. The move waswelcomedas a “bold step” by David Lewis Rubongoya, secretary-general of the National Unity Platform party. 📢 📢RELEASE ORDER📌We have issued a release order directing the@cdfupdf@mkainerugabaand UPDf@MODVA_UPDFto release Edward Rogers Ssebuufu aka@eddie_mutwewith immediate effect.

    "article_text": "Lebanon’s top security body has warned the Palestinian group Hamas against using the country’s territory for acts that could undermine national security, after rocket fire towards Israel led to counterstrikes. The Higher Defence Council issued the warning on Friday as Lebanon faces growing United States pressure to disarm groups outside state control, following a 14-month war between Israel and the armed Lebanese groupHezbollah, an ally of Hamas. Lebanese authorities are also trying to establish their authority throughout the country, particularly in the south near the border with Israel. Israel has violated the US-brokered November 2024 truce agreement on a near-daily basis, according to Lebanese authorities, including three air attacks on the capitalBeirut. In a statement, the council headed by President Joseph Aoun said Lebanon must not be used as a launchpad for instability or be dragged into unnecessary wars. It added that “the utmost measures and necessary procedures will be taken to put a definitive end to any act that violates Lebanese sovereignty.” Aoun, who previously served as army commander, has pledged to bring all weapons in the country under the state’s authority, but has admitted that disarming Hezbollah, which the US has been pressuring Lebanon to do, is a“delicate”matter. Mohammad al-Mustafa, secretary-general of the council, told reporters on Friday that while Aoun highlighted the importance of Palestinian rights, he also stressed that Lebanese stability should not be compromised. Hamas has a longstanding presence within Lebanon, including in camps across the country that host hundreds of thousands of longtime Palestinian refugees, and where Lebanese security forces have long had only limited authority. Along with Hezbollah, Hamas fighters in Lebanon fired rockets across the southern border into Israel in solidarity with Palestinians after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack, when Israel began a huge bombardment campaign in Gaza. Since then,Israeli air attackshave killed several Hamas commanders in Lebanon, including the group’s deputy chief in early 2024. Israel has cited security concerns for itscontinued deadly raidson Lebanon, despite the ceasefire. In a bid to address the concerns of Israel and the US, which brokered the ceasefire, the Lebanese army arrested Lebanese and Palestinian individuals accused of firing rockets towards Israel on March 22 and March 28. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Hezbollah has denied any involvement. But a Lebanese security source told the AFP news agency that security forces arrested three Hamas members. The council said legal proceedings would begin early next week against those detained over the rocket fire in March.",

    "article_text": "Fighting in the Sudanese city of al-Nahud, a strategic city in West Kordofan state acting as a gateway to the Darfur region, has killed 19 people and left 37 wounded, according to sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, in the latest eruption of violence in thebrutal two-year civil war. Local sources told Al Jazeera that the paramilitaryRapid Support Forces(RSF), which declared on Telegram that it had “liberated” al-Nahud from the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) on Thursday, had rampaged through neighbourhoods, looting the market, houses and cars. Al Jazeera understands that a doctor, a journalist and a police officer were among those killed as paramilitaries overcame the city, held by the SAF since the start of the conflict that has left tens of thousands dead and uprooted more than 12 million. Control over al-Nahud has become a priority for both the RSF and SAF as fighting between the pair intensifies in Darfur, where 542 people have been killed in the past three weeks alone, according to the United Nations on Thursday. The RSF has been doubling down on Darfur in recent weeks after losing the national capital,Khartoum, last month, in a bid to seize regional capital el-Fasher, the last major population centre still in the army’s hands, located 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of al-Nahud. Recent violence in el-Fasher and the nearby refugee camps ofZamzamand Abu Shouk has caused hundreds of thousands of people to flee 60km (37 miles) across the desert to the town of Tawila. As it continues its campaign in Darfur, the paramilitary group has also been inching closer to Khartoum again, shelling the presidential palace in its second attack on the capital in less than a week. On Saturday, the RSF bombarded the army’s General Command headquarters in Khartoum. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, commenting on the death toll in Darfur and extrajudicial executions conducted by both sides in Khartoum state, said on Thursday that the “horror unfolding in Sudan knowsno bounds”. The conflict between SAF, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF’s Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo has divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east, while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south.",

    "title": "Chile downgrades alert after magnitude 7.4 earthquake spurs tsunami fears",
    "article_text": "The Chilean authorities have downgraded an evacuation “red alert” after a magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck off the southern coasts of Chile and Argentina prompted concerns about a possible tsunami. The Chilean National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response (Senapred) had issued the alert on Friday for coastal areas in the country’s southernmost Magallanes region and its Antarctic territory due to the tsunami risk. At a news conference later in the day, Interior Minister Alvaro Elizalde said although the evacuation alert for the region was being downgraded, people were still advised to stay away from the beach and coastal regions. In a post on its website, Senapred said hundreds of people had been evacuated from a handful of communities, including the town ofPuerto Williams. Videos on social media showed people calmly evacuating as sirens blared in the background. The earthquake struck Drake Passage between Cape Horn and Antarctica at a depth of just 10km (six miles), the United States Geological Survey said. Magallanes is Chile’s largest and southernmost region and one of its least populated. According to government figures, in 2017, the population was about 166,000 people. Earlier, Chilean President Gabriel Boric said all the country’s resources were available to respond to the quake. “We call for evacuation of the coastline throughout the Magallanes region,” he wrote in a social media post. “At this time, our duty is to be prepared and heed the authorities.” Chile’s Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA) estimated that waves will reach bases in Antarctica and cities in Chile’s extreme south in the coming hours. Meanwhile, in the Argentinian city of Ushuaia, considered the world’s southernmost, local authorities suspended all types of water activities and navigation in the Beagle Channel for at least three hours. “The earthquake was felt primarily in the city of Ushuaia and, to a lesser extent, in towns across the province,” the local government reported. “In the face of these types of events, it is important to remain calm.”",

    "title": "US says war set to run on as Ukraine prepares to ratify minerals deal",
    "article_text": "United States Vice President JD Vance has said his administration sees no end to the war in Ukraine, despite preparations in Kyiv to ratify aminerals dealwith Washington. Vance told Fox News on Thursday that the Ukraine war prompted by Russia’s invasion of the country in 2022 was “not going to end any time soon”. The comments came a day after Ukraine signed a deal granting the US priority access to its minerals, which, although it stopped short of offering security guarantees, has raised hopes in Kyiv and Europe that US support could be revived and Ukrainian security increased. “It’s going to be up to them to come to an agreement and stop this brutal, brutal conflict,” Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia and Ukraine. “It’s not going anywhere … It’s not going to end any time soon.” Ukrainian legislator Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram on Friday that parliament would vote on May 8 to ratify the minerals deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted on Thursday that the deal, which was almost derailed after a fiery exchange with Vance and President Donald Trump in February, was “a truly equal agreement”. The deal absolves Ukraine from earlier US demands that it cover the repayment of billions of dollars in military aid supplied by Washington since Russia invaded in February 2022. It does not give any specific US security commitments, as Ukraine was seeking. However, Washington argues that boosting US business interests in Ukraine would help deter Russia. Trump has insisted that he will broker a ceasefire, but his administration has warned that it could walk away should Russia and Ukraine continue to launch attacks on each other. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on Thursday that the two countries were “closer, but they’re still far apart”. Meanwhile, hostilities persist. The Ukrainian air force said on Friday that Russia launched 150 drones overnight. Strikes on the industrial city of Zaporizhzhia left 29 people wounded, according to regional Governor Ivan Fedorov, writing on Telegram. Two men were wounded in a drone attack in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, with fires breaking out at two locations, Governor Sergiy Lysak said on Telegram. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its air defences destroyed 121 Ukrainian drones, the majority over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014.",

    "title": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are racing to build an ‘everything app’",
    "article_text": "Altman’s Worldcoin startup is about more than “authenticating humans in the age of AGI.” Altman’s Worldcoin startup is about more than “authenticating humans in the age of AGI.” byAlex Heath Sam AltmanandElon Muskaren’t just competing in the AI race; they both have ambitions to build Silicon Valley’s holy grail: an “everything” super app encompassing finance, social media, gaming, and more. Earlier this week, I got a peek at Altman’s plan from a cavernous event space on the northern edge of San Francisco. He was not there as the CEO of OpenAI, but as the co-founder and chairman of Tools for Humanity, the parent company of a cryptocurrency called Worldcointhat’s now available in the US. Worldcoin is distributed to people who scan their eyes at one of the startup’s orbs, which are rolling out in retail stores across America. At the same time, the token is being used to build a super app to rival X. Tools for Humanity’s World app is a crypto wallet, social network, and mini-app platform all in one. Its monthly user base has doubled in the last six months to 26 million people, 12 million of whom have been verified by an orb. In the World app, you can message others via a chat interface tied to World IDs — the blockchain-based identifier you get after scanning your eyes — and send or receive cryptocurrency. There are also dozens of mini apps available from developers like Kalshi, many of which let you transact in-app with Worldcoin. Creating a hub for finance and social networking is Musk’s stated intention for X, which is gearing up to launch Venmo-like money features later this year in partnership with Visa. This week, Tools for Humanity also announced a partnership with Visa to release a US debit card later this summer. It will let you transact with Worldcoin and offer rewards for AI subscriptions. By verifying that people are human, Tools for Humanity is also trying to address the bot problem that Musk said he wanted to fix when he bought Twitter.Onstage at the event, Altman recalled a walk co-founderAlex Blaniaand he took through San Francisco five years ago, well before the launch of ChatGPT. “It was clear to us that there was a need for something like this, that we needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of AGI,” he said. “We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.” During a press Q&A after the keynote, Tools for Humanity CEOAlex Blaniacalled out X as the kind of platform he’s trying to improve with World ID verification, which the startup plans to eventually charge developers for. Bots on X used to be “so stupid that you could see it was some crypto scam,” he said, acknowledging that now, it’s “not as clear.” There were several OpenAI leaders in the audience at this week’s event. A rumor leading up to it was that the two companies would announce a partnership for OpenAI’s planned social network. Given the Altman connection, I asked Blania during the press Q&A if he wanted to work with OpenAI. He responded that he was “definitely open to it” and hinted that there would be more to come on that front. I had hoped to ask Altman about it as well, but he slipped out after the keynote. Earlier this week, I attended Meta’s first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, at its headquarters in Menlo Park. That same morning, the standalone Meta AI app was released with a social feed for sharing interactions with the assistant. Eventually, the app is going toadd a premium tier and ads. After his opening keynote at LlamaCon, I caught up with Meta’s chief product officer,Chris Cox, to ask why Meta AI is getting its own app, why it has a social component, and what else he thinks sets the app apart. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity: What’s the goal of doing a standalone Meta AI app? Almost a billion people are using Meta AI. There’s a bunch of lighter-weight usage, but then there are some communities of people that are going super deep on it. We wanted to offer the lightweight mode in our apps and also the heavyweight mode. Does this mean that Meta AI’s hooks in the other apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) will disappear or become optional? Our plan is to keep it the way it is. Some of these things make sense in the apps. A lot of people are using it in search to learn more about a specific meme or a specific piece of content. We’ll continue to have those sorts of integrations. When you compare Meta AI to other assistants like ChatGPT, what do you think is its edge? There’s voice, there’s personalization, the social features, and then there’s the integration with hardware. We’ve done a lot of work on getting the voice to really low latency and making it really expressive, which lets you have an ongoing conversation. The second piece is the personalization. It remembers everything I’ve told it. It also incorporates your Facebook and Instagram data, if you connect your accounts, to understand interests in a niche way. It knows I’m a marathoner. It knows I’m very interested in AI. It knows the humor I like. That starts to get you a pretty fascinating level of depth when it comes to answering basic questions. We’ve created the best personalized experiences in social media, and we know that’s the difference between a vanilla app and something that people really love. So that’s going to be a big differentiator, I expect, for us. The social stuff is incredibly fun. Many people post the equivalent of political cartoons with visual commentary on today’s events. An observation we had is that people don’t know what to do with AI, and it’s not until they’ve been walked through it by somebody who’s an expert that the light bulb goes off. Just like social media, a lot of this is memetic. You’re inspired by what you see other people do. Will the Meta AI Discover feed become more of its own social network and not just a way to find prompts? I think we’ll add more to it. I’ve already found a bunch of AI creators using it. With early communities, you want a dedicated place because it’s less pressurized. I’m not going to share my AI-generated artwork on Instagram unless it’s really good. If you have a place that’s just for this thing, there’s going to be a community around it. Is there hope that this app also helps drive Meta Ray-Ban sales, since it’s how you pair with them? I think it could in the following way: you see people using Ray-Bans in the app. For a lot of people, that’s going to be the way they get excited about it instead of seeing marketing. What did you all learn from theLlama 4 benchmark fiasco? I think the most important thing for benchmarks is to stay focused on what actually matters for your product. Part of what we need to do is just be really, really, really clear on that. I think every organization is going through some version of this. The eval that matters is whether the product is good, period.

    "article_text": "There are deals to be had on every model right now, from the latest entry-level models to the noise-canceling AirPods Pro. There are deals to be had on every model right now, from the latest entry-level models to the noise-canceling AirPods Pro. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newAirPods MaxandAirPods 4(with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do thelatest AirPods Pro with USB-C. The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options. Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. Apple’s AirPods 4 improve on previous models with better sound, clearer voice calls, and an even more comfortable design. For $50 extra, you can purchase a model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging. The fancier version of the new AirPods 4 offer support for active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case that can use either Qi or Apple Watch pads, and a speaker in the case that chirps to help you find it. At itsSeptember event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments. The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are matching their all-time low of around $99 ($30 off) atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buy. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buystarting at $148.99 ($30 off), which remains their best price to date. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features aUSB-C charging caseand an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used withApple’s new Vision Pro headsetanddoubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids. As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor around $169 ($80 off), which is just $15 shy of their all-time low of $153.99 and the best price we’ve seen on Apple’s premium earbuds this year. Apple’s AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation.Read our review. The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not thebest noise-canceling headphonesfor most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user. At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with anew modelthat features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They’re currently on sale atAmazonandWalmartstarting at $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now, we’re not seeing any deals of note on the original pair.

The proposal also reads like a tiradeagainst civil rightsand any solutions for combatting climate change. “The budget document is laced with racist, anti-science, petty, and cruel language that should be beneath the president of the United States.” “The budget document is laced with racist, anti-science, petty, and cruel language that should be beneath the president of the United States,” Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a press release. The budget line cutting $624 million for the Economic Development Administration and Minority Business Development Agency describes programs as “subsidies for idealogues [sic] who prioritize ‘racial equity’ and the radicalized climate agenda” and criticizes funding of a “Pride Plaza” in Portland, Oregon. The agency that leads weather forecasting and research into climate change and marine ecosystems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, takes a major hit with a proposed $1.3 billion loss in funding. It “terminates a variety of climate-dominated” initiatives including educational programs it claims “radicalize students against markets and spread environmental alarm.” The budget would also take away $209 million for procuring weather satellites. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would lose $646 million, even as agrowing number of billion-dollar weather disasterstake a toll on the US. The document says FEMA will no longer “instill equity as a foundation of emergency management,” and falsely claims that the agency “discriminated” against people who voted for Trump — echoing disinformation about FEMA that Musk and others promoted on social media last year that stokedviolent threats against the agency’s staff. To try to prevent worsening climate disasters, the Biden administration funneled an unprecedented amount offederal funding into carbon pollution-free energy projects. Trump has been quick totry to claw those funds back, despite facinglegal challengesfor attempting to take away funding that had been approved by Congress. His budget proposal today says it would cancel more than $15.2 billion from thebipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Actpassed in 2021. That includes funding for for EV and battery manufacturing and cutting $5.7 billion that had been earmarked for EV chargers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been another target of Trump and Musk’s deregulatory agenda, and would lose more than $4.2 billion if the President’s budget is enacted. Some of the most severe cuts would be to the Hazardous Substance Superfund, a loss of $254 million that would otherwise go toward the clean up of more than1,300 toxic sitesacross the US. The EPA’s scientific research arm would similarly lose $235 million. The budget also eliminates the EPA’s environmental justice programs, slashing $100 million in funding. “When the next toxic disaster strikes, who will answer the phone and respond? Americans overwhelmingly support EPA’s mission, and the public must speak up and tell Congress to stop these attacks on public health,” Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network made up of hundreds of former EPA staff, said in a press statement. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which had a budget of roughly$48 billionlast year, would lose nearly 40 percent of its budget under President Trump’s plans. The document criticizes NIH of promoting “radical gender ideology to the detriment of America’s youth.” It comes a day after the Department of Health and Human Servicespublished a reporton treating transgender youth based on harmfulpseudosciencethat the president of the American Academy of Pediatricssaid, “misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Firefox could be doomed without Google search deal, says executive",
    "article_text": "﻿“It’s very frightening,” a Mozilla executive testified. ﻿“It’s very frightening,” a Mozilla executive testified. byLauren Feiner Firefox could be put out of business should a court implement all the Justice Department’s proposals to restrict Google’s search monopoly, an executive for the browser owner Mozilla testified Friday. “It’s very frightening,” Mozilla CFO Eric Muhlheim said. The DOJ wants to bar Google from paying to be the default search engine in third-party browsers including Firefox, among along list of other proposalsincluding a forced sale of Google’s own Chrome browser and requiring it to syndicate search results to rivals. The court has already ruled thatGoogle has an illegal monopoly in search, partly thanks to exclusionary deals that make it the default engine on browsers and phones, depriving rivals of places to distribute their search engines and scale up. But while Firefox — whose CFO is testifying as Google presents its defense — competes directly with Chrome, it warns that losing the lucrative default payments from Google could threaten its existence. Firefox makes up about 90 percent of Mozilla’s revenue, according to Muhlheim, the finance chief for the organization’s for-profit arm — which in turn helps fund the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation. About 85 percent of that revenue comes from its deal with Google, he added. Losing that revenue all at once would mean Mozilla would have to make “significant cuts across the company,” Muhlheim testified, and warned of a “downward spiral” that could happen if the company had to scale back product engineering investments in Firefox, making it less attractive to users. That kind of spiral, he said, could “put Firefox out of business.” That could also mean less money for nonprofit efforts likeopen source web toolsand an assessment of howAI can help fight climate change. Mozilla would have to make “significant cuts across the company” Ironically, Muhlheim seemed to suggest that could cement the very market dominance the court seeks to remedy. Firefox’s underlying Gecko browser engine is “the only browser engine that is held not by Big Tech but by a nonprofit,” he said. The other two are Google’s open source Chromium and Apple’s WebKit. Mozilla developed Gecko to stave off a fear that Microsoft would control all the protocols on the internet, Muhlheim testified, and creating Gecko helped ensure different browsers would be interoperable, so access to the web wouldn’t be controlled by one company. (Unlikenumerous other companiesfeatured in the Google trial, Firefox hasn’t expressed an interest in buying Chrome.) Replacing the revenue from Google is not as easy as making a deal with another search engine provider or a non-exclusive deal with Google, Muhlheim says. Mozilla has talked with Microsoft about the possibility of Bing taking over the default spot, but Muhlheim warns that without Google being able to bid on the contract, the revenue share Mozilla would be able to negotiate would likely fall. On top of that, Mozilla has found that Bing doesn’t monetize traffic as efficiently as Google does today. In a December 2024 presentation to Mozilla’s board that was shown in court, the company warned that losing Google’s payments posed a ​​“significant threat to viability for Mozilla with limited ability to mitigate.” From 2021 to 2022, the company ran a study to see what would happen if it quietly switched Firefox users’ default search engines from Google to Bing, and found that users who switched to Bing generated less revenue for Mozilla — a finding Muhlheim said demonstrates what might happen if all of its users were switched over to Bing. Mozilla has also previously tried to switch all users’ default search engines, and it didn’t go well. Between 2014 and 2017, the companymade Yahoo the default on its browser, and found that people disliked the experience so much that they switched to another browser altogether. “We would be really struggling to stay alive” If the DOJ’s other proposals work as it hopes, they would theoretically create many more quality search engines that could compete for Firefox’s default positioning, and take over the revenue share Google currently pays it. But Muhlheim says that would likely take such a long time that Mozilla would have to make significant cost cuts and strategy changes all while “waiting on a hypothetical future in which that happened.“ In the meantime, he said, “we would be really struggling to stay alive.” On cross-examination by the DOJ, Muhlheim conceded that it would be preferable not to rely on one customer for the vast majority of its revenue, regardless of the court’s ruling in this case. And, he agreed, another browser company, Opera, has already managed to make more money from browser ads than it does from search deals. But while that may be a potential pathway to diversifying Firefox’s revenue, he added, scaling up such a business at Firefox may look different, in part because of the privacy-preserving approach it takes to products. Mozilla hassupported choice screens for browserson phones and desktops, the DOJ noted, something it would directly benefit from. But it does not support a choice screen for users to select a default search engine in a browser. Muhlheim said Firefox regularly reminds users they have multiple search options — “there are a thousand different search points” in the browser, he testified. “Choice is a core value for us, but context matters,” he added on cross-examination. “The best way to get to choice is not always a choice screen.” Judge Amit Mehta asked Muhlheim if he’d agree that it would benefit Mozilla if at least one other company that matched Google’s quality and ability to monetize searches existed. “If we were suddenly in that world,” Muhlheim said, “that would be a world that would be better for Mozilla.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "In praise of a special little bag",
    "article_text": "Nothing beats a bag with a mission. Nothing beats a bag with a mission. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Nothing cements your relationship status with a new hobby like buying a special bag for it. Hiking? Cycling? Photography? You bet there’s a special bag designed for just that. Getting into a newthingand accumulating gear for it is a joy. An important and underappreciated subcategory of that enjoyment is finding a special bag to hold all of those gadgets. Finding and using that perfect bag — with all the right compartments, hooks, and snaps — is its own particular delight. And it’s high time we gave it the recognition it deserves. There are some purchases that just can’t hold up the hopes we have for them. Who among us hasn’t stood in line to check out at Uniqlo thinking “Theseare the wide-leg jeans that are going to change everything for me,” only to put them in the donation pile six months later? But a special little bag has always been able to support the weight of my expectations, even when they’re sky-high. I’ve never regretted buying one, but I sure as hell have regretted hauling around a bunch of equipment in a bag that wasn’t right for the job. Don’t get me wrong, a good general-purpose bag is a great thing to have.Peak Designmakes some popular backpacks along these lines, and I’ve spent plenty of time daydreaming aboutall the ways a Filson bagwould change my life if I had an extra $500 lying around. MyHerschel Little Americabag has been everything to me, from a commute companion to the toddler’s toy bag stuffed with airplane activities and my last shred of sanity. But certain hobbies call for their own special bag, especially when electronics are involved. Throwing a laptop or a camera into the same compartment as your water bottle and keys can go very wrong. I’ve never regretted buying one, but I sure as hell have regretted hauling around a bunch of equipment in a bag that wasn’t right for the job Last summer I started reallygetting into cycling, which is when I realized that a) I live on top of a giant hill, and b) riding up a hill with a bag full of stuff on my back sucks. There are a few great coffee shops within biking distance from my house, so I started packing up my laptop and heading out on two wheels most afternoons. But the Herschel bag’s back and straps aren’t well ventilated so I would wind up with a sweaty backanda sweaty, gross bag to carry around once I got off the bike. I don’t like the feeling of something on my back when I bike either, especially the way it shifts around when I turn to check behind me. Once I decided that I would be using my bike to commute to my coworking space once or twice a week, my list of special little bag criteria took shape. It needed to carry my laptop and lunch. It needed a couple of small front and side pockets for quick access to stuff. It needed to be reasonably water-resistant. It needed to be comfortable to carry aroundoffthe bike. Most importantly, I didn’t want to carry it on my back while biking. A little research led me toa convertible pannier backpack by Two Wheel Gearand it has been the perfect addition to my burgeoning collection of bike gear. When I’m ready to ride, I fold the backpack straps into a compartment on the back and the whole bag clamps onto my bike’s rear cargo rack securely with a few sturdy hooks. Once I park, I zip the back compartment shut and just snap the straps into place so it’s ready to be carried on my back. It has an outer pocket where I can stash my phone and keys for quick access, plus plenty of interior pockets for all my other stuff. It’s plenty weather resistant on its own, but there’s also a rain cover included in its own pocket. It’s great, I love it, and it has made cruising around town that bit more pleasant. The special little bag is load-bearing in so many ways I had the same experience with hiking a few years ago. I started off with all my little snacks and a Nalgene full of water stuffed into the main compartment of my Herschel backpack for day hikes around the central Cascades. As I started taking on more challenging hikes, having easier access to my water became more important. Likewise with my camera — setting the bag down to grab it from the main compartment was annoying. The Topo bag I bought comes with space for a hydration pack and a zipper on the side so I can swing my bag in front of me and grab my camera without taking it off my shoulder. I use it in conjunction witha small camera insertthat Topo doesn’t seem to sell anymore, which is a real shame because I could write 2,000 words about how much I likethatspecial bag. The trail backpack has a generous compartment for my Nalgene and ample storage for snacks. None of its features prevented a chipmunk from crawling in and nearly stealing my lunch at the top of Tolmie Peak, but that one was on me. The special little bag is load-bearing in so many ways. It keeps your gadgets and personal effects safe. It’s usually more comfortable than the alternative, which is important if you plan on using your back and shoulders into your forties and beyond. Don’t even get me started on the importance of a good diaper bag — every time I’ve switched away from ourbeloved Skip Hop bagit’s been nothing but a disaster. But more than the utility, it’s just plain fun finding and using that special bag; somehow it’s an extension of the hobby itself. “Where’d you get that bag?” is a natural connection point with other enthusiasts, too. Plenty of photographers I’ve met are tired of talking about their brand of camera gear but they will absolutely wax poetic about the Domke bag they bought in 1988. Maybe this is your sign to invest in the special little bag you’ve been eyeing, or maybe it’s just a reminder to show your own special bags a little extra appreciation. Either way, if you see me out on a hiking trail or bike path this summer please don’t hesitate to say, “Hey, where’d you get that bag?” Because I’m just dying to tell you.

Apple is rolling it out internally to start. byJay Peters Apple and Anthropic are building an AI-powered coding tool that will work in Xcode, Apple’s code-writing tool,Bloombergreports. A new version of Xcode will integrate Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet model to “write, edit and test code on behalf of programmers,”Bloombergsays. Apple is slowly rolling this new version out internally initially and apparently has not decided if it will release it to the public. Developers will be able to enter requests in a chat interface, test user interfaces, and help manage bug fixing, according toBloomberg. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment fromThe Verge. Anthropic spokesperson Danielle Ghiglieri declined to comment. Big tech CEOs have touted how AI assists with the development of their internal code, including Microsoft’s Satya Nadellasaying that“maybe 20 to 30 percent of the code that is inside of our repos today in some of our projects are probably all written by software.” OpenAI is also reportedly considering a $3 billion deal to buy theAI-powered coding tool Windsurf, which could make ChatGPT better for helping with coding. Apple announced an AI-powered tool to help with coding called “Swift Assist”at WWDC 2024, but hasn’t yet released it, as noted byBloomberg. The new tool could help Apple get a leg up as it tries to advance its lagging AI efforts. The company recently delayed itsupgraded Siri, saying in a statement that “it’s going to take us longer than we thought” to roll it out despite announcing it in June 2024. Oversight of Siri was recently moved from AI chief John Giannandreato Mike Rockwell, the former head of Vision Pro development. Update, May 2nd: Anthropic declined to comment.

The new feature was shared by Android tinkerer Mishaal Rahman reporting forAndroid Authority. Rahman manually enabled Android Desktop Mode under developer options on his Google Pixel 8 Pro running the latest Android 16 beta. After plugging it into a USB-C compatible monitor, it immediately displays a PC-like interface on the external display,as you can see as in his video: It looks similar to Samsung’suseful DeX featurethat lets youdock a Galaxy smartphoneto a monitor for a windowed experience. Android Desktop Mode puts Android’s status bar on the top so you can see your Wi-Fi and signal strength, and there’s a taskbar on the bottom that lets you pin apps for easy access. The taskbar also gives you a Windows Start Menu–style app drawer, and you get access to Android’s native navigation buttons on the right end of the taskbar. Apps run in windowed modes that look a lot like the experience on Android tablets, but you also get Windows PC–like abilities such as snapping windows to the left and right of the screen. Last year, Rahman found an early version of Google’s desktop experience didn’t do much more than let youdrop a resizable windowed app onto a bigger screen. In March, Google upped its abilities to include a display placement management setting that lets you drag boxes to arrange your mobile screen and monitor so you can make it easier to navigate your cursor between them, much like the display arrangement settings you’ll find on desktop operating systems. Rahman says Desktop Mode might not be ready at launch for Android 16, which isexpected to launch this spring. It could come later in a quarterly update or even as part of Android 17, which won’t likely come until 2026.

Microsoft’s higher-end console also offers 1TB of storage, double the base Series S, along with faster performance thanks to an expanded 12 teraflops of GPU performance. Both the disc-less Xbox Series X and Series S lack an optical drive, meaning they’re limited to playing digital titles.

    "title": "How crypto has increased the Trump family's net worth",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 2, 2025 / 7:41 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump's venture into crypto products has increased his family's wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a new report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in anew reportthat the president'scryptoholdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part tohis releaseof the $TRUMP and $MELANIAmeme coins, in addition to a large stake inWorld Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on \"the autocratic threat to our nation.\" The president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called \"USD1\" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. World Liberty has ties to the president and his sons. The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company. According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens –- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases. Details of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction. In a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. The White House responded to a request for comment by telling CBS News to \"report on something people actually care about.\" A spokesperson providedlinksto several White House technology initiatives. As the president's investments in crypto have grown, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into a dozen crypto companies since his inauguration, a CBS News analysis found. \"The bottom line is it appears like he's profiting off of his public office,\" said Virginia Canter, State Democracy Defenders chief counsel for ethics and anticorruption. Canter, who co-authored the new report, served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations. \"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts,\" Canter said. \"President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry.\" The report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazinearticlethat reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth. Crypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products. Canter says this makes it more difficult to identify potential conflicts of interest. \"In his first administration, we could see who was walking in and out of the Trump hotels,\" she said. The president, who as recently as 2021 described crypto currency as a \"scam,\" has since embraced digital currency, saying he hopes to make the United States the \"crypto capital of the world.\" Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses. He has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, includingonethat seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies andanotherthat instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Mr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to areportby Reuters. The value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts. The value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted \"I Love $TRUMP– SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!\" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24. Whether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. AReutersanalysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading. Aside from meme coins, the Trump family's more recent foray into cryptocurrency may become its most profitable. In October, then-candidate Trump helped launch World Liberty Finance, a decentralized or \"defi\" cryptocurrency exchange. Its website, which heavily features the president's image, offers users the opportunity to buy into the exchange using $WLFI tokens. \"Good News, the World Liberty Financial token is now live. Crypto is the future, let's embrace this incredible technology and lead the world in the digital economy. Go to World Liberty Financial.com,\" Mr. Trumpposted on Xin October, before the presidential election. The website says World Liberty is \"inspired by Donald J. Trump\" and Mr. Trump is listed as chief crypto advocate. His sons, Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, are all listed as Web3 ambassadors. Donald Trump Jr. promoted World Liberty Financial in March, at the D.C. Blockchain conference, where crypto industry insiders rubbed shoulders with members of Congress and the administration. \"I'm just super excited about what this can mean for the future of banking for the future of financial systems,\" said Trump Jr., who joined World Liberty's panel remotely. Founders Chase Herro, Zak Folkman and Zach Witkoff appeared on stage to promote World Liberty's stablecoin offering. \"We want Republicans, Democrats, whether it be black, blue, brown, white, to be using our stable coin,\" said Zach Witkoff, the son of Steven Witkoff, the White House special envoy to the Middle East. \"We think it democratizes finance.\" World Liberty says it hasraised more than $550 millionfrom investors who purchase the $WLF governance token. The majority of these investors remain anonymous to the public. For now, these $WLFI tokens are non redeemable, meaning that once they are purchased, users cannot exchange them. World Liberty denied CBS' multiple requests for an interview. Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire famous for buying and eating a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to the wall, is one of World Liberty's few publicly known investors. Sun, who was being investigated for securities fraud in the Biden administration, said he invested $30 million shortly after Mr. Trump's election, at the time claimingin a post on Xto be World Liberty's\"largest investor.\" Days before Mr. Trump's inauguration, Sun said he invested another $45 million, which he also disclosed in apost on X. A few weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission reversed itself and asked the judge to grant a stay in Sun's case, citing \"public interest.\" The pause in Sun's case was part of a larger push by the SEC to dismiss cases against crypto companies. A spokesperson for Sun and the SEC declined to comment. Last month, Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee sent aletterto the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency about the potential for conflict of interest as the Trump administration considers regulations of companies like World Liberty Financial. \"President Trump's involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence…presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system,\" said the letter, which was signed by five Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen. World Liberty Financial says 85,000 investors have gone through a standard Know Your Customer process to determine \"participation eligibility,\" and the company says it is arranging for a third-party accounting firm to audit its new venture into the U.S.-debt-backed stablecoins. As president, Mr. Trump is not subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest law. But he is required to disclose his assets and income under the Ethics in Government Act, including his crypto assets. The next financial disclosure report deadline for the president is May 15. Madeleine May is an investigative producer at CBS News based in Washington, D.C.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 2, 2025 / 6:54 PM EDT/ CBS News Weeklymeaslescases have set a new record, according to figures published Friday by theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, topping the peak of an outbreak in 2019 that ranked as the worst since the 1990s. The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency'slatest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis. That tops the 102 casesreportedfor the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus wasdeclared eliminatedin 2000. This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any othersingle outbreaksince the virus was eliminated. BetweenTexasandNew Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases inOklahomaand other states have also been linked to the outbreak. There have been 11 other local outbreaks of measles within the U.S. this year, up from 10 last week. While the pace of new cases looks to have declinedin Texas, officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending. \"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement. Anton said authorities are also watching to see if travel from the Easter holiday weekend last month will result in an increase. \"Cases from travel that weekend would likely start to be reported in the next week or two,\" Anton said. This year's tally of cases islikely an undercount, officials and experts have said, citing anecdotes of unreported infections. The unusually high severity of this year's wave also suggests many mild cases of spread are going undiagnosed. For example, authorities in Canadahave confirmedmore than 1,000 measles cases so far this year, after record outbreaks there. The U.S. has tallied at least 935 this year,according tothe CDC. In Canada, 7% of cases have resulted in hospitalizations, less than the 13% of cases that have resulted in hospitalizations in the U.S. Three Americans have also died from measles so far this year, compared to none in Canada.

    "title": "2 groups plan to publish climate research after Trump dismisses scientists",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 2, 2025 / 6:28 PM EDT/ CBS News After the Trump administrationdismissed nearly 400 scientistswho compile the nation's major quadrennial report on the impacts of climate change in the U.S., two scientific groups announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed. TheAmerican Geophysical Union, the world's largest association of earth and space scientists, and theAmerican Meteorological Society, the professional society for atmospheric and related sciences and services, announced they would be inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for what they said would be a \"first of its kind\" collection. The groups say their collection isn't meant to replace theNational Climate Assessment, but would complement it, since the dismissal of hundreds of scientists suggests that the next National Climate Assessment may not be as extensive as the previous ones. The Trump administration is legally obligated to produce the assessment, but the White House told CBS News that it's evaluating the scope of the assessment that it will publish. TheNational Climate Assessmentis a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., and it is congressionally mandated under theGlobal Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027, and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline. The assessment helps federal, state and local governments and businesses to prepare for the impacts of climate change and adapt to and mitigate challenges arising from climate change. American Meteorological Society president David Stensrud praised the National Climate Assessment as \"a comprehensive, rigorous integration and evaluation of the latest climate science knowledge that decision makers — from government at all levels to private enterprise — need in order to understand the world in which we live.\" He said it's \"vital to support and help expand this collaborative scientific effort\" to benefit the U.S. and the world. The American Geophysical Union and American Meteorological Society told CBS News in an email that their new effort will be a \"collection of scientific papers from across multiple journals that address a particular topic,\" and the focus on the collection will be climate change in the United States. American Geophysical Union president Brandon Jones said in a statement, \"This collaboration provides a critical pathway for a wide range of researchers to come together and provide the science needed to support the global enterprise pursuing solutions to climate change.\" The two organizations will open the effort to any scientists who want to submit original work or review articles. Authors who were released from writing the sixth National Climate Assessment are being encouraged to participate and submit their work. The AGU and AMS have not determined when this new collection of climate change research will be published. The groups told CBS News in an email that it's likely to take months, or even years, to produce the full catalogue of research, since every submission will need to undergo a rigorous peer-review process.

    "title": "Sam Altman's eyeball-scanning Orb wants to verify you're human",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 2, 2025 / 5:14 PM EDT/ CBS News Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the architect of ChatGPT, is behind a venture that wants to solve a modern-day problem: proving you're human amidst a proliferation of bots and artificial intelligence. The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior. The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people. The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\" World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service,accordingto the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit,includingHong Kong andSpain. \"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\" The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb,accordingto World's website. World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies. The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into thecryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation. The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human. \"It takes a founder of the brand and acumen of a Sam Altman to really do digital identity,\" Brukhman said. The U.S. rollout \"will massively bolster the adoption of registered users on the network.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

    "title": "Plan for possible military parade on Trump's birthday includes troops, vehicles",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 2, 2025 / 4:44 PM EDT/ AP The Army is planning for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday on June 14 that would include \"thousands\" of troops, as well and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, the White House and a defense official confirmed. According to planning documents obtained by the AP, the parade calls for over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians. The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element — a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted. The Army anniversary coincides with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14. A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members. High costs halted Mr. Trump'spushfor aparadein his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads. Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary. \"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\" said Butler. \"We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\" Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely. Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in. Mr. Trump weighed in on the military Thursday night, though he didn't mention plans for June 14. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \"We are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" He said he would rename May 8 — known as Victory in Europe Day — as \"Victory Day for World War II\" and change Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, to \"Victory Day for World War I.\" Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment. A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support. The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one. The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles. There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations. According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review. And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks. One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \"significant concerns regarding security requirements\" as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating. In his first term, Trump proposed having aparadeafter seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Mr. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue. That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs — with one estimate of a $92 million price tag — and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads. Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging. This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington. Bowser at the time said she didn't know if the event was being \"characterized as a military parade\" but added that tanks rolling through the city's streets \"would not be good.\" \"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said. In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade — at that time — would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 2, 2025 / 3:22 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Gregg Popovich, the winningest coach in the NBA, is stepping down as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs after nearly three decades, theteam announcedon Friday. \"While my love and passion for this game remain, I've decided it's time to step away as head coach,\" Popovich said. \"I'm forever grateful to the wonderful players, coaches, staff and fans who allowed me to serve them as the Spurs head coach and am excited for the opportunity to continue to support the organization, community and city that are so meaningful to me.\" Popovich will remain as team president. Mitch Johnson was promoted to head coach. During his tenure as head coach, Popovich, 76, led the team to five NBA championships, became the league's all-time wins leader and earned an induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame. \"Coach Pop's extraordinary impact on our family, San Antonio, the Spurs and the game of basketball is profound,\" Spurs managing partner Peter J. Holt said in a statement. \"His accolades and awards don't do justice to the impact he has had on so many people. He is truly one-of-one as a person, leader and coach.\" Popovich missed all but five games this season after having a stroke at the team's arena on Nov. 2, 2024. He has not spoken publicly since, though he had addressed his team at least once and released a statement in late March saying he hoped to return to coaching. Popovich joined the Spurs in the summer of 1988 as an assistant coach to then-head coach Larry Brown. Before that, he spent two seasons, from 1992-1994, as an assistant coach for Don Nelson with the Golden State Warriors. In his role as general manager of the Spurs, Popovich made the move to fire coach Bob Hill and promote himself to that job on Dec. 10, 1996. \"A change in direction was necessary,\" Popovich said that day. The Spurs hadn't changed direction again since. Popovich's career ends with a record of 1,422-869, which does include the 77 games — 32 wins and 45 losses — that were coached by Spurs assistant Johnson this season. He also won 170 playoff games with the Spurs, the most by any coach with any one team and the third-most overall behind only Phil Jackson's 229 and Pat Riley's 171. \"Gregg Popovich's sustained success as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs is incomparable. ... There are few people in the basketball community as beloved and revered as Coach Pop,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. Popovich also served as coach for Team USA, leading them to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Johnson had been the acting coach for the final 77 games the Spurs played this season. He will be formally introduced on Monday. \"We are thrilled for Mitch Johnson to be our next head coach,\" Holt said. \"Throughout his decade in the organization, we have seen that Mitch has the right values, poise and potential to lead us into the future.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 2, 2025 / 3:16 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump's budget proposal would cut 22% of non-defense discretionary spending next year while significantly increasing defense spending, according to a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget and information provided by the White House. The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House'sDepartment of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. \"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said. The White House isn't yet saying what their deficit or revenue projections will be. The president's recommendation is in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress, which is responsible for crafting and passing a budget. On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal. The senior OMB official said the president's budget proposal includes \"an enormous cut to foreign aid, but one that still preserves substantial presence\" to provide for \"targeted\" aid when it's in the interest of the United States. But spending on things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be the biggest drivers of the federal deficit and national debt, and those programs, along with interest on the debt, are taking up an increasingly large piece of the federal spending pie. A senior administration official said the president has been \"very, very involved\" in the budget proposal process. \"Obviously, this president's budget, he's very, very involved throughout the process,\" the official told reporters on the conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We had four years of budgets to build on and come into office, see the damage that the Biden administration has wrecked on our fiscal house, and to make updates and incorporate many of the changes that have been identified from DOGE and come to you with a proposal.\" Sara  Cookcontributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 2, 2025 / 2:21 PM EDT/ CBS News If your seasonal sneezing and other symptoms are worse this year, you're not alone —allergy sufferersare seeing (and feeling the effects of) the pollen outside. \"For many people, it probably does feel worse — and there's a reason for that. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns mean plants release pollen earlier and for longer stretches of time,\" Dr. Steve Furr, board chair of theAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, told CBS News. \"If you've been sneezing more than usual or feeling those itchy eyes persistently, you're not alone this year.\" May is also typically peak pollen season with high levels of both tree pollens and grass pollens, Dr. Robert Zemble, allergy division chief at Lehigh Valley Health Network, told CBS News. Even if you never had pollen allergies before, you can actually develop them as an adult,Dr. Mallika Marshall told CBS News Bostonlast month. \"You can blame climate change, because warmer temperatures are causing plants to bloom earlier and produce more pollen. Therefore, there's just more of it in the air,\" Marshall echoed. Pollen is one of the mostcommon triggersof seasonal allergies, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. A pollen count, which is how much pollen is in the air, can help those with allergies know when symptoms may be especially stirred up. \"Simply put, high pollen counts mean increased symptoms for allergy sufferers,\" Zemble said. \"Different regions are worse for seasonal allergies based on their plant growth present, temperature, precipitation and geological topography.\" In March, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America releasedits annual report, ranking the most challenging U.S. cities for those dealing withseasonal allergies. For three years in a row, Wichita, Kansas,ranked as the most challengingcity for pollen allergies and cities in the South and East ranked among the hardest hit. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology's National Allergy Bureautracks pollen levelsacross the country. Furr said allergies can cause an array of symptoms, including: \"But they don't come with a fever, body aches, or sore throat,\" he said. \"Colds can look similar but often include more fatigue, sore throat and sometimes mild fever. COVID symptoms are more variable but often include fever, fatigue, cough and sometimes loss of taste or smell—none of which you'd expect from allergies.\" While pollen can be found year-round, grass pollen is most common from April through early June, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Tree pollen also begins to slow in late spring to early summer, but pollen levels vary by location. Luckily, there are things you can do in the meantime to reduce allergy symptoms. Limit exposure:\"Keep windows in your home and your car closed, leave your shoes and outerwear at the door so you don't track pollen into your home and shower at night, so you don't bring that pollen into bed with you,\" Marshall suggested. Zemble said you can also cover your hair and eyes with hats and sunglasses while outdoors to limit exposure. Medication options:\"Over-the-counter antihistamines, nasal sprays or eye drops can be very effective for most people,\" Furr said. \"It's a good idea to start using them before your symptoms really ramp up.\" Seek professional support:If over-the-counter medications aren't helping or symptoms are interfering with your daily life, Furr suggests making an appointment with your family physician. \"We can talk about prescription options, allergy testing or even longer-term solutions like immunotherapy (such as) allergy shots or tablets,\" he said. \"You don't have to just 'tough it out' every spring!\" Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 1, 2025 / 11:13 PM EDT/ CBS News The Senate on Thursday approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act and designed to limit seven of the most hazardousair pollutantsthat are emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law. Senate Republicans utilized the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2024. The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass. The ruletied to the Clean Air Actwas finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\" The rule requires that industrial facilities — often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution — always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule. The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said thatthe rule forced 1,800 facilities across the countryto tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law. The seven pollutants in question are: Several Republican lawmakers have been attempting to revoke the rule. Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah introducedthe resolutionwhich passed Thursday. Curtis had argued that the rule disincentivized companies to deploy new technology to reduce pollution. \"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\" Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move. \"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy forMoms Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind — chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\" Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement, \"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\" The vote marks a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, which had lobbied against the \"Once in, Always In\" rule for some time. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group,sent a letter to Mr. Trumpafter his inauguration calling the rule \"burdensome,\" and listing it as one of several environmental regulations that are \"strangling our economy\" and should be reversed. Since January, the Trump administration has undertaken a series of efforts to weaken the EPA throughderegulationandstaffing reductions. In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" last week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldinarguedthe rollbacks won't have adverse impacts on health or the environment. Tracy J.

Garcia said attending college \"means having an opportunity to get out of here.\" It's an opportunity made possible through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. \"FAFSA, man, they have a lot of issues,\" Garcia told CBS News. \"It always gave me, like, some errors, or something. Yes, it was just pretty tedious.\" Aftera botched rollout of last year's FAFSA applicationunder the Biden administration, it was delayed again this year, with students encountering error messages and glitches on the site. Making things more challenging werethe unprecedented cutsto the Department of Education last month, impacting nearly half of the office of Federal Student Aid, which is responsible for managing FAFSA. Garcia, who will be attending Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College in the fall, said he tried to call the Federal Student Aid Information Center for help \"more times than what I can count. At some point I just wanted to stop.\" Lina McCormick-Morin, deputy director of the Southern California College Attainment Network — an education equity group that seeks to help underrepresented students achieve a college education, helps low-income students navigate the FAFSA system. \"The process is really grueling,\" McCormick-Morin said. \"It is genuinely like filing taxes and being audited at the same time.\" Thursday is National College Decision Day, which is the deadline for when most college-bound students have to declare which school they will attend in the fall. McCormick-Morin has seen college dreams put on hold, as only 58% of eligible California high school seniors successfully submitted FAFSA applications for the upcoming school year,according tothe California Student Aid Commission. \"It is difficult to see what is efficient about cutting the working capacity of any department that was already understaffed,\" McCormick-Morin said. University of Southern California junior Stephani Jaramillo and California State University, Northridge junior Jose Pablo-Corona told CBS News they don't have safety nets — they only have FAFSA. \"I worry that without that help, I won't be able to continue my education,\" Pablo-Corona said. \"So I'm pretty worried.\" Jaramillo said that \"for me, financial aid is hope, it's a stepping stone to reaching a potential future that I've been looking forward to my whole life.\" Now, both are concerned whether they will see their financial aid in time to complete college.\"Everyone chases some sort of American dream,\" Jaramillo said. \"No matter what it looks like, some sort of, like, happiness and stability. For me, that's my education.\" Tom Hanson is a national investigative correspondent for CBS News and Stations. His in-depth reports air across all platforms and programs.

    "title": "Judge strikes down 'unprecedented' Trump order targeting Perkins Coie law firm",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday struck down President Donald Trump’sexecutive ordertargeting the law firm Perkins Coie in a blistering opinion calling the president’s efforts “an unprecedented attack” on the U.S. judicial system. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee,issued a permanent injunctionbarring the enforcement of any part of Trump’s order from March, which focused on the firm’s representation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and its work with billionaire donor George Soros. “No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers,’” Howell wrote. “The importance of independent lawyers to ensuring the American judicial system’s fair and impartial administration of justice has been recognized in this country since its founding era,” Howell wrote, referencing John Adams’ decision to represent eight British soldiers charged with murder in connection with the Boston Massacre. She said Trump’s order “violates the Constitution and is thus null and void.” A spokesperson for Perkins Coie said in a statement that the judge's ruling \"affirms core constitutional freedoms all Americans hold dear, including free speech, due process, and the right to select counsel without the fear of retribution.\" \"We are pleased with this decision and are immensely grateful to those who spoke up in support of our positions. As we move forward, we remain guided by the same commitments that first compelled us to bring this challenge: to protect our firm, safeguard the interests of our clients, and uphold the rule of law,” the spokesperson said. The Justice Department did not immediately provide a comment Friday night. Trump’s executive order limited Perkins Coie employees’ access to government buildings, revoked security clearances at the firm, and ordered the heads of all federal agencies to terminate contracts with the firm and refrain from hiring employees who worked there. Follow live politics coverage here Howell had grilled Justice Department lawyer Richard Lawson at a hearing over the measure last week, and Lawson was unable to answer basic questions about theother firms that had reached deals with the White Houseto avoid their own executive orders. Howell also used a footnote in Friday’s order to criticize firms that took deals with the White House, writing that “some clients may harbor reservations about the implications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically responsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat of being targeted in an Executive Order.” Trump has targeted numerous law firms via executive order, prompting some to strike deals with the White House that include committing millions of dollars in pro bono representation for clients and causes supported by the Trump administration and getting rid of internal DEI policies. Concessions by firms such as Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have generated backlash within the legal community, including a protest lettersigned by dozensof Skadden alumni who were outraged by the firm’s deal with Trump. In Friday's order, Howell wrote that Trump’s “multi-year history of lodging public attacks” on Perkins Coie and “his promises during the 2024 campaign to act on his displeasure” toward the firm if he won further demonstrates that the executive order “was issued to seek retribution against plaintiff for the Firm’s representation of clients in political campaigns or litigation, about which President Trump expressed disapproval, dating back to 2017.” “This purpose amounts to no more than unconstitutional retaliation for plaintiff’s First Amendment protected activity,” she added.",

    "title": "Trump administration asks Supreme Court to grant DOGE access to Social Security data",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court's order restricting affiliates of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive Social Security Administration data, arguing in a Friday filing that the judicial order limits President Donald Trump’s executive authority. “This emergency application presents a now-familiar theme,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. “A district court has issued sweeping injunctive relief without legal authority to do so, in ways that inflict ongoing, irreparable harm on urgent federal priorities and stymie the Executive Branch’s functions.” Sauer urged the court tolift an injunctionissued by U.S. District  Judge Ellen Hollander blocking DOGE from accessing the data, which includes Social Security numbers, medical records and tax and banking information. While the Supreme Court considers a more permanent stay, the Trump administration is seeking an immediate pause on Hollander’s order arguing that the order prevents the Musk-led agency from carrying out its stated function of detecting waste and fraud, describing that effort as “time sensitive.” Follow live politics coverage here “The district court’s flawed injunction forecloses the Executive Branch from carrying out the pressing priorities of modernizing government information systems and ferreting out fraud, waste, and abuse—all at the behest of plaintiffs who gave their information to the agencies with the knowledge that other government employees may access their data. The district court has now blocked these time-sensitive efforts for over a month, without any legal basis for doing so,” he wrote. The Supreme Court has asked the attorneys for theunion groups seekingto block DOGE's access to respond to the administration's request by May 12. Earlier this week, the full Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Trump administration’s request for a stay in this matter. In a 9-6 decision, the panel backed the district court's decision to block DOGE from accessing the highly personal data. Hollander’s opinion, the appeals court wrote, “emphasizes that all this highly sensitive personal information has long been handed over to SSA by the American people with every reason to believe that the information would be fiercely protected.” The panel also said the government has yet to prove that DOGE is unable to complete its work with the anonymized and redacted data it currently has access to. “The evidentiary record establishes no need for such access; rather, the evidence demonstrates that DOGE’s work could be accomplished largely with anonymized and redacted data, along with discrete pieces of non-anonymized data in limited, appropriate circumstances — as has long been typical at SSA for the type of technology upgrades and waste, abuse, and fraud detection that DOGE claims to be doing,” the appeals court wrote. Since starting its work in January, DOGE has facedat least 11 lawsuitsspecifically targeting its efforts to access large swaths of Americans' personal information. Many of the lawsuits argue DOGE is violating thePrivacy Act of 1974, which heavily regulates what information about American citizens federal agencies can store and who can access that information. A federal judge in Marchblocked DOGEand its affiliates from accessing sensitive personal information from the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Treasury. The administration's effort to secure DOGE greater access to sensitive information comes as polling suggests voters are concerned with how the Musk-led group has executed its work.A recent NBC News pollfound 47% of voters hold a negative view of the effort, while 51% hold negative views about Musk specifically. Musk hasannounced plansto soon wind down his work at the White House to focus more on his businesses, telling reporters on Wednesday that he's confident DOGE's work will continue in his absence.",

    "title": "Trump unveils budget slashing health, education and clean energy programs while growing military",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump released abudget proposalFriday calling for a mix of cuts to domestic programs involving public health, education and clean energy, while seeking to increase spending on the military when factoring in a one-time boost. The 40-page request was addressed to congressional leaders and accompanied by a letter from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought addressed to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Overall, Vought said the proposal contains a 23% cut ($163 billion) in discretionary funding, and a 13% increase in military spending after including the $150 billion Republicans are eying in a separate bill. The White House budget comes as the Republican-led Congress is seeking to craft a massive bill for Trump’s priorities of tax cuts, higher spending on immigration enforcement and the military, spending cuts in other parts of the federal government, and a debt limit increase. Vought mentioned the calls for border funding in the new budget blueprint. The budget sparked some unusual pushback from Republican defense hawks, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who accused the White House of using accounting tricks to make it look like the White House wants “a trillion-dollar budget.” “It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms,” Wicker said in a statement, referring to the Pentagon spending level outside the one-time supplemental. “This budget would decrease President Trump’s military options and his negotiating leverage. We face an Axis of Aggressors led by the Chinese Communist Party, who have already started a trade war rather than negotiate in good faith.” White House budgets are usually symbolic and never become law as written. But they represent the president’s vision for spending and tend to influence the debate on Capitol Hill. They also tend to be a vehicle for messaging on the White House’s most popular priorities — and often propose difficult policy compromises or cuts that become the basis for political attacks from the opposition party. Trump’s new proposals could affect the next round of government funding talks, with funding set to expire on Sept. 30 afterpassage of a six-month funding billin early March. That legislation — unlike the party-line \"reconciliation\" bill — is subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate, meaning it will need significant Democratic support to become law in the Republican-controlled Congress. Trump's budget proposes a variety of steep cuts to well-known government programs, including cutting the National Institutes of Health by $18 billion compared with 2025 levels, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $4 billion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $3.6 billion. The budget also calls for various cuts to clean energy funding, education funding, scientific research and international aid. And it proposes a funding boost for Trump priorities, including a $43.8 billion boost to the Department of Homeland Security, $113.3 billion for the Defense Department and $500 million for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"MAHA\" — \"make America healthy again\" — priorities like promoting nutrition and exercise. The Trump proposal is limited to \"discretionary\" spending and excludes proposals on \"mandatory\" spending, the major part of the U.S. budget that covers safety net programs like Social Security, Medicareand Medicaid. Yet that's where difficult decisions on federal spending ultimately lie, with Medicaid proving to be asticking point among Republicansas they consider their big bill on Trump's tax and spending priorities later this year. Trump's budget won praise from Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called it \"a bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American strength and prosperity.\" \"House Republicans stand ready to work alongside President Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first,\" he said. It was slammed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who vowed that Democrats will \"fight this heartless budget with everything we’ve got.\" \"Donald Trump’s days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"As he guts healthcare, slashes education, and hollows out programs families rely on — he’s bankrolling tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. It’s not just fiscally irresponsible, it’s a betrayal of working people from a morally bankrupt president.\" Collins also responded in a Friday statement calling the request “simply one step in the annual budget process” and noting: “Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.” “This request has come to Congress late, and key details still remain outstanding,” Collins said, expressing “serious objections” to various provisions including cuts to programs like “LIHEAP, TRIO [an Education Department program], and those that support biomedical research.”",

    "article_text": "Former “Project Runway” production assistantMiriam Haleystormed out of a New York criminal courtroom Friday, moments after breaking down in tears and cursing on the stand during her fourth day atHarvey Weinstein’s sex crimes retrial. Haley, 48, was about 30 minutes into her testimony when Weinstein’s lawyer Jennifer Bonjean began grilling her on what she was wearing the night she alleges Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her at his SoHo home in July 2006. She had previously testified that, weeks later, Weinstein raped her in a Tribeca hotel room. \"He took my clothes off … I didn’t take my clothes off,\" Haley testified about the apartment incident. “He was the one who raped me, not the other way.” \"That’s for the jury to decide,\" Bonjean responded, escalating the exchange. As tears began to stream down her face, Haley stressed it was her experience and yelled: \"Don’t tell me I wasn’t raped by that f–--ing a–--hole!\" The outburst prompted Haley to request a break, which Judge Curtis Farber allowed. The jurors were sent out of the courtroom for a 10-minute recess before Haley briskly walked out through a side door. When court resumed Friday afternoon, Haley was not crying as Bonjean once again began to question her about the clothes she was wearing and how they were removed. \"I did not remove my clothes,\" she responded. \"I was on my period … I did not remove my clothes.\" This is the second time that Haley has faced Weinstein in criminal court. In 2020, Haley testified in Weinstein’s first trial, which resulted in alandmark 2020 convictionthat was overturned last year. \"He put his mouth on my vagina, before and after he pulled out the tampon, he put his mouth on my vagina forcefully,\" Haley testified earlier this week about the 2006 encounter. \"I was mortified, I was embarrassed, in disbelief.\" Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. He is also charged with one count of third-degree rape in connection with an alleged assault on actressJessica Mann, who is expected to testify, in 2013. He is also facing a charge in connection with the alleged 2006 assault of a Polish former model namedKaja Sokola, who is expected to testify. \"He knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Luceysaid during opening statements, alleging that Weinstein used his power to lure young women. \"He knew how the promises of success worked.\" Weinstein has denied all allegations, and his lawyers argued the sexual encounters with the accusers were all \"transactional\" and \"consensual.\"",

    "article_text": "Voters in a part of south Texas that is home to Elon Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, will decide Saturday whether to officially turn a small, coastal stretch at the southern tip of the Lone Star State into a city named Starbase. If the measure passes, which seems likely, the newly incorporated city would cover only about 1½ square miles, but it would be a much-needed win for the tech billionaire who has had a bruising past few months. In the first weeks of President Donald Trump’s administration,Musk was a mainstay at the White House, flexing his temporary role as chief of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw cuts andwidespread layoffs across federal agencies. But while DOGE projects helped Musk gain enormous power and influence, his reputation has taken a beating in the process. His outsize role in the Trump administration and hisefforts to downsize the federal workforcehave made him the target of protests around the country. And his electric car company, Tesla,reported a steep drop in profitslast month. But Saturday’s vote is expected to be a sure victory for the controversial billionaire. For one, most of the 283 eligible voters — residents of Cameron County whose homes would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city — are SpaceX employees or have some connection to the company.",

In today's edition, we have the first comments from Kristen Welker’s exclusive interview with President Donald Trump. Plus, we’re looking at another U.S. ally — after Canada — that has seen its upcoming election roiled by Trump as he reshapes not just American politics but global politics as well. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Scott Bland President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed concerns about potential economic trouble, saying everything would be “OK” in the long term, even if the U.S economy experienced a recession in the short term. Asked twice by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long term if there was a recession in the short term, the president said, “Look, yeah, it’s — everything’s OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” Following up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.” The remarks come as analysts on Wall Streetare increasingly worriedthat the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy. “Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added. According to initialmeasurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economyshrunk by 0.3%in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and aboost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs. On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying that it was a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind. “You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.” Read more → Days after aCanadian electionthat hinged on who wouldbest stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump, he is at thecenter of an electionin another liberal democracy. Trust in the United States is plummeting inAustralia, which votes Saturday amidglobal financial turmoilsparked by tariffs Trump hasimposed on trading partnersaround the world including Australia, a U.S. ally and vital security partner in counteringChina. As in Canada, Australia’s opposition conservative party, the Liberal Party, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump. Apoll released last monthby the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States — the lowest in the annual poll’s two-decade history. While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump’s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia’s security.

    "title": "Woman's ex accused of sending video of her body in plot to frame man for her murder",
    "article_text": "The Ohio mancharged with fatally stabbing a womanhe described as his “soulmate” shared a video from a fake social media account that showed the victim’s lifeless body in an effort to frame another man for the killing, court records obtained Friday show. The video, sent via Facebook, lasted five seconds and included R&B singer Chris Brown's \"Stutter\" playing in the background, according to a probable cause affidavit from a detective in Jefferson County, Indiana. The message was one of several that authorities accused Nigel Thomas, 34, of sending in an in elaborate plot to frame the other man, Shawn Bailey, for the murder of Wilma Robertson. The messages were sent to Robertson's relatives and people associated with her, according to the affidavit. The messages showed Bailey appearing to admit killing Robertson last month, the affidavit states. Bailey, who had dated Robertson, was arrested in connection with her murder on April 15, shortly after the Facebook video was shared with the girlfriend of Robertson’s ex-husband, according to the affidavit. A message sent to the girlfriend indicated that Bailey had done the ex-husband \"a favor\" and he no longer had to worry about Robertson, the affidavit states. Bailey, 33, remained in jail until April 25, the Jefferson County Prosecutor's Office said earlier this week. Bailey did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Thomas, who made his initial appearance in an Indiana courtroom Friday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thomas was charged with one count of felony murder and one count of obstruction of justice. \"It seems that he has absolutely no remorse whatsoever,\" Robertson's cousin, Kimberly Danner, said of Thomas in an interview. \"It's super insulting.\" Danner grew up with her cousin in Kentucky and said the two were more like sisters. She described Robertson, a certified nursing assistant and mother of two, as a free spirit who had a knack for making people laugh. Danner said her cousin met Thomas after she separated from her ex-husband a few years ago. Initially, Danner recalled, Robertson said that Thomas — a rapper who went by \"Nati Bang\" — \"understood her like nobody else.\" He wrote a love song about her, \"A Girl Named Wilma,\" that remains online, she said. The couple went to California, Danner said, though their relationship became \"toxic\" and in January 2024, Robertson returned to Kentucky,  Danner said. \"When she got back, she was just on this healing journey,\" Danner recalled. \"She wanted to come back, get her life on track, get her kids and take them back to California.\" Initially, Danner said, she spoke regularly to her cousin. But Robertson went silent roughly a year ago for reasons that remain unclear, Danner said. According to the affidavit, authorities believe Robertson was killed on April 11 or 12 at her home in Hanover, Indiana. Her body was discovered on April 14 in a utility room. Two stab wounds were found in her back, the affidavit states. Danner learned of her cousin's death on April 14, she said, though initially her family had no details about what happened. Later that night, she said, the video showing Robertson's body was seen by her ex-husband when his girlfriend received it. That, Danner said, \"is when we knew what had happened to her.\" After Bailey's April 15 arrest, he denied taking video of Robertson's body or sending messages, the affidavit states. He told authorities he'd been roughly 40 miles away, in Louisville, Kentucky, at the time of her death. A day later, Danner said she, too, received a Facebook message from someone purporting to be Shawn Bailey. Robertson's sister had also received a message from the supposed Shawn Bailey on Instagram, according to the affidavit, but by then, Danner said, she'd learned of Bailey's arrest and knew the messages were probably fake. \"I immediately knew it was Nati,\" she said, noting that she was on the phone with a detective at the time discussing Bailey's arrest. \"I was like, 'Let me tell you about this other guy she used to date.'\" The affidavit cites dozens of messages posted on Thomas' Facebook profile about Robertson in the days after her death, some of which describe her as Thomas' \"soulmate.\" Several of the messages tag Robertson's family. One, posted April 23, says: \"THEY TOOK THE ONLY ONE I REALLY TRUST SHE KNOWS ALL MY PAIN OF WHAT MY FAMILY DONE TO ME ITS WAR OVER YOU!!!!!\" Investigators later confirmed Shawn Bailey's alibi, according to the affidavit, and they discovered that the Shawn Bailey Facebook account was accessed by an IP address in Oxford, Ohio, while Bailey was incarcerated in Louisville. DNA found on the handle of a bloody knife at the crime scene excluded Bailey as a suspect, according to the affidavit, but showed a \"moderate\" match to Thomas. Thomas, who lived in Oxford, was arrested April 25, the same day Bailey was released, according to the Jefferson County Prosecutor's Office. For Danner, Thomas' arrest forced her to finally confront her cousin's death. \"That was probably the first time that I finally, really accepted that she was gone,\" Danner said. At Robertson's funeral, she said, \"it didn't feel like she was at peace at all. I feel it's because they had arrested the wrong person.\"",

    "title": "With his communal journal, Southwest employee invites passengers to let their feelings fly",
    "article_text": "DALLAS — If you board a plane with flight attendant John McKay, you’re likely going to be offered much more than a bag of pretzels. That’s because in addition to his carry-on, the Las Vegas-based Southwest Airlines employee packs a journal that really belongs to his passengers. Sometimes McKay makes an announcement, other times he says he’ll just hand the journal to a passenger who seems like a good fit. There are no instructions or rules for what happens next. Passengers add whatever comes to mind. Some have spontaneously shared poetry, prayers and even love advice. “Don’t ever give up on love, even when it feels like it’s nowhere to be found,” one person wrote. “I lift up Catalina to you, she is facing another battle with cancer,” another said. Others let their art do the talking. “People may be traveling for a happy reason or a sad reason, and you oftentimes don’t have time to figure that out,\" McKay said. \"So it was a way that I kind of keyed into that.\" The flight attendant said he was inspired by someone else's idea  idea and started sharing his journal in 2023. Then he flew from Maui after that island’s devastating wildfires. “I made an announcement about the journal that day, and before I could finish the announcement, there was a guy in the front row that grabbed that out of my hands, and it traveled the entire plane for the rest of the five hours,\" he said. Passengers poured their hearts out about more than just Maui on the journal's pages. “Lost my son a year and a half ago, couldn’t work, couldn’t get out of bed for almost 10 months,” someone wrote. “It’s powerful stuff,” said McKay, adding, “I think connection is the most important thing for humans.” A concept that has resonated so much that McKay recently started the project’s third journal. On a recent flight from Dallas to Houston, McKay traveled as a passenger to see his project in motion. Shorlty after takeoff, passenger Eliza Norris quickly offered to put pen to paper. “Thought I had it all … and so many losses also. Through it all never give up,” she wrote.",

    "title": "Trump may get a new national security adviser — or he might just keep Marco Rubio",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Secretary of state is a big job.But try piling on top of thatacting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, acting head of the National Archives and Records Administration and acting national security adviser. That’s Marco Rubio’s resume right now, and it might be that way for a while. Rubio gained his latest title after President Donald Trump announced that Michael Waltz — who has been under scrutiny since his central role in the Signal chat leak —would be stepping downand instead be nominated for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The White House raised the possibility of Rubio taking over Waltz’s job more than a month ago, according to a senior administration official. But it was tabled until recently, when Trump decided he’d had enough of Waltz. There is a very real possibility that Trump keeps Rubio in the national security adviser role for the long term, according to three people familiar with the matter, including two administration officials. Trump appears to be in no hurry to find a replacement. “The president has assembled an incredibly talented team that is fully committed to putting America and Americans first,” a senior State Department official said in a statement. “Secretary Rubio looks forward to serving as his interim National Security Advisor while ensuring the mission critical work at the State Department continues uninterrupted.” Two of the sources said Waltz’s departure had been simmering for weeks afterThe Atlantic reported on March 24thathe created a group chatwith top administration officials on the private messaging app Signal and inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the magazine. But, one of the sources added, there was no appetite for immediately handing critics a victory by firing Waltz — leading to the decision to send him to the United Nations instead. The senior administration official said the move was partly a lesson Trump learned from his first term: firing officials so they exit creates potential enemies who know a lot about the inner workings of the White House and how the president has operated. But moving them to a different job keeps them close. Another senior administration official disputed this assessment, saying, “That was not part of the calculus at all.” It’s widely expected that Waltz will get confirmed by the Senate if Trump does follow through and nominate him to be ambassador. Several names have been mentioned as possible candidates to be the next national security adviser, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke with NBC News. They include Michael Anton, the policy planning director at the State Department; Chris Landau, deputy secretary of state; and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and one of the administration’s most influential voices on policy. Miller did not return a request for comment Friday. There’s also a question about who will serve as deputy national security adviser — a role that could have outsize importance if Rubio continues to hold multiple jobs. Alex Wong, who was Waltz’s deputy, remains at the National Security Council for now, both to help with the transition and to make sure Trump’s upcoming foreign trip to the Middle East goes smoothly, according to two senior administration officials. Much of the planning for a trip — which will be Trump’s first major foreign trip in his second term, aside from attending the pope’s funeral — is done by the council. Rubio is the first person since Henry Kissinger to hold the role of secretary of state and national security adviser at the same time.",

    "title": "Trump downplays recession fears, saying the U.S. would be 'OK' in the long term",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed concerns about potential economic trouble, saying everything would be “OK” in the long term, even if the U.S economy experienced a recession in the short term. Asked twice by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long run if there were a recession in the short term, the president said, “Look, yeah, it’s — everything’s OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” Following up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.” The remarks come as analysts on Wall Streetare increasingly worriedthat the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy. “Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added. According to initialmeasurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economyshrank by 0.3%in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and aboost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs. On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying they were a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind. “You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.” “That’s not Trump,” he added Wednesday. “Because we came in on January, these are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy, destroying our country in so many ways.” Since the start of his administration in January, Trump has sought to impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Early last month, the presidentpausedthe introduction of largertariffs on most countries for 90 days, just days after imposing them. His partial retreat fueled a rally in markets, which as of Friday recovered the losses they suffered after his initial tariff announcement on April 2. At the same time, Trump slapped even more tariffs on China, raising the tariff rate on the Asian nation to 145%. Still, the president has repeatedly dismissed concerns that the tariffs on China will have major effects on the prices or availability of consumer goods in the U.S. During the Cabinet meeting, he told reporters, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”",

    "title": "Former aide who refuted Trump's false 2020 election claims is under federal investigation",
    "article_text": "A former senior cybersecurity official who refuted President Donald Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was “rigged” is under federal investigation, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Chris Krebs is facing an unspecified government investigation, the DHS spokesperson said. As a result, Krebs was expelled from a U.S. customs program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved American travelers at airports, known as Global Entry. “Chris Krebs is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies,\" the DHS spokesperson told NBC News. \"That is a fact disqualifying him for global entry.” Officials declined to say why Krebs was under investigation or which federal agencies were leading the probe.CNN first reportedKrebs' suspension from the Global Entry program. The White House referred NBC News to the DHS and Justice Department for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment. Krebs, who served as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during Trump’s first term, declined to comment. Trump fired Krebs after he said in a statement that the 2020 election was the “most secure in American history.” Krebs added, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” The investigation of Krebs comes after President Trump issued amemorandumon April 9 directing the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to “take all appropriate action to review” Krebs’ activities during his time in government. The memo also revoked Krebs’ security clearance. The memo targeting Krebs, and asimilar memonaming former senior DHS official Miles Taylor, marked an escalation in President Trump’s campaign of retribution against perceived political enemies. It was the first time the president had requested possible government investigations against individuals. The presidential memorandum accused Krebs of seeking to suppress “conservative viewpoints” on social media about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 epidemic, by allegedly coercing social media platforms under the “guise of combatting supposed disinformation.” The memo claimed Krebs “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.” Trump has repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election was “stolen” but there is no evidence that the vote was plagued by widespread fraud. More than 50 lawsuitsbrought by Trump or his allies alleging fraud and irregularities have been withdrawn, dismissed or denied by state and federal judges. After Trump signed the memorandum last month cancelling Krebs’ security clearance, Krebs stepped down from his role at the cyber security firm SentinelOne to prepare his legal defense. Security clearances are crucial for employees working on federal cyber security contracts. Over 40 cybersecurity experts signed anopen letteron April 29 condemning what they called “the political persecution” of Krebs. “By placing Krebs and SentinelOne in the crosshairs, the President is signaling that cybersecurity professionals whose findings do not align with his narrative risk having their businesses and livelihoods subjected to spurious and retaliatory targeting,\" the letter stated, \"the same bullying tactic he has recently used against law firms.\"",

    "title": "Private organizations step up to do science that was cut back by the Trump administration",
    "article_text": "After the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of authors working on the next National Climate Assessment, two science societies announced an effort to publish a special collection of climate change research in its stead. The Trump administration notified researchers earlier this week that their work was no longer needed on the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report that summarizes the effects of global climate change in the United States. The report’s future is no longer clear and some authors have expressed concern that it will be whittled down, unscientific or inadequate in expressing the risks of climate change. “I’m certainly concerned it might be fulfilled in a way that’s less rigorous and evidence-based,” said Robert Kopp, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University, who was one of the recently dismissed National Climate Assessment authors. In the wake of the administration’s action, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and American Meteorological Society (AMS) announced Friday that they would develop a special collection of research focused on climate, according to a news release from both organizations. The new collection, to be spread among more than two dozen peer-reviewed journals, is designed to “sustain the momentum” of the work being done on the National Climate Assessment after the authors and staff were dismissed, the news release said. In a statement, AGU President Brandon Jones said the special collection was not a “replacement” for the National Climate Assessment, but that it offered “a unique opportunity to publish new research and review articles that could underpin a U.S.-focused climate assessment.” The White House declined to comment on record on why National Climate Assessment authors were released, and what the administration’s plans are for the National Climate Assessment. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) to submit a report every four years to the president and Congress, and the National Climate Assessment has fulfilled that obligation in the past. It contains a summary of the best available science about the physics of climate change, its effects on the United States and how society is adapting. The report also contains localized climate predictions for different regions of the United States, which are meant to give the public a better idea of the risks facing their communities. The most recent version of the report,which was released in 2023, was about 2,200 pages and contained 37 chapters. The 2023 assessment said the Lower 48 states had warmed by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit on average since 1970 and that the country was dealing with increasingly extreme weather and costly disasters. “If you’re a state official, a businessperson or a member of the general public who wants to understand what is it we know about climate change and the economy, or climate change and coasts, or climate change and human health, you can’t do that by reading 200 peer-reviewed papers,” Kopp said, adding that the National Climate Assessment synthesizes climate science and organizes the main findings. While the National Climate Assessment is the product of hundreds of researchers who volunteer their time, the report has been organized by staffers at USGCRP. In April, the White House ended funding for that organization. “I have no ideas for what the plan is and I don’t think anybody does,” Kopp said. “They released all the authors and the staff of the Global Change Research Program, so that part of the government is vacant now.” A message on the USGCRP website now says: “The operations and structure of the USGCRP are currently under review.” Kopp said the National Climate Assessment authors had spent about a year outlining chapters to include in the 2027 report, and reviewing themes to include. The outline had already been sent to federal agencies for review. Authors of the report are now assessing how that outline could be transferred. “You’re not going to be able to replicate the NCA unless there’s an organization willing to step up and staff up,” Kopp said.",

    "title": "U.S. Army is planning a parade for its anniversary — and Trump's birthday",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump might finally get his parade. The U.S. Army is planning a big celebration to recognize not only the 250th anniversary of its founding, but also President Trump’s 79th birthday, both of which fall on June 14. That celebration will potentially bring tanks and hundreds of other military vehicles and aircraft onto and over the streets of the nation’s capital in June, according to three defense officials familiar with the planning. During Trump’s first term, the president sought to have a big military parade, but the plans were shelved over cost and concerns that some of the military vehicles, particularly tracked vehicles like tanks, could significantly damage the streets of Washington, D.C. and incur a huge price tag for repairs. The estimate for the parade being planned now is “tens of millions of dollars,” according to two of the defense officials. Trump didn’t forget and now is considering a military parade to honor both birthdays. Current plans call for more than 150 military vehicles and 50 aircraft to rumble through a parade route through Washington on June 10, the three defense officials said. That could include Army wheeled vehicles, like Humvees and trucks, and so-called tracked vehicles, like tanks, two of the officials said. The aircraft will include CH-47 Chinook helicopters and UH 60 Black Hawk helicopters, two of the officials said. And the famed Golden Knights are expected to jump from above, land near the viewing stands, and deliver a flag to the VIPs, most likely Trump, two of the officials said. The Army is celebrating its 250th birthday with a number of events, including a fireworks display, a festival and a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said in a statement. \"Parade planning is actively underway, and we anticipate approximately 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, and 6,600 Soldiers to highlight the Army’s 250 years of service to the nation,\" Warren said. The plan for the tanks is not yet final. One option under consideration is to put the tanks on trailers, which would mitigate some of the damage to the streets, but that could also impact the aesthetics of the parade, officials said. They also plan to have a separate staging area for the heavy vehicles so they do not have to cross any of D.C.’s bridges, two of the officials said. The vehicles would roll down the streets of Washington in columns, the officials said, in a way thatsome critics of the planned parade in his first term comparedto what is more typically seen in places like North Korea and Russia. For now, the plan is to have Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker Armored Fighting Vehicles, the Army’s new Infantry Squad Vehicles and more, the officials said. All the Army vehicles would be drawn from the Army’s 10 divisions, brought in mostly via train from bases like Fort Bliss, Texas to Fort Drum, New York. Each division will dedicate between 200 and 400 people to the parade, the officials said. Under the current plan, some of the troops would sleep in government buildings, including the Department of Agriculture and U.S. General Services Administration buildings, according to two of the defense officials. Asked about the parade last month, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed that planning was in the early stages and that the Trump administration had reached out about it, but said she had not been directly involved yet. The parade theme will include U.S. wars throughout the Army’s history and include soldiers marching in period uniforms, the officials explained. The plans are still evolving but the current early estimate is the parade and static displays in D.C. will cost as much as $45 million, according to two of the defense officials, who said that could change as planning continues. The final estimates from inside the Army are not yet complete as plans for the parade have not yet been fully approved by the White House and the Army, two of the officials said. Individual Army units will bear the ultimate cost of the parade, three of the officials said. In some cases, units would have to spend more than $1 million to participate. That could impact funds used for training, officials said. “Could the parade potentially impact training? Absolutely,” said one of the defense officials. “Will it impact training? That’s unclear.”",

    "title": "Trump administration settles with Maine over funding freeze after dispute over trans athletes",
    "article_text": "PORTLAND, Maine — President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday agreed to halt all efforts to freeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program after initially suspending those dollars due to a disagreement between the state and Trump over transgender athletes. In response, the state will drop its lawsuit that had been filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey announced. “It’s unfortunate that my office had to resort to federal court just to get USDA to comply with the law and its own regulations,” Frey said in a statement. “But we are pleased that the lawsuit has now been resolved and that Maine will continue to receive funds as directed by Congress to feed children and vulnerable adults.” An email message seeking comment was sent Friday to the Agriculture Department. The settlement closes a dispute first sparked by the federal government’s decision to freeze federal funds to Maine for certain administrative and technological functions in the state’s schools. A letter from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins explained that the decision stemmed from a disagreement between the state and federal governments over whether Maine was complying with Title IX, the federal law that bans discrimination in education based on sex. Trump had accused Maine of failing to comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. Soon after the secretary’s letter was sent, Maine’s Department of Education could not access several sources of federal funds for a state nutrition program, according to the court’s written order. Maine quickly sued the Trump administration, where the state’s attorneys argued that the child nutrition program received or was due to receive more than $1.8 million for the current fiscal year. Prior year funds that were awarded but are currently inaccessible total more than $900,000, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also said that the program was anticipating about $3 million that is typically awarded every July for summer meal program sponsor administration and meal reimbursement. A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funds last month after finding that Maine was likely to succeed in its legal challenge.",

    "title": "Australians vote in election, with high prices and housing shortage major issues",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press People vote at a polling booth at Sydney's Bondi Beach, Saturday, May 3, 2025.Mark Baker/APhide caption MELBOURNE, Australia — Polls opened in Australia's general election on Saturday with high costs of living and a shortage of housing major issues in the campaign. Voting across the nation the size of three times zones spanning two hours will continue from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. in eastern Australia. The polls open and close two hours later on the West Coast. Authorities said 8.6 million ballots from Australia's 18.1 million registered voters had already been cast, but not counted, before Saturday since early and postal voting began on April 22. Australia is among the few countries where voting is compulsory, a system that leans toward creating centrist governments. At the last election in 2022, 90% of eligible voters cast ballots. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor Party is seeking a second three-year term. His opponent, conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, wants to become the first political leader to oust a first-term government since 1931, when Australians were reeling from the Great Depression. The election is taking place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis. Annual inflation peaked at 7.8% a year after Labor was elected in 2022. The central bank's benchmark interest rate rose from a record low 0.1% to 0.35% two weeks before the government changed. The rate has been raised a dozen times since then, peaking at 4.35% in November 2023. The central bank reduced the inflation rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed. The rate is widely expected to be cut again at the bank's next board meeting on May 20 due to international economic uncertainty generated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Housing prices and rents have also soared as builders have gone broke because of inflation absorbing profit margins. Going into the election, Labor held a narrow majority of 78 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties form governments. There will be 150 seats in the next parliament due to redistributions. Dutton's conservative alliance of parties known as the Liberal-National Coalition held 53 seats in the last parliament, and a record-high 19 lawmakers were not aligned to either the government or the opposition. People queue outside the Australian High Commission in London to vote in the Australian federal election, Friday, May 2, 2025.Kirsty Wigglesworth/APhide caption Monash University political scientist Zareh Ghazarian said the major parties were gaining a smaller proportion of the votes at each election in recent decades, which was benefitting independent candidates and those representing minor partes. If the trend of votes shifting away from major parties that was evident at the 2022 election continued at Saturday's election, the result could be a rare minority government. There was a minority government during World War II and the next was during a three-year term after the 2010 election. \"This election's going to be a real test of whether what we saw in 2022 is a sign of things to come, or whether the '22 election was just a one-off flash in the pan,\" Ghazarian said. Party leaders usually concede defeat and claim victory on election day. But in the last minority government, key independent lawmakers announced they would support a Labor administration 17 days after the polls closed. Both campaigns have focused on Australia's changing demographics. The election is the first in Australia in which Baby Boomers, born between born between the end of World War II and 1964, are outnumbered by younger voters. Both campaigns promised policies to help first-home buyers buy into a property market that is too expensive for many. A major point of difference is energy. The opposition has promised to build seven government-funded nuclear power plants across Australia that would begin generating electricity from 2035. Gas-fired electricity would fill the gap between aging coal-fired plants closing and nuclear generators taking their place. Labor plans to have 82% of Australia's energy grid powered by renewables including solar and wind turbines by 2030 and to rely less on gas. On the eve of the election, Albanese received the endorsement of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said the Labor leader \"did more to secure my freedom than any other politician or public figure,\" including the late Pope Francis. The remarks, posted to the social platform X by Assange's brother Gabriel Shipton, were his first on Australian domestic matters since he was released from a British prison last June and returned to his homeland after a plea deal that ended U.S. prosecutors' attempts to extradite him for publishing military secrets. Albanese \"stood up to\" the U.S. over the case, Assange said, and his government had \"proven itself unusually capable of rescuing Australians caught up in sensitive political situations.\" The endorsement was unusual from Assange, who has been scathing about Australian politicians before. Albanese Friday night downplayed the endorsement, saying it was \"a matter for Mr. Assange\" and that it was \"a good thing\" the WikiLeaks founder was now able to be with his family.

    "title": "Man sentenced to 53 years in prison in attack on Palestinian American boy, mother",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Joseph Czuba stands before Circuit Judge Dave Carlson for his arraignment at the Will County, Ill., courthouse on Oct. 30, 2023, in Joliet, Ill.Charles Rex Arbogast/APhide caption JOLIET, Ill. — An Illinois landlord who killed a 6-year-old Muslim boy and severely injured the boy's mother in a brutal hate-crime attack days after the war in Gaza began was sentenced Friday to 53 years in prison. Joseph Czuba, 73, wasfound guilty in Februaryof murder, attempted murder and hate-crime charges in the death of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen. Judge Amy Bertani-Tomczak sentenced Czuba to 30 years in the boy's death and another 20 years consecutively for the attack on Shaheen. The judge also sentenced him to three years imprisonment for hate crimes. The length of the sentence makes it all but certain he will die behind bars. \"No sentence can restore what was taken, but today's outcome delivers a necessary measure of justice,\" said Ahmed Rehab, Executive Director of CAIR-Chicago. \"Wadee was an innocent child. He was targeted because of who he was—Muslim, Palestinian, and loved.\" Czuba did not speak during the sentencing. Czuba's attorney, Lenard, declined comment. Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow's office issued a statement calling Czuba a \"morally reprehensible killer\" and the impact of his actions \"truly unfathomable.\" The boy's great-uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, was the only family member who spoke during the hearing. He said that no matter the sentence length it wouldn't be enough. The boy's parents had plans for him and Czuba robbed them of that, he said. Yousef asked Czuba to explain why he attacked the boy and his mother, asking him what news he heard that provoked him, but Czuba did not respond, the Chicago Tribune reported. Czuba targeted them in October 2023 because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas, prosecutors said during the trial. Evidence at trial included harrowing testimony from Shaheen and her frantic 911 call, along with bloody crime scene photos and police video. Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before handing in a verdict. The family had been renting rooms in Czuba's home in Plainfield, about 40 miles from Chicago when the attack happened. Central to prosecutors' case was harrowing testimony from the boy's mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba's wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about the Israel-Hamas war, which had erupted days earlier. Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child's body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee's relatives. \"He could not escape,\" Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state's attorney, told jurors at trial. \"If it wasn't enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy's body.\" The jury deliberated for 90 minutes before returning a verdict. The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Wadee's funeral drew large crowds and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honor. Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover. She said there were no prior issues in the two years she rented from the Czubas, even sharing a kitchen and a living room. Then after the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. He later confronted Shaheen and attacked her, holding her down, stabbing her and trying to break her teeth. \"He told me 'You, as a Muslim, must die,'\" said Shaheen, who testified at trial in English and Arabic though a translator. Police testified that officers found Czuba outside the house, sitting on the ground with blood on his body and hands. Separately, lawsuits have been filed over the boy's death, including by his father, Odai Alfayoumi, who is divorced from Shaheen and was not living with them. The U.S. Department of Justice also launched a federal hate crimes investigation. Yousef told reporters after the hearing that Czuba was a grandfather figure to Wadee and the family doesn't understand what \"fake news\" Czuba may have heard about the war in Gaza that caused him to attack the boy and his mother. People need to understand Muslims before judging them, he said. \"Some people are bringing this war to this country,\" Yousef said. \"We cannot do that. We can't bring the war here. We cannot bring hatred to this country ... we need that to stop.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Emily Feng The receptionist desk sits empty at Radio Free Asia, Tuesday, April 1, 2025, in Washington, D.C.Rod Lamkey/AP/FR172078hide caption Radio Free Asiais laying offabout 90 percent of its staff and is shutting down many of its language services, citing its inability to continue paying employees after the Trump administration cut off its funding. \"We are in an unconscionable situation,\" Bay Fang, RFA's president and CEO, said in a statement. \"Because we can no longer rely on [the U.S. Agency for Global Media] to disburse our funds as Congress intended, we will have to begin mass layoffs and let entire language services go dark in the next week.\" This past March, President Trumporderedthe U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the federal agency which distributes funds to RFA and other U.S. government-funded broadcasters, to wind down their operations to the bare minimum, in an effort \"to reduce unnecessary governmental entities.\" Since 1996, RFA has broadcast in languages like Burmese, Cambodian and Mandarin to a weekly audience of around 60 million listeners. It and the other U.S. government-funded broadcasters were set up in the wake of World War II, toreach listeners and readersliving in what the U.S. considers repressive or authoritarian societies and to promote democratic values. Combined, these broadcastersreacheda weekly audience of more than 400 million people outside the U.S. around the world. In the last decade, RFAhas broken storieson China's detention campaign on ethnic Uyghurs and continued on-the-ground reporting in Myanmar in the midst of a civil war. Now only one staff member of the broadcaster's Uyghur-language service remains, Mamatjan Juma, the former deputy director of the Uyghur language service, said in an interview with NPR. \"This work is more than a job for me and so many of the people who are part of RFA. They are immensely proud to be part of this team and see it as their life's work to shine a light into the dark corners of the countries we cover,\" Fang told NPR on Friday. \" So today was perhaps the most difficult in my career.\" \"We've gone completely dark,\" says Mamatjan Juma, the former director of RFA's Uyghur language service. \"Shutting down the Uyghur service doesn't just mean silencing our newsroom. It means surrendering the information space to the Chinese state propaganda machine and its millions of bots.\" After Trump's directive in March, Kari Lake, a Trump senior advisor who effectively runs USAGM,promptly terminatedcongressionally-appropriated grants to Radio Free Asia and the other nonprofit news outlets funded by the U.S. government, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN). She also shut down Voice of America, which is part of the government. Lake, aformer television anchorwholostan Arizona senate race last year, has called the agency she now effectively heads \"unsalvageable.\" \"The rot is so bad. It's like having a rotten fish and trying to find a little portion you can eat,\"shesaidof USAGM in an interviewwithNewsmax in March. VOA and the Office for Cuba Broadcasting, which runs Spanish-language programs, were forced tosuspendmore than 1,000 of their employees. RFA put about three fourths of its staff on unpaid leave. In April, a federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered the administration toreinstateRFA and MBN's funds and employees, saying the White House's order to dismantle the broadcasters was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" But this week, a D.C. appeals court granted an administrative stay, freezing that court order for RFA and MBN. The following day, on Friday, RFA formally laid off many of its staff who were already on unpaid leave. RFA's Fang says a skeleton crew still remains to update RFA's much-pared back programming.

    "article_text": "Isabella Gomez Sarmiento Sean Combs' federal trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy will begin in New York next week. What is he accused of, and what will the trial mean for the mogul and for hip-hop? SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:The sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs begins in New York City next week. Combs has been in custody since his arrest last September. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the music industry will be watching the trial closely. It wasn't long ago that Combs was being celebrated for his long and influential career. NPR's Isabella Gomez Sarmiento has been following the allegations against him - and a warning that this story contains descriptions of sexual assault. Hi, Isabella.ISABELLA GOMEZ SARMIENTO, BYLINE: Hi, Sasha.PFEIFFER: What exactly is Combs being accused of?GOMEZ SARMIENTO: So to answer that, we have to go back a couple of years when Combs was at a real career high. And you may recall his career dates all the way back to the 1990s, so some listeners might know him better as Puff Daddy or P Diddy. But if we fast-forward to 2022, he'd gotten a lifetime achievement award from BET. The next year, New York City mayor Eric Adams awarded Combs a key to the city. I mean, he was just really on top of his game and getting all of these recognitions for his decades not just as an artist but as a key player in the music and media industry. In November 2023, he gets nominated for a Grammy and then very quickly, his reputation takes a huge hit. Combs' ex partner, the singer Cassie Ventura, files a civil lawsuit claiming that Combs trafficked, raped and violently beat her throughout their relationship. She alleges that the abuse went on for over a decade and that Combs employees helped him cover it up. Now, Combs denies all of Ventura's allegations, but the next day, they settle that lawsuit out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the accusations are so shocking that Combs' reputation just doesn't really bounce back.PFEIFFER: Isabella, you said that Ventura filed a civil lawsuit. So explain how Combs has ended up in jail facing criminal charges.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: Yeah, that's right. After Ventura comes forward, many, many more people file civil lawsuits against Combs, alleging very similar kinds of abuse, and Combs keeps denying the allegations. But like you said, these are not criminal charges. Then, in March of 2024, federal law enforcement agents raid several properties linked to Combs. They confiscate weapons, they confiscate electronics, all sorts of things. And two months later in May, CNN obtains and releases a hotel surveillance video that shows Combs violently kicking and hitting Ventura. It was an incident from 2016, and Combs posts this online.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SEAN COMBS: My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: In September of 2024, Combs is arrested in New York City. The federal government charges him with sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy, basically alleging that he used his businesses to facilitate and conceal sex crimes dating back more than a decade. There's a description of that hotel incident in the criminal indictment, though it doesn't refer to Ventura by name, and prosecutors point to that video to argue that Combs should not be released on bail because he could behave violently. A judge ultimately sides with them, and Combs remains in custody awaiting this trial.PFEIFFER: Once his trial starts next week, give us a sense how it's likely to play out.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: Yeah. There are several alleged victims expected to testify against Combs, and those could very well include people who filed some civil lawsuits against Combs. The CNN video will be admitted as evidence. And, you know, Combs' attorneys maintain his innocence. They say that all of these encounters were consensual. But if he is convicted, if the jury finds him guilty of all of the charges, he could spend the remainder of his life behind bars.PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Isabella Gomez Sarmiento.

But if we fast-forward to 2022, he'd gotten a lifetime achievement award from BET. The next year, New York City mayor Eric Adams awarded Combs a key to the city. I mean, he was just really on top of his game and getting all of these recognitions for his decades not just as an artist but as a key player in the music and media industry. In November 2023, he gets nominated for a Grammy and then very quickly, his reputation takes a huge hit. Combs' ex partner, the singer Cassie Ventura, files a civil lawsuit claiming that Combs trafficked, raped and violently beat her throughout their relationship. She alleges that the abuse went on for over a decade and that Combs employees helped him cover it up. Now, Combs denies all of Ventura's allegations, but the next day, they settle that lawsuit out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the accusations are so shocking that Combs' reputation just doesn't really bounce back.PFEIFFER: Isabella, you said that Ventura filed a civil lawsuit. So explain how Combs has ended up in jail facing criminal charges.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: Yeah, that's right. After Ventura comes forward, many, many more people file civil lawsuits against Combs, alleging very similar kinds of abuse, and Combs keeps denying the allegations. But like you said, these are not criminal charges. Then, in March of 2024, federal law enforcement agents raid several properties linked to Combs. They confiscate weapons, they confiscate electronics, all sorts of things. And two months later in May, CNN obtains and releases a hotel surveillance video that shows Combs violently kicking and hitting Ventura. It was an incident from 2016, and Combs posts this online.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SEAN COMBS: My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: In September of 2024, Combs is arrested in New York City. The federal government charges him with sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and racketeering conspiracy, basically alleging that he used his businesses to facilitate and conceal sex crimes dating back more than a decade. There's a description of that hotel incident in the criminal indictment, though it doesn't refer to Ventura by name, and prosecutors point to that video to argue that Combs should not be released on bail because he could behave violently. A judge ultimately sides with them, and Combs remains in custody awaiting this trial.PFEIFFER: Once his trial starts next week, give us a sense how it's likely to play out.GOMEZ SARMIENTO: Yeah. There are several alleged victims expected to testify against Combs, and those could very well include people who filed some civil lawsuits against Combs. The CNN video will be admitted as evidence. And, you know, Combs' attorneys maintain his innocence. They say that all of these encounters were consensual. But if he is convicted, if the jury finds him guilty of all of the charges, he could spend the remainder of his life behind bars.PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Isabella Gomez Sarmiento.

    "title": "Medical journals hit with threatening letters from Justice Department",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein Ed Martin, now the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, speaks at a hearing on Capitol Hill on June 13, 2023.Michael A. McCoy/Getty Imageshide caption The letters began arriving at medical journals around the country over the last few weeks. \"It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications … are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates,\" wroteEdward R. Martin Jr., the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, in a letter to the journalCHEST. Martin then asks a series of questions — about misinformation, competing viewpoints and the influence of funders such as advertisers and the National Institutes of Health. \"The public has certain expectations and you have certain responsibilities,\" the letter adds. Martin asks for a response by May 2. \"We were surprised,\" says Dr.Eric Rubin, the editor-in-chief ofThe New England Journal of Medicine, one of at least four journal editors to get a letter from Martin and probably the most prominent. \"Other journals had gotten letters before, so it wasn't a shock, but, still, a surprise.\" In addition to Rubin's journal, Martin has sent letters toJAMA, which is published by theAmerican Medical Association;Obstetrics & Gynecology, a journal of theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; andCHEST, which is published by the American College of Chest Physicians. There may be others. \"We were concerned because there were questions that suggested that we may be biased in the research we report,\" Rubin says. \"We aren't. We have a very rigorous review process. We use outside experts. We have internal editors who are experts in their fields as well. And we spend a lot of time choosing the right articles to publish and trying to get the message right. We think we're an antidote for misinformation.\" Rubin says the letter mentioned that the journal has tax-exempt status. \"It does feel like there's a threatening tone to the letter and it is trying to intimidate us,\" Rubin says. The letters don't cite any specific examples of supposed bias or say what action Martin might take. But others say the letters raise serious concerns. \"It's pretty unprecedented,\" saysJ.T. Morris, a lawyer at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech advocacy group. He says the First Amendment protects medical journals. \"Who knows? We've seen this administration take all sorts of action that doesn't have a legal basis and it hasn't stopped them,\" Morris says. \"And so there's always a concern that the federal government and its officials like Ed Martin will step outside and abuse their authority and try to use the legal process and abuse the court system into compelling scientific journals and medical professionals and anybody else they disagree with into silence.\" Medical journals play a crucial role in vetting and disseminating scientific information, including which treatments and public health measures work, which don't and which ones might be dangerous or safe. \"It's an indication of the degree to which this administration will go to try to interfere with scientific research and the scientific community,\" saysCarl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington. \"They'll do just about anything and tamper with science in any way that they think will be helpful.\" The letters come as the Trump administration has been trying to influence what scientists can say in a variety of ways. The administration has stifled communication by federal scientists and slashed studies about misinformation, about how to talk about vaccines and about LGBTQ+ health issues. It has been requiring scientists to scrub language in their grants and research deemed \"woke,\" including gender terminology. \"This is a set of policies attacking the scientific community, whether it's scientists in universities or in institutions like NIH, FDA, CDC or journals and their editors,\" says Richard Horton, the editor ofThe Lancet, a leading British medical journal.The Lancethas not received one of the letters, Horton says, but published aneditorialcondemning the inquiries. \"This is a research ecosystem, and it is the working of that research ecosystem which has delivered these phenomenal breakthroughs over so many decades. And that is what's being attacked,\" Horton says. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya have both criticized medical journals. Kennedy has eventhreatened legal actionagainst journals. Just before taking over at the NIH, Bhattacharya helped start anew journalaimed at providing an alternative to mainstream publications. Neither Martin nor the Department of Justice responded to NPR's requests for comment. But some other people also assert that the dominant medical journals are biased. \"I share concerns with the U.S. attorney that American scientific groups and journals have become far too activist and far too left wing in recent years,\" saysJudge Glock, who directs research at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. But even Glock and others who share that view stop short of wanting the Justice Department to investigate medical journals. \"In general, the U.S. attorney shouldn't be concerning himself or herself with the position of these particular journals,\" Glock says. \"They should not ask for information, and they should not be trying to encourage them to publish different types of editorials or change their editorial practices based on what a U.S. attorney feels is appropriate.\" But there is some support for how Martin is pressing the journals. \"They are absolutely biased, and we've seen that they've been captured by what I called a blob, which is a form of gatekeepers that are colluding with the Big Pharma and the public health agencies and academia and they all know each other,\" saysRoger Severinoof the Heritage Foundation, another conservative think tank. \"So, yes, there has been a lot of bias, and they should be finding the truth first and foremost. But instead they become just another special interest.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "He let snakes bite him some 200 times to create a better snakebite antivenom",
    "article_text": "Ari Daniel Tim Friede, pictured here with a water cobra, exposed himself to snake venom over decades. Scientists say they have now made a broadly effective antivenom with the help of his antibodies.Centivaxhide caption In 2001, after working up to it for years, Tim Friede finally allowed himself to be bitten by a snake. He started with venomous cobras because they're dangerous — and because they're what he had on hand at the time. \"My first couple bites were really crazy,\" he says. \"It's like a bee sting times a thousand. I mean, you can have levels of anxiety that goes through the roof.\" Friede has been fascinated with snakes for as long as he can remember. He used to hunt garter snakes growing up in Wisconsin. As an adult, his obsession turned to venomous snakes — and the harm they cause people globally. He felt the most dramatic way to raise awareness of the issue was to allow himself to be bit, repeatedly. He admits it's been \"a rocky road,\" however. Right out of the gate, he says, \"I was put in ICU after two cobra bites and I dropped in a coma for four days.\" Friede recovered and with time, became more careful. To date, he estimates he's willingly been bit some 200 times by all manner of venomous snakes — black mambas, taipans, cobras, kraits and many others. These snakes may be dangerous but he's often found them easier to understand than people. The relationship is clear. \"They want to kill me,\" he says. \"I want to survive.\" Friede's motivation evolved to see if he could develop immunity to this swirl of toxins — so that his body might provide a roadmap to making a broad kind of antivenom. Now, in a new paper in the journalCell, researchers say they've done just that, thanks in large part to the antibodies that Friede has developed over nearly a quarter century of self-envenomation. Venomous snakes are a global health problem Every year, venomous snake bites kill tens of thousands of people globally and permanently disable several hundred thousand more, according to theWorld Health Organization(WHO). \"So they might lose a limb, they might lose function in a limb, they might end up having to have huge surgeries, skin grafts, that kind of thing,\" saysStuart Ainsworth, a molecular biologist at the University of Liverpool who studies snake bites, antivenoms and therole that antibodiescan play in helping create more powerful antidotes. This is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries and also countries in the tropics. These places \"have huge snake bite burdens,\" says Ainsworth. Specific health risks vary depending on the region of the world and the kinds of snakes found there. For example, in Papua New Guinea, most of the snakes produce neurotoxic venom. David Williams, a scientist who evaluates antivenoms for WHO, says the biggest risk to people who are bitten by these snakes is paralysis, \"which can prevent them from being able to control their airway and breathing and they can potentially suffocate and die as a result of that.\" Other venoms can affect the blood and cause it either to fail to clot or to form clots too readily, \"which can lead to basically the patient stroking out or having a clot lodge in the vessels of the heart and cause a heart attack,\" says Williams. Some venoms cause intense pain while others cause no pain at all. Such diversity in venom form and function is a big reason why the creation of a broad universal antivenom has been such a challenge. For decades, antivenoms have come from the antibodies generated by animals like horses that have been injected repeatedly with small amounts of venoms, says Williams. Their manufacture has improved substantially butJacob Glanville, CEO of the biotech company Centivax, wondered about a different approach. Some years back, after working on the problem of developing a universal flu vaccine, he began thinking about how to create a universal antivenom that could defang the venom of all venomous snakes. Glanville wanted to find a shared molecular site across multiple venom toxins from different snake species that he could target. Rather than using a horse, Glanville figured that a person who'd been repeatedly exposed to lots of different venoms might have human antibodies that could target such a site to interfere with the toxins. \"I was calling vivariums hoping for a clumsy snake researcher,\" he says, but he was coming up empty-handed. And then he found Tim Friede. Friede remembers Glanville saying to him: \"You're the guy I'm looking for. We need your blood. We need your antibodies.\" And Friede accepted. \"If anybody has broken through the problem of getting the immune system to focus,\" says Glanville, \"it's this guy, by this repeated stimulation with all these snakes.\" Once Friede agreed to participate, Glanville scanned his blood for its immune memory. He searched the troves of antibodies for those that netralized the neurotoxins of multiple snakes. \"And we found the ultra-broad antibody that had this very remarkable ability to go bind right on the conserved site that the neurotoxin uses to cause paralysis,\" says Glanville. The antibody provided mice with full protection against five snakes — the black mamba and a mix of cobras. So Glanville and his colleagues wrote the journalCellto gauge their interest in publishing the research. \"A really smart editor said, 'Look, antibodies are wonderful, but I think we could actually go further,'\" recallsPeter Kwong, a structural biologist at Columbia University and one of the researchers. \"And she proposed something like a working cocktail,\" one that would take on even more snakes. The team agreed it was worth a try. They added a small molecule called varespladib that had already been shown to work against some venoms. \"And some additional species were suddenly covered, some completely and some partially,\" says Glanville. The team also went back to Friede's blood and found a second broad-acting antibody. \"And so we added that in and that's when we suddenly saw this coherent protection that was happening across this large panel,\" Glanville says. This cocktail of three components offered mice complete protection against 13 species and partial protection against six more — representing a set of genetically diverse venomous snakes from Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, and more. There are other antivenoms that can neutralize a broad set of snakes, says Ainsworth, who's not involved in the study, but this is the first to do so using synthetic antibodies. \"It's definitely a step in the right direction because it's answering some of the questions we have about how to properly design universal antibodies,\" says the WHO's Williams, who wasn't involved in the research. But he cautions that further developing this cocktail into a truly universal antivenom will inevitably have its challenges, including doing human trials and expanding its coverage to vipers, which make up about half of the venomous snakes. Ainsworth agrees that the findings are solid, though he's eager to see how the antivenom works in people, especially given that venoms are complex chemical formulations. \"There are lots of different components in venoms,\" he says. \"This, you're only neutralizing two components. We don't know if we just neutralize the key components in the venom, what will the other toxins do? This is why it's very important to do clinical trials.\" The team at Centivax says their next steps include testing the new cocktail in dogs that have been bit by venomous snakes in Australia. And as they continue to develop their antivenom for an even wider array of snakes, they plan to incorporate vipers as well. Glanville hopes to get philanthropists or foundations to help pay for the clinical studies and manufacture in order to make the resulting antivenom affordable globally. He estimates there's a market of $600 million per year, but it's currently split across a few dozen antivenoms. A single antivenom would allow Centivax to own most of the market. For Tim Friede, who's now thedirector of herpetologyat Centivax, it's about helping the people impacted by venomous snakebites worldwide. When he heard that his antibodies had helped create this new antivenom cocktail, he says he was happy. \"I couldn't believe it. I really couldn't believe it,\" he says. \"I know I'm doing something for humanity and giving back to science.\" Upon Glanville's recommendation, it has been several years since Friede last allowed himself to be bitten by a venomous snake. But he admits to missing it, mostly in terms of \"just knowing where you can take your mind,\" he says. \"To know you can beat that and keep your calm and keep your cool, it's a wonderful thing.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Scott Neuman Alternative for Germany (AfD) MP Gerold Otten speaks to the media as co-leader of the far-right party Alice Weidel stands next to him on March 24, 2025, at the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) in Berlin.John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Germany's domestic intelligence agency has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist — a move likely to further isolate the group that has emerged as the country's largest opposition party. The Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution — Germany's equivalent of the FBI — released a 1,000-page report on Friday. In a statement on itswebsite, the BfV said it had reached its conclusion after a three-year investigation. \"Following its statutory mandate, the BfV was required to assess the party's actions against the central fundamental principles of the constitution: human dignity, the principle of democracy, and the rule of law. In addition to the federal party's platform and statements, the review particularly examined the statements and other behavior of its representatives, as well as their connections to right-wing extremist actors and groups.\" The AfD, known for itsanti-immigration and nationalistplatform, has been underfederal surveillancesince 2021 as part of a lengthy investigative process, as the BfV had previously announced. While several state-level AfD branches had already been labeled extremist, the new report extends that designation to the party's national organization. \"It is unprecedented, but it didn't come as a huge surprise,\" said Jörn Fleck, senior director at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center. He noted that the BfV delayed the decision to avoid influencing February's elections. In those polls, the AfDcaptured20.8% of the vote and152 seatsin the Bundestag, placing second behind the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU). Despite its electoral strength, the AfD remains politically isolated. Mainstream parties have formallyshunnedthe group, denying it any governing coalition roles. Fleck says the intelligence agency's designation \"will strengthen the push to continue keeping the AfD out of key committee roles in the Bundestag — no committee chairs, no vice president of parliament.\" The AfD did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. Ahead of the elections, U.S. Vice President Vancewarned European leadersagainst sidelining right-wing parties. The AfD has also received public support from Elon Musk, a Trump ally and billionaire entrepreneur. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned BfV's movein a post on X. \"Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. That's not democracy—it's tyranny in disguise,\" he wrote. \"What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD—which took second in the recent election—but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "The health care sector is bracing for higher prices and potential shortages. Baxter International, a prominent health care and pharmaceutical manufacturer, reports that President Trump's tariffs will likely cost the company $60 million to $70 million this year,according to the Chicago Tribune. The hefty toll was revealed by Baxter's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Joel Grade, during an earnings call Thursday. \"We are able to mitigate a portion of these impacts,\" Grade reportedly said in the call. \"Currently a majority of Baxter’s products sold in the US are manufactured in the US and made largely from US-made components. However, international procurement is part of our business operations and as such we are impacted from the US and retaliatory tariffs that have been issued.\" Baxter makes a number of pharmaceutical and hospital products, but may be best known for being a leading source of IV fluid bags. Last year, the catastrophic damage from Hurricane Helene included ravaging a Baxter manufacturing plant in Marion, North Carolina, that produces60 percent of the country's supply of IV solutions. In the call, Grade noted that only a small fraction of Baxter's total sales are in China. But, \"given the magnitude of the tariffs that have been enacted between the two countries, these tariffs now account for nearly half of the total impact,\" he said. The Tribune reported that Baxter is now looking into ways to dampen the financial blow from the tariffs, including carrying additional inventory, identifying alternative suppliers, alternative shipping routes, and \"targeted pricing actions.\" Baxter is also working with trade organizations to lobby for exemptions. In general, the health care and medical sector, including hospitals, is bracing for price increases and shortages from the tariffs. The health care supply chain in America is woefully fragile, which became painfully apparent amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Baxter isn't alone in announcing heavy tariff tolls. Earlier this week, GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. said the tariffs would cost the companyaround $500 million this year, according to financial service firm Morningstar. And in April, Abbott Laboratories said it expects the tariffs to cost \"a few hundred million dollars,\" according to the Tribune.

    "title": "DOJ confirms it wants to break up Google’s ad business",
    "article_text": "The advertising remedy trial will begin on September 22. We sometimes think of Google as a search company, but that's merely incidental—Google is really the world's biggest advertiser. That's why the antitrust case focused on Google's ad tech business could have even more lasting effects than cases focused on search or mobile apps. The courtruled against Google last month, and now both sides are lining up to present their proposed remedies in a trial later this year. In today's hearing, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema set the beginning of that trial for September 22 of this year. Just likethe search case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is aiming to hack off pieces of Google to level the playing field. Specifically, the DOJ is asking the court to force Google to sell two parts of the ad business: the ad exchange and the publisher ad server. The ad exchange is the world's largest marketplace for bidding on advertising space. The ad server, meanwhile, is a tool that publishers use to list and sell ads on their sites. While Google lost the liability phase of the case, it won on the subject of ad networks. The court decided that the government had not proven that Google's acquisition of ad networks like DoubleClick and Admeld had harmed competition. So, Google won't have to worry about losing those parts of the business. The government's proposed breakup would come in phases, beginning with a requirement that Google provide real-time access to bidding data to third-party vendors. Google objects to this as it would essentially force the company to develop systems that don't currently exist and then release them as open source products. The timeline for such an effort, the company believes, makes this infeasible. Following that move, the DOJ wants to see Google sell the aforementioned components of its advertising business. Naturally, Google opposes this as well. \"The DOJ’s additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the Court’s findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's VP of regulatory affairs. In the trial, Google will paint this demand as a severe overreach, claiming that few, if any, companies would have the resources to purchase and run the products. Last year, an ad consultant estimated Google’s ad empirecould be worth up to $95 billion, quite possibly too big to sell. However, Google was similarly skeptical about Chrome, and representatives from other companies have said throughout the search remedy trial that theywould love to buy Google's browser. After losing three antitrust cases in just a couple of years, Google will have a hard time convincing the judge it is capable of turning over a new leaf with light remedies. A DOJ lawyer told the court Google is a \"recidivist monopolist\" that has a pattern of skirting its legal obligations. Still, Google is looking for mercy in the case. We expect to get more details on Google's proposed remedies as the next trial nears, but it already offered a preview in today's hearing. Google suggests making a smaller subset of ad data available and ending the use of some pricing schemes, including unified pricing, that the court has found to be anticompetitive. Google also promised not to re-implement discontinued practices like \"last look,\" which gave the company a chance to outbid rivals at the last moment. This was featured prominently in the DOJ's case, although Google ended the practice several years ago. To ensure it adheres to the remedies, Google suggested a court-appointed monitor would audit the process. However, Brinkema seemed unimpressed with this proposal. As in its other cases, Google says it plans to appeal the verdict, but before it can do that, the remedies phase has to be completed. Even if it can get the remedies paused for appeal, the decision could be a blow to investor confidence. So, Google will do whatever it can to avoid the worst-case scenario, leaning on the existence of competing advertisers like Meta and TikTok to show that the market is still competitive. Like the search case, Google won't be facing any big developments over the summer, but this fall could be rough. Judge Amit Mehta will most likely rule on the search remedies in August, and the ad tech remedies case will begin the following month. Google also has the Play Store case hanging over its head. Itlost the first round, but the company hopes to prevail on appeal when the case gets underway again, probably in late 2025.

During the previous three years, I served as a program officer at the NSFScience of Science(SOS) program. We reviewed, recommended, and awarded competitive research grants on science communication, including research on science communication to the public, communication of public priorities to scientists, and citizen engagement and participation in science. Projects my team reviewed and funded on misinformation are among the many others at NSF that have now been canceled (see the growing listhere). Misinformation research is vital to advancing our understanding of how citizens understand and process evidence and scientific information and put that understanding into action. It is an increasingly important area of research given our massive, ever-changing digital information environment. A few examples of important research that was canceled because it threatens the current administration’s political agenda: This work is critical on its own. Results of misinformation research inform how we handle education, public service announcements, weather warnings, emergency response broadcasts, health advisories, agricultural practices, product recalls, and more. It’s how we get people to integrate data into their work, whether their work involves things like farming, manufacturing, fishing, or something else. Understanding how speech on technical topics is perceived, drives trust, and changes behavior can help us ensure that our speech is more effective. Beyond its economic impact, research on misinformation helps create an informed public—the foundation of any democracy. Contrary to thepresident’s executive order, it does not “infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens.” Misinformation research is only a threat to the speech of people who seek to spread misinformation. Political attacks on misinformation research is censorship, driven by a dislike for the results it produces. It is also part of a larger threat to the NSF and the economic and social benefits that come from publicly funded research. The NSF is a “pass through agency”—most of its annual budget (around $9 billion) passes through the agency and is returned to American communities in the form of science grants (80 percent of the budget) and STEM education (13 percent). The NSF manages these programs via a staff that is packed full of expert scientists in physics, psychology, chemistry, geosciences, engineering, sociology, and other fields. These scientists and the administrative staff (1,700 employees, who account for around 5 percent of its budget) organize complex peer-review panels that assess and distribute funding to cutting-edge science. In normal times, presidents may shift the NSF’s funding priorities—this is their prerogative. This process is political. It always has been. It always will be. Elected officials (both presidents and Congress) have agendas and interests and want to bring federal dollars to their constituents. Additionally, there are national priorities—pandemic response, supercomputing needs, nanotechnology breakthroughs, space exploration goals, demands for microchip technologies, and artificial intelligence advancements. Presidential agendas are meant to “steer the ship” by working with Congress to develop annual budgets, set appropriations and earmarks, and focus on specific regions (e.g.,EPSCoR), topics, or facilities (e.g., federal labs). While shifting priorities is normal, cancellation of previously funded research projects is NOT normal. Unilaterally banning funding for specific types of research (climate science, misinformation, research on minoritized groups) is not normal. It’s anti-scientific, allowing politics rather than expertise to determine which research is most competitive. Canceling research grants because they threaten the current regime’s political agenda is a violation of the NSF’s duty to honor contracts and ethically manage the funds appropriated by the US Congress. This is a threat not just to individual scientists and universities, but to the trust and norms that underpin our scientific enterprise. It’s an attempt to terrorize researchers with the fear that their funding may be next and to create backlash against science and expertise (another important area ofNSF-funded research that has also been canceled). Political interference in federal funding of scientific research will not end here. Arecent announcementnotes the NSF is facing a 55 percent cut to its annual budget and mass layoffs. Other agencies have been told to prepare for similar cuts. The administration’s actions will leave little funding for R&D that advances the public good. And the places where the research happens—especially universities and colleges—arealso under assault. While these immediate cuts are felt first by scientists and universities, they will ultimately affect people throughout the nation—students, consumers, private companies, and residents. The American scientific enterprise has been aworld leader, andfederal funding of science is a key driver of this success. For the last 100 years, students, scientists, and entrepreneurs from around the world have flocked to the US to advance science and innovation. Public investments in science have produced economic health and prosperity for all Americans and advanced our national security through innovation and soft diplomacy. These cuts, combined with other actions taken to limit research funding and peer review at scientific agencies, make it clear that the Trump administration’s goals are to: All Americans who benefit from the outcomes of publicly funded science—GPS and touch screens on your phone, Google, the Internet, weather data on an app, MRI, kidney exchanges, CRISPR, 3D printing, tiny hearing aids, bluetooth, broadband, robotics at the high school, electric cars, suspension bridges, PCR tests, AlphaFold and other AI tools, Doppler radar, barcodes, reverse auctions, and far, far more—should be alarmed and taking action. Here are some ideas of what you can do: There is a lot going on in the political environment right now, making it easy to get caught up in the implications cuts have on individual research projects or to be reassured by things that haven’t been targeted yet. But the threat looms large, for all US science. The US, through agencies like the NSF, has built a world-class scientific enterprise founded on the belief that taxpayer investments in basic science can and do produce valuable economic and social outcomes for all of us. Censoring research and canceling misinformation grants is a small step in what is already a larger battle to defend our world-class scientific enterprise. It is up to all of us to act now. Mary K.

    "title": "Judge on Meta’s AI training: “I just don’t understand how that can be fair use”",
    "article_text": "Judge downplayed Meta’s “messed up” torrenting in lawsuit over AI training. A judge who may be the first to rule on whether AI training data is fair use appeared skeptical Thursday at a hearing where Meta faced off with book authors over the social media company's alleged copyright infringement. Meta, like most AI companies, holds that training must be deemed fair use, or else the entire AI industry could face immense setbacks, wasting precious time negotiating data contracts while falling behind global rivals. Meta urged the court to rule that AI training is a transformative use that only references books to create an entirely new work that doesn't replicate authors' ideas or replace books in their markets. At the hearing that followed after both sides requested summary judgment, however, Judge Vince Chhabria pushed back on Meta attorneys arguing that the company's Llama AI models posed no threat to authors in their markets, Reutersreported. \"You have companies using copyright-protected material to create a product that is capable of producing an infinite number of competing products,\" Chhabria said. \"You are dramatically changing, you might even say obliterating, the market for that person's work, and you're saying that you don't even have to pay a license to that person.\" Declaring, \"I just don't understand how that can be fair use,\" the shrewd judge apparently stoked little response from Meta's attorney, Kannon Shanmugam, apart from a suggestion that any alleged threat to authors' livelihoods was \"just speculation,\" Wiredreported. Authors may need to sharpen their case, which Chhabria warned could be \"taken away by fair use\" if none of the authors suing, including Sarah Silverman, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Richard Kadrey, can show \"that the market for their actual copyrighted work is going to be dramatically affected.\" Determined to probe this key question, Chhabria pushed authors' attorney, David Boies, to point to specific evidence of market harms that seemed noticeably missing from the record. \"It seems like you're asking me to speculate that the market for Sarah Silverman's memoir will be affected by the billions of things that Llama will ultimately be capable of producing,\" Chhabria said. \"And it's just not obvious to me that that's the case.\" But if authors can prove fears of market harms are real, Meta might struggle to win over Chhabria, and that could set a precedent impacting copyright cases challenging AI training on other kinds of content. The judge repeatedly appeared to be sympathetic to authors, suggesting that Meta's AI training may be a \"highly unusual case\" where even though \"the copying is for a highly transformative purpose, the copying has the high likelihood of leading to the flooding of the markets for the copyrighted works.\" And when Shanmugam argued that copyright law doesn't shield authors from \"protection from competition in the marketplace of ideas,\" Chhabria resisted the framing that authors weren’t potentially being robbed, Reuters reported. \"But if I'm going to steal things from the marketplace of ideas in order to develop my own ideas, that's copyright infringement, right?\" Chhabria responded. Wired noted that he asked Meta's lawyers, \"What about the next Taylor Swift?\" If AI made it easy to knock off a young singer's sound, how could she ever compete if AI produced \"a billion pop songs\" in her style? In a statement, Meta's spokesperson reiterated the company's defense that AI training is fair use. \"Meta has developed transformational open source AI models that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies,\" Meta's spokesperson said. \"Fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this. We disagree with Plaintiffs' assertions, and the full record tells a different story. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and to protect the development of GenAI for the benefit of all.\" Some have pondered why Chhabria appeared so focused on market harms, instead of hammering Meta foradmittedly illegally pirating booksthat it used for its AI training, which seems to be obvious copyright infringement. According to Wired, \"Chhabria spoke emphatically about his belief that the big question is whether Meta’s AI tools will hurt book sales and otherwise cause the authors to lose money,\" not whetherMeta's torrenting of bookswas illegal. The torrenting \"seems kind of messed up,\" Chhabria said, but \"the question, as the courts tell us over and over again, is not whether something is messed up but whether it’s copyright infringement.\" It's possible that Chhabria dodged the question for procedural reasons. In acourt filing, Meta argued that authors had moved for summary judgment on Meta's alleged copying of their works, not on \"unsubstantiated allegations that Meta distributed Plaintiffs’ works via torrent.\" In the court filing, Meta alleged that even if Chhabria agreed that the authors' request for \"summary judgment is warranted on the basis of Meta’s distribution, as well as Meta’s copying,\" that the authors \"lack evidence to show that Meta distributed any of their works.\" According to Meta, authors abandoned any claims that Meta's seeding of the torrented files served to distribute works, leaving onlyclaims about Meta's leeching. Meta argued that the authors \"admittedly lack evidence that Meta ever uploaded any of their works, or any identifiable part of those works, during the so-called 'leeching' phase,\" relying instead on expert estimates based on how torrenting works. It's also possible that for Chhabria, the torrenting question seemed like an unnecessary distraction. Former Meta attorney Mark Lumley, who quit the case earlier this year,told Vanity Fairthat the torrenting was \"one of those things that sounds bad but actually shouldn’t matter at all in the law. Fair use is always about uses the plaintiff doesn’t approve of; that’s why there is a lawsuit.\" Lumley suggested that court cases mulling fair use at this current moment should focus on the outputs, rather than the training. Citing the ruling in a case where Google Books scanning books to share excerpts was deemed fair use, Lumley argued that \"all search engines crawl the full Internet, including plenty of pirated content,\" so there's seemingly no reason to stop AI crawling. But the Copyright Alliance, a nonprofit, non-partisan group supporting the authors in the case, in acourt filingalleged that Meta, in its bid to get AI products viewed as transformative, is aiming to do the opposite. \"When describing the purpose of generative AI,\" Meta allegedly strives to convince the court to \"isolate the 'training' process and ignore the output of generative AI,\" because that's seemingly the only way that Meta can convince the court that AI outputs serve \"a manifestly different purpose from Plaintiffs’ books,\" the Copyright Alliance argued. \"Meta’s motion ignores what comes after the initial 'training'—most notably the generation of output that serves the same purpose of the ingested works,\" the Copyright Alliance argued. And the torrenting question should matter, the group argued, because unlike in Google Books, Meta's AI models are apparently training on pirated works, not \"legitimate copies of books.\" Chhabria will not be making a snap decision in the case, planning to take his time and likely stressing not just Meta, but every AI company defending training as fair use the longer he delays. Understanding that the entire AI industry potentially has a stake in the ruling, Chhabria apparently sought to relieve some tension at the end of the hearing with a joke, Wired reported. “I will issue a ruling later today,” Chhabria said. “Just kidding! I will take a lot longer to think about it.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Microsoft’s new “passwordless by default” is great but comes at a cost",
    "article_text": "The move is part of an industry-wide push for users to adopt passkeys. Microsoft says it’s making passwordless logins the default means for signing in to new accounts, as the company helps drive an industry-wide push to transition away from passwords and the costly security problems they have created for companies and their users. A key part of the “passwordless by default”initiativeMicrosoft announced on Thursday is encouraging the use of passkeys—the newalternative to passwordsthat Microsoft, Google, Apple, and a large roster of other companies are developing under the coordination of the FIDO Alliance. Going forward, Microsoft will make passkeys the default means for new users to sign in. Existing users who have yet to enroll a passkey will be presented with a prompt to do so the next time they log in. The push to passkeys is fueled by the tremendous costs associated with passwords. Creating and managing a sufficiently long, randomly generated password for each account is a burden on many users, a difficulty that often leads to weak choices and reused passwords. Leaked passwords have also been a chronic problem. What’s more, over the past decade, attacks such as password spraying have grown increasingly effective at breaching sensitive networks,Microsoft’s own included. Left out of Microsoft’s announcement is that even after users create a passkey, they can’t go passwordless until they install the Microsoft Authenticator app on their phone. Microsoft has made Authy, Google Authenticator, and similar apps incompatible, a choice that needlessly inconveniences users and undermines the whole “passwordless by default” marketing message. Using Microsoft Authenticator isn’t a requirement for using a passkey, but account holders who don’t have it will be unable to ditch their login passwords. With a password still associated with the account, many of the security benefits of passkeys are undermined. Passkeys, part of the FIDO Alliance’sWebAuthn standard, in theory provide a means of authentication that’s immune to credential phishing, password leaks, and password spraying. Under the latest “FIDO2” version of WebAuthn, it creates a unique public/private encryption keypair during each enrollment that’s generated and stored on a user’s phone, computer, Yubikey or similar device. In WebAuthn parlance, this device is called an \"Authenticator.” The public portion of the key is sent to the account service. The private key remains bound to the user device, where it can’t be extracted. When the user wants to log in, the account service presents a “unique challenge” that comes in the form of some random input. When the user activates the Authenticator—by entering a PIN or password or providing a fingerprint or face scan—the Authenticator uses the private key to sign the challenge and sends it to the site. The site then uses the private key it has on hand to verify the signature is valid. The elegant design allows the person logging in to cryptographically prove they are, in fact, the authorized user without ever exposing a credential that can be stolen or otherwise compromised. Additionally, the unique keypair is cryptographically bound to the URL of the account it belongs to, making it impossible to use the credential against look-alike phishing sites. (The flow for the older FIDO1 version of WebAuthn is different.) Microsoft accounts with Microsoft Authenticator enrolled are one of the few that offer the option to go truly passwordless. For those who aren't willing to install the app, their account will still be associated with this easily compromised shared secret. And in that case, some of the key benefits of passkeys are muted. The FIDO Alliance tends to present passkeys as production-ready in their current state. When Icovered passkeys in December, I found that they remained clumsy and difficult to use for a variety of reasons. That said, WebAuthn continues to be a work in progress and is likely to overcome its current weaknesses. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Texas goes after toothpaste in escalating fight over fluoride",
    "article_text": "Colgate and Crest toothpastes are in the crosshairs. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is investigating two leading toothpaste makers over their use of fluoride, suggesting that they are \"illegally marketing\" the teeth cleaners to parents and kids \"in ways that are misleading, deceptive, and dangerous.\" The toothpaste makers in the crosshairs are Colgate-Palmolive Company, maker of Colgate toothpastes, and Proctor & Gamble Manufacturing Co., which makes Crest toothpastes. Inan announcement Thursday, Paxton said he has sent Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the companies. The move is an escalation in an ongoing battle over fluoride, which effectively prevents dental cavities and improves oral health. Community water fluoridation has been hailed by health and dental experts asone of the top 10 great public health interventionsfor advancing oral health across communities, regardless of age, education, or income. But, despite the success, fluoride has always had detractors—from conspiracy theorists in the past suggesting the naturally occurring mineral is a form of communist mind control, to more recent times, in which low-quality, controversial studies have suggested that high doses may lower IQ in children. The debate was renewed earlier this year when the National Toxicology Program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciencesfinally published a particularly contentious study after years of failed scientific reviews. The study claims to find a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and slightly lower IQs in children living in areas outside the US, mostly in China and India. But the study's methodology, statistical rigor, risk of bias, and lack of data transparency continue to draw criticism. Paxton referenced the study in his announcement of the investigation into toothpaste makers. Specifically, Paxton suggests that the toothpaste makers are marketing the toothpastes to encourage children to use too much, such as by adding appealing flavorings. Paxton notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Dental Association (ADA) both recommend usingsmall amounts. \"Toothpaste manufacturers must follow state law to ensure that they aren’t putting Texas families in peril through their false, misleading, and deceptive marketing, and these CIDs will help my office discover any potential wrongdoing,\" Paxton said in a statement. The ADA has continued topromote and defend the use of fluoride in community waterand only awards its ADA Seal of Acceptanceto toothpastes that contain fluoride. In March, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water. Florida is poised to become the second.

    "title": "Trump’s 2026 budget proposal: Crippling cuts for science across the board",
    "article_text": "Budget document derides research and science-based policy as \"woke,\" \"scams.\" On Friday, the US Office of Management and Budget sent Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate's Appropriations Committee,an outlineof what to expect from the Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal. As expected, the budget includes widespread cuts, affecting nearly every branch of the federal government. In keeping with the administration'sattacks on research agenciesand theplaces research gets done, research funding will be taking an enormous hit, with the National Institutes of Health taking a 40 percent cut and the National Science Foundation losing 55 percent of its 2025 budget. But the budget goes well beyond those highlighted items, with nearly every place science gets done or funded targeted for cuts. Perhaps even more shocking is the language used to justify the cuts, which reads more like a partisan rant than a serious budget document. Having a secretary of Health and Human Services whodoesn't believe in germ theoryis not likely to do good things for US health programs, and the proposed budget will only make matters worse. Kennedy's planned MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) program would be launched with half a billion in funds, but nearly everything else would take a cut. The CDC would lose about $3.6 billion from its current budget of $9.6 billion, primarily due to the shuttering of a number of divisions within it: the National Center for Chronic Diseases Prevention and Health Promotion, the National Center for Environmental Health, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, and the Global Health Center and its division of Public Health Preparedness and Response. The duties of those offices are, according to the budget document, \"duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary.\" Another big hit to HHS comes from the termination of a $4 billion program that helps low-income families cover energy costs. The OMB suggests that these costs will get lower due to expanded energy production and, anyway, the states should be paying for it. Shifting financial burdens to states is a general theme of the document, an approach that will ultimately hit the poorest states hardest, even though these had very high percentages of Trump voters. The document also says that \"This Administration is committed to combatting the scourge of deadly drugs that have ravaged American communities,\" while cutting a billion dollars from substance abuse programs within HHS. But the headline cuts come from the National Institutes of Health, the single largest source of scientific funding in the world. NIH would see its current $48 billion budget chopped by $18 billion and its 27 individual institutes consolidated down to just five. This would result in vast cutbacks to US biomedical research, which is currently acknowledged to be world-leading. Combined with planned cuts to grant overheads, it will cause most research institutions to shrink, and some less well-funded universities may be forced to close facilities. The justification for the cuts is little more than a partisan rant: \"NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.\" The text then implies that the broken trust is primarily the product of failing to promote the idea that SARS-CoV-2 originated in a lab, even though there's no scientific evidence to indicate that it had. The National Science Foundation funds much of the US's fundamental science research, like physics and astronomy. Earlier reporting that it would see a 56 percent cut to its budget was confirmed. \"The Budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science.\" Funding would be maintained for AI and quantum computing. All funding for encouraging minority participation in the sciences will also be terminated. The budget was released on the same day that the NSF announced it wasjoining other science agenciesin standardizing onpaying 15 percent of its grants' valuefor maintaining facilities and providing services to researchers, a cut that would further the financial damage to research institutions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would see $1.3 billion of its $6.6 billion budget cut, with the primary target being its climate change work. In fact, the budget for NOAA's weather satellites will be cut to prevent them from including instruments that would make \"unnecessary climate measurements.\" Apparently, the Administration doesn't want anyone to be exposed to data that might challenge its narrative that climate change is a scam. The National Institute of Standards and Technology would lose $350 million for similar reasons. \"NIST has long funded awards for the development of curricula that advance a radical climate agenda,\" the document suggests, before going on to say that the Institute's Circular Economy Program, which promotes the efficient reuse of industrial materials, \"pushes environmental alarmism.\" The Department of Energy is seeing a $1.1 billion hit to its science budget, \"eliminating funding for Green New Scam interests and climate change-related activities.\" The DOE will also take hits to policy programs focused on climate change, including $15 billion in cuts to renewable energy and carbon capture spending. Separately, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will also take a $2.6 billion hit. Over at the Department of the Interior, the US Geological Survey would see its renewable energy programs terminated, as well. Some of the DOE's other cuts, however, don't even make sense given the administration's priorities. The newly renamed Office of Fossil Energy—something that Trump favors—will still take a $270 million hit, and nuclear energy programs will see $400 million in cuts. This sort of lack of self-awareness shows up several times in the document. In one striking case, an interior program funding water infrastructure improvements is taking a cut that \"reduces funding for programs that have nothing to do with building and maintaining water infrastructure, such as habitat restoration.\" Apparently, the OMB is unaware that functioning habitats can help provide ecosystem services that can reduce the need for water infrastructure. Similarly, over at the EPA, they're boosting programs for clean drinking water by $36 million, while at the same time cutting loans to states for clean water projects by $2.5 billion. \"The States should be responsible for funding their own water infrastructure projects,\" the OMB declares. Research at the EPA also takes a hit: \"The Budget puts an end to unrestrained research grants, radical environmental justice work, woke climate research, and skewed, overly-precautionary modeling that influences regulations—none of which are authorized by law.\" US science couldn't flourish without an educational system that funnels talented individuals into graduate programs. So, naturally, funding for those is being targeted as well. This is partially a function of the administration's intention to eliminate the Department of Education, but there also seems to be a specific focus on programs that target low-income individuals. For example, theGEAR UP programdescribes itself as \"designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.\" The OMB document describes it as \"a relic of the past when financial incentives were needed to motivate Institutions of Higher Education to engage with low-income students and increase access.\" It goes on to claim that this is \"not the obstacle it was for students of limited means.\" Similarly, theSEOG programfunding is \"awarded to an undergraduate student who demonstrates exceptional financial need.\" In the OMB's view, colleges and universities \"have used [it] to fund radical leftist ideology instead of investing in students and their success.\" Another cut is claimed to eliminate \"Equity Assistance Centers that have indoctrinated children.\" And \"The Budget proposes to end Federal taxpayer dollars being weaponized to indoctrinate new teachers.\" In addition, the federal work-study program, which subsidizes on-campus jobs for needy students, is also getting a billion-dollar cut. Again, the document says that the states can pay for it. (The education portion also specifically cuts the funding of Howard University, which is both distinct as a federally supported Black university and also notable as being where Kamala Harris got her first degree.) This budget is a recipe for ending the US's leadership in science. It would do generational damage by forcing labs to shut down, with a corresponding loss of highly trained individuals and one-of-a-kind research materials. At the same time, it will throttle the educational pipeline that could eventually replace those losses. Given that the US is one of the major sources of research funding in the world, if approved, the budget will have global consequences. To the people within the OMB who prepared the document, these are not losses. The document makes it very clear that they view many instances of scientific thought and evidence-based policy as little more than forms of ideological indoctrination, presumably because the evidence sometimes contradicts what they'd prefer to believe.

    "title": "NASCAR, IMSA, IndyCar, F1: GM’s motorsport boss explains why it goes racing",
    "article_text": "Motorsports remains a great way to train good engineers. CONCORD, N.C.—We weren't allowed cameras past the lobby of General Motors' shiny new Charlotte Technical Center. It's the automaker's new motorsport hub in the heart of NASCAR country, but the 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m2) facility is for much more than just stock cars. There are cutting-edge driver-in-the-loop simulators, shaker rigs for punishing suspension, and even an entire gym for drivers to work on their fitness. It's also home to GM's racing command centers—conference rooms with walls of monitors where engineers and strategists provide remote support for GM's teams at their respective racetracks. It's pretty busy most weekends; this Saturday and Sunday, Chevrolet is racing in both IndyCar (in Alabama) and NASCAR (in Texas), next week, it's Chevrolet and Cadillac in Belgium for the World Endurance Championship and Northern California for IMSA, plus NASCAR in Kansas. Starting next year, F1's 24 races a year will be added to the mix as well. The technical center had been sanitized before our group of journalists arrived, perhaps rendering the camera ban moot anyway. The smells, on the other hand, were intriguing—solvents, 3D printers, some other rapid prototyping, or maybe all of it all at once. If only websites were scratch and sniff. The person with overall responsibility for it all is Ken Morris, whose full title stretches to senior vice president of product programs, product safety, and motorsports. The last of those items in his portfolio is almost certainly less important to GM than new products or those products being safe, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have real benefits. The days of a widget being tested on a race car and then fitted to road cars shortly afterward are mostly an artifact of the past, but there are other ways that motorsport programs make for better vehicles for the rest of us. \"I love the sport of it, of course, but I really love watching engineers develop over time and learn how to improve, improve, improve,\" Morris told me. \"I think it's not a given that a vehicle is really well integrated, from not only the tuning of the car, which is important, but body structure, torsional stiffness, all those kind of things are so important. And if the engineers don't have the right kind of backgrounds or right mentality, those things can get ignored, and it shows up in the end,\" he said. The late Richard Parry-Jones, who rose to CTO over at rival Ford, had a similar take: vehicle dynamics matter. \"There are people that think no one can tell the difference, you know, and I've always said they absolutely can tell the difference. They don't know what it is. And the structural feel of the car going down the road, you know, people might explain, 'It feels like a vault.' Well, I can tell you exactly what's going on, physically, from the parts and the tuning, and it's an outcome that we strive for,\" Morris said. The addition of electrified powertrains has certainly been one of the biggest trends in motorsport over the past decade or so. Since F1 made hybrids mandatory in 2014, we've also seen hybridization come to IMSA and WEC's prototypes, and most recently, IndyCar added a supercapacitor-based system. But it hasn't been a one-way street; this year, both the World Rally Championship and the British Touring Car Championship have abandoned the hybrid systems they adopted just a few years ago. Win on Sunday, sell on Monday, like concrete tech transfer, is much less of a thing in the early 21st century, but marketing remains a central reason for OEM involvement in the sport. I asked Morris if Cadillac would be endurance racing with the V-Series R if the LMdh ruleset didn't require a hybrid system. \"I think it's an interesting discussion because you know, current EVs—the development [needed] where you can really do lapping at the Nürburgring or lapping full laps and not one hot lap, then you're done, there's just going to have to be development, development iteration, iteration, and that's what racing is,\" Morris said. While the mechanical specifications of the hybrid Cadillac (and its rivals) are locked down, software development is unfettered, and Morris is not the first competitor to tell me how important that development path is now. Battery cell chemistries and battery cooling are also very active research areas and will only get more importantonce Cadillac enters F1. At first, that will be with Ferrari engines in the back, but starting in 2029, the Cadillac team will use a powertrain designed in-house. In the lobby of the Technical Center were a pair of Chevy's Blazer EV.R NASCAR prototypes. But as we've seen with Formula E, an entirely BEV-based series is a tough challenge at the best of times. And NASCAR races mostly on ovals, where there are no opportunities to regenerate braking energy back into the battery. GM, the other manufacturers, and NASCAR are working together to see where or how to add something electrified to the sport, possibly a support series. \"I selfishly really would like however it's set up to benefit our road cars, so that we really do get the technical benefit and technical payoff of the resources that were put into it. And, you know, I'd like it to be so that when we hire software engineers or battery engineers or drive unit engineers, they are working on something that will directly benefit when we want to do a full-blown [electric] track car,\" Morris told me. Last summer, we looked at how GM has been using AI to improve its racing performance. That includes tools that monitor the radio feeds to predict cautions, an image analysis pipeline that can alert engineers to car damage seconds after the photographer snaps the shot trackside, and strategy suggestions like when to make that pit stop. Sadly, like the suspension settings on a race car, some things remain too much of a competitive advantage to discuss freely with journalists, and no one will tell me if they've created an AI agent that sussed out a quicker line around a track. \"I don't know if I can share some examples,\" Morris said. \"I've got examples of things that we do that are fundamental, what we do analytically that would take four weeks, that will now take about four hours. And I mean, that's not BS, that's real... especially in the aerodynamics area, computational fluid dynamics, those kind of things. Aero is the one that has the most examples. But there's other places... And if you don't get in now, you're going to be way behind.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Screwworms are coming—and they’re just as horrifying as they sound",
    "article_text": "US is now scrambling to use aerial bombs of sterilized flies to halt the spread. We're on the verge of being screwwormed. The biological barrier was breached, they're slithering toward our border, and the US Department of Agriculture is now carpet-bombing parts of Mexico with weaponized flies to stave off an invasion. This is not a drill. Screwworms are possibly the most aptly named parasites imaginable, both literally and figuratively. Screwworms—technically,New World Screwworms—are flies that lay eggs on the mucous membranes, orifices, and wounds of warm-blooded animals. Wounds are the most common sites, and even a prick as small as a tick bite can be an invitation for the savage insects. Once beckoned, females lay up to 400 eggs at a time. Within about a day, ravenous flesh-eating larvae erupt, which both look and act like literal screws. They viciously and relentlessly bore and twist into their victim, feasting on the living flesh for about seven days. The result is a gaping ulcer writhing with maggots, which attracts yet more adult female screwworms that can lay hundreds more eggs, deepening the putrid, festering lesion. The infection, called myiasis, is intensely painful and life-threatening. Anyone who falls victim to screwworms is figuratively—well, you know. Screwworms aren't a new foe for the US. Decades ago, they were endemic to southern areas of the country, as well as the whole of Central America, parts of the Caribbean, and northern areas of South America. While they're a threat to many animals, including humans, they are a bane to livestock, causing huge economic losses in addition to the carnage. In the 1950s, the US began an intensive effort to eradicate screwworms. The successful endeavor required carefully inspecting animals and monitoring livestock movements. But most importantly, it relied on a powerful method to kill off the flies. The ploy—called the Sterile Insect Technique—throws a wrench into theunique life cycleof screwworms. After the larvae feast on flesh, they fall to the ground to develop into adults, a process that takes another seven days or so during warm weather. Once adults emerge, they can live for around two weeks, again depending on the weather. In that time, females generally only mate once, but don't worry—they make the most of the one-night stand by retaining sperm for multiple batches of eggs. While females lay up to 400 eggs at once, they can lay up to 2,800 in their lives. After carefully studying the life cycle, USDA scientists figured outa way to sterilize male fly larvae with doses of gamma radiationwithout hurting the males' abilities to find mates. USDA scientists then used small aircraft to bomb screwworm-riddled areas with millions of sterile male flies. The onslaught of sterilized flies elbows out fertile ones from their one-time chances of mating with a female, cratering the population. The method is remarkably successful. Screwworms were eradicated from the US by about 1966. Through the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, the frontline of the worms was pushed down through Central America. Screw worms were eventually declared eradicated from Panama in 2006. That year, the USDA partnered with Panama tobuild a sterile fly production facilitythat would be used to maintaina biological barrieralong the Darién Gap at the border of Panama and Colombia. Along the barrier, sterile flies have been released by air at least once a month since the eradication, according to Mark Fox, an entomologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who gavea clinical presentation on screwwormsin October. For decades, the US and Central America have mostly been free of screwworms, a fact that is estimated to have saved US farmers $900 million every year. There was a blip in 2016 when screwworms mysteriouslyshowed up in the Florida Keys, producing ghastly wounds on the islands' adorable and endangered Key deer, the smallest of North America’s white-tailed deer. But with intensive efforts andabout 188 million sterile flies, the outbreak was declared over by the end of March 2017. The source of the screwworms was never identified. Now, the US is staring down a more significant threat. In 2022, the biological barrier at the Darién Gap was breached. By July 2023, screwworms reached Costa Rica, then Nicaragua in March 2024, and Honduras by September 2024. Now, they are in Mexico. In February,the USDA announced it was shifting its aerial sterile fly bombingsfrom Panamato Mexicoto try to halt the northward advancement.In comments this week, Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins said that the parasites are currently south of Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest strip of land between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. The overall goal is to push them back down to the Darién Gap. But the effort to force the worms southward will be challenging. In the CDC's October presentation warning clinicians of the threat, Fox and other experts noted that keeping the parasites from spreading has been difficult. Challenges include varied topography that makes surveillance tricky, indigenous communities in hard-to-reach areas, communication barriers, inadequate wound care in animals, and continued transportation of animals through unmonitored checkpoints. Compared to humans, livestock and other animals are at far greater risk from screwworms' resurgence. For instance, there were at least 18,553 animal cases in Panama last October but only 79 human cases in the country. Still, when screwworms get a taste for human flesh, it's not pretty. The infection is extremely painful, and every single one of the larvae must be physically removed—and again, there are often hundreds. The procedure typically requires surgery. As CDC Medical Officer Rebecca Chancey remarked in the clinical presentation, the larvae are \"pretty tenacious and hang on pretty tightly, so oftentimes, you know, a great deal of force is required to remove them.\" Once the larvae are out, doctors must remove necrotic tissue, clean the wound, treat for any secondary infections, and try to manage the pain. There have been at least three human cases of screwworm myiasis in the US in recent years: In 2014, a 26-year-old US woman fell asleep on a beach in the Dominican Republic after drinking and came home with an infestation of screwworm larvae in her ear. In 2023, a 64-year-old man took a trip to Argentina and Brazil soon after having surgery on his cheek. Larvae were visible in the surgical wound before he left, and his cheek bandage reportedly fell off during his flight home. And last year, an immunosuppressed man traveled to the Dominican Republic and came back withan infestation in his nose and sinus cavities. (You can watch extremely graphic footage of US doctors trying to remove themhere.) Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Claude’s AI research mode now runs for up to 45 minutes before delivering reports",
    "article_text": "New feature searches hundreds of sources to build a document—but is it accurate? On Thursday, Anthropicannouncedsignificant upgrades to its AI assistant Claude, extending its research capabilities to run for up to 45 minutes before delivering comprehensive reports. The company also expanded its integration options, allowing Claude to connect with popular third-party services. Much like Google's DeepResearch(which debuted on December 11) and ChatGPT'sdeep researchfeatures (February 2), Anthropicannouncedits own \"Research\" feature on April 15. Each can autonomously browse the web and other online sources to compile research reports in document format, andopen source clonesof the technique have debuted as well. Now, Anthropic is taking its Research feature a step further. The upgraded mode enables Claude to conduct \"deeper\" investigations across \"hundreds of internal and external sources,\" Anthropic says. When users toggle the Research button, Claude breaks down complex requests into smaller components, examines each one, and compiles a report with citations linking to original sources. In our experience, most of these deep research features from the various AI vendors have worked fairly well, surfacing relevant research that can be difficult to find otherwise if you don't already know where to look. But users should be aware of the potential forconfabulations within the resultsthat might contain plausible-sounding AI-invented sources that don't exist. While most reports complete within 5 to 15 minutes, Anthropic says, the new research system can now take up to 45 minutes for particularly complex investigations—tasks that would typically require hours of manual research effort. We can testify that AI-prepared research documents can definitely save some time gathering important and noteworthy sources. But you have to know what you're looking at to make sure you're not relying onirrelevant or false information. As always with AI outputs, do not trust any of them blindly. In this sense, AI search functions have arguably been most useful so far for experts in a particular field who can separate the wheat from the chaff. For example, we asked Anthropic's Research a simple question: \"Who Invented Video Games?\" After 13 minutes and 2 seconds of research, it constructed a fairly comprehensive and nuanced report, complete with sources, that, in my opinion (havingwritten a lotabout the subject over the past 20 years), providesa largely accurate historical overview that exceeds the quality of most video game history books in print today. Still, the report contained a direct quote statement from William Higinbotham that appears to combine quotes fromtwosourcesnot cited in the source list. (One must always be careful with confabulated quotes in AI because even outside of this Research mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet tends to invent plausible ones to fit a narrative.) Werecently covereda study that showed AI search services confabulate sources frequently, and in this case, it appears that the sources Claude Research surfaced, while real, did not always match what is stated in the report. There's always room for interpretation and variation in detail, of course, but overall, Claude Research did a relatively good job crafting a report on this particular topic. Still, you'd want to dig more deeply into each source and confirm everything if you used it as the basis for serious research. You can read the full Claude-generated result asthis text file, saved in markdown format. Sadly, the markdown version does not include the source URLS found in the Claude web interface. Anthropic also announced Thursday that it has broadened Claude's data access capabilities. In addition to web search and Google Workspace integration, Claude can now search any connected application through the company's new \"Integrations\" feature. The feature reminds us somewhat of OpenAI'sChatGPT Pluginsfeature from March 2023 that aimed for similar connections, although the two features work differently under the hood. These Integrations allow Claude to work with remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers across web and desktop applications. The MCP standard, which Anthropic introduced last November andwe covered in April, connects AI applications to external tools and data sources. At launch, Claude supports Integrations with 10 services, including Atlassian's Jira and Confluence, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Asana, Square, Sentry, PayPal, Linear, and Plaid. The company plans to add more partners like Stripe and GitLab in the future. Each integration aims to expand Claude's functionality in specific ways. The Zapier integration, for instance, reportedly connects thousands of apps through pre-built automation sequences, allowing Claude to automatically pull sales data from HubSpot or prepare meeting briefs based on calendar entries. With Atlassian's tools, Anthropic says that Claude can collaborate on product development, manage tasks, and create multiple Confluence pages and Jira work items simultaneously. Anthropic has made its advanced Research and Integrations features available in beta for users on Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, with Pro plan access coming soon. The company has also expanded its web search feature (introduced in March) to all Claude users on paid plans globally.

    "article_text": "NotebookLM is a genuinely useful AI tool, and it's coming to your phone. After several years of escalating AI hysteria, we are all familiar with Google's desire to put Gemini in every one of its products. That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is not—this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google's advanced AI models, has been available on the websince 2023, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it's not yet available to install. Until now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing islive in the Play Store early. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you'll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being. NotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google's other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent. It has a hefty context window of 500,000 tokens and supports document uploads as large as 200MB. Google says this creates a queryable \"AI expert\" that can answer detailed questions and brainstorm ideas based on the source data. NotebookLM also originated Audio Overviews, the sometimes creepyAI-generated \"podcasts\"that have since crept into other Google AI products. Those will be accessible in the app, and you can join the conversation yourself to talk with the AI-generated hosts. Again, it's a little creepy but also cool? However, this and a few other features in NotebookLM are only available to those with a $20 Gemini Advanced subscription. Credit:\n\n          \n          Google NotebookLM is a contender for Google's best AI idea since the entire technology industry went gaga for large language models (LLMs). Unlike so much of what Google has been doing in AI, NotebookLM doesn't intrude upon your established workflows, and it offers a genuinely useful feature set. With a strict focus on the data sources you've provided, it is less likely to hallucinate falsehoods, and it cites its sources in line, making it a snap to check the documents for verification. The app will let you access your existing AI experts and add new ones right from your phone. The app even integrates with the Android sharing menu, allowing you to add new sources to the app without even opening it. A version of the app for iOS islisted for pre-registration, too. However, Apple's store also lists an official launch date: May 20, the same day Google I/O kicks off. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Cyborg cicadas play Pachelbel’s Canon",
    "article_text": "Such insect-computer hybrid speakers  might one day be used to transmit warnings in emergencies. The distinctive chirps of singing cicadas are a highlight of summer in regions where they proliferate; those chirps even featured prominently on Lorde's 2021 albumSolar Power. Now, Japanese scientists at the University of Tsukuba have figured out how to transform cicadas into cyborg insects capable of \"playing\"Pachelbel's Canon. They described their work ina preprintpublished on the physics arXiv. You can listen to the soundshere. Scientists have been intrigued by the potential of cyborg insects since the 1990s, when researchers began implanting tiny electrodes into cockroach antennae and shocking them to direct their movements. The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications. For instance, in 2015, Texas A&M scientistsfound thatimplanting electrodes into a cockroach's ganglion (the neuron cluster that controls its front legs) was remarkably effective at successfully steering the roaches 60 percent of the time. They outfitted the roaches with tiny backpacks synced with a remote controller and administered shocks to disrupt the insect's balance, forcing it to move in the desired direction And in 2021, scientists at Nanyang Technological University in SingaporeturnedMadagascar hissing cockroaches into cyborgs, implanting electrodes in sensory organs known as cerci that were then connected to tiny computers. Applying electrical current enabled them to steer the cockroaches successfully 94 percent of the time in simulated disaster scenes in the lab. The authors of this latest paper were inspired by that 2021 project and decided to apply the basic concept to singing cicadas, with the idea that cyborg cicadas might one day be used to transmit warning messages during emergencies. It's usually the males who do the singing, and each species has a unique song. In most species, the production of sound occurs via a pair of membrane structures called tymbals, which are just below each side of the insect's anterior abdominal region. The tymbal muscles contract and cause the plates to vibrate while the abdomen acts as a kind of resonating chamber to amplify the song. The Tsukuba team essentially hijacked the tymbals of seven large male cicadas of theGraptosaltria nigrofuscataspecies by attaching electrodes to create their insect-computer hybrid speakers. This species has fewer muscles or organs near the tymbals, making it easier to focus the electrical stimulation on those sound-producing muscles, and its larger size made it easier to perform the necessary surgical procedures. A user interface sent electrical signals through an amplifier circuit, which enhanced the signals and sent them to the electrodes on the cicadas. Microphones placed one centimeter in front of the insects recorded their chirps in response to the electrical stimulation while a circuit tester measured the voltage flowing through their tiny bodies. The researchers experimented with different voltages to determine the optimal voltages for producing each pitch interval and mapped the resulting waveforms. After a bit of trial and error, the team induced the cicadas to produce specific musical notes over more than three octaves, ranging from 27.5 hertz to 261.6 hertz. From there, the researchers figured out how to get the insects to \"play\" recognizable tunes, notably Pachelbel's Canon. The experiments did not harm the cicadas, co-author Naoto Nishida, now at the University of Tokyo,told New Scientist. \"Some of them wanted to run away,\" he said. \"Others were like, 'OK, use my abdomen.'\" arXiv, 2025.

    "title": "“Blatantly unlawful”: Trump slammed for trying to defund PBS, NPR",
    "article_text": "Defunding PBS and NPR risks devastating rural communities, networks say. President Donald Trump escalated his attack on NPR and PBS on Thursday when he signed anexecutive orderdemanding the end of all federal funding supporting the news outlets. In his order, Trump claimed that unlike in the 1960s, when the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was funded to ensure Americans had access to critical news, there are plenty of news options today. He has joined other Republicans accusing NPR and PBS of promoting a left-leaning bias. In a White Housestatement, he ordered any agency directly or indirectly funding the outlets' allegedly \"woke propaganda\" to \"end the madness\" as soon as possible, cutting off current funding \"to the maximum extent allowed by law\" and declining \"to provide future funding.\" Trump's authority to cut off CPB's funding continues to be disputed. In March, his administrationreportedlyplanned to direct Congress to rescind CPB funding—as both NPR and PBS arefully funded through 2027—butaccording to PBS, budget director Russell Vought has yet to send over any guidance. With that effort seemingly stalled, Trump appears to now be seeking a route around Congress. He has demanded that CPB rewrite the rules on grant eligibility by June 30 to directly ban any future funding for either NPR or PBS. That planned ban would also stop any organization that receives federal grants from sharing funding with either organization. According to NPR, Congress allocated $535 million to CPB for 2025, and its budget is approved in a two-year cycle specifically \"to insulate it from political pressures\" as administrations and power dynamics shift on Capitol Hill. Currently, NPR \"receives about 1 percent of its funding directly from the federal government,\" while its 246 member institutions \"receive on average 8 to 10 percent of their funds from CPB.\" Partly because television programming costs more, PBS and its stations \"receive about 15 percent of their revenues\" from CPB, the report said. CPB President Patricia Harrison suggested in a statement provided to Ars that these moves to block networks' funding exceed Trump's authority. \"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the president’s authority,\" Harrison said. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,\" statutorily forbidding \"any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.\" In astatementexplaining why \"this is not about the federal budget\" and promising to \"vigorously defend our right to provide essential news, information and life-saving services to the American public,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher called the order an \"affront to the First Amendment.\" PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger went further, calling the order \"blatantly unlawful\" in a statement provided to Ars. \"Issued in the middle of the night,\" Trump's order \"threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years,\" Kerger said. \"We are currently exploring all options to allow PBS to continue to serve our member stations and all Americans.” While Trump opposes NPR and PBS for promoting content that he disagrees with—criticizing segments on white privilege, gender identity, reparations, \"fat phobia,\" and abortion—the networks have defended their programming as unbiased and falling in line with Federal Communications Commission guidelines. Further, NPRreportedthat the networks' \"locally grounded content\" currently reaches \"more than 99 percent of the population at no cost,\" providing not just educational fare and entertainment but also critical updates tied to local emergency and disaster response systems. Cutting off funding, Kreger said last month, would have a \"devastating impact\" on rural communities, especially in parts of the country where NPR and PBS still serve as \"the only source of news and emergency broadcasts,\" NPRreported. For example, Ed Ulman, CEO of Alaska Public Media, testified to Congress last month that his stations \"provide potentially life-saving warnings and alerts that are crucial for Alaskans who face threats ranging from extreme weather to earthquakes, landslides, and even volcanoes.\" Some of the smallest rural stations sometimes rely on CPB for about 50 percent of their funding, NPRreported. \"Nationwide, our public television interconnection system supports the PBS Warning, Alert, Response Network, a critical pathway for the distribution of wireless energy emergency alerts to cell phones,\" Ulman told lawmakers. Additionally, NPR noted that local stations \"provide context that national reporters can't always get,\" aiding NPR's coverage of breaking national news. It's clear that some members of the public are also alarmed by the threat to local media. Trump's March attempt to rescind funding sparked protests, heightening scrutiny of the president at a time when he also faces public backlash over tariffs and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Courts could possibly intervene to block the executive order. PBSreportedthat lawsuits opposing Trump's efforts to dismantle the US Agency for Global Media—including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which serve parts of the world where free press access is restricted—have won rulings that \"the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.\" The CPB has alreadysuedthe Trump administration, requesting a temporary restraining order to block allegedly illegal terminations of CPB board members. They're hoping a court will ultimately agree that Trump must be stopped from any efforts to \"interfere with or control the governance and operations of the CPB.\" So far, the pushback has not stopped Trump from continuing his attacks on public institutions, which PBSnotedgo beyond the CPB and include efforts to \"cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters, and others,\" as well as efforts \"to withhold federal research and education funds from universities.\" Together, this paints a picture of shrinking access to resources, PBS warned, which NPR suggested could result in long-lasting harms to American communities everywhere. \"Eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would have a devastating impact on American communities across the nation that rely on public radio for trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts, and public safety information,\" an NPR spokesperson warned last month.

    "article_text": "There are negative consequences for the flies, but they avoid being eaten alive. Have you ever pulled an all-nighter because of anxiety? Found yourself doomscrolling on your phone when you should have gone to bed hours ago? Purposely downed too many cups of coffee at three in the morning? There are some insomniac flies who would like a word. It appears that fruit flies that spend their days lazily buzzing through the lush orchards and rainforests of Queensland, Australia, live in paradise. That changes at sunset. After dark, the flies are plagued by theGamasodesqueenslandicusmites, which can attach themselves like ticks and literally eat the flies alive in their sleep. Researchers led by University of Cincinnati biologist Joshua Benoit have now discovered that flies that have had enough of the mites will stay awake at the expense of their health. These mite-resistant flies drain their nutrient reserves to stay up all night, making them more susceptible to starvation. Insomniacs consumed more oxygen and were generally more active than non-resistant flies; they also experienced changes in gene activity related to their metabolisms. Fruit flies(Drosophila melanogaster)may be pests to humans, but they have their own pests to contend with. Ectoparasitic mites such asG. queenslandicusare some of the worst. Being bitten can put the flies' immune and repair responses into overdrive, at great energy cost. Parasitized flies are also less successful at mating. Given all that, the flies are likely better off staying awake and in defense mode. Benoit and his team compared the flies’ daytime and nighttime activities. They also bred generation after generation of mite-resistant flies to see how their resistance would evolve. When humans purposely select for or against certain features in other organisms like this, it's known asartificial selection. This was meant to give the researchers an idea of how mite-resistant flies evolve in response to mites in nature. While many genes saw changes after the researchers selected for mite resistance, those associated with metabolic processes such asglycolysis, which involves enzymes breaking down glucose, were especially affected. “We found that more than 30 metabolism genes were differently [activated] in these flies, suggesting they were burning their energy a little faster than you’d expect,” Benoit said in apress release. Those genes associated with metabolism were upregulated, meaning they showed an increase in activity. An observed loss of body fat and protein reserves was evidently a trade-off for resistance to mites. This suggests there was increased lipolysis, or the breakdown of fats, and proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins, in resistant lines of flies. The depletion of nutrients could make fruit flies less likely to survive even without mites feeding off them, but their tenaciousness when it comes to staying up through the night suggests that being parasitized by mites is still the greater risk. Because mite-resistant flies did not sleep, their oxygen consumption and activity also increased during the night to levels no different from those of control group flies during the day. Keeping mites away involves moving around so the fly can buzz off if mites crawl too close. Knowing this, Benoit wanted to see what would happen if the resistant flies’ movement was restricted. It was doom. When the flies were restrained, the mite-resistant flies were as susceptible to mites as the controls. Activity alone was important for resisting mites. Since mites are ectoparasites, or external parasites (as opposed to internal parasites like tapeworms), potential hosts like flies can benefit from hypervigilance. Sleep is typically beneficial to a host invaded by an internal parasite because it increases the immune response. Unfortunately for the flies, sleeping would only make them an easy meal for mites. Keeping bothstereoscopic eyesout for an external parasite means there is no time left for sleep. “The pattern of reduced sleep likely allows the flies to be more responsive during encounters with mites during the night,” the researcherssaidin their study, which was recently published in Biological Timing and Sleep. “There could be differences in sleep occurring during the day, but these differences may be less important asD. melanogastersleeps much less during the day.” Fruit flies aren’t the only creatures with sleep patterns that parasites disrupt. Evidence of shifts in sleep and rest in birds and bats has been shown to happen when there is a risk of parasitism after dark. For the flies, exhaustion has the upside of better fertility if they manage to avoid bites, so a mate must be worth all those sleepless nights.

    "title": "White House budget seeks to end SLS, Orion, and Lunar Gateway programs",
    "article_text": "\"SLS alone costs $4 billion per launch and is 140 percent over budget.\" The White House released a \"skinny\" version of itsbudget proposal for fiscal year 2026on Friday, including financial information for all federal agencies. A \"skinny\" budget simply means that while the document contains top-line numbers for agencies and their programs, it does not provide much in the way of specific allocations. The document was delivered to the Senate Committee on Appropriations on Friday and signed by Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. A \"full fiscal plan\" will follow in the coming weeks. This is the first step in the budget process, in which Congress has the critical role of actually writing a budget. \"I look forward to working with you to achieve significant budgetary savings for the American people within the spending programs under your jurisdiction,\" Vought wrote. The budget contains some notable changes for the US space agency. Overall, NASA is asked to take a 25 percent cut in its budget, from about $25 billion to $18.8 billion. Ars has previously reportedon some of these proposed cuts, most notably to its science budget. These include a $2.265 billion reduction in Space science and a $1.161 billion reduction in Earth science. Perhaps the most notable cancellation here is the Mars Sample Return mission, which the budget proposal says will be achieved by human missions to Mars. There are also significant changes proposed in NASA's biggest-ticket exploration programs. The budget would cancel the Lunar Gateway that NASA has started developing and end the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft after two more flights, Artemis II and Artemis III. \"The Budget phases out the grossly expensive and delayed Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule after three flights,\" the document states. \"SLS alone costs $4 billion per launch and is 140 percent over budget. The Budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the Moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions.\" There are no further details about those commercial systems. NASA has contracted with SpaceX and Blue Origin to develop reusable landers for the Moon, and both of these systems include vehicles to move from Earth orbit to the Moon. The changes to SLS, Orion, and Gateway have been widely speculated upon in recent months, but seeing them in black and white is still significant. The development of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft has been a budget fixture for decades, costing in excess of $3 billion a year for slow progress. The projects have been widely derided as \"jobs programs.\" However, that is one reason Congress has so fiercely supported them: They provide good-paying, reliable jobs across the country. Duringa confirmation hearinglast month, a private astronaut tapped by the Trump administration to lead NASA was repeatedly pressed by US senators to commit to flying Artemis II and Artemis III with the SLS and Orion hardware. The nominee, Jared Isaacman, agreed to do so. However, during this hearing, Isaacman made no promises about missions beyond this, nor did members of Congress ask him about Artemis IV or other future missions. Several sources in the space community, therefore, believe it is indeed plausible that SLS and Orion will be phased out over the next five years in favor of far less expensive commercial rockets and spacecraft. NASA will thus be asked to beat China to the Moon with the legacy systems and then identify more affordable options for future missions to the Moon. One area that will see increased spending under the Trump administration's proposed budget is human space exploration. \"By allocating over $7 billion for lunar exploration and introducing $1 billion in new investments for Mars-focused programs, the Budget ensures that America’s human space exploration efforts remain unparalleled, innovative, and efficient,\" the document states. Under the Trump administration, NASA will seek to reach both the Moon and Mars. The goal, stated in the document, is to refocus NASA \"on beating China to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars.\" Unfortunately, there is no information on what these \"Mars-focused programs\" will be. Some of this new funding would almost certainly go to SpaceX. The company, founded by Trump ally Elon Musk, explicitly focuses on establishing human settlements on Mars. Although lunar and Mars exploration receive increases, the budget seeks to reduce the agency's commitment to the International Space Station, while still flying it until 2030. \"The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research,\" the document states. \"Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced. The station’s reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs.\" It is likely that Congress will oppose some of these changes, particularly the cuts to science programs and the reduction in activity on the International Space Station. But that story will play out in the coming months as the laborious budget process unfolds. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Epic Games Store completely eliminates revenue fees for smaller developers",
    "article_text": "Epic takes no cut for first $1 million in annual per-game revenue under new plan. It has been over six years since Epicstarted undercutting Steam's 30 percent revenue share for developers, asking for just 12 percent of sales on its then-new Epic Games Store. Now, Epic is going even further by reducing those fees to zero for a game's first $1 million in annual sales. Thenewly announced fee structurewill go into effect in June, Epic said, and will apply to a developer's revenue on a \"per app\" basis. After the first $1 million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12 percent fee for listing on the Epic Games Store. This isn't the first time Epic has offered a financial break to smaller developers. Back in 2011, the companyeschewed royalty payments for the first $50,000 in salesfor projects made with the newly free Unreal Development Kit. By 2020, that royalty-free grace period for Unreal Engine projectswas increased to cover the first $1 million in lifetime salesfor a project. Epic's focus on the low end of the gaming revenue scale is something of an inverse of Valve's fee structure on Steam. In 2018, Valvecut its default 30 percent revenue shareto 25 percent, but only for lifetime per-game earnings in excess of $10 million. Valve's fee goes down again to 20 percent after a game hits $50 million in lifetime sales. That \"better deal for bigger developers\" setup drew particular ire from Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney shortly after it was announced. \"Right now, you assholes are telling the world that the strong and powerful get special terms, while 30% is for the little people,\" Sweeneywrote to Valve in a 2018 emailunearthed during the company's legal fight with Apple. \"We're all in for a prolonged battle if Apple tries to keep their monopoly and 30% by cutting backroom deals with big publishers to keep them quiet. Why not give ALL developers a better deal?\" The first few years of the Epic Games Storewere characterized by a \"hand-curated\" approach to game offerings, focusing on established developers andflashy exclusivesto attract new customers to the store. Back in 2023, though, Epicofficially opened the store to self-publishing, allowing for a flood of hundreds of smaller games such asFell in Love with Coser 4andVacation Adventures: Park Ranger 17 Collectors Edition, to highlight just a couple of recent and upcoming Epic Games Store releases. While Epic will certainly lose a lot of revenue under this new fee structure, the company has long showna willingness to throw large sums of money at the Epic Games Storein an attempt to get a foothold against Steam's near-monopoly in PC game distribution. And while the Epic Games Storemanaged to attract over $1 billion in customer spending in 2024, that number falls well short ofSteam's estimated $10.8 billion in total spendingthe same year. That has to be at least a little disappointing for Epic, considering the company fell well short ofearly hopes of becoming 35 to 50 percent of the PC gaming market by 2024.

    "title": "Eric Schmidt apparently bought Relativity Space to put data centers in orbit",
    "article_text": "\"Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is.\" In the nearly two months since former Google chief executive Eric Schmidtacquired Relativity Space, the billionaire has not said much publicly about his plans for the launch company. However, his intentions for Relativity now appear to be increasingly clear: He wants to have the capability to launch a significant amount of computing infrastructure into space. We know this because Schmidt appeared before the House Committee on Energy and Commerceduring a hearingin April, speaking on the future of AI and US competitiveness. Among the topics raised then was the need for more electricity—both renewable and non-renewable—to power data centers that will facilitate the computing needs for AI development and applications. Schmidt noted that an average nuclear power plant in the United States generates 1 gigawatt of power. \"People are planning 10 gigawatt data centers,\" Schmidt said. \"Gives you a sense of how big this crisis is. Many people think that the energy demand for our industry will go from 3 percent to 99 percent of total generation. One of the estimates that I think is most likely is that data centers will require an additional 29 gigawatts of power by 2027, and 67 more gigawatts by 2030. These things are industrial at a scale that I have never seen in my life.\" AI applications consume an enormous amount of computing power. A single ChatGPT query consumesapproximately 10 times moreenergy than a Google search does. The US energy industry is not well prepared for this kind of dramatic growth in energy demand, as power consumption over the last decade has increased by about 0.5 percent a year. Data centers also consume significant amounts of water for cooling. After seeing these comments by Schmidt, I reasoned that the former Google executive might have bought Relativity Space as a means to support the development of data centers in space. Such data centers, ideally, would be powered by solar panels and be able to radiate heat into the vacuum of space. \"This probably helps explain why Schmidt bought Relativity Space,\"I commentedon the social media site X after Schmidt's remarks. A day later, Schmidtreplied with a single word, \"Yes.\" There are relatively few US launch companies that either have large rockets or are developing them. The options for a would-be space entrepreneur who wants to control their own access to space are limited. SpaceX and Blue Origin are already owned by billionaires who have total decision-making authority. United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket is expensive, and its existing manifest is long already. Rocket Lab's Neutron vehicle is coming soon, but it may not be large enough for Schmidt's ambitions. That leaves Relativity Space, which may be within a couple of years of flying the partially reusable Terran R rocket. If fully realized, Terran R would be a beastly launch vehicle capable of launching 33.5 metric tons to low-Earth orbit in expendable mode—more than a fully upgraded Vulcan Centaur—and 23.5 tons with a reusable first stage. If you were a billionaire seeking to put large data centers into space and wanted control of launch, Relativity is probably the only game in town. As Ars has previously reported, there aresome considerable flawswith Relativity's approach to developing Terran R. However, these problems can be fixed with additional money, and Schmidt has brought that to the company over the last half-year. Schmidt does not possess the wealth of an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. His personal fortune isroughly $20 billion, so approximately an order of magnitude less. This explains why, according to financial industry sources, Schmidt is presently seeking additional partners to bankroll a revitalized Relativity. Solving launch is just one of the challenges this idea faces, of course. How big would these data centers be? Where would they go within an increasingly cluttered low-Earth orbit? Could space-based solar power meet their energy needs? Can all of this heat be radiated away efficiently in space? Economically, would any of this make sense? These are not simple questions. But Schmidt is correct that the current trajectory of power and environmental demands created by AI data centers is unsustainable. It is good that someone is thinking big about solving big problems.

    "article_text": "Rockstar: Extra time will let us \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\" Rockstar's highly anticipatedGrand Theft Auto VIwill finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said ina Friday morning announcement. That means the game will miss the \"2025\" release window that the developer announced alongsidethe game's first trailer in late 2023. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use \"this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\" \"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,\" Rockstar wrote in its announcement. \"The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.\" While disappointing for franchise fans, today's official announcement of a delay hasn't exactly been unexpected. Insider sources have been reporting that the 2025 release target looked unlikelyfor well over a year now. \"Nobody I’ve talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now,\" Bloomberg's Jason Schreierwrote on Blueskythis morning. \"Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch.GTA VIslipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer.\" The new planned launch date ofGrand Theft Auto VInow falls a full 4,634 days after the September 17, 2013, launch ofGrand Theft Auto Von the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By contrast, there was just a 1,967-day gap between the release ofGrand Theft Auto Vand the prior releaseGrand Theft Auto IV, whichalsolaunched on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 29, 2008. In the thousands of days sinceGrand Theft Auto Vlaunched, the game hassold a staggering 210 million copies, according to publisher Take-Two (including sales for subsequent ports and remasters on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC). Much of that success has been driven by the enduring popularity ofGrand Theft Auto Online, a mode that hasbeen a consistent cash cow for Take-Two for well over a decade now, despite dated online code that has led topersistentissuessurroundingcheatersandhackers. Rockstar's initial 2023 announcement ofGTA VIpointedly left out any mention of a PC version alongside the planned PS5 and Xbox Series X/S releases (though Rockstar later confirmed that port will be coming at some point). Rockstar'shistory of delayed PC ports, including along wait for a heavily delayed PC version ofGrand Theft Auto V, suggests that PC players may have to wait significantly longer than their console-playing brethren to playGTA VI, though. “We don't always go across all platforms simultaneously,\" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnicktold IGN earlier this yearwhen asked about PC release plans. \"Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.” There's also no word if Rockstar has any plans to bring some version ofGrand Theft Auto VIto the Switch 2, a console that wasstill the whisper of a rumor when the game was officially announced in 2023. In 2022, Rockstar suffered what it called a \"network intrusion\" that led tothe leak of some extremely earlyGrand Theft Auto VIfootageonto the wider Internet. \"We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way,\" Rockstarwrote at the time. \"Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Deadpool May Next Team With Multiple X-Men on the Big Screen",
    "article_text": "A billion dollars made it clear Deadpoolwould be a major partof the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward. But how would that work? Well, a new report claimsRyan Reynolds is working onhis next story, and it once againinvolves the X-Men. According tothe Hollywood Reporter, Reynolds is “working on various treatments for an ensemble film featuring three or four X-Men characters” that would see Deadpool as a supporting character, not the star. Apparently, the actor believes “keeping his f-bomb wielding anti-hero more on the sidelines could allow for the X-Men characters to be used in unexpected way.” The caveat here is that this is all very early days. “Treatment” is basically just a fancy Hollywood word for “idea.” It’s not a script. It’s more of a general outline creatives can bring to a studio to get a writer and director on board to flesh things out more fully. Plus, the trade reports this is all happening outside of Marvel for now. That’ll change but it’s just Reynolds and his team. That means this is not the same thing as the specific X-Men projectthat’s been bubbling at the studiofor about a year, written by Michael Lesslie. It’s also worth noting that Reynolds has previously been dead set about Deadpool not officially joining any of those teams. So, whatever this is, it’s gonna be more unique than a traditional team-up. âI think Deadpool works so well appearing with the X-Men and Avengers, but he always needs to stay an outsider,âhe said a few months back. âHis ultimate dream is to be accepted and appreciated. But he canât be accepted. His coping mechanism of deflecting shame through humor works only when used to pave over his many inadequacies. If and when hedoesÂ become an Avenger or X-Man, weâre at the end of his journey.â So let’s speculate. Let’s say the next Deadpool movie features the R-rated character facing off with, or teaming up, with some X-Men. Who would you like to see? Even before that, are these characters that should be established already, such as Channing Tatum’s Gambit, Kelsey Grammer’s Beast, or Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine? Or new characters? Personally, I think it could be interesting for Deadpool to tag along with some of the younger X-Men characters, be that a Jubilee or Kid Omega or just younger versions of more established characters, in a mentor-mentee role. Or you can flip that. Put Deadpool as the more inexperienced character along with a Cyclops, Storm, Rogue, etc. The possibilities are quite literally endless. Which is why Reynolds is just now figuring it out. If he does settle on something, though, you can be sure this would all be after the events ofAvengers: Secret Wars and take place firmly past the Infinity Saga as well as the Multiverse Saga. Maybe this is the kick-off of the Mutant Saga. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "The Return of the Pebble Smartwatch Is a Sign People Crave Something Unique",
    "article_text": "The return of Pebble offers a chance to reset the clock on smartwatches.Eric Migicovsky, the original idea man behind Pebbleâs simple, pared-down e-paper wearable, isback with a devicethatlooks akin to that decade-old smartwatchbrand in the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2. The first footage of Migicovskyâs resurrected wearable shows promise, not for any big feature that sets it apart from your typical Apple Watch, but because it’s not like anything else you can buy today. The regular slate of smartwatches from the likes ofGoogle,Samsung, and Applehasnât left us truly excited. Samsung and Apple are in a race to add as many health sensors to the back of their devices, and still the most we can hope for on the impendingApple Watch Series 11is a slimmer body and slightly better display. Core Devicesâ Core 2 Duo, in its current iteration, is practically the same device as aPebble 2but with a few tweaks. It includes a relatively small, 1.2-inch display andâget thisâno touchscreen. You control it with buttons. TheCore 2 Duoscreen is black and white, while the $225 Core Time 2 has a 1.5-inch color touchscreen display and a heart rate monitor. In avideoposted Thursday, Migicovsky offered some insight into the smartwatch itself, plus more on what people in the U.S. can expect to pay for one due to Trump tariffs. He confirmed the Core 2 Duo is being made in China, but the company will bulk ship the devices to the U.S. to try and shift the burden of the 27.5% tariffs on smartwatches to what they pay to the factory. The cost of smartwatch shipments may go up by $10 to $25, he said. Things could change, and thereâs a chance that prices could be impacted once President Donald Trumpâs 90-day pause on worldwide tariffs on countries other than China is over. The ship date still hasnât changed from July this year. There are upgrades on the way. Migicovsky said he hopes to integrate complicationsâaka those little widgets that tell you the time or offer app alertsâ alongside deeper Beeper integration for having an all-in-one chat app. The Pebble founder said he would also like to add some sort of AI companion onto the smartwatch. He cited the app Bob.ai, which can offer quick answers to simple queries through Googleâs Gemini AI model. The maker has already mentioned users could connect with ChatGPT via a built-in microphone, but the new smartwatches will have a speaker for ChatGPT to talk back. The Core 2 Duo is supposed to retail for $150. That sounds relatively low compared to the $400 MSRPApple Watch Series 9orSeries 10,but when you consider how often these devices go on sale only a few months out of the gate, Pebble is going to compete against Apple and other, much larger brands. If thatâs the case, is there a market for these lower-powered, less health-focused smartwatches? That depends if Core Devices wants to rely solely on those nostalgic for the Pebble ecosystem. Nothing, the company started by OnePlus alum Carl Pei, has managed to capture a chunk of the Android phone ecosystem by simply makingeye-catching transparent phones. Nothingâs CMF budget sub-brand is producing interesting alternatives, like thenew Phone 2 Pro, to Pixel or Galaxy devices. Migicovsky, whoâs much more low-key than Pei, isnât flashing any âglyphâ lights to entice customers to his alternative smartwatch. Heâs relying on fans and word of mouth to build a brand without any emphasis on overt smart features. The Pebble founder said he enjoys smartwatches for the sake of easy-to-access notifications. âItâs fun,â he said, before showing off a watch face with an octopus holding an ice cream cone. âI love having a device in my life that makes me feel happy.â E-paperSmartwatcheswearables Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Andor Let Saw Gerrera Be Right Again",
    "article_text": "Saw Gerrera’s post-Rogue Onecareer has forged him into one ofÂStar Wars‘most fascinating elementsof the Rebellion. A sometime ally and often outside detractor to the unequivocal heroes of the original films, Saw became the embodiment of an unsanitized look at the reality of resisting a totalitarian regime like the Galactic Empire, a fascinating foil put up firstagainst Mon Mothma, and thenAndor‘s own Luthen Rael as one facet of the greater whole of the Rebel Alliance. But while he’s regularly made some very valid points across his appearancesâoften alongside him being othered or in some ways villainized by the eventualtellers of the historythat is the Alliance’s victory against the Empireâthis week’s set ofAndorepisodes gave an incredible moment over to the partisan leader to articulate his perspective. AcrossÂAndorseason two’ssecond trio of episodes, Saw’s narrative is experienced less through the man himself directly, and more from the perspective of former Ferrix native Wilmon Paak. Wilmon himself is already an interesting mirror to Saw’s own origins inClone WarsâWil’s father, Salman, was tortured to death by the Empire in an attempt to hunt down the insurgent operative codenamed “Axis,” leading to Wil throwing an incendiary device that further ignited the riot at Maarva’s funeral in season one, an interesting mirror to Saw losing his sister in Oderon’s Republic-backed insurgency against Separatist rule in the Clone Wars. But over the course of this act, we see Wilmon, sent to provide technical support to Saw’s partisans by Luthen, transform from an initially wary, almost captive tool manipulated by Saw through equal parts fear and duplicity to a willing adherent of Saw’s vision. It climaxes in a wild moment to see on screen inStar Wars, where, having used Wilmon’s engineering knowhow to help steal a supply of volatile starship fuel, rhydonium, Saw invites the young man to join him in huffing the toxic vapors that make it so dangerous to handle in the first place. At first, Saw waxes lyrical about “rhydo,” as he almost lovingly calls it, a symbol for everything he idealizes about resistance to the Empire: it’s violently powerful, essential, a substance practically yearning to defy the hands of whoever seeks to control it, and reward that desire for control with painful, inevitable death. Up to this pointStar Wars‘ inherent need to other Saw’s stance in contrast to the heroes of the eventual Rebellion that we meet in the moviesâa canonical necessity to prove their way of resistance was ultimately the justified oneâhas previously been defined by presenting Saw as too distrusting, too unpredictable, too stubborn, even, no matter how valid his sentiments, to ever effectively lead a broader coalition against the Empire. But in this moment you really get to see the charisma that belies that prior framing of him, as we watch Wilmon go from abject horror at Saw to willingly joining him in inhaling the spoils of their victory. But what helps sell that cult of personality is that in this momentÂAndortreats Saw’s volatility not as a potential liability as it has been across his prior appearances sinceÂRogue One, but the inevitable conclusion of a life lived under the authoritarian jackboot of an organization like the Empire. Saw’s fuel-huffing is simultaneously presented as the actions of an unstable person and also the almost tragic extent of what he’s been pushed to by, at this point, decades of resistance against first Republic, and then Imperial, occupation of every part of his life. “You think I’m crazy? Yes, I am. Revolution is not for thesane,” Saw gasps to Wil as he coaxes the young man into breathing in the rhydonium, the substance that is both a death sentence and, as Saw has just evangelized to his latest follower, the symbol of everything resistance to the Empire should be. Saw has endured fighting to survive since he was a teenager, internment in labor camps, losing his family and his home, and exchanging it for a life where, as he describes to Wil, for his willing to fight back at any cost he is both hunted by his oppressors and left unloved by his would-be allies. In the face of that evil, what alternative is there for him than to lose his mind, to burn from the inside out, knowing his days in this fight are numbered whether he wants them to be or not? In that momentâreflected against the struggles hiscounterparts in Luthenand Mon inÂAndorhave faced asthey both reckonwith becoming part of a greater alliance against the EmpireâSaw is presented not as he has been while making valid points before, but unequivocally justified in his actions, even if the justification is a tragic one.Star WarsisÂStar Wars: even if we know Saw’s final fate, there’s still plenty of opportunities to return to his character in the run up to this moment. But hereÂAndorhas given us a Saw that is, chronologically speaking, on the edge of oblivion, pushed closer and closer to the end of those numbered days we see inÂRogue One. If this is to be the last time we really spend time with him before that closing chapter, then it’s only fitting that he is finally presented with justified vindicationâand allowed to burn as brightly as his beloved rhydo.

    "article_text": "It could be just a coincidence, or it could be a response tothat genuinely alarmingWeaponstrailerthat dropped earlier this week, but the creators ofBring Her Backare here in a new clip to tease audiences about their “harrowing, traumatic, and fun” film. Which 2025 horror movie will give you the most nightmares? It’s too early to tell, but this latest from the directors ofTalk to Medefinitely looks like a strong contender. Directors and twin brothers Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou (Danny also co-wrote with Bill Hinzman) have an infectious excitement aboutBring Her Back, especially its star Sally Hawkinsâwhose acclaimed and diverse filmography(The Shape of Water, Paddington)definitely doesn’t have “creepy foster mom trying to raise the dead” in it… yet. “We wanted to do something different fromTalk to Me,” Michael Philippou explains in the clip. “It’s still a horror film, but it’s more psychological.” Danny chimes in to call it a “psycho-biddy film,” which is excellent news for all the hagsploitation fans out there. (If that doesn’t ring any bells, stop what you’re doing and watchWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?right now.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Barratt, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips, Sally-Anne Upton, Stephen Phillips, and Mischa Heywoodâas well as, the Philippou brothers promise, frights, emotional moments, and “some fucked-up shit.” It hits theaters May 30.

    "title": "How Trump’s Proposed Budget Will Gut Public Health in America",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is hoping to take a sledgehammer to science and public health. In its new proposed budget released this week, the White House is pushing for sweeping cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other vital agencies. The White Houserevealedits budget proposal Friday. Some of the proposal’s lowlights include slashing the NIH and CDC’s budget by nearly 50%. While Congress is unlikely to pass all the cuts, passing just a few could destabilize the country’s public health programs and gravely set back scientific research. Trump’s proposed budget calls for a total of $163 billion to be cut in non-defense discretionary spending for the 2026 fiscal year, or about 22% from this year’s current budget. It specifically asks for $18 billion to be cut from the NIH (around 40% of its current $47 billion budget), $4 billion from the CDC (roughly 50%), and $4 billion from the National Science Foundation (55%). It’s also pushing for entire divisions within these agencies to be eliminated as a part of a supposed reorganization, including those related to mental health and gun violence prevention. At the same time, the administration is pushing to increase military spending by 13%, to $1.01 trillion. These proposals are also known as “skinny” budgets, since they don’t cover any single expenditure of the federal government. They’re often seen as symbolic, since it’s ultimately Congress that’s responsible for passing the federal budget. But that might not hold true this time. For one, Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress. And secondly, the Trump White House has already tried (pending legal challenges) to slash some of the science and public health funding earmarked by previous budgets, suggesting that it won’t be stymied so easily. The loss in knowledge, resources, and even potentially human lives that these cuts could create can’t be overstated. The NIH has long punched above its weight in driving major medical breakthroughs and treatments. A 2018 studyfound, for instance, that NIH-funded research had contributed to the development of every single new drug approved in the U.S. between 2010 and 2016. Another study in 2023foundthat the NIH had invested just as much per drug as the pharmaceutical industry on treatments approved between 2010 and 2019. These NIH-funded studies are predominantly basic research, meaning the sorts of early studies used to find or vet potential new drugs in the first place. One of many success stories that the NIH helped make possible? Thedevelopment of GLP-1 drugsthat eventually led to Ozempic. The CDC, meanwhile, is the backbone of the country’s public health system, helping support state and local health departments across the country. These departments rely on the CDC for comprehensive lab testing and other resources not available to them. Among many other functions, the CDC helps keep our cruise ships free of norovirus and other stomach bugsâor at least they did until Trump gutted the CDC’sentire full-time staff dedicatedto that program.Â The proposed budget cuts could also unravel the progress we’ve made against deadly public health crises likedrug overdoses,HIV/AIDS, andtuberculosis. Donât worry, thoughâthe Trump budget does propose $500 million for Make America Healthy Again (MAHA), the signature initiative of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Heâs pledged to tackle the root causes of chronic disease through the project. But in his short tenure so far, he’s overseenmassive funding and job cutsthroughout the Department of Health and Human Services, and some of the cuts proposed by the Trump budget would directly target programs related to heart disease and other chronic ailments. RFK Jr. has also regularly spouted misinformation about vaccine safety and autism. Not to mention, he’s a big believer ofchemtrailsâarguably one of the dumbest conspiracy theories out thereâand recently said heâd appoint someone to investigate the sinister force he believes is behind them. The Trump administrationâs current and proposed budget cuts threaten everything from thequality of our milkto the vaccines thatprevent once-eradicated diseases like measles from returning.Â And the effects of this drain will be felt both now and long into the future.

    "title": "Disney Says It Made Its Walt Disney Robot to Remind Fans He Was an Actual Person",
    "article_text": "WhenDisneylandturns 70 this July, Main Street’s Opera House will play host to the return of Walt Disney, who will sit down with audiences to tell his story in robot form. The response to the announcement atD23 Expo 2024thatWalt Disney Imagineeringwas working on a way to bring an animatronic, lifelike Walt into the parks to greet guests inWalt Disney – A Magical Lifehas been mixed, even among members of the Disney family. At the expo Disneyâs grandnephew, Roy P. Disney, was present in support of the announcement. Meanwhile Walt’s granddaughter Johanna Miller wrote aFacebook poststressing that he would not have wanted to be turned into an animatronic: “The idea of a Robotic Grampa to give the public a feeling of who the living man was just makes no sense. It would be an imposter.” TheLA Times recently reported on the discourseafter previewing some of the show’s concepts without the animatronic present. Disney Imagineering’s Tom Fitzgerald posits that the choice to create the animatronic falls in line with Walt’s initiative to always be progressing with the tools at Disney’s disposal. “His life story had been told in these other formats already,” Fitzgerald told the LA Times. “What could we do at Disneyland for our audience that would be part of our tool kit vernacular but that would bring Walt to life in a way that you could only experience at the park? We felt the technology had gotten there. We felt there was a need to tell that story in a fresh way.” Among the supporters are Kirsten Komoroske, the executive director of the Walt Disney Family Museum, who shared that the organization has conferred with other members of the Disney family on the concept. “They really feel that he would have liked this project,” she said. She also said there was no documentation to Miller’s claim that Walt would have stood against it. “We know that itâs anecdotal and we canât speak to what was told to people in private and we canât speak to Joannaâs specific feelings about the project. But we have worked very diligently for many years with the Walt Disney Family Museum and members of the Disney and Miller family. … Weâve taken care to make sure that the family is along the journey with us and we feel that weâve presented a faithful and theatrical presentation that keeps Walt alive in the medium that he pioneered.” When asked why the Walt animatronic was happening now, Fitzgerald explained, âFor two reasons. One is Disneylandâs 70th anniversary is an ideal time we thought to create a permanent tribute to Walt Disney in the Opera House. The other: I grew up watching Walt Disney on television. I guess Iâm the old man. He came into our living room every week and chatted and it was very casual and you felt like you knew the man. But a lot of people today donât know Walt Disney was an individual. They think Walt Disney is a company.â Now Disney fans of all ages can meet Walt Disney, the robot, this summer.

    "title": "NASA’s SPHEREx Telescope Just Switched On. Time to Map the Entire Universe in 3D",
    "article_text": "NASAâs newest eye on the cosmos is officially open for business, commencing its regular science operations this week with the main charge of mapping the universe. After a six-week calibration period, NASA’s Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorerâmercifully shortened to SPHERExâhas begun its two-year mission to build an ultra-detailed, full-sky map of the universe. Launched in early Marchafter some delay, the space observatory is now snapping 3,600 infrared images per day, collecting light at wavelengths that humans canât see that contains evidence of cosmic objects and events dating back to the dawn of the universe. Unlike some telescopes that peer into a specific patch of sky, SPHEREx will observe the entire celestial sphere, completing a sweep of it every six months. SPHEREx orbits Earth roughly 14 times a day, each time scanning a fresh strip of our Milky Way and beyond. SPHEREx takes in light with six detectors that split light into 102 infrared colors, which the mission will use to make over 9 million observations of interstellar clouds in our own galaxy over the course of its lifetime. With these infrared images, scientists aim to answer some massive questionsâlike how the universe expanded a trillion-trillionfold in the first instances after the Big Bang. SPHEREx will look for the faint fingerprints of that wild expansion hidden in the positions of galaxies across the sky. âWeâre going to study what happened on the smallest size scales in the universeâs earliest moments by looking at the modern universe on the largest scales,â said Jim Fanson, the missionâs project manager at NASAâs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a NASArelease. âI think thereâs a poetic arc to that.â But thatâs not all. Using a technique called spectroscopy, SPHEREx can break down the light from distant galaxies, star-forming clouds, and dusty regions of the Milky Way to reveal what they’re made ofâshedding light on how essential ingredients for life, like water and organic molecules, spread throughout the universe. âThe performance of the instrument is as good as we hoped,â said principal investigator Jamie Bock, in the same release. âThat means weâre going to be able to do all the amazing science we planned on and perhaps even get some unexpected discoveries.â SPHEREx will be the first mission to map the sky in so many colors. Over the course of its two-year mission, the hundreds of thousands of images the mission takes will be woven together into four all-sky maps, which could help researchers understand the origins and evolution of the universe.

    "title": "Trump’s Proposed NASA Budget Could Torch the Agency’s Boldest Missions",
    "article_text": "The U.S. administration is proposing a $6 billion cut to NASA’s budget for next year, axing cornerstones of the agency’s Moon program and its ambitious plan to return rocky samples from Mars. President Donald Trump’s administrationreleaseda so-called skinny budget on Friday, outlining the proposed funding for NASA’s 2026 fiscal year. The proposed budget highlights the administration’s “objectives of returning to the Moon before China and putting a man on Mars.” It would thereby phase out NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its Orion capsule, replacing them with commercial substitutes, and terminate the agency’s Lunar Gatewayâan in-the-works space station that would be the first to orbit the Moon. The budget would also axe NASA’s Mars Sample Return in an effort to “terminate unaffordable missions.” NASA has taken a lot of heat for its massive, fully expendable Moon rocket, pouring billions into SLS beforeadmitting that it’s ultimately unaffordable. The 5.75-million-pound rocket was built using components from NASA’s Space Shuttle program, which ran from 1981 to 2011. It’s a capable, heavy-lift rocket that, unfortunately, has cost a fortune. SLS has alreadygone $6 billion over budget, with the projected cost of each SLS rocket being $144 million more than anticipated. That would increase the overall cost of a single Artemis launch to at least $4.2 billion, according to areportreleased in May by the office of NASAâs inspector general. Trump’s close ally, rocket billionaire Elon Musk, hasspoken outagainst the use of SLS for upcoming Artemis missions, criticizing the concept for its complete lack of reusability. Jared Isaacman, Trump’s nominee for NASA administrator, is also not a fan of SLS,referringto it as “outrageously expensive.” “The Budget funds a program to replace SLS and Orion flights to the Moon with more cost-effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,” the budget proposal reads. The rocket that’s the closest to being fit for the job will likely be SpaceX’s Starship. The Orion capsule completed an uncrewed trip to the Moon and back in November 2022 for NASA’s Artemis 1 mission, and is expected to carry a crew in April 2026 for Artemis 2. Despite someissues with the capsule’s heat shield and hatch, it performed well during its first go. The budget proposal, however, suggests that Orion will be replaced after Artemis 3. Although Artemis was conceived during Trump’s first term to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo, the program is being torn apart by the administration’s first proposed budget. Another likely sacrifice from the Artemis program is theLunar Gateway, a space station designed to orbit the Moon and support ongoing missions through scientific research. The proposed budget is a 24% cut from NASA’s current $24.8 billion budget for the year 2025. The majority of the space agency’s programs will suffer budget cuts save for NASA’s human space exploration budget, which received an additional $647 million compared to the 2025 budget as the administration remains hyper-focused on returning to the Moon and landing astronauts on Mars. Trump’s administration allocated more than $7 billion toward lunar exploration and an additional $1 billion in new investment for programs focused on Mars. Mars Sample Return (MSR), NASA’s elaborate plan to return samples from the Red Planet, wasn’t so lucky. The budget proposal referred to the mission as “grossly overbudget and whose goals would be achieved by human missions to Mars.” NASA has been struggling to figure out a way to make MSR work, but the mission has suffered from cost overruns and scheduling delays. The mission was originally capped at a $7 billion budget to return the samples in the 2030s. It was later revealed, however, that MSR requires an $11 billion budget, with an estimate of returning the samples by 2040. In light of areportreleased in 2023, NASA beganconsidering an alternative architecture for its complex missionbut the agency has yet to come up with a solid plan for MSR. The budget also proposes reducing the crew size aboard the International Space Station (ISS) ahead of its planned retirement in 2030, when itâs expected to be replaced by a commercial space station, and possibly multiple commercial space stations. “Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced,” the budget proposal read. “The stationâs reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs.” NASA has been anticipating severe budget cuts under Trump, and the suggested allocation of funds has placed so many of the agency’s critical programs on the cutting board, wasting years of research and funding and opting for a commercial alternative instead.

    "article_text": "This week’s rivetingAndorepisode arccame at quite the cost during the Ghorman armory heist. While rebel leaders and lovers Vel and Cinta were sent to aid the inexperienced Ghorman resistance, clashes were had and accidents well…happened. Actress Varada Sethu (Doctor Who), who played Cinta discussedher tragic fatewith Variety.Â “My belief was that Cinta was always going to die in the rebellion.” she said of the moment an an eager young rebel accidentally shot her, which was a shocking surprise to see her go out on. “I couldnât really see someone like her outliving a rebellion. Itâs just so horrific, but I just felt it was so brave and unapologetic and thatâs what makesAndorandRogue Onedifferent from the otherStar Warsshows and films. Itâs the stories about the grassroots people. Itâs not actually about the heroes. Weâre not looking at a Skywalker that can do mind tricks. These are the people who have to spill blood to lay the groundwork for someone greater to emerge.” Sethu continued to explain why Cinta’s death made sense,”Sheâs been used as a weapon by the rebellion. Sheâs the assassin, the one whoâs constantly in a fight-to-the-death mode. Vel is used as a spy, and obviously sheâs put in life-threatening situations, but Cinta is the one who wields the blade or the gun. Sheâs the one who people see in the last moments of their life. Who knows how many people sheâs killed. When youâre in that position time and time again, I think the probability of you being on the receiving end of that is a lot higher.” The character who was a main feature onAndorSeason one split off from the group after the Aldhani mission, which set the stage for the troubles with the foundation Mon began that her friend Tay so slimily and his course to meeting Cinta. The moment at the end of the first arc, when we see Cinta again picking up Tay, is chilling and exciting. The big moment is one the actress and her scene partner know must have gone badly for one of them while Mon danced the night away.Â “Ben Miles, who plays Tay Kolma, and I were both talking about this because obviously itâs not the script. So we were like, ‘What do you think happens?’ And Ben was like, ‘Oh, itâs never a good thing if we come across you, though, is it?’ I love that itâs this unspoken thing. Itâs like seeing death when she turns up. Iâm just short of having a scythe.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "A Middle Eastern Firm Is Making a $2 Billion Investment Using Trump’s Crypto",
    "article_text": "The Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial announced Thursday that itsstablecoinwill be used to complete a $2 billion transaction between MGX, an investment firm owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, and cryptocurrency exchange Binance. You really can’t even begin to count just how many conflicts of interest are taking place in the above sentence, but we’ll try. Let’s start with the announcement, which took place atToken2049, a massive cryptocurrency conference held in the United Arab Emirates. The announcement was made on stage Thursday by Zach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of World Liberty Financial, alongside Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. Witkoff is the son of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff, who happens to currently serve as the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East. So far, we’ve got the sons of the President of the United States and the son of a federal representative announcing a business deal on stage in a region that is anessential trade partner. As for what was announced: State-owned investment fund MGX, established last year by the government of Abu Dhabi to back artificial intelligence projects, will invest $2 billion worth of stablecoins into cryptocurrency exchange Binance. They will be usingWorld Liberty Financial’srecently launched stablecoin, USD1, to complete this transaction. The web is about to get much more tangled, but here we go: MGX is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the National Security Advisor for the country.According to the New York Times, Tahnoon was in the United States meeting with President Trump and his cabinet. In April, Eric Trumpannouncedthat the Trump Organization has agreed to build an 80-story Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, part of the UAE. Meanwhile, President Trump plans to visit the region in the coming weeks and is reportedly currently weighing the possibility of a deal that would ease restrictions on Nvidia selling to the UAE,per Bloomberg. As for the Binance of it all, the cryptocurrency exchange has been scrutinized by US regulators since 2023, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the company and founder Changpeng Zhao of artificially inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, and misleading investors. The agency’s ongoing civil lawsuit against Binance wasput on hold in February, after Trump took office and pledged to ease up on regulations on cryptocurrency. Oh, and here’s one more conflict of interest, just for the hell of it: Also on stage when Witkoff and Eric Trump during the announcement of the transaction was Justin Sun, the founder of crypto platform TRON, which received scrutiny from the SEC forallegedly manipulating the price of the cryptocurrency. Sun bought $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial’s cryptocurrency token, $WLFI, after the 2024 presidential election, and Trump subsequentlyasked for the SEC’s case against Sun to be pausedonce he took office.According to the Times, Witkoff told Sun on stage, âTRON is just an incredible technology, and weâre lucky to be partners with you.â You gotta hand it to Trump and company here. This deal is absolutely air-tight, in that there is not a single aspect of it that is not deeply compromised in some way. That level of corruption really takes work, but they’ve done it.

    "title": "Thunderbolts‘ ‘Big’ Death Is So Obvious and Pointless",
    "article_text": "You know the old proverb: if you get a ragtag group of misfits together, someone’s gotta die. That’s exactly what happens inThunderbolts,but don’t bother trying to guess which character bites it. It’s been clear for so long, the whole ordeal just ends up being insulting. About half an hour intoÂThunderbolts,during its much marketed four-way fight betweenfour of its antiheroes, Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) kills Taskmster (Olga Kurylenko) by shooting her right in the face. It’s one of the worst-kept secrets of this movie, possibly of the MCU’s Multiverse Saga. For months, fans have speculated the once-mind controlled assassin would be the one to shuffle off this mortal coil. When it can be bothered to feature her, marketing has only shown her in the brawl between her, Ghost, Yelena (Florence Pugh), and John Walker (Wyatt Russell);postersnearly crop her out of the group shots or don’t give her the decency of showing her face, as is the case with John and Ghost. If that weren’t clear enough, she wasn’t listed among the cast beingchaired overfrom this movie toAvengers: Doomsday. The MCU’s Taskmaster thatfirst debuted inBlack Widowwasn’t a one-to-one adaptation of Tony Masters, first created in the comics by David Micheline and George Perez in 1980. That the film kept the character’s photographic reflex powers but otherwise rewrote the snarky mercenary into Antonia Dreykov, daughter of the Red Room’s creator who was mind-controlled by her father after Natasha bombed them both in Budapest, was a neat (if semi-predictable) reveal that came too late in the film to breathe like the “Bucky was Winter Soldier” twist it was trying to evoke. But Antonia wasn’t Masters, which rankled longtime fans of the comics version and earned her the title of one of the MCU’s worst character adaptations to date. (For this to stick, pretend this franchise has perfectly brought every other character to life and not twisted and reshaped them for their own ends, up to and including several of Taskmaster’sThunderboltsÂcostars.) Still, that she left the film flying off to safety with Yelena and the other saved Widows left the door open for her to return, potentially more similar to her comic book counterpart. Pairing her with Yelena again and the similarly mind-controlled Bucky could’ve provided some interesting character work too, right? Yeah, no.ÂThunderboltsÂonly has Antonia on hand to get got, and it’s the most egregious case of bad booking in MCU history. After unmasking to tell Yelena they’ve no beef with each other, she gets utterly worked over by Ghost and Walker and not given a fighting chance. It’s made worse when they proceed to loot her corpse for gear and not actually use what they stole all that much, and all she gets is some musings from Yelena later on about the “rough life” she had. It’s an unsatisfying, somewhat mean-spirited end to a character that had room for improvement and also undercuts the film’s central thesis. This movie asks if its assembled baddies are worthy of second chances, but doesn’t even pretend to offer that question toward one of the biggest victims in the semi-grounded corner of the MCU. Going by the film’s throughline, Taskmaster ultimately died because having her around too long would’ve undercut Yelena’s arc about her own dark past when someone she helped save was throwing a shield and firing arrows not six feet away from her. And that just sucks, because it feels like a return to old habits. Disposable villains used to be one of Marvel’s greatest weaknesses, but over time, the villains started gettingsome more meatthanks to good acting and taking the time toinvest in them. ThunderboltsÂwas announced back in2022, at a time where the MCU was bringing back the villains it hadn’t killed off through projects likeShe-HulkÂandÂShang-Chi.ÂNot every decision has been a winner, but these returns have provided some extra color to its villain roster. It’s one thing to make a sensible pivot from one baddie to a more prominent one, and another to just kill someone for the sake of it. Well, RIP Antonia “Taskmaster” Dreykov (2021-2024).

    "title": "Murderbot‘s Main Character Is Both Killing Machine and Sci-Fi Nerd",
    "article_text": "Murderbotcreators, writers, directors, and executive producers (and brothers) Chris and Paul Weitz are huge fans of theMartha WellsMurderbot Diariesbooks, and they approachedtheir Apple TV+ seriesfrom the same perspective. Sci-fi fans like what they like, including the show’s main character, played by Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd: a Security Unit that’s hacked its own system, gained free will, and discovered the wild world of trashy TV. Its favorite show isThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a soapy space opera that most of the other characters disdain but Murderbot considers to be “premium entertainment.” And it would know: by the time we meet it onMurderbot, it’s consumedthousandsof hours of entertainment programming. It enjoys the show, butSanctuary Moonproves to be surprisingly influential, too, giving SecUnit much-needed inspiration when it needs it the most. “We loved the books. We wanted to treat this as if the character really existed,” Paul Weitz told io9 at a recentMurderbotpress day. “So because Murderbot is so obsessed with it, [Sanctuary Moonand the other media was] something that we could do in the show that was true, we felt. And every step of the way, we were checking in with Martha Wells, showing her visuals, sending her scripts. So we knew that she was going to get a kick out of it as well. But we wanted to see what Murderbot was into.” He continued. “Also, we love the idea that other people are disrespectful of what Murderbot is into, but that it sticks to its guns through the end. It’s having this big adventure. It’s having to sort of be in an action sci-fi show, but it does just want to watch [Sanctuary Moon]. So we thought it was really important to check in with it.” As for creatingThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moonas a show within the show, the team aimed to do the exact opposite ofMurderbotitself: it’s bright, it’s corny, and it’s full of familiar faces giving deliberately over-the-top performances. “In terms of the texture of the show itself, we would put every kind of maximalist instinct that we had, which wasn’t appropriate forMurderbot,intoSanctuary Moon,” Chris Weitz said.“So the colors are amped up. It’s shot on a virtual stage as opposed to in actual locations, which was the rule for the on-planet scenes inMurderbot. We were also dialing up friends of ours, especially ones who had experience in big franchises, because there’s something about fandom as well that we were sort of playing on.” “So John [Cho] being inStar Trekand Clark Gregg from the MCU and DeWanda [Wise] having been in theJurassic Worldfranchise, as well as the weird kind of meta friendship of Jack McBrayer and [Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd]âit’s a real friendship. It’s just there’s a kind of a meta aspect to it. So it was a fun repository for all of those strange notions.” Murderbot‘s first two episodes arrive May 16 on Apple TV+. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Trump Issues New Executive Order to Eliminate Federal Funding for NPR and PBS",
    "article_text": "During his second campaign trail, Donald Trump threatened to continue his war against the media (or, as he fondly calls us, “the enemy of the American people”). Although Trump is barely over 100 days into his second term, he’s fulfilled those promises. Now,Trump is attacking public media by eliminating federal funding for NPR and PBS, which will impact hundreds of local stations across the country. On Thursday, Trump signed anexecutive orderdirecting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease funding for NPR and PBS, whom hepreviously describedas “radical left ‘monsters'”. According to the order, “Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.” Naturally, the White House was much less delicate in its messaging. In a Fridaystatement, the White House claimed that both organizations “receive tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds each year to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news’.” The White House’s examples includedNPR’s apologyfor describing people as “illegal”, aPBS documentary on reparations, and both organizations’ content on transgender communities. The CPB is a private, nonprofit corporation that was authorized by Congress in 1967 withthe Public Broadcasting Act. Under this law, CPB is not to be “an agency or establishment of the United States Government” and is meant to protect the “maximum freedom” of public media from “extraneous interference and control.” In astatement, Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS, said that Trump’s “blatantly unlawful” order “threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming.” Similarly, Kate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations,saidthat Trump’s order “would devastate the public safety, educational, and local service missions of public media”. Per the Washington Post, the CPB receivesabout $535 millionper fiscal year. It distributes funding through grants to over 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations with a focus on funding content for underserved audiences. When it comes to CPB-funded programming, you may first think of iconic shows like Sesame Street or Between the Lions. But as Riley outlined, CPB funding also allows for public safety services like the PBS Warn System. She warned, “These restrictions would be particularly damaging to local stations serving smaller, more rural communities.” In its first 100 days, the Trump administration has utilized a range of tactics totarget and suppress the media. For example, the administration is currently engaged in a legal battle with Associated Press reporters after blocking them from covering White House events. Why? Because the AP wouldn’t call the Gulf of Mexico by the administration’s preferred name: “Gulf of America”. Per NBC News, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expressioncondemnedit as a clear attack on press freedom, writing, “The role of the press is to hold those in power accountable, not to act as their mouthpiece.” Earlier this week, the Committee to Protect Journalistsreleased a reporton how the Trump administration is “chipping away” at press freedom. Although CPJ usually waits a year to evaluate an administration’s impact on the press, Trump’s actions warranted an exception. Along with trying to exercise control over CPB’s funding,Trump tried removing three of its board members, including two Biden appointees, this week. Under law, the president has the power to appoint board members in consultation with Senate leaders from both parties. However, he doesn’t have the authority to remove them. The CPB sued in response, and, similarly, it will likely oppose Trump’s executive order. “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,” President and CEO Patricia Harrisonsaidin a statement. “In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.” The order can be challenged in court. But as Georgetown law professor Stephen Vladeckwarned, winning these lawsuits isn’t the point. And, obviously, neither is creating legislation within the scope of the law. Instead, Vladeck said the Trump administration’s actions are “designed to intimidate, to chill, to shift the conversation, to consume the oxygen.” Trump’s attacks on journalism can’t be read separately from other attempts to expand his administration’s power. From DOGE’s plans tosilo datafrom various federal agencies into a master database toTrump bringing independent agencies further under control, it ties together.

    "title": "Trump Says ‘Internet People’ Are ‘Kissing My Ass’ in Bizarre School Speech",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump gave a speech to 2025 graduates of the University of Alabama on Thursday night, where he rambled about tariffs, the so-called “golden age” of America, and trans athletes. But it was Trump’s comments about tech CEOs that really shone. You see, Trump knows that all of the “internet people,” as he called them, hated the president during his first term. But thanks to Trump’s consolidation of power, they’re all bowing down. Trump told the graduates that in order to succeed, you have to “take certain risks” and do things “a bit differently.” Then thepresident saidthat it was important to “fix the broken system” before pivoting in a way that made it clear he was actually speaking about breaking the system entirelyâsomething that he’s currently doing with the help of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump argued, “If you want to go to the top, you’re just never going to do it unless you break the system.” “You have to break the system a little bit and follow your own instincts,” said Trump. “But if your vision is right, nothing will hold you down. Nothing. You have to have the right vision.” That’s when Trump got into the way that he had successfully broken the system by making tech CEOs fall in line. Many tech companies and CEOs donated to Trump’s inauguration,shelling outbig in one of the most nakedly corrupt attempts to buy a president’s favor in recent memory. Apple’s Tim Cook, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman were just a few of the tech leaders who each gave Trump $1 million, to say nothing of the quarter of a billion dollars Musk gave to help get the fascist president back into office. “If you look at some of these internet people, I know so many of them. Elon is so terrific. But I know now all of them, you know, they all hated me in my first term. And now they’re kissing my ass.” The internet people are indeed kissing his ass. And many of them are seeing the returns. Musk, for example, has been given unprecedented access to the federal government, destroying anything he likes on a whim and getting a unique view into sensitive information that would give the oligarch a huge advantage as a federal contractor. Musk’s companies, like SpaceX, make boatloads of money from the government, and that’s only going to accelerate as Republicans push through a new spending bill that’s bound to help Musk. President Trump’s latest budget proposal includes things like the “Golden Dome,” a missile defense platform that will deliver enormous revenue to SpaceX, according to theNew York Times. And you’ll notice that in all of DOGE’s supposed cost-cutting, not a single contract for SpaceX has been on the chopping block. What are the odds, right? The rest of Trump’s speech was filled with the kinds of things he says every day, along with some elements from the campaign speeches he would give in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. For instance, Trump demonized trans athletes and trotted out a cartoonish impersonation of weightlifters he’d done many times before. The president also mentioned that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, didn’t like it when he told the story, a fact he also mentioned many times at his hate-filled campaign rallies. Trump also touched on his tariffs, which are currently causing chaos in the global economy. The president slapped a 145% tariff on all goods coming from China, which means ships that would normally be sending goods to the U.S. right now simply aren’t coming, according to theWall Street Journal. “I said, you know, a number of times, ‘tariff’ is the most beautiful word in the world. And I got absolutely decimated by the fake news,” Trump told the University of Alabama graduates. “They said, ‘What about love? What about your wife? What about your parents? What about religion and God?’ So I said, ‘All right, it’s the fifth nicest word I’ve ever seen.'” There’s no evidence anyone in the news media took issue with Trump calling tariffs the most beautiful word in the world. The issue is that tariffs have the potential to cripple the economy and make things much more expensive for Americans. But Trump will often create stories from whole cloth that he thinks will make his speeches more entertaining. He’s also come to understand that dropping in some curse words here and there can play well, enough if a couple of decades ago that would’ve been considered beyond the pale for a U.S. president. It would’ve been notable if President Barack Obama said something like “kissing my ass” during a speech to a bunch of college kids. Today, it doesn’t even seem remarkable. Trump’s use of profanity isn’t new, and is really the least objectionable thing about the man, but it is particularly funny that Fox News has been leaning into the idea recently that Democrats are using curse words too much. Friday morning, Fox did yet another segment about how the Democratic Partyhad becomethe “party of profanity.” But the profanity doesn’t really matter at the end of the day. The thing that matters is the fact that Trump continues to destroy the U.S. government with the help of oligarchs and teenagers namedBig Balls. And it doesn’t seem like the U.S. system is prepared to stop them. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

If passed, the White House's budget will slow down medical research and worsen public health problems like the drug overdose crisis. The Trump family keeps cashing in. There's no reason to believe anything these guys say. The billionaire ripped into a recent report that claimed his company wants him gone. \"Are you ready for this, media?\" the attorney general asked, but what followed was a heaping pile of horsecrap about a very serious subject.

If you spend any time in the kitchen, whether you’re trying to bake a cake from scratch or microwaving yesterday’s meals, you’ve probably thought about buying a mixer. There are tons of uses for one, of course, but it can be expensive to invest in. Itâs one of those rare appliances that if you do one, it’ll stand the test of time. But for many, it can be something that you just can’t justify spending a ton of money on. Luckily, you can grab the KitchenAid Classic Series mixer for just $250 right now at Amazon, down from its usual price of $350. That’s $100 off and a discount of 29%. That’s an extremely low price for one of KitchenAid’s best appliances, plus you can use it for things beyond confections and soups or sauces. See at Amazon This mixer comes with a 4.5-quart stainless steel bowl, which is large enough to mix up dough for several loaves of bread or batches of cookies. Or whatever you want to end up making, really. It has a tilt-head design to make it easier to add ingredients while youâre mixing, and it locks in place so everything stays secure as the motor does its thing. You get 10 speed settings, which gives you better control over whatever youâre making. It also comes with the three additional accessories: a coated flat beater, a dough hook, and a six-wire whip. Thatâs everything you need to get started baking right out of the box. Of course, you probably won’t know much about all that if you’re a beginner, but you’ll be glad it’s all there when you do. There’s a lot you’ll be able to do with your mixer when you learn. If you’re a seasoned professional when it comes to mixers, however, you’ll be interested to know that the the power hub on the front of the mixer lets you attach more than 10 different accessories that you can buy, like a pasta maker, meat grinder, and spiralizer. So even though it starts as a mixer, it can grow with you should you decide to learn more about cooking in general. And if not, you can just consider that part of the mixer an additional storage space. f youâve been waiting for the right moment to bring a KitchenAid mixer home, this is it.Getting $100 off to make it just $250 is one great reason to pull the trigger.

    "title": "GTA VI Delay to 2026 Is Really an Interlude for $100 Games",
    "article_text": "Grand Theft Auto VIis no longer coming in 2025. If you hoped to return to the neon-streaked streets of Vice City, developer Rockstarsaid Fridayyouâll need to wait until May 26, 2026. Itâs an expensive game to make, and the people making the next GTA said they need more time. Thatâs fine with us, because we probably couldnât stomach yet another price hike in a year that has already proved gaming will keep getting more and more expensive. âWe are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team,â Rockstar wrote on its website. âWith every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, andGrand Theft Auto VIis no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.â Last December, theFinancial Timescited industry analysts DFC Intelligence, who said thatGTA VIâs development costs could be as high as $2 billion, though more conservative estimates put it in the high hundreds of millions. It could be the most expensive game ever produced, but thatâs dwarfed by supposed sales estimates of at least $1 billion in preorders alone before release. The total revenue in the first 12 months could be as high as $3.2 billion, according to analysts. Which is why other industry experts have been so adamant that the nextGrand Theft Autocould cost more than practically any other game at launch in gamingâs history. In January, Matthew Ball of Epyllion wrote in his 229-slidepresentationon the state of video games that the industry is praying Rockstar and publisher Take-Two Interactive setGTA VIâs price at $100. Gizmodo spoke to one analyst whocame to the same conclusionafter having conversations with Take-Twoâs CEO Strauss Zelnick. We should note that Take-Two has not offered any hint at how muchGTA VIwill costÂ . Rockstar might offer other buying incentives for prospective players to buy the game on day one, such as extra money to use in a new version ofGTA Onlineor promises of free content updates. Players who are already steaming about DLC pricing and live service model games probably wonât find that as much of a boon as Take-Two would. No matter what, the $100 hump would be a major milestone for the entire games industry. If it sells wellâthere’s no reason to believe it won’t even with a higher sticker priceâit will tell publishers from all ends of the games industry that players are willing to drop a Benjamin on the games they want to play. Two of the largest video game publishers, Nintendo and Microsoft, already burst the bubble of the $80 game standard.Nintendoâs Switch 2 handheld will demand$70 for a game likeDonkey Kong Bananzaand the Switch 2 version ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildâan 8-year-old game. Meanwhile,Mario Kart World,Kirby and the Forgotten Land, andMario Party Jamboreewill all cost $80 on Switch 2 pre-tax. This week,Microsoft updated its suggested pricingfor all of its Xbox hardware and then dropped the news that its first-party titles will start selling for $80 later this year. Players have not responded well to the new price of games, but themass numbers of Switch 2 preorderssuggest players arenât yet ready to quit gaming just because the latest titles cost $10 or $20 more than theyâre used to. In that way,GTA VIâs new 2026 release date is a reprieve. Take-Two is simply giving players more time to adapt to the new normal before hitting us with yet one more hammer blow. GTA VIMicrosoftNintendoXbox Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

Get one now before tariffs make it impossible to get handhelds from Anbernic, Retroid, or Ayaneo. You won't just be haggling over Nintendo Switch 2âs $450 price tag or $80 games, but its limited storage space. Be careful: Cheaper Switch 2 gear like the new GameCube controller or Hori's third-party cameras may not work exactly as you think. There's a good reason you should keep Recall toggled off. GameStop's Switch 2 preorders page shows the console is now sold out, though you should check your orders page in case you got lucky.

    "article_text": "No offers found Luke Dale, the voice of Hans Capon, is thrilled that GTA 6 won't be out until 2026, and for a pretty good reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The big news of the day is, without question, theGrand Theft Auto 6 delayfrom fall 2025 to May 26, 2026. Despite the reassuring words of Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, who said the company is still going to make a great many truckloads of money this year, just about everybody was unhappy to hear the news: Gamers, analysts, Take-Two shareholders, and PC Gamer senior editor Rich Stanton are all taking it quite poorly. In fact, I'd go so far as to say pretty much everyone is unhappy about it—except for, as noticed byGamesRadar, one guy. And that one guy, well, he'sthrilled. That might seem a little oddly celebratory at first glance, but he's got cause. Luke Dale is the actor who portrays Henry's nobleman pal Hans Capon in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and that game is one of the big releases of 2025—a critical and commercial hit that's going to be in the Game of the Year conversation in pretty much any year, except those years that see a new Grand Theft Auto drop. In those years, well, everyone else might as well just stay home. Just in case anyone was unclear about what his message meant, Dale followed it up with another point that was clearer on his aspirations: I have to imagine that Dale isn't alone in his excitement over the removal of 2025's one true juggernaut, although his is the only open expression of it I've seen on social media thus far. Of course, GTA 6 becomes a problem for 2026 now, but a problem delayed is a problem solved, right? For the record, because this is relevant to our interests, Grand Theft Auto 6 remains unannounced for PC, despite the newly added months of development time. That's got Rich worried that he won't be able to play ituntil 2027, or maybe even 2028. He is definitely not celebrating.

    "article_text": "No offers found Vasily's just a guy trying to get by. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mudrunner in the style of Disco Elysium is maybe not the most obvious videogame mashup imaginable, but that's pretty much what seems to be going on withZarya, an upcoming \"narrative simulator\" about a guy named Vasily who's just trying to earn a living and do the occasional solid for his friends in a deeply rural post-Soviet backwater. Zarya—not to be confused with the Overwatch character of the same name—has been listed on Steam for more than a year now, but it went completely under my radar until the recent release of a new gameplay trailer. The video doesn't do a great job of explaining what the game is about, but the vibe is impeccable: Driving rough, Soviet-era vehicles on roads that mostly exist as either distant memories or wishful thinking is clearly at the heart of the experience, but Vasily's also doing some grilling, he's going fishing, he's doing a little shopping, he's going for a sunset walk—the man seems to be living not a bad life, all in all. The Steam page gives off much the same impression: While your day job of running deliveries can make you \"an off-road legend,\" it's the underlying narrative that sounds more interesting to me. \"Dive into the stories of people living far from civilization. Assist the villagers with their challenging tasks. Grill kebabs with the guys in the garages, go fishing with Petrovich, take the harvest to the market, tow cars, and try not to end up in a pit, as the last time a tractor was seen in the village was 30 years ago. Enjoy a plethora of authentic post-Soviet 'clichés', from old cars to familiar childhood landscapes and the simple joys of life.\" Not a whole lot to go on there either, but again, thevibes—I dig them, and I want to know more. When that will happen is anyone's guess at this point, but there is an option to sign up for a playtest on Steam. Don't hold your breath waiting to get in anytime soon, though: The most recent update on that I can find was posted in September 2024, when developer SBSR said it was \"collecting applications\" but hadn't actually started sending out invites. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found You gotta consume art to make it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In April, I had a chance to ask lead Diablo 4 developers how tough it is for their dev teams tocontinue coming up with ominous namesfor gameplay activities when they've spent 30 years exhausting every thesaurus in the demonic lexicon. Their answer: Pretty tough. Last week, PC Gamer spoke to the lead artists in the Diablo franchise, and we took the opportunity to pitch a similar question. After designing thousands of barbed, demonic armor pieces, how do they stay inspired when they have to design new Diablo gear pieces and ghouls—whether forBerserk collaborationsor otherwise? \"What I encourage for the art team is to get out from Diablo once in a while,\" Diablo Immortal lead artist Emil Salim said. \"On the weekend, stop looking at Diablo imagery. Go to the museum, go to experience other things, go to Coachella, go look at various really different forms of art. That's where a lot of the original ideas come from.\" It's a common refrain among artists and creatives of all stripes. An artist who only ever ingests material from one mode or medium will, eventually, descend into stagnation. It's true across disciplines: If you want to write about videogames, for example, you'll write better if you're taking time for movies, books, music—anything that exposes you tootherideas that you can incorporate into your work. According to Salim, even the equally grim Berserk collaboration provided some useful variety for the Diablo Immortal team. \"Having this kind of collab really helped us in the art team, because visually, it gives us a refresh,\" Salim said. \"We have all of this visual library in our minds as artists right? Working on something different, like during a collab, really helped us reset that visual library. Now that we're done with the collab and moving back into our regular designs, it helps us come up with new ideas.\" Lead Diablo 4 artist Viviane Kosty echoed the sentiment. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Think about cooking, right? You eat your own food and then you go experience other cuisines in the world so that you can draw similarities and compare flavors, profiles, spices, and ingredients, and then you can come back with a fresh mind and create new things,\" Kosty said. \"Art is very similar to cooking and fashion and all other art forms out there. You should always know what you're making and what else other people are making, and that's how you can create.\" Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept.

A glorified boss rush? Some weird Fortnite-esque live-service Forever Game? Or is it an official replacement forElden Ring's seamless co-op mod? None of the above, really, and the latest trailer aims to dispel some of those myths and explain exactly what players are getting into through ten minutes of soothingly infomercial-esque narration.

While I regrettably missed out playing the network test myself, I got to watch friends streaming it, and I'm eager to give it a spin. I've also got dibs on either the bird-man Guardian (the archetypical greatshield defender class) or the Duchess (an all-or-nothing glass cannon combo fiend with an aesthetic straight out of Bloodborne), although I'm gravitating towards the former purely because of the Solaire alternate skin that they show off in the trailer. One thing that is relatively new in this trailer is the mention of personal quests for each of the playable characters. Talking with certain NPCs in the Roundtable Hold (your home between sorties) will unlock bonus objectives in the field which will build on theDeepest Loreof each hero. Probably not a major focus of the game, but it's nice to see a little bit of a narrative hook sprinkled in amongst the loot-hoarding, monster-mashing, semi-speedrunning combat. The last segment of the trailer is dedicated to the big Nightlord bosses, which you'll be throwing down with on the third day of each session. While some of them are immediately familiar to anyone that has survived Elden Ring (horrible cosmic skull-bug Astel is returning to thrash another round of asses), there's some interesting new faces in there. I'm a little perturbed by the giant goat-man shaman with far too many giant googly goat eyes, but I especially want to tussle with the chunky-looking one-armed centaur warlord. His moves remind me ofLudwigfrom Bloodborne. Elden Ring Nightreign launches at the end of the month—May 29th—withpre-orders open now on Steam. There's a £35/$40 regular edition and a £48/$55 deluxe version, which doubles as a preorder on some DLC coming further down the line, including \"additional playable characters and bosses\", hinting at a planned season pass kinda situation.

    "title": "Following its huge win over Apple, Epic says it will take even less money from developers who use its store",
    "article_text": "No offers found Epic is also launching new Webshops that will enable developers to bypass the \"exorbitant fees\" charged by Apple and Google. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Following itsmajor courtroom victory over Appleearlier this week, Epic Games has announced upcoming changes to the Epic Games Store aimed at enticing more developers to use it, and putting a little bit of a thumb in Apple's eye in the process. The first change is a reduction in the amount of money Epic takes from developers on its storefront. Epic currently takes 12% of revenues from sales on the storefront, significantly lower than most others: Steam, for instance, takes 30% on the first $10 million of revenues earned, 25% once the $10 million mark is surpassed, and 20% on anything beyond $50 million. Under the new scheme, Epic will take nothing on the first $1 million in revenues earned per app per year, after which its usual 12% cut will kick in. This is a pretty big deal for smaller, indie developers. Valvetook some heatwhen it adjusted its revenue share formula in 2018 because it clearly favored big publishers and major successes; Epic's shift comes at it from the other end, offering a boon to makers of games that aren't runaway hits. Along with the adjusted revenue split, Epic is also adding a new feature that will enable developers to launch their own \"webshops\" on the Epic Games Store. And why would they want to do that? \"These webshops can offer players out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees,\" Epic said. \"With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States.\" Epic Games Store will take 0% on the first $1,000,000 of payments we process per game per year (vs 15% for Apple), and 12% after that (vs 30% for Apple).Next month, we launch EGS Webshops for out-of-app purchases, as an alternative to in-app purchases.https://t.co/yTufyZbiqRMay 1, 2025 The issue of in-app purchases were at the center of the legal fight Epic picked with Apple five years ago: Epic decided it wasn't going to pay Apple's 30% cut on Fortnite purchases and added its own payment processing option to the Fortnite app, and Applereacted entirely predictably. Epic lost that battle, but five years and some unexpected twists later, it's finallywon itself a compromise: Apple has been told unequivocally that it can't stop iOS app developers from linking to out-of-app web payment forms, and can't charge commission fees on those out-of-app purchases. Now Epic is opening the door to all developers to sell their stuff without paying Apple's big fees. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To sweeten the pot further, any purchases made through Epic's webshops will earn 5% inEpic Rewards, which can be put toward other purchases on the Epic Store. It's not a huge amount, but if you're buying a bunch of stuff anyway and the choice is to get 5% or get nothing, well, that seems like pretty easy math to me. Epic's updated revenue share and webshops are both set to go live sometime in June.

    "title": "Grand Theft Auto 6's delay makes me think we won't be playing this thing on PC until 2027, or god forbid even 2028",
    "article_text": "No offers found So... GTA 7 in 2040? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today brought the bombshell news that Rockstar hasdelayed Grand Theft Auto 6 until May 2026, a pushback of approximately half a year on perhaps the most anticipated game the industry has ever seen. Some fans were inconsolable, Take-Two's shareholders needed the smelling salts, and my immediate reaction was, simply,god we won't be playing this thing on PC until 2027 at the earliest. Before the delay was announced, Take-Two had been saying Grand Theft Auto 6 was on-track for release in fall 2025. But ever since the first reveal it's refused to announce or even confirm a PC version. Grand Theft Auto 6 is confirmed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and nothing else. The gap between GTA 5 and GTA 6 also means that the gaming landscape itself has changed. PC has not traditionally been a priority for Rockstar: GTA 5 launched in September 2013 on consoles, but it wouldn't come to PC until April 2015. Even this was something of an industry hangover. As Rockstar North veteranObbe Vermeej put it: \"Initially the consoles were a much bigger market for a game like GTA. They just got into the habit of doing consoles first. There used to be way more money in the console versions. Now that that's changed, hopefully the PC version will be closer behind.\" Vermeej's explanation does make a lot of sense. GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas always felt like one of the major reasons to own a PlayStation 2, and two decades ago games were still mostly sold in boxes. But now PC is a much more dominant force and boasts an installed base of players that, frankly, no console could ever dream of: one recent estimate says there are908 million PC players. They might not all have a rig that can handle GTA 6, but plenty will. Even Take-Two head honcho Strauss Zelnick admits the winds have changed, and basically said the same as Vermeej. PC is a \"more important part of what used to be a console business\" not least because of ongoing elements like GTA Online still boasting \"enormous ongoing engagement.\" So at least we can confidently say that a PC version will happen: GTA 5 consistently remains one of Steam's most-played games, and thanks to having both a standard and premium edition is somehow in the global top 20 sellers list twice. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But Rockstar hasn't exactly rushed to take advantage of that. The expanded and enhanced version of GTA 5 was released for consoles in March 2022, but took fully three years to make its way over to PC. I've got two big concerns about GTA 6 coming to PC. The first is that Rockstar and Take-Two really can afford to take their sweet time on this: everyone knows it's going to be the biggest game on the planet from day one, and probably break every sales record going. If GTA 5 is any indication, it's also planned as a living experience that will last well over a decade. Which means that 26 May 2026 is the current release date, but don't go all surprised Pikachu if Rockstar decides it needs a little longer. The second is that, even if GTA 6 makes that date, Rockstar is being coy about a PC release for a reason, and that reason is probably that it doesn't even want to think about it until the console versions are in perfect shape. GTA 4 took a mere seven months to come to PC in 2008, but ever since then Rockstar's marquee titles have seen gaps of 13 months (Red Dead Redemption 2) and 19 months (GTA 5) before appearing on god's own platform. It's almost unimaginable but, if GTA 6 makes its new release date and that kind of form is maintained, we might not even be looking at 2027. It's not what anyone wants to hear, but something like a 19-month gap here would push GTA 6 PC into early 2028, almost three years out. Rockstar justdelays games a lot. PCG's EIC Phil Savage said around the time of GTA 6's reveal that he couldn't see the PC version \"stretching into 2027,\" but a year-and-a-half later it's looking like that might be optimistic and, right now, feels like the most likely scenario to me. This is Rockstar, and it does what it likes. At least when the PC version of GTA 6 does appear, it'll bethe best and shiniest versionof the game. But today, right now? That feels like very little consolation.

    "title": "The Breach update for No Rest for the Wicked is an overhaul so massive that old save files just won't cut it",
    "article_text": "No offers found Two new zones, a horrible plague to fight and a bunch of gribbly new bosses nearly double the game's scope. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. No Rest for the Wickedhas had a bumpy ride through early access so far. While I thought the initial release was an impressive overhead blend of Diablo-ish action RPG systems and Souls-like tropes, it was held back by performance issues and limited scope, and only saw one major update after release (the Crucible patch) before developer Moon Studios fell largely silent. I'm chalking most of that quiet spell up to behind-the-scenes shenanigans, as Moon Studios have now successfullyreclaimed the rights to the game from publisher Take-Two, making this a fully independent production. And now, in what feels like a publisher-free relaunch (and first anniversary celebration), No Rest for the Wicked has gone through a bit of a growth spurt, roughly doubling the size of its world and overhauling a lot of the underlying systems in what the studio are calling the Breach update. You cancheck out the (exhaustingly lengthy) full patch notes here, and get your first peek of the new stuff in the impressive trailer below. Be warned: You'll need to roll a new character to see all the new content, as changes have been made to the game from the very start. The heart of this new update is two new regions. One is a beautifully autumnal-looking zone with heavy yellow lighting and fields of sunflowers to fight through. The other is a dense, more vertically arranged forest zone filled with bird-people and other woodland beasties. There's also a new, smaller town that provides a rest-stop for players digging into the new regions. Old areas have also seen a lot of tweaks and improvements, and the new endgame Plague system provides extra incentives to retread old ground. That whole horrible curse-plague isn't just a plot beat now, but manifests in the world once you've finished up the new story content, turning chunks of the map a sickly purple, changing the look of the afflicted areas and populating them with tougher, mutated monsters. The plague can be pushed back by clearing out these new enemies, then beating up mutant variants of old bosses. And of course there's some loot in it for you too. One thing that hasn't changed about the game is just how gorgeous it all looks, especially in cutscenes. Moon Studios artists—forged in the fires of theOri series—continue to cook, as almost every shot looks like concept art come to life, and the new bosses shown in the trailer below look especially gnarly, with the plague-ridden enemies covered in all manner of horrible, jiggling growths.Blech. As big and impressive as this update was, the response from players has been pretty strongly negative. Despite the game now supporting the latest DLSS upscaling tech, those gorgeous graphics still come at a steep hardware cost and Steam Deck players report having a rough time still, no matter how much they upscale from a blurry low-fi image. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. More significantly, many were irritated by the update's high difficulty. No Rest for the Wicked wasn't easy to begin with, but a fresh wave of negative user reviews skewering it for its uncompromising challenge has led Moon Studios to roll outan emergency hotfixaddressing some of the criticisms. They've managed to squeeze out a little extra performance from some of the cinematics, but primarily this update is focused on turning down the heat, lowering the level ranges for earlier zones, increasing XP gain and vastly slashing the costs of upgrading and repairing gear. There's still a ways to go until No Rest for the Wicked is finished. The story still doesn't have an ending, and there's some major features planned but not yet implemented, such as full online co-op (and PvP), which is pencilled in for the full version. Still, if this update is any indication of what we can expect from here on, I've got high hopes for the game in its final form, even if it's going to thrash me six ways to Sunday. For those willing to suffer a little, there'sa respectable 30% discount available on Steam, taking a good chunk out of its usual £35/$40 price tag.

    "title": "Nvidia denies 'tall tales' that chips are being smuggled in fake baby bumps and alongside live lobsters",
    "article_text": "No offers found This is just weeks before the implementation of the AI Diffusion Rule. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia and AI firm Anthropic are currently embroiled in a back-and-forth around claims the former's chips are being smuggled into China, and the concerns that smuggling raises. Where Anthropic cites a systemic problem, Nvidia argues Anthropic is telling \"tall tales\". In arecent blog post, Anthropic warned of the 'major threat' that is chip smuggling. It claims China has \"established sophisticated smuggling operations, with documented cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of chips\". This leads Anthropic to argue that export enforcement needs increased funding, and that the tier system introduced in the 'AIDiffusion Rule' needs adjusting to allow tier 2 countries better access to technology, alongside more lenient rules for tier 2 countries. Effectively, the AI Diffusion Rule, which takes effect on May 15, would prioritise allies of America for the control of advanced AI chips, and any chips being smuggled into China would subvert the aims of that rule. For some context on those specific methods for smuggling, a woman was caught aftersmuggling 200 CPUs in a prosthetic bellyback in 2022. Then, in 2023, two men were found smuggling GPUs into Chinaalongside live lobsters. These aren't just random claims on behalf of Anthropic, it's citing previous cases of smuggling. Nvidia, however, toldCNBC, \"American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters\". Given the antagonism between America and China regarding advancement in AI (as shown by the likes ofDeepSeek), Anthropic, as an American AI company, has an investment in America being the dominant leader in AI growth. As cited at the bottom of Anthropic's blog post, Anthropic's leaders havepreviously arguedAmerica's \"shared security, prosperity and freedoms hang in the balance\", in regards to wider AI support and adoption. On the way to a recent White House event Jen-Hsun Huang has spoken about the need to \"accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world.\" That's Nvidia's CEO arguing for getting more 'American' AI chips out into different territories, which could kinda be on the same side of the argument as Anthropic. Especially as he also later stated that: \"China is right behind us,\" which is also seemingly leaning into that whole secure nationhood stuff, too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is one step in a large argument made by companies concerning their competition with China. Just a few months ago,OpenAI arguedit should be allowed to scrape copyrighted content as it would lose out to China otherwise. Anthropic, like many other major AI companies, is reliant on the hardware of Nvidia to operate in wider AI workloads. The examples it brings up are from chip smugglers in the last few years, but it doesn't argue that these specific examples are how smugglers are beating detection right now. In this sense, Anthropic is broadly gesturing at a perceived problem with smuggling to justify tightening restrictions and enforcement in light of the Diffusion Rule. Nvidia is hand-waving that concern with its response, but the incredulity in the messaging does seem a tad strange, given these were previously successful smuggling techniques, albeit not specifically of Nvidia products. Anthropic has not given any evidence of any relevant or ongoing smuggling techniques as of the time of writing.

    "title": "I feel like I can finally say we're at a point where buying new PC gaming gear doesn't mean settling for less",
    "article_text": "No offers found Poor quality products haven't disappeared, but gaming going mainstream has raised all boats. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week:I spent hours emptying my office to make room to build a new desk. Then I spent hours building said desk. Finally, I spent hours looking at the ruin wrought upon my apartment as my various office gubbins sit tucked into every nook and cranny, all the while putting off actually moving it all back into the office again. As I was sitting on the sofa with theLenovo Legion Go Srecently, I was struck by just how comfortable it is to use. Comfort is one of the main benefits of the handheld that I noted in my review, and it goes some way towards making up for its lacklustre power. In fact, the handheld is so comfortable that I pretty much exclusively use it instead of theoriginal Legion Go—I use the latter as a slightly cumbersome reading tablet, strange as it sounds. And it's not just ergonomic comfort that makes the Legion Go S great, either; it's also its satisfying clicks and springy triggers. Plus, I can't lie, it looks prettier too, in a minimalistic kind of way. After gaming on the Legion Go S, the next day I returned to my desk for work and started typing away on theKeychron Q5 HE. This is a Hall effect keyboard—a key switch technology that's primarily beneficial for gaming—and yet the main reason I keep it on my desk isn't because of this tech but simply because of how comfortable and satisfying it is to use. Seriously, my modded Varmilo keyboard is literally collecting dust because the key action on this Keychron gaming keyboard is just. So. Satisfying. This is what I'd always wanted from my PC gaming gear, but I feel like I've only recently been able to say: Yes, PC gaming gear is high-quality and comfortable, and we're not really missing out on anything by using it. And that's partially because the line between gaming and non-gaming gear is becoming blurred. I can't help but contrast this with when I first started PC gaming almost 20 years ago. I remember picking up the first Razer BlackWidow keyboard in 2010 or 2011, and I wassoimpressed with it, mainly because mechanical keyboards weren't so common back then and it was my first go with one. But objectively, the original BlackWidow doesn't hold a candle to what you can get today. It had flimsy and somewhat rattly keycaps, basic (non-lubed and scratchy) Cherry MX Blue switches, and less than ideal sound dampening (if any was present at all—I can't remember because I don't think I even knew about keyboard sound dampening, at the time). It was heavy and sturdy, at least, but that was about it. Great for its day, but not for today. And yes, I'm sure there were some great mechanical keyboards back then, too, but those would be a far cry from the full-featured beasts you can get today. They would be a far cry from a Hall effect keyboard of such high quality, with such gorgeous typing sound and feel, as the Keychron I use today. We're not having to choose at all between gaming performance, quality, and comfort. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nor are we having to choose between gaming performance and sleek, office-friendly aesthetics. I'm reminded of this most acutely by myLogitech G Pro X Superlight(which admittedly now requires a little maintenance after much use). This mouse is (super) light, performant, and looks perfectly inconspicuous in pretty much any environment, provided you don't go for the bright pink version. We could, of course, see this as following the trend of technology in general, whether it's PCs, bikes, or TVs. With raw performance and new features tending to plateau—at least compared to earlier advancements—focusing on comfort and performance is one way to stay ahead of the competition (well, that and making things look good butreducingquality to cut costs and increase margins, but we'll leave that aside for now). When it comes to PC gaming gear, though, the shift is, I think, in part because PC gaming has become so popular and mainstream that many gaming hardware and peripheral companies are seeing the benefit in making high-quality products that can double as work and general life products. When I met with some SteelSeries reps last year, they were keen to impress upon me that the company's peripherals (or at least itsApex Pro Gen 3 TKLkeyboard) are designed off the back of the recognition that people aren'tjustsitting at home gaming nowadays. They're travelling and using the same peripherals at the office, or they're staying at home using the same peripherals for both study and game time. And sure, there will always be garish RGB-laden gaming gear that's seemingly made out of foil and toothpicks being sold for $10. That's primarily because PC gaming will always have a healthy market of kids who like shiny things but can't spend much money. But now there's an incredibly healthy supply of the opposite, too, and such a healthy market of this opposite seems to me to be a pretty recent development. Best gaming mouse: the top rodents for gamingBest gaming keyboard: your PC's best friend...Best gaming headset: don't ignore in-game audio You see this the other way around, too, with non-gaming companies tailoring products to gaming. My current favourite bit of kit, for instance, is theEarFun Air Pro 4, a pair of lively little earbuds. EarFun is certainly not a gaming brand, and yet its earbuds work wonderfully for gaming, thanks to Game Mode, which reduces latency to imperceptible levels when connected over Bluetooth. You'll find similar modes in the software for most decent earphones today. It's taken me a while to admit this (and my colleague Jacob R will be happy to know he's finally reigned victorious in our months-long debate over this exact issue in regards to keyboards), but it's really quite easy to find high-quality gaming peripherals, devices, and components these days. By this, I primarily mean peripherals and devices that are comfy, satisfying to use, and have office-friendly designs, which are also great for gaming. That's true whether you're looking at a gaming brand that's finally set its mind to simpler things rather than flashy RGB lighting and raw frame rate performance, or at non-gaming brands that have realised enough people are gaming these days that it can't hurt to affix some gaming functionality. That's why I'm pleased to admit that we're finally at the spot I used to wish we would arrive at all those years ago when I started gaming on PC. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old. He swiftly realised the local PC repair store had ripped him off with his build and vowed never to let another soul build his rig again. With this vow, Jacob the hardware junkie was born. Since then, Jacob's led a double-life as part-hardware geek, part-philosophy nerd, first working as a Hardware Writer for PCGamesN in 2020, then working towards a PhD in Philosophy for a few years (result pending a patiently awaited viva exam) while freelancing on the side for sites such as TechRadar, Pocket-lint, and yours truly, PC Gamer.

    "article_text": "No offers found Still, it's a new GPU to ponder over at the very least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Good news: AMD has finally announced the specs of the much-rumoured RX 9070 GRE. The bad news? It appears to be a China-only card for now, leaving those of us in the rest of the world to stare in wonder. Or at the very least, mild interest. Not that this is a particularly big surprise, given theRX 7900 GREwas also a China-exclusive card to start with, although it did become available in limited quantities to the rest of the world eventually. Anyway, theRX 9070 GREhas 48 Compute Units, a boost frequency of up to 2,790 MHz, 48 Ray Tracing Accelerators, 96 AI Accelerators, and 96 ROPS, with 3,072 Stream Processors in total (viaVideocardz). Oh, and 12 GB of GDDR6 VRAM over a 192-bit bus, which is spookily close (by which I mean, bang on accurate) to theleaked specswe reported on last week. AMD also says that the RX 9070 GRE is 6% faster than the RX 7900 GRE on average across 30+ games at native 1440p Ultra, which is a bit underwhelming in my book. Not that I'd consider that performance to be slow, exactly, but I can't help but feel it's a roundabout way of saying \"slower than the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT.\" Which is to be expected, of course, but still. The pre-order price is listed at 4,199 RMB. That equates to around $588 at today's exchange rates, although it's difficult to do a direct comparison with a Chinese pre-order price versus current Western market GPU prices, given that most models are still yo-yoing around in pricing and availability.

Still, we're getting towards the sort of time we expect to see anRX 9060 XTrelease, which will hopefully flesh out the RX 9000-series desktop range good and proper. Computex 2025, perhaps? It's not long now until I pack my bags for Taiwan once more, so I'm hoping AMD might have something a little more exciting (or at least, available) to show off there.

    "article_text": "No offers found I don't make the rules. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've written so much hagiography for Morrowind on this website that I'm even starting to annoy myself. You'd think that means I'm not going to spend yet another article gushing about Morrowind. You'd be wrong. You should play Morrowind: it's the best Elder Scrolls game and, quite frankly, one of the best games of all time, and you can currently pick it up for cheap as part ofFanatical's ongoing build-a-Bethesda-bundle sale. You've seen this kind of thing before: the more games you buy, the cheaper they become individually. Ordinarily, this is a cunning ploy to get you to buy games you don't actually want, but there are enough all-timers in the line-up here that I reckon you could easily fill your cart with games you might truly desire to play some day. The tiers are as follows: you can pick up2 games for $3.50 each,3-4 games for $3.33 each, or5+ games for $3 each. The numbers are the same in British pounds, too, which isn't how exchange rates work, but what do I know? There are 15 games to make your selection from, including classic Bethesda Game Studios stuff like Morrowind, the original Oblivion (no remaster here, sorry gang), The Elder Scrolls Online, and Fallouts 3 and 4, but also Bethesda-published bangers like Dishonored 2 and Death of the Outsider, Wolfenstein: The New Order, Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, and Quake 4. Hey, I happen to like Quake 4, okay? Plus a bunch of other stuff, which I'll list in convenient, bullet-pointed form below, but the point is I think you could easily assemble a patchwork of five or more games to bring everything down to its lowest price. Unless you already own most of them. Which is an issue, I admit. But if you don't own most of them, you should buy and play Morrowind. You should also buy and play Dishonored 2, one of the best immersive sims of the last decade and a game whose name alone is certain to plunge the PC Gamer Slack into a diversion lasting at least 30 minutes. Just, probably avoid Wolfenstein: Youngblood. That was a weak link in the MachineGames series. Anyway, here's that list of every game you can pick up: Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crewOblivion persuasion: Master the minigame Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Parts for that high-performance Intel Battlemage gaming GPU have been spotted again and I still want it to teach Nvidia's RTX 5070 a $400 pricing lesson",
    "article_text": "No offers found Anything that might keep Nvidia honest would be incredibly welcome. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A couple of weeks ago, a mootedhigh-end variant of Intel's Battlemage gaming graphics architecture was spotted in a shipping manifest. That was labelled for \"R&D\" purposes, but still had me hoping Intel was cooking something up that might compete with Nvidia'sRTX 5070on performance but radically undercut it on price. This latest spot of the increasingly hallowed Intel G31 GPU is a fraction more straight up, in some regards at least, and so even more tantalising. Once again, it'sX user Haze2K1and theshipping data website NBDthat's furnishing us with an insight into Intel's graphics machinations. But this time, instead of the G31 GPU itself popping up in the data, it's supporting components for the chip, including socket stiffeners (ooo, er!) and cylindrical multicontact connectors, whatever they are. The shipments were to Intel's Vietnam facility, where Haze2K1 claims the company's reference-design Limited Edition boards are produced. You could take from that, should you wish to be optimistic, something along the lines of Intel making preparations to start production on a line of G31-based gaming graphics cards. But hang on, even if that's true, exactly what can you expect from G31? As I explained last time around,Intel's latest Arc B580 and B570 GPUs use the BMG-G21 chipand the bigger G31 GPUhas long been rumouredas the next step up in the Battlemage hierarchy. There's no official information, but the rumour mill has settled on 32 execution units (EUs) for G31, fully 60% more than the 20 EUs of the existing Intel Arc B580. Going by the raw performance of the B580, you might then expect performance up atNvidia RTX 5070levels or even beyond. In practice, that seems pretty ambitious. But if G31 can at least get near the 5070, well, that would be pretty exciting, especially if Intel retained its typically aggressive GPU pricing strategy. Hence, my speculation a few weeks ago that G31 could have the makings of a $400 RTX 5070 killer. Of course, you have to wonder why, if Intel is indeed planning to release a G31-based graphics card, it's taking so long, what with the B580 launching last December. There's been some talk that G31 suffers even more acutely from the excessive CPU load that has compromised the appeal of the Arc B580 board. But ultimately, we just don't know. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That said, if Intel could get a G31-based graphics card out in 2025, it should have over a year to win customers. We wouldn't expect properly new mid-range GPUs from Nvidia until spring 2027. Likewise, AMD's RDNA 4-based GPUs, including theRX 9070 and RX 9070 XTare pretty new on the market, with the RX 9060 series not even on sale yet. The bottom line is that there's still time for Intel to make an impact. So, get those fingers and toes crossed and keep watching this space.

    "title": "If you HAVE to upgrade your GPU today, these are the five graphics cards I think are worth looking at",
    "article_text": "No offers found Just in case your old GPU randomly decided to set itself on fire, here are a few options to consider in this dire market. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Don't you just love how buying one of thebest graphics cardsis impossible right now? The latest cards are either out of stock or just priced up to a ludicrous degree, and the last-gen GPUs are in such tight supply their prices are far from a comfort, either. And just when we all thought the nightmare of out-of-stock GPUs was behind us. Following the 2021 GPU shortage (spurred by crypto miners, scalpers, and bots), we all thought we were in the clear, with cards lining the shelves and prices that didn't make us cry. Nope. Certainly far from in the clear. If youcanwait to buy a graphics card, my advice is that you absolutely should. It's the wild, wild west out there right now and, if you're not desperate, it's better to wait it out. Can't wait any longer? Maybe your current card's given up the ghost or you fear you don't have the graphical grunt to runElden RingNightreign at a decent lick. Fair enough, but just know that it won't be easy. If refreshing Amazon every five seconds or camping outside your local retailer to try and score acheap GPU dealis not your thing, I've got you. I've rounded up the five GPUs I'd buy right now if I had to buy one, so you can waste your money efficiently and overpayjust a bitinstead of a lot. Don't say I didn't warn you. MSI RTX 4060 Ventus 2X Black OC | 8 GB GDDR6 | 128-bit | 3072 CUDA cores | 2.46 GHz boost clock | 115W |$380 at Newegg|£249 at Amazon UK I know that last-gen cards aren't particularly exciting anymore, not when we're all drooling over the likes of theRTX 5090(which, by the way, apparentlycan't run Oblivion Remastered at a steady 60 fps. Go figure). But I didn't promise you excitement; I promised you GPUs at prices you'd be able to stomach, and that's why the RTX 4060 is at the top of the list. With upscaling and DLSS 3, you'll still run most games at high settings at 1080p. Can the RTX 4060 handle 1440p? Yeah, it can, but you'll need to be conservative with the graphics settings. In ourRTX 4060 review, you'll find that the card can comfortably maintain 60 fps in most games even if you drive the settings all the way up to max. Cyberpunk 2077 on ultra with ray tracing on is not a thing for this card, though, at least not without DLSS 3 and Frame Generation. Going last-gen has one glaring downside: No DLSS 4. You can't quadruple your frame rates with Nvidia's Multi Frame Generation. But, seeing as you can still double them, I say you'll be fine for a few years. Price-wise, I'm sorry to report that the RTX 4060 is, like every other card, selling above MSRP. Like I said, the GPU market is awful right now. But, I found one for sale for$380 at Newegg(or£249 for us lucky Brits) and that's as good as it gets right now. MSI Ventus 3 |16 GB GDDR7 | 256-bit | 8960 CUDA cores | 2.45 GHz boost clock | 300W |$900 at Newegg|£808 at Amazon UK (Palit card) For gamers with deeper pockets that don't quite go all the way to the RTX 5090, the RTX 5070 Ti is the only option right now. With theRTX 5080selling for$1,280 and up on Amazon, you don't have much of a choice. Back to the RTX 5070 Ti. Polarizing graphics card, that one. PC Gamer's reviewed two different models of it, theAsus TUF Gaming RTX 5070 Tiand thisMSI Ventus 3X RTX 5070 Ti, and while one scored a hefty 86 out of 100, the other one fares much worse with a 68 score. It's not that one was great and the other one was not; it's all about the price. If we just close our eyes and pretend for second the pricing issue isn't a thing (mmm, what a world...), the RTX 5070 Ti is a decent GPU. It can almost match the RTX 5080 with the right overclock. The RTX 5070 Ti is roughly 20% faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, and around 15 to 20% slower than the RTX 5080. In our 1440p benchmark, it scored between 61 fps (Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing on ultra settings) and well above 100 fps in games that don't make a mockery out of every GPU. It's brilliant at 1440p, good enough at 4K, and overkill at 1080p. The RTX 5070 Ti is also overpriced, no surprise there. The cheapest one I spotted was$900 at Newegg, and it also gets youDoom: The Dark Agesfor free, which normally costs $100. If you're over on this side of the pond,Amazon UK sells the RTX 5070 Ti for £807. Sapphire Pulse RX 7800 XT |16 GB GDDR6 | 256-bit | 60 compute units | 2.43 GHz boost clock | 263W |$580 at Newegg|£461 on Amazon UK (XFX card) Listen, I'm a sucker for AMD, and I love theRX 9070 XT. I just don't think you should buy one right now, so I'm still recommending theRX 7800 XTinstead. The RX 9070 XT is one frustratingly pricey affordable GPU these days. Its big selling point was that it was massively undercutting the Nvidia competition and delivering on gaming performance. Scarcity and opportunism, however, has bumped the $599 MSRP to the moon. The absolute cheapest option onNewegg is $859, and just typing that is upsetting. At that price point, just get the RTX 5070 Ti, which wins in ray tracing and offers MFG. The RX 7800 XT is an acceptable alternative if you're willing to forgo (some of) that fancy-schmancy ray tracing stuff. And if not, I've got two more Nvidia options for you below, so what are you still doing here? The RX 7800 XT didn't break any records when it first launched, but it offered top-notch value for the money, and even now, when it costs$580 at Neweggand$590 on Amazon(or£461 on Amazon UK), that side of it is still true. When we look at pure rasterization, this is a GPU that rivals the RTX 3080 and the RTX 4070, and you'll generally find it for less than either. A 1440p card through and through, the RX 7800 XT delivers some of its best work at that resolution—although it certainly wouldn't mind if you scaled down to 1080p. At 1080p, it easily hits 60 fps in every game bar Cyberpunk 2077; at 1440p, it gets absolutely obliterated by the dystopian blockbuster, huffing and puffing as it averages 27 fps with ray tracing on. Outside of Cyberpunk, it's an admirable GPU, and it hits anywhere from 60-ish to 120-ish fps in every other game in our test suite. Gigabyte RTX 5060 Ti Gaming OC | 16/8 GB GDDR7 | 128-bit | 4608 CUDA cores | 2.57 GHz boost clock | 180W |$530 at Amazon|£450 at Amazon UK (MSI card) I admit that I had low hopes for the RTX 5060 Ti. After many hours spent ranting about the stupidly narrow memory bus on the RTX 4060 Ti and how close those two GPUs were to the RTX 3060 Ti (don't even get me started), I have come to accept that Nvidia is doing the same thing yet again. That's what they want, right? Imagine my disappointment then, when all my whining was for nothing, and the RTX 5060 Ti actually turned out to be a decent GPU? Preposterous. We took thePalit Infinity 3 RTX 5060 Ti 16 GBand theMSI Gaming Trio OC RTX 5060 Ti 16 GBout for a spin, and found that the former was 20% faster than the RTX 4060 Ti. This is a 1080p card, but reach into Nvidia's bag of goodies (aka DLSS and Multi Frame Generation) and you can pull off 1440p. If you force it to run at 4K, you'll find that the extra bandwidth gained from using speedier GDDR7 RAM actually puts it 40% ahead of the last-gen GPU. Performance-wise, I'm pleased; price-wise, this GPU is stuck in the same hellscape we're all living in right now. The cheapest one I've found is this Gigabyte Gaming OC 16 GB model,priced at $530(or an MSI Inspire 2X model for£450 in the UK). The 8 GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti finds itself adrift in the current Nvidia lineup. Youcanbuy one for$420(£360), but the question is, should you? At 1080p, absolutely go for it. Anything beyond and you're better off with the 16 GB version. Gigabyte WindForce RTX 5070 | 12 GB GDDR7 | 192-bit | 6144 CUDA cores | 2.51 GHz boost clock | 250W |$604 at Newegg|£519 at Amazon UK (Palit card) While the RTX 5060 Ti was a pleasant surprise, theRTX 5070sort of disappointed me. But it's only just a bit pricier than the RTX 5060 Ti right now, and that gives it some merit. This GPU is considerably slower than the RX 9070 XT, so if both were sold at MSRP, I'd be sending you a whole bunch of links to buy the AMD flagship instead. It's only around 13% faster than the RTX 4070 Super, but the access to MFG elevates it to a whole new level, unless you're not a fan of them 'fake frames' that is. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huangpromised us RTX 4090-level performancewith this one. Well, we're only about 80% behind that figure at 4K, so he was almost right. Kind of. But if you compare it to cards in a similar pricing bracket, the RTX 5070 is not too bad. It's just notoutstanding, but at$604(£519), I'll take it. Given the lacklustre gen-on-gen improvement, you might as well get the RTX 4070 Super, but that old GPU is actually pricier right now. The RTX 5070 quietly slides onto this list with no applause, and no fanfare, but as a means to an ends during a rough market. If you're itching to get yourself a new GPU, I feel your pain. I was stuck in that same limbo back in 2022, with an aging PC that cried quietly when I tried to play Elden Ring. There were just no GPUs to be had, and my poor GTX 1060 had to keep on keepin' on until I finally sent it where GPUs go to retire in 2024. I waited it out. So should you. The problem, right now, is twofold. One: GPUs are almost never sold at MSRP, knocking down the value for money aspect. Two: Even if they're ever sold at a reasonable price, they're also quick to sell out. Okay, I lied, because here's… Three: There are no last-gen cards available at MSRP either. If you've got an unlimited budget and a GPU that's currently on fire as we speak, go ahead and buy one of the five graphics cards I listed above. Otherwise, my recommendation is patience. The prices are wild, but they're getting better. It's already possible to score a graphics card near MSRP in the UK, and hopefully, the US market will catch up eventually. Until then, keep pushing your old GPU to do its best. I hear words of encouragement don't work, but it never hurts to try.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is currently doing a ratherwell-deserved victory lapafter one million sales and stellar Steam numbers—which is heartening to see from an ambitious AA studio.

We’ve always said if there is strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the response so far, I’d say chances are good.\" Those staggered-yet-delight vibes grok with how the studio's been responding to its breakout success on social media, with theofficial Clair Obscur X accountwriting \"We had a nice, easy morning following a totally normal weekend\" next to a picture of a Gestral from the game recreating the 'This is Fine' meme. Personally, I'm psyched. To keep things as vague as possible (I think Clair Obscur's ending ought to be experienced personally) this is a game with plenty of room to expand upon its killer final act.

Instead, \"new users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account.\" What options, exactly? \"Instead of showing you all the possible ways for you to sign in, we automatically detect the best available method on your account and set that as the default,\" Microsoft says. Options includeWindows Hello Facial recognition, fingerprint scanning and PINs or personal identification numbers, which are together known as passkeys as opposed to passwords. PINs, of course, are really just a subset of the broader notion of passwords, so there's an element of semantics to all this. Despite that, Microsoft is touting the move as bringing its account logins a step closer to the ultimate ideal of completely ditching passwords. \"As more people enroll passkeys, the number of password authentications will continue to decline until we can eventually remove password support altogether,\" the announcement says. Anyway, the driving force behind all this is the inherent insecurity of passwords. Once a password has been compromised, and if that's the sole point of security, anyone, anywhere, can access an account by the simple means of typing in a password. As Microsoft says, \"bad actors know that the password age is ending, and that the number of easily compromised accounts is shrinking. In response, these bad actors are devoting considerable resources to automating brute force and phishing attacks against any account still protected by a password. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Last year, we observed a staggering 7,000 password attacks per second (more than double the rate from 2023). As passkeys become the new standard, expect increased pressure from cyberattackers on any accounts still protected by passwords or other phishable sign-in methods.\" While facial recognition, fingerprints and other biometric methods are not totally foolproof, they are fundamentally more secure. What's more, passkey-based methods aren't just safer, they're easier and faster to use. \"Users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful at getting into their account than password users (about 98% versus 32%). When you use a passkey, you get into your account much quicker, too! Passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than a password and multifactor authentication,\" Microsoft claims, and we've no real reason to doubt it.

    "article_text": "No offers found Hellfire Gala's mid-season update finally invites Ultron to the party. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In case you're somehow running out of characters to learn and events to tick off, theMarvel RivalsSeason 2.5mid-season update adds even more to play around with. This update includes the rest of the content revealed in the announcement for the second season, but also a few additional surprises. The first half of Marvel Rivals Season 2 brought Vanguard Emma Frost to the team, the beautiful Krakoa map, heaps of costumes, and tons of tweaks to various systems. While the mid-season update isn't quite so chunky, it's still worth marking on your calendar. Below, you'll find out everything there is to know about Marvel Rivals Season 2.5 right now. Marvel Rivals Season 2.5 is expected to launch onFriday,May 30,2025. Starting at 2 am PDT / 5 am EDT / 10 am BST / 11 am CEST, the servers should go offline for around two to three hours before the update is in our hands. Season 2.5 will hang around for about six weeks until Season 3 comes along and messes up the meta once again. In fact, from Season 3 onwards, the update cadence is speeding up, with each season lasting just two months. This means we'll get a new hero every single month from now on, alongside new maps, events, and costumes. The one and only Ultron finally arrives with the mid-season update. Despite his…prickly nature, Ultron is actually a Strategist, meaning it's his job to keep the team alive with healing and other supportive buffs. While Ultron's abilities are yet to be officially revealed, his kit has leaked in its entirety: Almighty Ultron isn't the only new addition in the mid-season update, as we'll also get Arakko, a brand-new convoy map. Of course, we'll also get tons more events and costumes, too. With the Season 2 meta finally settling into a rhythm after the arrival of Emma Frost, NetEase has revealed some heroes expected to see changes in the mid-season patch: Since these balance changes are coming alongside the addition of a new hero, the tweaks are somewhat minimal. Expect further balancing after the meta has settled once more after Ultron joins the roster. Outside of character balance, NetEase has also confirmed a slight change off the back of Season 2's competitive point tweaks. Following this update, competitive point gains and losses were more heavily weighted on match performance, rather than the outcome. This resulted in a handful of Duelists gaining a disproportionate number of points (and losing less) compared to the rest of the roster, especially Vanguards and Strategists. In Season 2.5, the competitive point system will be further optimised to avoid these kinds of situations.

    "article_text": "No offers found Mod ahead therefore time for joy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The thing that makes FromSoft games great isn't the tightly honed boss fights, the layered lore, or the quiet tragedy of their antagonists. It's the ability to write 'Don't give up skeleton' and 'Try finger but hole' across every inch of the game and subject players around the world to it. Every game should have that and now, thanks to enterprising modders, we're one step closer to a world where that's true.Ghosts of Tamrielis a mod for Oblivion Remastered (viaVG247) that lets you leave little messages for your fellow Heroes of Kvatch, Dark Souls style. The mod comes from authors yamashi and jay-jay, and lets you drop messages anywhere in Cyrodiil for other players (who have the mod, naturally) to read just by hitting CTRL on your keyboard. They take the form of floating Welkynd Stones—those glowing blue mana-restoring rocks you get in Ayleid ruins—and are a lot more flexible than FromSoft's collection of canned sentence structures and words that players manage to make absolutely filthy anyway. In fact, the whole thing is dangerously, wonderfully open. The interface is just a text document that you can title and write anything you want in. This is a recipe for a terrible nightmare, of course: you can already picture the ASCII art, but there's also an upvoting and downvoting system to push back on stuff you'd prefer not to see. Messages have a 24-hour lifespan before they vanish forever, but that resets whenever they get an upvote. On the flipside, any message that accrues enough downvotes will get yoinked out of the system. There's a system to hide messages you don't want to see in your own world, too. The mod requires an internet connection, of course, and will show your character's name in addition to the messages you leave, but apart from that it's all gloriously anonymous in a very old-internet sort of way, which is appropriate for a remaster of a game from '06. \"None of the data sent to the server is logged,\" say the authors, \"it only exists in memory for the lifetime of the message, after that it disappears forever.\" So if you're desperate to share your wit and wisdom with the Oblivion community writ large, pop over to Nexus, install theOblivion Remastered Script Extender, then install Ghosts of Tamriel with a mod manager and go.

    "article_text": "No offers found Test your might. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Paizo continues to offer some absolutely bonkers value for its Pathfinder 2nd Edition—once more putting a whole heap of its books on offer for a good cause. This time around, theAsian Fantasy Bundleon Humble has raised thousands forStop AAPI Hate, an organisation dedicated to fighting discrimination and hatred against Asian and Pacific Islander people in the US. It should be noted that all of these books are PDF copies—which means if you want to play on Foundry, you'll need to do some legwork to convert the adventure within. Still, it's an exceptional amount of bang for your buck—thinning down around $700 (£517) of books to $57 (£44). Here's what you get before we even get stuck into adventure content. The star of the show here, though, is the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix adventure path, a campaign that'll take you from level 11 to 18. The core concept is that you and your buddies have been invited to Tian Xia by the sorcerer Hao Jin to compete in a fighting tournament, though first you'll need to qualify by surviving Danger Island. Yes, that's its actual name. It looks like it all leans joyously into its fighting game inspirations (the second part of the adventure is literally called \"Ready? Fight!\") and may very well be a blast. Again, sadly, this is one of the adventure paths Paizo made before its very good integration with Foundry VTT—though at a cursory glance, there are some fan-made modules that'll help cut your workload down. If you're playing in-person, though, this bundle is a no-brainer. If you don't want to start at level 11, the included scenarios are enough to get you there and all lead into each other nicely: Meaning there's a ready-made level 1-18 campaign here with two distinct halves to keep your players busy. As is normally the case with Humble Bundles, you can also pay less. For $5 you can still get the beginner box, a Player's Guide for the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix adventure (in case you want to go full homebrew), and a levels 1-4 scenario Lost on the Spirit Road. I've beenenjoying Pathfinder 2e immenselyas a newer DM to the system and, like a lot of PF2e's recent Humble Bundles, this one is bloomin' great value for your money.The Asian Fantasy Bundlewill be available for 20 days, ending May 22, so you've got almost a month to wrangle your table.

    "article_text": "No offers found All to the lifeboats; women and children first. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rockstar went and dropped a bomb on what was otherwise quite a sleepy Friday when it announced that—whoops, sorry—it was actually going to releaseGTA 6's console versionon May 26, 2026, rather than in its previously announced release window of autumn 2025. Which sure made game devs hoping to release something this year breathe a sigh of relief, but didn't much please investors in Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive. Per theFT, Take-Two's share price dropped 15% in the aftermath of Rockstar's characteristically austere news post announcing the delay. So it's no wonder Take-Two put out itsown press releaseconcurrently with Rockstar's announcement—it anticipated just this kind of reaction. This release, though, was less focused on players and more aimed at convincing its bug-eyed investors that the sky wasn't falling. \"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto 6,\" said Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick. Zelnick said that \"While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto 6,\" it's also \"steadfast in our commitment to excellence.\" Releasing GTA 6 in that original autumn window, it seems, would not have upheld that standard for excellence, so off to 2026 it goes. But Take-Two urges its shareholders not to freak out, and promises it'll still make more money than anyone could possibly know what to do with evenwithGTA's release date slipping across the horizon. Take-Two's took some time and \"reiterated its expectations that the Company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, Net Bookings in Fiscal 2026 and 2027,\" which is to say it's still gonna sell a record volume ofstuffin this fiscal year (2026) and next fiscal year (2027, they make this stuff confusing on purpose, I reckon). \"As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline,\" Zelnick reassured investors, \"we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.\" Well, that's a weight off my mind.

    "article_text": "No offers found \"I just don't understand how that can be fair use.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors filedcopyright infringement lawsuitsagainst Meta Platforms and OpenAI back in 2023, alleging pirated versions of their works were used without permission to train AI language models. Meta has since argued that such usage falls under fair use doctrine (via Reuters), but US federal district judge Vince Chhabria seems to have been less than impressed by the defence: \"You have companies using copyright-protected material to create a product that is capable of producing an infinite number of competing products,\" said Chhabria to Meta's attorneys in a San Francisco court last Thursday. \"You are dramatically changing, you might even say obliterating, the market for that person's work, and you're saying that you don't even have to pay a license to that person… I just don't understand how that can be fair use.\" Under US copyright law,fair useis a doctrine that permits the use of copyrighted material without explicit permission of the copyright holder, Examples of fair use include usage for the purpose of criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research. It can be used as an affirmative defence in response to copyright infringement claims, although several factors are considered in judging whether usage of copyrighted works falls under fair use—includingthe effect of the useof said works on the market (or potential markets) they exist in. Meta has argued that its AI systems make fair use of copyrighted material by studying it, in order to make \"transformative\" new content. However, judge Chhabria appears to disagree: \"This seems like a highly unusual case in the sense that though the copying is for a highly transformative purpose, the copying has the high likelihood of leading to the flooding of the markets for the copyrighted works,\" said Chhabria. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Meta attorney Kannon Shanmugam then reportedly argued that copyright owners are not entitled to protection from competition in \"the marketplace of ideas\", to which Chhabira responded: Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. \"But if I'm going to steal things from the marketplace of ideas in order to develop my own ideas, that's copyright infringement, right?\" However, Chhabria also appears to have taken issue with the plaintiffs attorney, David Boies, in regards to the lawsuit potentially not providing enough evidence to address the potential market impacts of Meta's alleged conduct. \"It seems like you're asking me to speculate that the market for Sarah Silverman's memoir will be affected by the billions of things that Llama [Meta's AI model] will ultimately be capable of producing,\" said Chhabria. \"And it's just not obvious to me that that's the case.\" All to play for, then, although by the looks of things judge Chhabria seems determined to hold both sides to proper account. It also gives me a chance to publish a line I've always wanted to write: The case continues. Yep, it's about as satisfying as I thought.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Working out how tojoin the Mages GuildinOblivionis a worthwhile pursuit, even for players who don’t consider themselves major magic users. Alongside the usual benefits of joining a guild (like a place to sleep and improved Disposition among its members), the Mages Guild gives you access to a treasure trove of alchemical tools and ingredients that you can use to craft potions or even just sell off for some sweet, sweet gold. Thankfully for any aspiring Arch-Mage, the Mages Guild is one of the simplest memberships to earn in the game, so don’t expect anything quite as involved as trying tojoin the Thieves Guild. While its upper ranks are more exclusive, you can become an Associate of the Mages Guild within minutes of emerging from the sewers of Imperial City. Here’s how it’s done. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis pretty extensive, joining the Mages Guild remains the same as in the original version, so this guide applies to both games. Mages don’t have to be quite as shady or secretive as other guilds like theDark Brotherhood, and that really works to your benefit when trying to join their ranks. Just follow these three simple steps and, as if by magic, you’ll find yourself the newest member of the Mages Guild: There are seven Mages Guild halls dotted across the map of Cyrodiil. These are located in each city—with the exception of the Imperial City and Kvatch—and each one of them houses a local leader. Any of these fine folks can approve your induction into the Mages Guild. The best part is you don’t need to have mastered thepersuasion minigameeither; it really is as easy as just asking to join. City Leader Anvil Carahil Bravil Kud-Ei Bruma Jeanne Frasoric Cheydinhal Falcar Chorrol Teekeeus Leyawiin Dagail Skingrad Adrienne Berene The Arcane University in the Imperial City is an elite centre of learning that’s reserved for members of the Mages Guild. Any visitor can enter the lobby but as a lowly Associate, you’ll need to rise through the ranks a bit before you can properly access it. In order to do that, make sure toacquire a recommendation from each of the seven Mages Guild leadersby completing their respective quests. Provided you’re a member of the Guild, speaking with a local leader will prompt them to tell you about a particular problem they’re having. Naturally, you’re going to be the one to solve it. These Mages Guild recommendation quests range from retrieving missing magical artifacts to taking out a rogue mage, but none of these should present you with too much difficulty. You‘ll be able to explore more and more of the Arcane University as your Mages Guild rank increases. Continue to complete quests for the guild and it won’t be long until you find yourself at the tippy top of the Arch-Mage’s Tower.

Grand Theft Auto 5 released in 2013 and this means there'll have been a 13 year wait for the next installment in the series. No doubt the news will have many feeling wasted: including many developers and publishers,who feared this exact scenario. Grand Theft Auto 6 was announced in late 2023 with a spectacular trailer, and the 2025 release date that's now for the birds. The worst thing about this news?

If you think the one thing AI search has been missing is a component to instantly share your searches with your friends, boy do I have an app for you. Meta's new AI app now comes with a function to not only view, but also interact with your friends and family's use of AI. According to a recentMeta blog post(viaThe Verge), \"Meta AI is built to get to know you, so its answers are more helpful. It’s easy to talk to, so it’s more seamless and natural to interact with. It’s more social, so it can show you things from the people and places you care about\" As well as coming with prompts and an ability to use Meta AI via your voice, Meta's Llama 4 (its latest AI model) is being used in the app for more personal and conversational prompts. The app will \"get to know you\" by remembering things you tell it to, in order to use that information in future answers. This can help it give more detailed answers when you ask it for exercise routines, personalised diet advice, or anything that may require more context than a simple prompt. Personalised responses are now available for users in the US and Canada, and they can draw from information you've given Facebook or Instagram, if you choose to link your accounts in settings. These are all fairly standard upgrades for AI use, as the likes ofChatGPT implemented a memory system last yearto pick up on previous conversations. The biggest update in the dedicated Meta AI app is its lean into a full-blown social media. There is now a 'Discover' feed, which shows you the prompts your friends and family are using. The examples it gives are a friend asking AI to sum them up in emojis, someone asking if the location they're in is good for camping and if they should be 'worried about bears', and someone asking the AI to recreate their photo of them as a video game character. Users can, in turn, choose to copy their prompts through a 'remix feature'. Meta AI only shares your prompts should you choose to make them public, so no, Meta won't be putting you on blast for asking how to cut an onion without crying. The new app also comes with a history tab, which means you could choose to buyRay-Ban's Meta smart glasses, ask Meta AI a question while wearing them, then check your prompt from your phone later. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's an ecosystem at work here that feels like an extension of the Metaverse that Meta has been tryingand failing to buildfor some time. If you feel like your AI searches are too private, and you haven't had the chance to share quite enough of them with your friends, you can now do it in just a single click. If you're wearing Meta's smart glasses in public, however, you might as well just announce your searches out loud, if you ask me.

    "title": "Intel's all-important Panther Lake mobile chip rumoured to launch later this year with just one model and it won't be getting the exciting graphics option",
    "article_text": "No offers found Only four Celestial-spec GPU cores at launch, not the full-fat 12-core variant. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remember we mentioned earlier this week howIntel's upcoming Panther Lake mobile CPUis shaping up to be a killer chip for gaming handhelds? Well, now we have some purported details of the first Panther Lake model Intel will release. The good news? It's coming later this year. The bad news? It reportedly won't get the exciting graphics option. According to a post on X, Intel will launch just one Panther Lake SKU this year. It will sport four P-cores, eight E-cores, zero low-power E-cores and a four-core iGPU. That latter detail is a little disappointing. As we reportedly earlier, perhaps the most exciting aspect of Panther Lake is a variant with 12 graphics cores. That's 50% up on the eight iGPU cores in Lunar Lake. If you also factor inthe new Celestial graphics architecture in Panther Lake, which is likely to offer more performance per graphics core than the Battlemage-based iGPU in Lunar Lake, the result should be a really substantial leap in gaming performance over Lunar Lake. And lest you have forgotten, we found Lunar Lake to be a very nice little chip for gaming handheldsinour review of the MSI Claw 8 AI+ A2VM handheld. In short, it's very competitive with AMD's equivalent chip for handhelds based on the Strix Point APU,as seen in the Ayaneo 3. So, Panther Lake could well be by far the fastest chip for handhelds. At least it would be if launched in time to compete with AMD's Strix Point. But if this latest rumour is correct, we'll have to wait until some time in 2026 for the Panther Lake model with 12 graphics cores. Because the variant detailed above with just four graphics cores is said to be the only model launched this year. There's obviously no official word on why that's the case, if indeed the single-model story is accurate. But there's a good chance it's related to the fact the Panther Lake usesIntel's brand new 18A node for its CPU tile. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It always take time to ramp up production volumes on a new node and the assumption here is that Intel isn't in a position to manufacture enough CPU core tiles on 18A to release a full line up of chips upon immediate release. Cynical industry observers, meanwhile, might conclude that Intel's 18A node isn't truly ready for volume production. But the company wants to get at least something based on 18A out the door in 2025 in order to keep to its own self-imposed roadmap. Thus, we'll get just the one SKU in 2025. Whatever the reason, the next question is why it's the SKU detailed and not one with the 12-core graphics and also some low-power E-cores? That may be because Intel prefers to go with the most relevant mainstream SKU at launch and then feed in higher-end models later. It's thought that Intel will be producing the graphics tile on TSMC's N3E node, which is fairly mature at this point and should not itself present any impediment to Panther Lake production. For an iGPU, Panther Lake's graphics are big. But TSMC has been producing much larger chips on N3E than even the most powerful Panther Lake graphics tile for some time now, most obviously the high-end variants of Apple's M4 chip range. Anywho, it seems it won't be too long now before we get our first taste of Panther Lake and 18A. But we'll probably have to wait a little while before that killer handheld chip arrives, mores the pity.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's publisher says Oblivion Remastered 'didn't seem to harm us at all', in fact, it may have helped: 'Everybody was thinking and talking about the genre'",
    "article_text": "No offers found Sometimes you get lucky, and players are just happy to have two cakes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's publisher haspoked fun at the Barbenheimer-esque situationbetween its own stellar JRPG and the Oblivion Remaster, it doesn't seem like it's harmed Sandfall's hit at all. Clair Obscurlanded very well, gathering over 1 million sales in under a week and an all-timer critical reception. In a recent interview withThe Game Business, senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan at Kepler says he's pretty sure that's down to Expedition 33 having something special to offer gamers, because hey, turns out they're also two very different games: \"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity,\" Handrahan says, \"When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.\" Which is fair enough. RPGs and JRPGs are very different beasts. While the differentiation between the genres has been one of debate (and some controversy), it's very much a 'you know it when you see it' situation. Bethesda's catalogue has a very different set of mechanics when compared to your Personas and Final Fantasies. Especially since \"Western-style\" RPGs have leant further and further away from turn-based combat. Both due to mistaken genre conventions that haven't really borne out, but also thanks to their roots in the CRPG's penchant for real-time pause and the like. If we're comparing JRPGs to Bethesda RPGs specifically, the narrative experience is completely different, too. \"I think there were other aspects,\" Handrahan adds. \"Like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass … so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. \"Actually,\" he continues, \"Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While shadow-dropped games can absolutelycause major issues for smaller developers, I'm personally glad Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 managed to squeeze its way into the gaps left by the Oblivion Remaster. It's certainly a game that deserves the attention, having swallowed 60+ hours of my attention into a time vortex last week. I think Handrahan's bang on the money here, too—to the point where he's almost stating the obvious. Ol' 33 and Oblivion Remastered are both extremely different games with different core audiences. That's not to say there isn't some overlap, but the charming jank and open world of Bethesda's classic is a complete apple when compared to the orange of Clair Obscur's mind-bending, tightly-written plot and strict narrative.

    "title": "Oblivion's one-room waterfront shack is the perfect player home",
    "article_text": "No offers found I have thousands of gold and live in a hovel that looks like it belongs to a skooma-sucker. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Here is what I want from a videogame player home. It should be a single room so I don't have to go through loading screens once I'm inside just to get to my stuff. It should have options so I can decide whether to give it wall hangings or not. And I should be able to reach it from a nearby fast travel point without passing any guards in case I have a bounty on my head. That last one is particular to Oblivion, but incredibly important. If I've been raising money to unlock the next quest in the Thieves Guild chain by finding the one NPC in town I consider to be a jerk and then stealing every single apple and piece of cloth in their home, I may need to get back to my storage containers and the bed I only sleep in to level up without hearing Wes Johnson shout at me. The real estate agent won't tell you this, but the bandit dungeon Dzonot Cave provides a convenient fast travel point within easy swimming distance of the Imperial City's waterfront shack, making this run-down hovel a practical choice for the thief about town. Some people will sing the praises of expensive mansions with multiple wings you need to hire a servant to look after, or the DLC homes that don't cost any septims to acquire and which feel kind of like cheating. Though I will totally retire to the smuggler's den in Dunbarrow Cove some day, that's an endgame option. While I'm still deciding who to murder to join the Dark Brotherhood and hoovering up every sidequest in the Imperial City I need a convenient base of locations, and that's the waterfront shack every time. It's the cheapest player home for sale in Oblivion, going for just 2,000 gold septims at the Market District's Office of Imperial Commerce. And yes, with its single bed and lack of furniture it does look like the kind of place you see getting mocked on social media: \"Imperials really live in apartments like this and don't see any issue.\" But there is no Twitter in Cyrodiil and no one is going to rack up 192,000 likes for shitting on your living conditions, so I am going to live in convenient squalor and like it. I know what you're thinking. \"But Jody, what about Benirus Manor in Anvil, which you don't have to buy upgrades for if you do the quest to clear it of ghosts and is relatively cheap at a mere 5,000 septims?\" Sure, I bought Benirus Manor once I could afford to branch out and acquire a second home conveniently placed near the starting point of the Fighters Guild questline. But not only does it have interior loading screens, for some reason it's the one player home you can't fast travel out of once you're inside it. This is a real niche case, because an ordinary person would just walk out the front door if they wanted to fast travel. I do not plan on staying an ordinary person, however, when I can become a vampire. Being immortal is pretty sweet, especially in the remaster which doesn't give you a bunch of wrinkles just because you've joined the living dead. Taking damage from daylight is a bit of a downside, especially because you can't fast travel while it's happening. And that's why Benirus Manor, despite being haunted, is actually a terrible choice for a vampire's home. From the waterfront shack I can fast travel whenever I please, and hopefully it's dark by the time I get there. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Now that I've bought the upgrade that gives me a few storage containers to keep my collection of books and spare suits of armor in, the waterfront shack is where I'll stay. Because even though that apartment in Bravil is basically one room and conveniently located downstairs from a Thieves Guild fence, the thought of making multiple trips to schlep all my spare equipment over there is too much.

Transform a mystifying bundle of yellow letters and seemingly unhelpful greys into a healthy assortment of greens in today'sWordlewith the help of our May 2 (1413) clue. Pair it with our tips for maximum effect, or go grab yourself an instant win no matter how you've been doing with a quick peek at today's answer. You've got this. Nearly… nearly… there it is. A bit of careful prodding after a great start soon put me on the right track, and once I was there all I had to do was explore a little more until I either found it or had nothing else left to try. Easy. If it's not feeling so easy for you today, make sure you use our hint, OK? This word would come up when trying to work out who an item belonged to, or who was responsible for something. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "title": "The best Oblivion Remastered mods",
    "article_text": "No offers found Improved performance, better visuals, and gameplay tweaks can be yours for the remastered classic RPG. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You're not really playing a Bethesda RPG unless you're running at least a couple mods, or for the real diehards, a couple hundred. With the launch of Oblivion Remastered, modders immediately got to work to create new mods for the overhauled RPG, as well as updating mods for the original game to work with the new one. It's still early days for the Oblivion Remastered modding scene, and there's the added complication of the remaster using Unreal Engine 5 in addition to Gamebryo. The original Oblivion is still intact in the game's files, but tangling with and taming a second game engine on top of the first means it may take a while to see the modding scene really take off. For now, we've got several mods we can recommend to improve performance, visuals, and a few gameplay elements, and we'll be updating this list frequently as new mods (and old updated ones) arrive. Oblivion Script Extender You might not need this mod yet, but it was critical for the original Oblivion (just as the Script Extender is to Skyrim) so it's safe to say it'll soon be instrumental for most mods. There are a number of mods already dependent on it and that will only increase as modders have more complex needs for their custom creations. Ultimate Engine Tweaks A visual upgrade always means a performance downgrade, and some players report that their PCs struggle to run Oblivion Remastered smoothly. If you're having issues with stutters and low frame rates, or want to remove effects like film grain and chromatic aberration, give this mod a try. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Universal Achievement Unblocker If you gonna mess with Oblivion Remastered by using mods or console commands, you're risking having achievements blocked. Why? I have no earthly idea. But this mod will allow you to still earn achievements even if you're using mods or cheats. Better HUD Even 20 years later, some things never change. Bethesda always seems to design HUD and UI elements for people sitting across the room from their screens, so if you're at a desktop everything just looks way too big. This mod gives you several smaller compasses to choose from, even some with no text elements for a truly minimalist look. No Hud No Effects Want to take some screenshots without UI clutter? Want to turn off effects like object outlines, fog, or compass markers? In the original game a couple of quickOblivion console commandscould handle that, but a few of the old ways don't work in the remaster. This mod sets up easy toggles to quickly hide or show all sorts of HUD furniture and visual effects. Unleveled Item Rewards Bethesda changed the leveling system for the remaster, but stuck with the leveled rewards system, which means you might wind up with an ultimately crummy version of a cool weapon. This mod shuts that off so you're getting the best version of every quest reward item every time you earn one. That might seem a little OP initially, but that's still an improvement over the system in the vanilla game. Difficulty Slider Fixed Something isn't quite right with Oblivion Remastered's difficulty levels, as players found when they switched from Adept (too easy) to Expert (hellishly hard) to Master (hellishly hard, but more so). This mod evens things out a bit with more sensible damage scaling to provide a good challenge but not an impossible one. Auto Local Map Want to use a local map? Your scroll-finger is gonna get a workout, because it's a laborious process to zoom in from the world map to see dungeons and interior maps. This mod has the local map open by default whenever you're inside. Nice. First Person Horse First-person horseriding was shown in the Oblivion Remastered trailer, but strangely, there's no option to actually do it in the game. If you don't like being wrenched into third-person perspective while on horseback, the alpha (version v0.0.0.0.0.0.1a) of this mod can help, though the effect still clips quite a bit. Faster Sleep and Wait Shop's just closed? Night has fallen? Guy you want to kill is behind a Very Hard lock in his home? You can wait by pressing T, but each hour takes a second to pass which feels like, well, a wait. This'll speed that up to 250 milliseconds per hour (provided your hardware is up to snuff).

If you’re having issues sending money to your friends and family through your financial institution – maybe Chase, Bank of America, or TD Bank – you’re not alone. Zelle, which is the company and tech that powers these instant transfers between banks, is in the midst of an outage. Much of Zelle's appeal versus Venmo or PayPal is that it’s instant, and no extra fees are associated with the speed. However, users have taken toDown Detector– a site that tracks outages – and social media platforms to voice issues with the platform. Reported outages spiked to over 1,000 at 1PM ET, and right now, as of this live blog starting, are circulating around 720 reports. Stick with us as we track this outage as it rolls on. We're approaching 10 PM ET here on the east coast of the United States, and reported issues with Zelle on Down Detector are beginning to drop, though it has been a bit of a rollercoaster. As of 9:39 PM ET, Down Detector shows only 311 reports for the platform. That's far below the over 1,000 reports we saw earlier today. We'll resume updates tomorrow morning and update you if we hear anything further from Zelle or Fiserv. Zelle is showing some signs of recovery – as of 5:45 PM ET, there were under 500 reported outages on Down Detector. We're still monitoring reports and have asked Fiserv for more details, but we haven't heard back yet. We're finally here from Fiserv. Here's what a spokesperson shared with TechRadar: \"Earlier today, we experienced an internal issue that temporarily disrupted service. The issue has since been resolved, and we are now working to process the backlog. We remain committed to providing reliable service and are taking steps to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\" While Fiserv isn't sharing what the issue was, the teams there identified it and have resolved it. Now, though, it's processing the backlog. That will likely take a bit, but Fiserv also promises to work to prevent these in the future. There is still no time frame for a fix from Zelle or Fiserv, but reports are holding pretty steady on Down Detector. Zelle is showing 727 reported outages as of 3:35 PM ET. Here's a quick update on reported outages on Down Detector: Zelle has over 800 reported outages as of 2:51 PM ET, an increase from the time we began our live blog. Banks like Bank of America, Ally, and Old National Bank are still seeing spikes. Fiserv, which has likely far fewer consumer users, is currently sitting at 91 reported outages as of 2:53 PM ET. We're waiting for Fiserv to comment on the issue, and we'll update you when we hear back. In the meantime, here's a look at what some impacted users are sharing on social media. It's worth noting that Zelle, while responding when asked for comment, doesn't have a services status page. @NavyFederal need to send out alerts stating when something is down!

Additionally, on X (formerly Twitter), CNN's Matt Egan notes that the issues impacting Zelle are linked to Fiserv, which is also experiencing an outage according to Down Detector. The platform also shows that Ally and Old National Bank are having issues. Zelle confirms to @CNN that users at some banks are not able to use the payments platform.Zelle said the issue is linked to a third-party: Fiserv@downdetector outage reports spiked Friday morning and remain elevated. pic.twitter.com/dIImnb45EAMay 2, 2025 Zelle has confirmed the ongoing outage. Here's what a spokesperson shared with us: “We are aware that certain Zelle® users at some financial institutions are not able to use Zelle at this time. This situation involves an independent third-party that provides services to particular financial institutions. We are working diligently with our partners to resolve this matter as soon as we can. Zelle users may see transactions marked as ‘payment pending’ in the meantime. We will share updates as more information becomes available.” It's clear that Zelle is aware of the issue and notes that it's worth working with various partners to resolve it. As with most outages, no exact timeframe is given. And if you can use Zelle right now through a bank, but it's not working as expected, you might see \"payment pending.\" It's clear that Zelle is having a rough day, here's a look at the reported outages thus far on Down Detector.

    "title": "You can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how",
    "article_text": "Widget AI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you like usingGoogleGemini on your smartphone but find it tedious to tap multiple times to get to the feature you want, Google has you covered. The tech giant has begun rolling out Gemini home screen widgets for both Android and iOS. That means a single tap can launch right into a conversation with Gemini, open the microphone for a voice conversation, share a file with the AI, or even snap a photo with the camera that will go right to Gemini. The rollout is happening gradually but widely. If you’re running Android 10 or higher, you can already add the Gemini widget by long-pressing on your home screen, tapping “Widgets,” finding Gemini in the list, and dragging it wherever you want it to live. For iOS 17 and up, it’s a similar story: hold your home screen until the icons jiggle, tap the plus button, search for Gemini, and add your widget of choice. You can also customize it by long-pressing it again and swapping out shortcuts or rearranging which actions appear first, such as the microphone for voice chats or the camera button for visual searches. This update isn't necessarily groundbreaking, but it speaks to the way a lot of people might use Gemini for short activities or tasks but don't want to immerse themselves in it more than necessary. If you use Gemini every day to ask questions, create funny images, plan trips, or brainstorm emails, this could make accessing the AI a little more convenient. The fact that it is also closer to how Siri and the rapidly dissolving Google Assistant function is probably not a coincidence. These aren't Gemini's first mobile widgets either. Google released verysimilar Gemini widgetsa couple of months ago for the iPhone lockscreen. Though functionally very similar, they are technically a different form of widget. Google is gradually rolling out the home screen Gemini widget over the next week, so you may only have the lock screen variant available right now. The widgets also offer a glimpse into Google's strategy for infusing Gemini into our daily lives. They want people to think about AI as not just something you call on occasionally, but as a day-to-day tool that is instantly and easily accessible. Instead of lurking in the background, Gemini becomes a part of the interface. Starting with mobile devices is a smart move for making Gemini feel more like a core service. A lot of people first try out new tech features and products on mobile devices, not on their laptops or desktop computers. If they like it on a mobile device, maybe that will translate to desktop usage. And if you're going to use AI on your phone, it should be quick and casual, like checking the weather or the time. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Gemini’s widgets are fairly basic at the moment, but they set the foundation for more complex widgets to come. Imagine a future widget that surfaces ongoing conversations so you can finish an interrupted project, or one that shows real-time updates from custom topics you follow, or even offers proactive suggestions based on your habits. All in all, these new widgets are less about bells and whistles and more about removing friction. They aim to give Gemini a faster, more native-feeling way into your daily habits, whether on Android or iPhone. The widget may be the wedge Gemini needs to fulfill every little request an AI assistant can handle.

    "article_text": "Perplexity to remove your perplexity When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI conversational search enginePerplexityand its newWhatsApp integrationcan provide more than just idle conversation. It can help you figure out the truth amid the rumors and half-remembered anecdotes that might appear in a group chat. You can get Perplexity to immediately fact-check your group chats. Perplexity's real-time provision of truth is easy to get. You just forward any questionableWhatsAppmessage to Perplexity's number, +1 (833) 436-3285, and the AI will explain in seconds whether the claim holds up or belongs in the digital trash. You can forward screenshots, messages, images with a quote that Einstein definitely said, and any other bit of suspicious information. Just save the number to your contacts, open WhatsApp, forward the message you want checked, and hit send. The feature works in over 20 languages, and, because it's Perplexity, you'll get links to the sources for the facts, providing you with the receipts to prove to whoever made the claim that they are wrong. Let’s say your cousin shares a sketchy video about some major global event or celebrity death. You don’t have to leave WhatsApp, open your browser, do a deep search, then return to the group. You can just forward the post to Perplexity’s number and get a result and the quiet moral satisfaction of knowing you're right without needing to launch a full group argument. Keeping quiet also sidesteps the question of privacy. After all, they may not approve of you sharing their messages and images with an AIchatbotwithout their permission. Few would feel good about their private messages being used as “factual errors” to train an AI. Meta AI might get away with it through the terms and conditions of WhatsApp, as they are both owned by Meta, but how that works with regard to Perplexity is less clear. You can now forward any WhatsApp message to Perplexity: +1 (833) 436-3285 and get it fact checked instantly. This is super useful when WhatsApp groups are filled with a ton of forwarded messages which could be misleading. pic.twitter.com/y1C8ZIj7d8May 1, 2025 The fact-checking is essentially just a narrower use case for Perplexity and its real-time web search capabilities. But it's a potentially very enticing element of the WhatsApp integration for Perplexity. Not that the AI developer is stopping with just that feature. The company has hinted at plans to expand beyond one-on-one message forwarding. You might see Perplexity popping up in your WhatsApp group chats like Meta AI does. Perplexity could possibly even be set up to respond automatically when sketchy messages drop. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Placing a fact-checker into WhatsApp won't necessarily convince anyone that they're wrong, but it might help you prove to yourself that you aren't losing your mind when an estranged relative insists that the moon disappeared for a week recently. Of course, there's still the social etiquette to figure out. Will forwarding a relative’s post for fact-checking make Thanksgiving awkward? Possibly. But if they’re circulating “garlic water cures baldness,” maybe that’s a small price to pay.

    "article_text": "Spotify can move fast when it wants to When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. That was quick. Just one day aftera US federal judge told Apple to loosen its grip on the App Store, Spotify has issued an app update – already live in the App Store – that'll enable customers to subscribe without going throughApple. The update was approved by Apple and lets Spotify include details about subscription plans and promotional offers that are available outside the App Store on Spotify's website. Spotify has been a vocal critic of App Store rules and was inbullish moodfollowing the ruling from a US federal judge. Previously, Apple heavily restricted how much app developers could advertise and link to payment options outside the App Store, where Apple takes a 30% cut from in-app payments. But the speediness of Spotify's move has got some subscribers asking a question: if Spotify can address this overnight, why hasn't it fixed some of the most annoying missing features for Apple devices? One potential answer, of course, is that adding non-Apple subscription links makes money and making Spotify play nicer with Apple doesn't. For Apple listeners, two of the biggest omissions are AirPlay 2 support and native HomePod integration, both of which have been possible for years. Spotify has chosen not to implement them and as a result streaming Spotify on HomePods or to AirPlay devices is a bit of a pain. The reason multiple streamers – Pandora was here too – didn't embrace HomePods was because when you asked them to play music they would always go to Apple Music. But that was addressed five years ago when Apple enabled you to specify other music apps as your default music player, and Pandora promptly changed its app accordingly. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. But by then Spotify was feuding with Apple over App Store fees and in no mood to play nice with its perceived oppressor. It filed its first anti-trust complaint in Europe in 2019. As subscriberbtz1put it on the Spotify Community site, only having first-gen AirPlay means that \"this outdated technology presents several limitations that directly impact our enjoyment\". Those limits include interruptions in the audio, limited bandwidth compared to AirPlay 2 and lack of multi-room support. In a later comment in the same thread, btz1 says \"I feel punished for wanting to use Spotify in the Apple ecosystem.\" Clearly, Spotify has the resources to make big changes to its app and to make them quickly. So perhaps now it can escape Apple's \"app tax\" it can put some of them towards improving Apple subscribers' experience with the features they've been asking for for years.

    "article_text": "Chuwi CoreBook X i9-13900HK is a solid upgrade When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chinese laptop maker Chuwi has announced a new version of its CoreBook X notebook, powered by a 13th genIntelCore i9-13900HK “Raptor Lake” processor. This chip was released back in Q1 2023 and has 14-cores and 20-threads and can reach clock speeds of up to 5.4GHz. It comes with integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, so will offer reasonable performance for tasks such as content creation, productivity, and light gaming. However, it’s a shame there’s no discrete GPU option for those needing more graphical oomph though. The new CoreBook X i9-13900HK has 32GB of DDR4 RAM, upgradable to 96GB, and a 1TB PCIe SSD. You can add a second M.2 2280 SSD if you need more storage. The laptop measures around 12 x 9 x 0.7 inches and has a 14-inch 2K (2160 x 1440) IPS display with a 3:2 aspect ratio that covers 100% of the sRGB color gamut and offers an 85% screen-to-body ratio. It weighs in at 3.09lb (1.4kg) and has a backlit keyboard and a 5.8-inch touchpad. CoreBook X i9-13900HK comes with a 46.2Wh battery, which Chuwi says will provide up to 8 hours between charges. Fast-charging support allows it to reach 60% in under an hour. The laptop’s cooling system features dual copper pipes and a dedicated fan to keep the temperature down when under load. It comes with a full-featured USB-C port, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, HDMI, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a microSD card slot. Wireless connectivity is Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2.

    "article_text": "Both Republicans and Democrats agree on move When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Shockingly, under past procurement contracts, the US Army hasn’t always held the right to repair its own equipment - but both Democrats and Republicans agree this now has to change. The US Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll and General Randy George, US Army Chief of staff, have issued anannouncementconfirming a “comprehensive transformation strategy,” which will, “reexamine all requirements and eliminate unnecessary ones, ruthlessly prioritize fighting formations to directly contribute to lethality, and empower leaders at echelon to make hard calls to ensure resources align with strategic objectives.” The strategy, named the Army Transformation Initiative, has three sides; “deliver critical warfighting capabilities, optimize our force structure, and eliminate waste and obsolete programs.” This change is part of a broader effort being implemented by current Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, who released a memo encouraging the US to “transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems.” Hegseth urges the US Army to “Identify and propose contract modifications for right to repair provisions where intellectual property constraints limit the Army's ability to conduct maintenance and access the appropriate maintenance tools, software, and technical data - while preserving the intellectual capital of American industry,” as well as to “seek to include right to repair provisions in all existing contracts and also ensure these provisions are included in all new contracts. Firms holding government contracts like Lockheed Martin and Boeing often use expensive equipment and installers in order to repair and service broken parts, but this initiative would enable military professionals to print 3D spares in the field and install them more cheaply and quickly.

    "title": "ChatGPT could have multiple preset personalities for you to interact with in the future, to help combat its sycophantic personality problem",
    "article_text": "Why OpenAI rolled back ChatGPT 4o and what they’re doing about it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAIhas addressed the rollback of the most recent update toChatGPT-4o because of user complaints about its annoying, sycophantic personality. In anApril 29 blog postOpenAI states: “We have rolled back last week’s GPT‑4o update inChatGPTso people are now using an earlier version with more balanced behavior. The update we removed was overly flattering or agreeable – often described as sycophantic. We are actively testing new fixes to address the issue. We’re revising how we collect and incorporate feedback to heavily weight long-term user satisfaction and we’re introducing more personalization features, giving users greater control over how ChatGPT behaves.” The blog post goes into further reasons for why the problem happened, but the crux of the matter is that OpenAI focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. OpenAI promises to refine its core training techniques and systems prompts to explicitly steer the model away from sycophancy in the future, as well as allow for more user testing before deploying models. From reading the blog post, you get the sense that OpenAI feels like it has dropped the ball on this one and is doing all it can to make amends. As well as issuing the statement, Joanne Jang, its Head of Model Behavior, has just done an‘ask me anything’ (AMA) on Reddit, to answer any further questions people may have, specifically about ChatGPT’s personality, sycophancy, and future model behavior. Her replies revealed interesting insights into what the future might hold for ChatGPT’s personality: Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Reddit user Responsible_Cow2236 asked, “Where do you see the future of model behavior heading? Are we moving toward more customizable personalities, like giving users tools to shape how ChatGPT sounds and interacts with them over time?\" Jang responded by offering the possibility that ChatGPT could come with multiple preset personalities: “We’ve been working on two things: (1) getting to a default personality that might be palatable for all users to begin with (not feasible but we need to get somewhere) and (2) instead of relying on users to describe / come up with personalities on their own, offering presets that are easier to comprehend (e.g. personality descriptions vs. 30 sliders on traits)\", said Jang. The idea of preset personalities in ChatGPT is an intriguing one and something I could see combining well with the different voices that ChatGPT advanced voice mode already offers. As for when we can expect the next update to ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI is not saying anything at the moment beyond “We fell short and are working on getting it right.” Graham is the Senior Editor for AI at TechRadar.

    "title": "TikTok hit by a €530 million fine in the EU for illegally sending Europeans' data to China",
    "article_text": "TikTok has rejected the EU data watchdog's decision and plans to appeal When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Irish EU Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined TikTok a total of €530 million (the equivalent of a bit more than $600 million) for illegally sending Europeans' data to China, where its parent company, ByteDance, is based. Specifically, TikTok was found in breach of two articles of the EU data protection law,GDPR, for not fulfilling its obligations concerning data transfers to China and transparency. The video streaming app now has six months to bring its data processing into compliance or suspend any transfers to China. TikTok has firmly rejected the data regulator's decision and plans to appeal in full. As the DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle highlights in anofficial statement, the GDPR requires that the high level of protection provided within the European Union continues where personal data is transferred to other countries. That's something TikTok seems to have failed to do. \"TikTok’s personal data transfers to China infringed the GDPR because TikTok failed to verify, guarantee, and demonstrate that the personal data of EEA users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,\" said Doyle. Specifically, the EU data watchdog found TikTok to have breached two GDPR articles: Article 46(1), which regulates its transfers of EEA User Data to China, and its transparency obligations ruled by Article 13(1)(f). The DPC then issued two administrative fines of €485 million and €45 million, respectively. Such a failure to fulfill GDPR requirements, Doyle noted, didn't enable the video streaming platform to address potential access by Chinese authorities to EEA personal data under Chinese anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, and other laws. The problem for TikTok may not end here, though. TikTok was also found guilty of giving the DPC erroneous information about where Europeans' data where stored. The company first ensured these were not stored on servers based in China. Yet, this allegation was then contradicted in April 2025 when TikTok admitted to having discovered in February 2025 some limited EEA user data on Chinese servers. The DPC is set to publish a decision on this matter in due course. Commenting on this point, Doyle said: \"Whilst TikTok has informed the DPC that the data has now been deleted, we are considering what further regulatory action may be warranted, in consultation with our peer EU Data Protection Authorities.\" TikTok said to disagree with the DPC decision and be ready to appeal all charges. \"The decision fails to fully considerProject Clover,our €12 billion industry-leading data security initiative that includes some of the most stringent data protections anywhere. It instead focuses on a select period from years ago, prior to Clover’s 2023 implementation and does not reflect the safeguards now in place,\" said Christine Grahn, TikTok's Head of Public Policy & Government Relations for Europe, in anofficial statement. This isn't, however, the first time TikTok has been fined in Europe for breaching data protection law. In 2023, the DPC issued a€345 million fineagainst TikTok for violating children's privacy.

    "title": "I took my Meta Quest 3 on a 3,000-mile flight so you don’t have to – here's what I learned",
    "article_text": "My in-flight Quest 3 experience was somewhat turbulent When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've been testing VR headsets for years, but before a recent trip from London to Miami I’d never taken one with me on a flight – and until some key things change, I probably won't take one with me again, based on my experience. Normally I adore myMeta Quest 3– I think everyone should own one, or aMeta Quest 3S, given how superb these VR machines are for their price – and having seen stories of Meta's success inoffering them as in-flight entertainment on Lufthansa airlinesI believed I'd have an excellent time flying with one too. However, my troubles began before we took off – in fact, they began before I’d even left home. Checking Meta's app store I was surprised to find no ‘flight-approved’ category that would easily supply me with software recommendations. And searching for movie downloads was much more of a challenge than I expected. While the Quest supports streaming platforms like Netflix, the browser-based (rather than app-based) reveals displays its faults clearly. In this form it's an online-only service as it's impossible to download content to watch later offline, as you can with the phone app. Eventually I sourced a digital copy ofAvengers: Endgamein 3D, but it wasn't a hassle-free process – far from it. I also found a mixed-reality chess game I thought might be fun, not realizing it was an online-only title until I was in the air. After my meal had been served and the seat belt sign had been switched off so I could fetch it from my stowed bag, I donned my Quest 3 and dove into the metaverse, armed with my limited entertainment selection. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Avengers: Endgamewas superb. Not just the movie itself (I haven’t watched it since the midnight release showing years ago and I’d forgotten how great it was) but the overall experience. I had installed Bigscreen – a free app which transports you to different cinema screen environments to watch movies in – but ended up just using the Meta TV app in mixed-reality mode. I could dim my surroundings and enlarge the screen so it felt like I was in my own private movie theatre, but I wasn't shut off from my surroundings, so I could pay attention if a flight attendant walked past with food or drink. It was leagues ahead of the dinky screen installed in my seat that I'd have had to rely on for entertainment otherwise. Not being in VR helped during turbulence too. Because I could see the real world shaking thanks to the MR passthrough feed I didn't feel particularly nauseous during the ordeal, something I suspect wouldn’t be the case had I been in VR. Software selection woes aside, my next biggest concern was battery life. I was able to watch one hour ofEndgamein mixed reality using just under 50% of my Quest 3's battery life. With a charging cable and power bank I could extend this use time, but relying solely on the Quest 3 as inflight entertainment for a long voyage would clearly be a challenge. You could mitigate this with an add-on like the one of theKiwi Design battery strapsI've reviewed, but then you’d run into the next problem: bag space. Baggage space on an airline comes at a premium, and filling your carry on with a fully kitted out VR headset setup is a non starter. So I replaced the bulky battery strap with the more compact (and less functional) elastic strap. This reduced the space the Quest 3 took up considerably, but it still wasn't compact – especially with the controllers. With these battery and space issues in mind it feels like a VR headset would be ideal for a shorter (sub-four-hour journey) where you’re struggling for baggage space across the hold and cabin so carrying the headset wouldn’t be a problem. I should also note that I was flying in Virgin Atlantic's premium economy section, rather than standard economy, and the only seat next to me was vacant. Moreover, I was sitting at the front of the section, in a seat with extra leg room, so I had plenty of space to move around. In a more tightly packed economy seat I could see myarmmovements being annoying to any stranger unlucky enough to be sitting next to me, making VR way too impractical (and risky) to be viable outside of more premium classes. Mixed reality would be more practical, but it’s also more of a battery sink, as I discovered. Despite these issues I could see how close the Meta Quest 3 is to greatness, and how the in-flight experience could be improved with a few upgrades. More subtle motion controls (like those theApple Vision Prouses) would eliminate the risk of whacking an innocent passenger with my arm flails. A bigger in built battery would be ideal too, as would a simpler way to find and download movies to the headset. The big-screen movie experience, especially with a 3D movie, was truly fantastic, and it just serves to highlight why Meta and others must do more to improve this aspect of VR as finding even one 3D movie was a major hassle. And using the headset, even in mixed reality, helped me forget I was on a flight. I'm not an especially nervous flier, but I'll admit to feeling a little tense while in the air, and that tension was noticeably absent when using my Quest 3. So while I won't be taking my Meta headset on my next long-haul flight, I can see a future where it becomes my go-to travel gadget. For now, though, it'll be staying at home, and I'll take my AR glasses instead.

    "article_text": "The long wait seems to be coming to an end When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsungis finally rolling out One UI 7 to older Galaxy phones in the US, following months of delays and ambiguity over the launch of the Korean tech titan’s latest mobileoperating system. As reported byAndroid Authority, Samsung is now rolling out its most recent OS version update to the full range of supported handsets, after theGalaxy S24series got the update in April 2025. The full list of devices included in this latest stage of One UI 7’s long-troubled rollout includes: As perSamMobile's list of One UI 7-supported devices, this means that once the rollout has completed, One UI 7 will finally be available on all supported Galaxy S and Galaxy Z phones in the US. Presumably, other regions will follow suit soon. Notably, the Android Authority report doesn’t mention whether this latest release will bring One UI 7 to any Galaxy A series phones – while the recently released Galaxy A26, Galaxy A36, andGalaxy A56all run One UI 7 out of the box, we’ve not heard so much about previous generations. Samsung has seemingly struggled to get One UI 7 off the ground. The Android 15-based operating system launched with the Samsung Galaxy S25 series in January, though this was officially a pre-release build of the software. Here at TechRadar, we’ve reported extensively on the various updates and rumors surrounding One UI 7 and its prolonged release through our dedicatedSamsung Galaxy phonescoverage – but now, it seems like an end is in sight. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, withGooglegetting closer to the launch ofAndroid 16, it’s worth asking whether this delay will affect Samsung’s update schedule going forwards. We recently reported onsupposedly leaked images that show an early version of One UI 8running on aSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, but there’s no telling when this update might arrive. Let’s not get too ahead of ourselves, though – this is a great moment for Samsung Galaxy owners, and whileI haven't exactly been impressed with the rollout of One UI 7, it is good to see Samsung pull through. Now that Samsung’s latest software update isn’t limited to only thebest Samsung phones, many more users will gain access to its overhauled UI, new Now Bar feature, and reworked notifications system, among other new features.

Despite being the company's CEO since its founding in 1993,Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been drawing the same salary from the company for a number of years - however a recentSEC filinghas revealed Huang just got his major first salary increase in a decade. Rising from $996,514 in 2024 and $996,832 in 2023, Huang received a $1,486,199 salary in fiscal 2025, marking a not-insignificant 49% year-over-year increase. In reality, various other components make up Huang's total compensation, the biggest being $38.8 million in stock awards in 2025, leaving him with a hefty $49,866,251 package at the end of the year. Besides the salary increase, rises in other compensation saw the Nvidia leader get nearly $15.7 million more in 2025 compared with 2024, marking an equally healthy 46% jump. Salaries for CFO Colette M Kress, Worldwide Field Operations SVP Ajay K Puri, Operations EVP Debora Shoquist and General Counsel and Secretary EVP Timothy S Teter remained stable year-over-year, but total compensation of the four Named Executive Officers (NEOs) rose by 59-74%. It's not just compensations that have rise in the past year, though. In February, Nvidia declared a staggering 114% growth in annual revenue compared with the year before, noting a 78% year-over-year increase to its fourth-quarter revenue alone. Yearly revenue stood at $130.5 billion, compared with $60.9 billion the year before, and $27.0 billion and $26.9 billion in the two preceding years.

    "article_text": "\"We will lower prices for users by up to 30%,\" said Proton's CEO When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Proton could lower its pricing by up to 30% after a US judge found Apple guilty of violating a federal injunction over illegal monopoly. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple willfully violated her injunction issued in 2021 in theEpic Games case. The Big Tech giant was supposed to halt anti-competitive practices by giving third-party developers more power to redirect users to cheaper non-Apple payment options. Proton, the provider of one of thebest VPNandsecure emailapps, has welcomed the ruling as a victory against Big Tech. \"Proton will finally be allowed to let iOS users purchase subscriptions outside of the App Store. No Apple tax means we will lower prices for users by up to 30%,\" wrote the company's CEO, Andy Yen, on X. In response to the recent court ruling in the US against Apple's illegal in-app purchase monopoly, @ProtonPrivacy will finally be allowed to let iOS users purchase subscriptions outside of the app store. No Apple tax means we will lower prices for users by up to 30%.May 1, 2025 Yen also pointed out how such a court decision could help cut inflation in the US, too, \"by dropping the price of a significant chunk of digital purchases by 30% overnight\". The Fortnite maker sued Apple in 2020 to challenge the up-to-30% cut the Big Tech provider takes from App Store purchases. \"It's about choice. Apple can charge whatever fee they want for their payment system. But we are now free to offer an alternative option that is up to 30% cheaper. For the first time, the user can decide for themselves (pay Apple 30%, or save 30%),\" said Yen. It's too early to say how this will affectProton VPNandProton Mailusers in the US and beyond. We approached Proton for clarification, but are still waiting for a response at the time of publication. Nonetheless, on May 2, 2025, Spotify confirmed that Apple has finally approved an update to allow the music streaming giant to freely show clear pricing information and links to purchase, fostering transparency and choice for US consumers. \"We can now give consumers lower prices, more control, and easier access to the Spotify experience.

Other barriers and requirements were also enforced to discourage customers from using competing purchasing platforms, said the Judge asreported by the BBC. Besides allegedly promoting an illegal in-app purchase monopoly, the company is also facing a criminal contempt investigation as the judge found Apple's vice-president of finance, Alex Roman, \"outright lied under oath.\" Apple is said to \"strongly disagree\" with the judge's decision. \"We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal,\" said an Apple spokesperson.

    "article_text": "“NullBulge” deployed credential stealing malware When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A Santa Clara man who created an AI image generation tool that deployed hidden malware has pleaded guilty to stealing over 1.1 TB of internal company data after illegally accessing Disney’s internal Slack channels. The hacker, Ryan Mitchell Kramer, who went by the name “NullBulge” was charged with one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Californiareported. The incident had wide reaching consequences, withDisney choosing to ditch Slack in favour of Microsoft teams following the breach. Over 10,000 Slack channels were involved in the incident, and confidential data including internal communications and sensitive information like images, source code and credentials were compromised. Kramer reportedly accepted a plea deal, pleading guilty to the two felony charges that each carry a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison - but he has not yet been sentenced. The plea deal outlines that in early 2024, Kramer “posted a computer program on various online platforms, including GitHub, that purported to be computer program that could be used to create A.I.-generated art. In fact, the program contained a malicious file that enabled Kramer to gain access to victims’ computers.” After the victim downloaded the malicious file, Kramer accessed Disney’s information through the victim’s personal computer, where he stored login credentials for personal and professional accounts. After the hacker accessed these accounts, he downloaded over 1.1TB of data from Disney, which was then publicly released alongside the victims bank, medical, and personal information.

    "title": "Germany ‘has rebuilt the Berlin Wall’ – Vance",
    "article_text": "US Vice President J.D. Vance has compared the German government’s treatment of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to rebuilding the Berlin Wall. On Friday, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, classified the anti-immigration AfD as an“extremist”organization, citing“xenophobic, anti-minority, Islamophobic, and anti-Muslim statements made by leading party officials.”The label enables police to closely monitor the party’s activities. “The AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,”Vance wrote on X. “The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt – not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment,”he added. The party’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, accused the government of attempting to quell dissent.“Since the AfD is the strongest party in polls now, they want to suppress the opposition & freedom of speech,”she wrote on X. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a backlash to Germany’s handling of the eurozone debt crisis. It has since shifted focus to demanding tighter immigration and asylum laws and opposing the“woke agenda.”The party also criticizes NATO and has staged protests against sending weapons to Ukraine. The AfD finished second in the federal elections in February, winning 152 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag. Last month, it topped opinion polls for the first time, with 26% support. The party is especially popular in the economically underdeveloped regions of former East Germany. The AfD has also been embroiled in controversy, as some members have had links to far-right and neo-Nazi groups or used slogans associated with Nazi Germany. Major German parties have refused to form coalitions and work with the AfD as part of the so-called ‘firewall against the far-right’. Vance criticized efforts to isolate the party during a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February.“Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There is no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t,”the US vice president said. The Berlin Wall was built by East Germany in 1961 to stop its citizens from fleeing to West Berlin. It remained in place throughout the Cold War until it was torn down in 1989, leading to German reunification.",

    "title": "Germany is ‘tyranny in disguise’ – Rubio",
    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sharply criticized Berlin for designating Alternative for Germany (AfD), the country’s most popular party according to recent polling, as“extremist.”Such actions have nothing to do with democracy, he has warned. “Germany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,”America’s top diplomat wrote on X on Friday.“That’s not democracy – it’s tyranny in disguise.” Earlier in the day, the German domestic security service (BfV) announced the decision to officially designate AfD a“confirmed extremist entity.”This legal status allows the BfV to deploy surveillance and intelligence measures to monitor the party’s activities without restriction. Explaining the move, the agency cited“the extremist nature of the entire party, which disregards human dignity.”It pointed to the party’s“prevailing understanding of the people based on ethnicity and descent,”which it said was“incompatible with the democratic basic order.”The AfD has long been known for its harsh anti-immigration stance. “What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD… but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes,”Rubio argued, calling on Berlin to“reverse its course.”The right-wing party has been enjoying steady support from Washington ever since US President Donald Trump entered the White House for his second term. US Vice President J.D. Vance strongly criticized politicians who shun parties such as the AfD at the Munich Security Conference in February. US-based billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk has repeatedly openly expressed support for the party. In January, ahead of the German parliamentary vote, he hosted a livestream on X with AfD co-leader and then chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel. The party came in second during the February election, behind the center-right Christian Democrats, which ruled out any coalitions with the AfD. Recent polls show the two parties being neck-and-neck, with one survey published by Forsa Institute putting AfD one percent point ahead of their center-right rivals.",

    "title": "‘Don’t rush’ to ban AfD – Scholz",
    "article_text": "Berlin should not rush into trying to ban the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Friday. Earlier in the day, a lengthy report by Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) classified the populist party as“extremist,”accusing it of being racist in its anti-migrant rhetoric, and of showing signs of acting against the country’s democracy. The classification opens the door to a potential ban, and for the domestic spy agency to increase surveillance of the AfD, as is the case with extremist groups such as the Islamic State. “I think this is something that cannot be rushed into,”Scholz said when asked about banning the AfD outright. He went on to point out that Germany’s“Federal Constitutional Court has rejected all recent applications for bans.” He referred to Germany’s numerous unsuccessful past attempts to outlaw the former nationalist National Democratic Party (NDP) as an example of the legal troubles that could follow trying to ban the AfD. The NDP weathered years of federal attempts to prohibit it, changing its name to The Homeland in 2023. The party did not run in the 2025 German elections. The AfD, which has seen a surge in popularity in the polls in recent months, has condemned the BfV report as a“severe blow to the German democracy.” “The AfD is the strongest party in current polls… Nevertheless, the AfD, as an opposition party, is now being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before the change of government,”co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said in a joint statement. A Forsa poll from last month indicated that AfD had overtaken incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the most popular political party in the country.",

    "title": "Ukraine can’t reclaim lost territory – Rubio",
    "article_text": "Ukraine will not be able to reclaim its 2014 borders from Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has publicly stated he will never recognize the lost territories, including Crimea, as Russian. The peninsula voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in 2014, shortly after the US-backed armed coup in Kiev. Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk and Lugansk regions held their own referendums in 2022 to become part of Russia. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Keith Kellogg told Fox News that Kiev has expressed a willingness to cede land de facto, if not de jure, as part of a peace deal. “Ukraine can’t push the Russians all the way back to where they were in 2014,”Rubio said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. After months of US-brokered peace efforts, Washington has a pretty clear idea of what both sides want, the top US diplomat noted. “We kind of can see what it would take for Ukraine to stop. We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop,”he said, adding that Moscow’s and Kiev’s settlement demands are still“far apart.” “It’s going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible, or I think the President is going to have to make a decision about how much more time we’re going to dedicate to this,”Rubio said. Both Trump and Rubio have previously warned that the US could walk away from being a peace broker in the Ukraine conflict, if there is no progress soon. “Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what’s happening with China is more important,”Rubio said, adding that Iran is another US concern. Moscow has repeatedly stated that its peace terms include Ukraine’s neutrality, demilitarization and denazification, as well as for Kiev to give up its ambitions to join NATO. Also, ceding the new Russian regions of Kherson, Zaporozhye and the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics is not up for discussion, Russian President Vladimir Putin said last year. Should Kiev abandon plans to join the US-led military bloc and withdraw its troops from the four new territories, Moscow is ready to institute an immediate ceasefire, he added.",

    "title": "Macron attempts to interfere with papal conclave – media",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to influence the upcoming papal conclave in favor of a French candidate to become the next Pope, several conservative Italian media outlets have claimed. The reports emerged following meetings between the French leader and several cardinal electors, as well as a leader of an influential Catholic movement ahead of the conclave set to determine Francis’ successor. Macron had lunch with four of the five cardinal electors of French descent, including Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille, last Saturday on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. The pontiff passed away on April 21. Last Friday, the French president also had dinner at a restaurant in Rome with Andrea Riccardi, the head of the Community of Sant’Egidio, a powerful Catholic association with more than 70,000 lay members in 74 countries, and which reportedly has clout over some members of the upcoming conclave. According to the Italian daily Il Tempo, the French leader asked the cardinals about ways to build a consensus around Aveline. The outlet called the cardinal – who is considered a contender to become the next Pope – an“ultra-European, anti-sovereignist”and“one of the most liberal”members of the conclave. The daily also described the meetings as an example of“interventionism worthy of a new Sun King,”in an apparent reference to France’s 17th century King Louis XIV, who sought to influence the election of a Pope through French cardinals. Another Italian paper, La Verita, directly accused Macron of seeking to choose the next Pope. The Elysee Palace did not officially comment on the agenda of the two meetings. The Community of Sant’Egidio denied the allegations, telling Le Monde on Thursday that Macron“seeks to understand the process, not influence it.” Conservative Italian media linked the president’s actions to his desire to regain international influence and mend ties with the Holy See, which reportedly soured under Pope Francis. These claims caught the attention of French news outlets, including Le Monde, which said their Italian colleagues were spreading“rumors,”reflecting the mutual distrust between Paris and Rome. A conclave involving 135 cardinals is set to convene at the Vatican on May 7 to elect the next Pope.",

    "title": "EU to tap frozen Russian funds – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear is set redistribute around €3 billion ($3.4 billion) of frozen Russian funds, Reuters reported on Friday. The money will reportedly be used to compensate Western investors whose assets are stranded in Russia. The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that doing so would amount to“theft,”contravening international law. A number of Western states froze an estimated €264 billion worth of Russian sovereign and private funds following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Around €200 billion is currently held by Euroclear. The assets have already generated billions in interest, of which €1.55 billion was transferred to Ukraine in July 2024. Euroclear will redistribute €3 billion from a pool of €10 billion in cash belonging to Russian entities and individuals blacklisted by the EU as part of Ukraine-related sanctions, according to two sources cited by the news agency. “We received authorization from our competent authority to unfreeze the compensation amounts and make these available to our participants,”Reuters cites a briefing document dated April 1 as saying. The agency noted that changes to the bloc’s sanctions regime, adopted late last year, allow for these disbursements to Western investors. According to two Reuters sources, Moscow has recently seized €3 billion held by Euroclear at a depository in Russia to compensate Russian investors affected by Western sanctions. In November, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Moscow would use the income from the frozen assets of Western investors in response to similar actions by the West. The issue of confiscating frozen Russian assets has been debated by EU lawmakers for more than three years, but member states have so far failed to arrive at a consensus. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has repeatedly called for the funds to be tapped and transferred to support Ukraine’s reconstruction. Last month, she acknowledged that some member states still oppose the move. The Russian authorities have initiated around 100 court actions against Euroclear, one source told Reuters, without providing details on their status. Moscow has condemned the asset freeze, arguing that it violates international law and undermines the global financial system. The Kremlin previously stated that it plans to launch legal action against those involved in the seizure of its assets.",

    "title": "AfD is ‘extremist’ – German intel agency",
    "article_text": "Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has officially designated the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) as an“extremist”party. The designation comes despite the AfD leading national opinion polls. In a statement on Friday, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said that the AfD exhibits numerous signs of a party acting against the free democratic basic order while accusing it of“disregarding human dignity.”The assessment was made based on an“intensive and comprehensive expert review”of the party’s activities, including its affiliations and statements by party members. At the core of the decision is what the agency described as the party’s“understanding of people predominantly based on their ethnic descent.”According to the BfV, AfD leaders promote policies that exclude German citizens with migrant backgrounds – particularly Muslims – from full societal participation. The report also flagged the party’s use of terms such as“knife-wielding migrants”and its attribution of violent tendencies to non-European ethnic groups. “The continuous incitement against refugees and migrants… promotes the spread and deepening of prejudices, resentment, and fears,”the BfV concluded. AfD co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla have condemned the decision.“Today’s classification is a severe blow to German democracy,”they said in a joint statement.“The AfD is the strongest party in current polls… Nevertheless, the AfD, as an opposition party, is now being publicly discredited and criminalized shortly before the change of government.” Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against any hasty decisions regarding imposing any restrictions on the party.“I think this is something that cannot be rushed into,”Scholz said when asked about banning the AfD outright. The BfV’s statement comes after a new Forsa poll released last month indicated that the AfD has 26% support, ahead of Germany’s Christian Democrats (25%) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (15%). The AfD has continued to gain traction amid voter dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and rising concerns over immigration and the economy. Despite the high level of support for the AfD indicated by polls, the federal election two months ago was won by the Christian Democrats, who signaled that they had no intention of cooperating with right-wing parties.",

    "title": "US-Ukraine minerals deal ‘hides secret agreements’ – Ukrainian MP",
    "article_text": "The US-Ukraine minerals agreement announced this week“hides”details of Kiev’s“indefinite obligations”to Washington, a Ukrainian lawmaker has claimed. In a Facebook post on Friday, Irina Gerashchenko, a member of European Solidarity party said the deal includes two“secret,”supplementary documents that will not be subject to parliamentary ratification. The minerals deal reportedly grants the US preferential access to Ukrainian mining projects in exchange for assistance with an investment fund to support the country’s reconstruction. Initially portrayed by Washington as repayment forbears of military support – estimated at $350 billion by President Donald Trump – the final text, published on Thursday by the Ukrainian government, states that only future aid will count toward US contributions to the fund. Gerashchenko claimed however that instead of one agreement, the US and Ukraine signed three. “The Zelensky government has not provided deputies and society with all the agreements signed in the US, which, as it turned out, are three, not one,”she wrote.“Meanwhile, they want to ratify only one framework document in the Verkhovna Rada. Others are labeled ‘implementation documents,’ despite the fact that it is in these two secret agreements that all the technical details of indefinite Ukrainian obligations are hidden.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal“avoided”commenting on the two documents and the lack of securityguaranteesin the published agreement – reportedly a key point of contention during negotiations – Gerashchenko told the country’s parliament on Friday. The claim has raised questions among Ukrainian lawmakers and the public on the actual scope of the agreement. MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak claimed on Telegram that, when pressed, Shmigal acknowledged the two additional documents but downplayed them as“technical”and exempt from ratification. The texts“must be signed after the ratification”of the main agreement, Shmigal claimed, noting that lawmakers would see them when the Ukrainian negotiating team returns from the US next week. Western media reports have also noted the existence of additional documents and claimed that a last-minute dispute arose when Washington demanded Kiev sign all three. Ukrainian officials reportedly argued they could not sign the annexes until the main agreement was ratified in Parliament. Later reports suggested all three documents were ultimately signed. Further details about the contents of the supplementary documents have not been publicly released, and the Ukrainian government has not issued an official statement addressing their existence or content.",

    "article_text": "The US has begun sharing its“most sensitive”military intelligence on China’s and Russia’s space operations with the UK and other members of The Five Eyes (FVEY) global intelligence group, The Times has reported, citing a senior commander within the US Space Force. Until this month, the work of Space Delta 9, a unit focused on America’s orbital warfare, was largely meant only for US officials with top-secret security clearance. However, in a move that a Space Delta 9 spokesman described to The Times as“momentous,”British military chiefs have been allowed to observe operations at the unit's base in Colorado. The other Five Eyes members, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, have also been allowed access to the highest levels of US space intelligence, the British daily reported on Wednesday. The Times attributed the development to Beijing and Moscow allegedly developing“new space capabilities,”such as dual use satellites, and orbiters designed for both civilian and military applications. ”We have to be ready for that fight that nobody wants to have,”Colonel Ramsey Horn, commander of Space Delta 9, told the paper. He went on to claim that the unit is“more ready”than ever to engage in combat in space. The US Defense Department has accused China of stockpiling anti-satellite weapons, raising concerns over what it describes as Beijing’s increasing emphasis on space warfare. Chinese officials have rejected the claims and argued that militarization of space by the US poses the real threat to global stability. Washington has made similar allegations against Russia, suggesting that Moscow may possess covert anti-satellite systems, potentially with nuclear capabilities. The Kremlin has dismissed the claims as baseless attempts to deflect attention from America’s own military ambitions in space. Both Russia and China have consistently stated their opposition to the weaponization of space and have advocated for keeping space a domain reserved for peaceful use.",

    "title": "English football bosses ban men from women’s game",
    "article_text": "Transgender athletes will no longer be allowed to compete in women’s football in England, according to the country’s Football Association (FA). The policy change was prompted by a UK Supreme Court ruling. The participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports has been a hot topic in recent years. Some argue that this undermines fair competition, while others believe trans athletes should be included based on gender identity rather than their ‘assigned sex’ at birth. “Transgender women will no longer be able to play in women’s football in England, and this policy will be implemented from 1 June 2025,”the FA said in a statement released on Thursday, citing last month’s court ruling. On April 15, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the term ‘woman’ refers to biological sex, not gender identity, meaning that transgender individuals who were born male are not legally considered women for the purposes of single-sex protections. The ruling comes after the ‘For Women Scotland’ campaign group challenged a Scottish law aimed at increasing the number of women on public boards, which included transgender women with legal recognition as female. Fewer than 30 transgender women are registered among millions of amateur players, with none currently playing in the professional game across the Home Nations, the BBC reported on Thursday, citing the FA. The ban comes a month after the association ruled that transgender women could continue to play in the women’s game as long as they keep their testosterone levels below 5 n/mol for at least 12 months. The Scottish Football Association has announced the same policy, saying it is banning transgender women from women’s football. At the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Chinese Taipei’s Lin Yu-ting found themselves at the center of controversy regarding gender verification in sports. The International Olympic Committee defended their participation, and both athletes won gold medals despite public outcry. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke out, expressing support for Italian boxer Angela Carini, who was defeated by Khelif in a 46-second bout. Commenting on Khelif’s victory, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that allowing biological male athletes to compete against females could lead to unintended consequences. In November last year, then-US President-elect Donald Trump also voiced his opposition to the committee’s decision to allow Khelif to compete against women.",

    "title": "Germany is weaponizing WWII memory against Russia",
    "article_text": "Eighty years ago, Germany suffered its worst self-induced military – as well as moral, political, cultural, you name it – catastrophe ever. First, Nazi Germany led the global fascist challenge that we call World War II. Then, Germany was not merely defeated but crushed by the combined efforts of, in order of importance, the Soviet Union, the US, and UK, to name only those powers that really mattered decisively for the outcome of the war in Europe. This Allied victory in Europe is celebrated in May. In the West, the commemorations peak on the 8th and in Russia, one day later. In Asia, things were different. World War II started earlier – in July 1937, not September 1939, and ended later – in August, not May, 1945. Regarding the war in Europe, the West has always, with varying intensity, sought to diminish the preponderant role of the Soviet Union – and within the latter, of Russia. Concerning the war in Asia, the West’s main target of this weaponized forgetfulness has been China,rightly labeled“the forgotten ally”by historian Rana Mitter. China, like the Soviet Union and now Russia, has always dared challenge Western hegemony and especially US ‘primacy’. And, as with Russia and the former Soviet Union, it is this geopolitical independence that has led the West to deny the Chinese people’s real and massive World War II contribution and sacrifices, which were enormous (the death toll alone, to quote only one figure, is estimatedat 12-20 million). But for now, back to the European part of the war. There, in historical reality, it was the Soviet Union that did the most – by far – to destroy Nazi Germany. And that is a simple, even quantifiable historical fact. Merely a decade ago, it was occasionally admitted even in Western mainstream media, such as America’sWashington Postand Britain’sIndependent. A few figures suffice to sketch just how predominant the Soviet share in the victory over Nazism was: Over the course of the war, in all its theaters, 17 to 18 million Germans served in the Nazi forces (including the Wehrmacht and the smaller but especially important and vicious Waffen-SS). At least 4 million German soldiers were killed in the fight against the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1945 alone. Estimates indicate that at least as many were injured, probably more; around 3 million became POWs. The upshot of this is simple: A massive chunk, some historians estimate up to 80%, of the total German fighting manpower of World War II – not only those who invaded the Soviet Union – was eliminated on what the Germans called the Eastern Front. Without going into easily available details, the picture is similar when we focus not on men but materiel. Ask, for instance, Google’s Gemini AI in Deep Research mode, and it will sum it up thus:“It is evident that the Eastern Front absorbed the vast majority of Germany’s total tank losses throughout the war.”It turns out that the failure of Germany’s touted Leopard tank in the Ukraine conflict has a long tradition reaching back to Nazi Germany’s Panthers and Tigers: Russia, neutering German cats since 1941. Put simply, as withSweden’s Gustav XIIand France’sNapoleon, it was Russia and the Soviet Union that broke Hitler’s back. And at enormous cost and sacrifice: Current, solid figures put Soviet losses (military and civilian combined)at 26-27 million. (Compare, for instance, with the US: Military casualties,according to Encyclopedia Britannica, just over 292,000; civilian losses were negligible, even if every individual death is, of course, tragic.) And now it is Germany – of all places – that has marred the run-up to this year’s May anniversary with an embarrassingly ugly scandal. Its essence is a German government attempt to crudely instrumentalize the commemorations to make them serve the propaganda war that has been part of the West’s proxy war in Ukraine, while accusing Russia of doing just that. In Germany, more and more often, every accusation is a confession, as they say about Israeli propaganda. While similar initiatives have occurred for years, this year, the German Foreign Office – still mismanaged by Annalena ‘360-Degrees-of-Russophobia’ Baerbock – has escalated the pettiness by circulatinga so-called Handreichung– officially, a sort of advice; unofficially, nasty arm-twisting – to insist that neither Russian nor Belarusian representatives should be invited to commemoration events and that, if they dare show up anyhow, they should be kicked out. The barbaric call to, in essence, kick out well-behaved diplomats as if they were brawlers at a pub, is encoded as a reference to ‘house rules’ to be enforced. But this is a shamelessly primitive euphemism, about as Teutonically klutzy as when the German authorities used to disappear their opponents into ‘protective custody’. The German mainstream media have mostly, once again, supported this harebrained and bigoted attempt to stick it to the Russians, as is fashionable again in the new-old Zeitenwende Germany of massive re-armament and ‘war fitness’ (Kriegstuechtigkeit –a term Nazi-infowarrior-in-chief Joseph Goebbels also used). As always,Ukrainian representativeshave done their best to misuse their always willingly available German media platforms to confirm Germans in their errors. TheGerman parliamenthas followed the Foreign Office and demonstratively excluded Russian and Belarusian diplomats from its commemorations. At least some of the heads of commemoration sites and museums are obeying the Foreign Office’s advice, or perhaps pursuing the same policy out of their own provincial dogmatism. Christian Wagner, who is responsible for sites in Thuringia,has explicitly barred Russian and Belarusian diplomats. Likewise, the head of commemoration sites in Brandenburg, Axel Drecoll,has boasted of disinviting the Russian ambassadorand of being ready to evict him – in cooperation with the ‘security forces’ – if he tries to attend. The good news is that there is resistance as well. Around the town of Seelow – a region with special importance because of the immense 1945Battle of the Seelow Heights– local politicians, including from Sarah Wagenknecht’s leftwing BSW, the centrist SPD, and also the mainstream-conservative CDU party, dared show themselves“astonished”by the Foreign Office’s“absurd”ideas. WhenRussian Ambassador Sergey Nechayev did attenda commemoration event,no one asked him to leave and – surprise, surprise – nothing terrible or scandalous happened. That’s because Russians, unlike quite a few Germans, it seems, still know how to behave with decency. To the credit of many other Germans, in Seelow, the ambassador was welcomed by a crowd showing theirsupport and respect. Nechayev also took part in commemorations in Torgau, where Soviet and US troops famously met toward the end of the war, and later,at the site of the former camp of Sachsenhausen,which was liberated by the Red Army in April 1945. There, as well, the hysterical fantasies of Germany’s Foreign Office proved simply irrelevant. In the Berliner Zeitung,songwriter and author Hans-Eckardt Wenzel sharply criticized the policy of weaponizing the memory of World War II against Russia. In particular, he took Axel Drecoll to task, challenging him, in effect, to stop his attempts at rewriting history. The German Foreign Office, meanwhile, has shown cold feet. It has begun to equivocate in a comically dishonest and self-revealing manner.When challenged about his ministry’s gratuitous initiativeagainst Russian and Belarusian representatives, its spokesman, Sebastian Fischer, outdid his usual stonewalling: The Foreign Office’s circular, he said, is not a prohibition because the individual memorial sites and museums retain the right to decide whether to follow it or not. Yes, sure, and we know from Hollywood that the Pirate Code is not really legally binding but more like, you know, sort of a recommendation. Russia has long pointed out that Western elites have become so habitually underhanded, so addicted to sophistry and casuistry that they are no longer ‘agreement-capable’. Thank you for selflessly illustrating, Mr. Fischer from the Foreign Office, that this collapse of a minimum of good faith holds true not only in their behavior abroad but at home as well. In reality, it is obvious that – despite Fischer’s transparent weaseling – the Foreign Office issued its directive to exert political and public-opinion pressure and do its worst to compel other institutions. To now discover that no one really meant to give orders is a cheap cop-out. But let’s be fair, for Germany, it’s at least a new one: From ‘I was just following orders’ to ‘We never really meant to give any.’ And they say Germans have learned nothing from their nasty past! In the same press conference, Fischer also failed to answer a crucial question: His ministry has argued that Russian and Belarusian representatives should be kept away and even kicked out if they dare show up in order to prevent any nefarious political instrumentalization. Yet, when reminded that similar concerns have been voiced for years now and asked to provide concrete examples of anything of the kind actually happening, Fischer drew an embarrassing blank. He mumbled something vague about some St. George’s ribbons – and that was it, all he could come up with. This from a strangely high-ranking spokesman for a country that has never really had an issue with quite a few of its new Ukrainian friends displaying stuff that is by any reasonable reckoning much worse, namely Nazi-style – and often just straightforward-Nazi – symbols. Talk about instrumentalizing the memory of World War II! It was left to a member of the German parliament from the Alternative for Germany party (AfD) to speak some plain truth:Steffen Kotre pointed outthat it is, actually, Germany’s“ideological policy”that“is instrumentalizing history.”For those out to“clobber the Russians ideologically,”the real history of World War II does not even matter. Exactly! It is not a pretty picture: The German authorities have revealed, once more, just how small-minded, historically illiterate, and fanatically Russophobic they are. The same politicians who have never failed to supportIsrael’s routine instrumentalization of the German crime of the Holocaustto cover for Israel’s own brutal crimes of apartheid and genocide against the Palestinians, have shown that they see Russia as a legitimate target of what can only be called memory warfare by dirty tricks. Of all countries, it is Russia, the one that – objectively, quantifiably – did the most to rid the world of the Nazism that Germans made, served, and fought for, which some Germans now feel they have to censure and offend demonstratively. Germany’s elites have serious problem not merely with memory but with elementary logic and basic decency.",

    "title": "US did most to win both world wars – Trump",
    "article_text": "The US played the most significant role in achieving victories in the two world wars, President Donald Trump claimed on Friday. Trump made the claim while announcing he has designated May 8 as Victory Day for WWII and November 11 Victory Day for WWI. Nazi Germany officially capitulated to the Allied forces on May 8, 1945, shortly after Soviet troops captured Berlin. The surrender took effect after midnight in Moscow. Traditionally, May 8 is observed as Victory in Europe Day, with Russia celebrating on May 9. ”Many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other Country, by far, in producing a victorious result on World War II,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Thursday. “Nobody was close”to the US“in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance,”Trump claimed.“We won both Wars,”he wrote, adding that“We are going to start celebrating our victories again!” Trump’s praise for the US military effort in Europe comes as he pressures fellow NATO member states to ratchet up their defense budgets. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that the EU must take responsibility for its own defense as the US is gradually stepping back from its security commitments on the continent. The US president has previously claimed that Russia“helped”the US win WWII, drawing a rebuke from Moscow. Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that while Russia is grateful to the US for its support during the Second World War via the Lend-Lease program, the Soviet Union would have beaten Nazi Germany anyway. The US does not officially observe any public holidays dedicated specifically to World War II. However, remembrance ceremonies have been held nationwide in May, August, and September for many years. On November 11, the US celebrates Veterans Day, commemorating the 1918 armistice , which suspended active hostilities and effectively ended the World War I.",

    "title": "Russia and Ukraine ‘closer’ to settlement – Rubio",
    "article_text": "Russia and Ukraine are closer to a peace agreement than at any point in the past three years, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. He cautioned, however, that the sides still need to bridge numerous differences to end the conflict. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Rubio reflected on efforts by US President Donald Trump to settle the Ukraine conflict, a promise he had made while still on the campaign trail. “For a hundred days he has done efforts to bring about peace… Look, we’ve gotten closer. We – for the first time – we haven’t known this for three years – we kind of can see what it would take for Ukraine to stop. We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop,”Rubio said. However, stark differences between Moscow and Kiev remain, the State Secretary noted.“They’re closer, but they’re still far apart. And it’s going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible… or I think the president is going to have to make a decision about how much more time we’re going to dedicate to this,”he added. His comments come as State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce affirmed that the US is committed to settling the conflict, but is“not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings.”Instead, she signaled that it is now up to Russia and Ukraine“to present and develop concrete ideas about how this conflict is going to end.” Last month, the Trump administration indicated that the US could withdraw from the peace process altogether if there is no clear indication of progress in the talks. Earlier media reports suggested that the US had proposed a peace agreement that includes Washington’s recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, as well as“freezing”the conflict along the current front line and acknowledging Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia. The deal would also reportedly prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and initiate a phased removal of the sanctions imposed on Russia. Russia has maintained that any peace settlement must include recognition of the new territorial reality on the ground, Ukraine’s demilitarization and denazification, as well as assurances that Kiev will not join NATO. Ukraine, however, has consistently refused to acknowledge its former territories as part of Russia.",

    "title": "‘Russophobia’ behind Romania’s expulsion of RT reporter – Tara Reade (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "The recent detention and deportation of RT correspondent Chay Bowes from Romania highlights growing“Russophobia”in the West, particularly in Western media, according to Tara Reade, an RT contributor and a former US Senate aide. The incident“says volumes”about Romania’s upcoming presidential election, Reade claimed, and questioned why the country would prevent international observers from attending. Bowes, an Irish journalist and EU citizen, was detained on Thursday after arriving in Bucharest to cover the election re-run, but was later deported to Istanbul. According to Bowes, Romanian authorities labeled him ‘a security threat’ – a notion Reade said she finds alarming. “I’m shocked that they have detained him… what does Romania have to hide? It makes you wonder, what is going on,”Reade said, speaking to RT on air following the news of Bowes’ detention. She tied the move to what she described as“Russophobia”and efforts by Western governments to suppress Russian-affiliated voices. “Russophobia has now spread so much to Western media, and has fueled this fear of any kind of journalist that might even work for [Russia]… It’s seeped through to every fabric of international conversations… it’s ridiculous, the Russophobia,”she said, calling the trend“really concerning, because we are living in a multipolar world and there’s no room for Russophobia anymore.” Romania’s presidential election re-run was ordered after last year’s results were annulled over alleged violations. NATO critic Calin Georgescu won the first round, but the Constitutional Court invalidated the result, citing campaign irregularities and accusations of Russian interference – claims Moscow has denied. It later emerged that the controversial campaign in question had been funded not by Moscow, but by Romania’s pro-EU National Liberal Party, which was reportedly targeting a rival but inadvertently boosted Georgescu instead. The re-run is set for May 4 and May 18.",

    "title": "US demands direct Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "The US will no longer serve as mediator in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce has said. Speaking at a regular press briefing on Thursday, she stated it was time for the two parties to propose their own solutions and engage in direct talks. Trump had previously pledged to end the Ukraine conflict“within 24 hours”if elected, though he later described the claim as an“exaggeration.”Since taking office in January, he has pressed both sides for a ceasefire but has expressed frustration over the slow progress in the talks. Trump has warned that the US may withdraw from the peace process if it continues to falter. Earlier, Moscow signaled it’s ready to start direct negotiations with Kiev“without preconditions,”while Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces to observe a short ceasefire during Victory Day celebrations next week. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has branded the Russian truce announcement a“manipulation.” “We will not be the mediators,”Bruce told reporters when asked about Washington’s future role.“We certainly are still committed to it and we’ll help and do what we can, but we are not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings.” “It’s time for both of the nations involved in this conflict to come up with concrete proposals about how this conflict ends. It’s going to be up to them,”Bruce added. Her remarks contrasted with comments by US Vice President J.D. Vance, who said earlier this week that Washington planned to dedicate another 100 days to mediating a peace deal. Media reports have claimed the US peace proposal includes recognizing Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and its de-facto control over parts of four former Ukrainian regions that chose to join Russia. It also reportedly calls for“freezing”the conflict along current front lines. Commenting on Moscow’s decision to halt military operations next week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the pause should serve as“the start of direct negotiations with Kiev without preconditions.”Kiev, however, demanded an immediate, unconditional 30-day ceasefire.",

    "title": "China ‘assessing’ US tariff talks – Commerce Ministry",
    "article_text": "China is“assessing”US overtures to begin tariff negotiations, the Commerce Ministry said on Friday. According to the ministry, senior US officials recently reached out to Beijing through third parties with proposals to start talks. Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have risen since US President Donald Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports last month as part of a wider effort targeting over 90 trade partners. Most of the new tariffs were paused for 90 days – excluding China – while a baseline 10% remains in place. Beijing responded with 125% tariffs on US goods and export restrictions. The ministry said China has taken note of recent US messages and is evaluating the possibility of negotiations, adding that while Washington has expressed interest in talks, trust would be undermined if unilateral tariffs remain. “The US has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China. China is currently assessing this,”the ministry stated. Trump previously suggested that the tariffs could“come down substantially”and spoke about the potential for a“fair deal with China.”He also claimed that his administration was“actively”engaging with Beijing and that he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping by phone. Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed on Fox News last week that Beijing was“reaching out”to Washington. China has denied this and accused the US of misleading the public. In its statement on Friday, the Commerce Ministry reiterated that the US must show“sincerity”by canceling the tariffs if it wants meaningful dialogue. It added that China remains open to talks, but will not be pressured:“If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open.” It stressed that Beijing will only agree to negotiations in good faith.“Saying one thing and doing another, or even trying to coerce and blackmail under the guise of talks, will not work with China,”the statement read. Analysts expect negotiations will begin soon, citing recent market volatility and the IMF’s downward revision of global growth forecasts due to trade uncertainty. Some observers, however, predict that formal talks will not be announced until after the US and China agree on the terms of a tariff deal privately.",

    "title": "Israel bombs targets near Syria’s presidential palace – IDF",
    "article_text": "Israel said on Friday that it conducted airstrikes near the presidential compound in Syria, in response to violence against the Druze minority. “A short while ago, warplanes attacked the area near Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa’s palace in Damascus,”the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a brief statement. Al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Julani, led a coalition of Islamist forces that toppled President Bashar Assad in December 2024. The rapid seizure of the capital and other cities in western Syria was accompanied by massacres of Druze, Christians, and Assad loyalists. According to Al Jazeera, clashes erupted on Monday in the towns of Jaramana and Sahnaya south of Damascus after an audio clip circulated on social media in which a man criticized the Prophet Mohammed. The recording was attributed to a Druze scholar, who has denied responsibility. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a joint statement on Friday, describing the IDF strikes as“a clear message to the Syrian regime.”They added:“We will not allow forces to be sent south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.” Syria’s state-run news agency, SANA, reported on Thursday that order had been restored in Sahnaya following the deployment of security forces. The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned what it called“attempts to internationalize the situation,”and vowed to protect the Druze population. The Druze are a minority religious group that follows an offshoot of Islam and make up around 3% of Syria’s population. Some Druze in southern Syria have reportedly asked for Israeli protection, calling it the“lesser evil.” The IDF invaded southwestern Syria shortly after Assad’s downfall in December, occupying several towns beyond the Golan Heights, including Quneitra.",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration is prepared to dedicate another 100 days to mediating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, US Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News in an interview published on Wednesday. He said the US has made progress by getting both sides to present their ideas for resolving the conflict. “We’ve got this first step,”the vice president said, reflecting on the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term. “We’ve got the peace proposal out there and issued, and we’re going to work very hard over the next 100 days to try to bring these guys together.” Vance noted that before the Trump administration got involved, Moscow and Kiev“weren’t even talking – not to each other, not to anybody. They were just fighting.”He added:“Now, the work of diplomacy is to try to sort of bring these two sides closer together,”pointing to the“very big gulf between what the Russians want and what the Ukrainians want.” During last year’s election campaign, Trump vowed to end the conflict“within 24 hours”of entering the White House – which he later described as an“exaggeration.”Since taking office in January, he has pressed both sides to reach a ceasefire and has recently shown frustration over the lack of progress. Although Russia praised Trump and his team for better understanding its position than the administration of former President Joe Biden, Moscow insisted that any comprehensive ceasefire must include an end to Ukraine’s mobilization and a halt to foreign weapons deliveries. Both sides accused each other of violating the month-long energy truce brokered by Trump in March, as well as last month’s 30-hour Easter truce. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine drop its claims to Crimea and four other regions, and abandon its NATO ambitions. On Thursday, Trump’s special envoy, Keith Kellogg, said Kiev had agreed to acknowledge Russia’s control over what it considers“occupied territories,”while stopping short of officially recognizing Russian sovereignty. However, Kiev has repeatedly stated that it will not cede any land to Russia.",

    "title": "Israeli security cabinet backs plans to expand Gaza operation, media reports say",
    "article_text": "World World Palestinians stand at the site of an Israeli strike on a tent camp sheltering displaced people, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Apr 30, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Hatem Khaled) JERUSALEM: Israel's security cabinet approved plans for an expanded operation in the Gaza Strip, Israeli media reported on Friday (May 2), adding to signs that attempts to stop the fighting and return hostages held by Hamas have made no progress. The decision came after comments from both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the head of the military, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir this week indicating that Israelintended to step up the campaign in Gaza. Since the collapse of an earlier ceasefire agreement in March, Israeli troops have been carving out wide buffer zones in Gaza, squeezing the 2.3 million population into an ever narrower zone in the centre of the enclave and along the coast and shutting off the entry of aid trucks. \"As long as Hamas does not release our hostages, we will significantly deepen our military action,\" ynet, one of Israel's main news outlets quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying. A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the reports, which said the decision would be approved by the full cabinet on Sunday. On Thursday, Netanyahu said that while Israel was seeking the return of its hostages, of whom up to 24 are believed to be alive, its ultimate goal in Gaza remained to defeat Hamas. \"In war, there is the ultimate goal - and that ultimate goal is the victory over our enemies,\" he said. Despite efforts by Egyptian and Qatari mediatorsto restore the ceasefire, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal. Israel, which wants the return of 59 hostages still held in Gaza, has insisted that Hamas must disarm and be excluded from any role in the future governance of the enclave, a condition that Hamas rejects. The group, which ran Gaza since 2007, has insisted on agreeing a lasting end to the fighting and a withdrawal of Israeli forces as a condition for a deal that would see a release of the hostages. Earlier, Netanyahu's office issued a statement denying that it had rejected a ceasefire proposal put forward by Egyptian mediators, and saying Hamas was standing in the way of a deal to halt the fighting. Israeli commanders have said the military was ready to step up its operations in Gaza at short notice. \"We will use all the power at our disposal, we will increase the pace and intensity of the operation, and if required we'll do so soon,\" Zamir said at an Independence Day ceremony on Thursday. On Friday, Israeli strikescontinued to hit different areas of Gaza, killing at least 25 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities said. Israel's campaign was triggered by the devastating Hamas attack on Oct 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and saw 251 taken hostage. It has so far killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and devastated Gaza where aid groups have warned the Israeli blockade risks a humanitarian disaster.

    "title": "Discover the beauty of Japanese islands via small-ship luxury cruising",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Cruising at its most refined: No towering behemoth with water parks and thousands of passengers. Just a floating sanctuary of dignified luxury moving silently through deep blue waters. The torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine at Miyajima. (Photo: Daven Wu) This audio is generated by an AI tool. In late March this year, as Yokohama shook itself awake from its wintery slumber, Iboarded the Seabourn Questfor a long-anticipated, two-week cruise around the Japanese islands. Our timing couldn't have been more perfect: The cherry blossom season was just beginning, unfurling its gauzy tapestry of white and pink across the landscape. With barely a ripple, the Quest – a slick, all-white vessel carrying only 347 guests from 73 countries and attended by 357 crew members from 44 – eased away from the bustling port. This was cruising at its most refined. No towering behemoth with water parks and thousands of passengers. Just a floating sanctuary of dignified luxury moving silently through deep blue waters. As we pulled away from Yokohama’s metropolitan sprawl, there was a collective sense of anticipation, knowing that over the next fortnight, the ship would deliver us to ports so remote and logistically challenging that they normally remain inaccessible to all but the most determined travellers. Our first morning at sea brought intellectual stimulation alongside relaxation. On board were a couple of former diplomats and authors. Throughout the voyage, they delivered fascinating lectures on the complex history and geopolitical landscape of East Asia – the longstanding tensions between Japan, China, Russia, and the United States, all played out in these waters we were sailing through; the nuclear policies reshaping the region; and the remarkable economic transformations that had turned simple fishing villages into industrial powerhouses like Yokohama. These scholarly offerings provided fascinating context that no guidebook could match, transforming our journey from mere sightseeing to deep cultural immersion. The next dawn brought our first port – Hiroshima. As we ventured from the shoreline, the city revealed itself, its streets and parks draped in a breathtaking canopy of white and pink sakura blossoms that seemed to defy its sombre history. We walked through the Peace Memorial Park, where the skeletal dome of the former Industrial Promotion Hall stands against the sky as a stark reminder of a painful past, evoking a profound sense of reflection and sorrow. The carefully tended grounds and memorials create a space that honours Hiroshima’s terrible history, while allowing visitors to contemplate its message of peace – a moment also reflected in the nearby Shukkeien garden where a single bent gingko tree that survived the atomic blast provides silent testimony to both destruction and resilience. At Miyajima the following day, we climbed hillside paths festooned with cherry trees that created a floating white cloud of flowers hanging above ancient wooden shrines. The famous vermilion torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine appeared to hover on the water's surface, while in the nearby shopping streets, old machiya-style homes have been transformed into boutiques selling curry oyster buns and sweet red bean cakes. Not far from these lively thoroughfares, the massive unfinished timber library of Hokoku Shrine (Senjokaku), begun in 1587 but never completed, stands as a grand monument to interrupted ambition. As we continued northward through the Kanmon Strait to Busan, South Korea, the Quest revealed itself to be a haven of civilised pleasures. Mornings began with stretch classes overlooking the sea, while afternoons offered bridge lessons or informal gatherings over tea service with champagne, scones and delicate cucumber sandwiches. For those willing to brave the cold air, there was fine dining under stars, followed, one evening, by an elegant recital in the Grand Salon by a classically trained pianist. After a day in Busan, the ship's northward journey brought us back into Japanese waters to smaller ports where modern Japan seemed to recede. In Sakaiminato, weather-worn wooden homes lined quiet streets where fishing boats bobbed gently in the harbour. The town is famous as the birthplace of Shigeru Mizuki, Japan's legendary manga artist whose supernatural yokai creatures are immortalised in 177 bronze statues along Mizuki Shigeru Road. Down by the waterfront, we discovered a tiny sushi restaurant with rickety chairs and tables polished by generations of elbows, where we savoured fish of such freshness that it seemed to melt on contact with the tongue. Tsuruga unfolded itself through temple gates and communal bathing houses fed by hot springs. The Japanese approach to bathing struck me as beautifully practical – simple, utilitarian facilities with indoor and outdoor pools where the bracing contrast between steaming waters and cool air created an experience more rejuvenating than any luxury spa treatment. Elsewhere in the city, the Kehi Shrine, dating from 702, features one of Japan's three most remarkable wooden torii gates, its simple elegance all the more impressive for having weathered thirteen centuries. In Takaoka, we visited Zuiryuji Temple, a national treasure constructed entirely of wood without a single nail, its clean lines and balanced proportions exemplifying the restrained beauty of Zen Buddhist design. Walking through its pristinely manicured grounds, we found ourselves naturally falling into a quieter, more contemplative state. Precisely the effect, one imagines, its builders intended. And so, the days passed. Again and again, I reflected on the peculiar alchemy of small-ship cruising – how it manages to distil travel to its essence by removing all friction. No hunting for hotels in unfamiliar cities, no deciphering train timetables in hieroglyphic scripts, no navigating complex ferry schedules to reach island destinations. Instead, each morning brought a new horizon, a new adventure, with the comforting knowledge that at day's end, our floating resort awaited with familiar faces and creature comforts. As we pushed further north towards Hokkaido, the cherry blossoms retreated, their buds still tightly closed against the lingering chill. In Sakata, we explored the immaculately preserved Homma residence, once home to one of Japan's most prominent merchant families during the Edo period when this small port was a crucial hub for the rice trade. The landscape grew more dramatic as we sailed towards Hakodate and the snow-streaked mountains that loomed in the distance beyond its harbour. Early morning found us wandering among vendors in the central morning market, examining piles of dried kelp and gleaming plump scallops arranged in neat stalls. Our final port of Kushiro appeared through morning fog, its city market offering a final opportunity to indulge in the ocean's bounty – mounds of uni, buttery toro, and sweet crab arranged with gastro-porn precision. Along one of the main thoroughfares, we discovered a traditional artisan workshop where calligraphic seals are still made to order, each one a miniature work of art pressed into vermilion stamp ink to create distinctive personal signatures As the Quest finally glided back into Yokohama harbour, I found myself silently thanking the ship for its gentle companionship on a voyage cocooned by airy pink clouds of cherry blossoms that had seemed to follow us from port to port. In two perfect weeks, suspended between sea and sky, we had traced Japan's coastline during its most magical season, experiencing moments both profound and simple. The bent tree in Hiroshima that survived an apocalypse, the languid sea days spent watching the ever-changing face of the ocean, the taste of just-caught fish in Sakaiminato. What remained, though, was a perspective rarely granted to those who visit by conventional means – Japan seen from the sea. It was how Japan had first revealed itself to the world, and how I will always remember it: Islands emerging from the mist, mountains descending to meet the water's edge, and everywhere the quiet dignity of a culture that understands better than most the beauty of moments that cannot last. www.seabourn.com Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

De Bruyne scored the game's lone goal in his penultimate game at Etihad Stadium to give City a crucial victory in their chase for Champions League qualification - and in the process, the outgoing captain sent a reminder of what the team will be missing once he is gone. The 33-year-old Belgian announced last month that he would leave the team once his contract expires at season's end. \"Just thank you,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports, when asked for his thoughts on De Bruyne. \"His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers and today the goal again.

Pundit and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said the conversation as De Bruyne's final City season nears an end should be around what he has contributed. \"We should not be getting bogged down in the contract situation,\" Carragher said on the Sky broadcast. \"It's been decided, it's over.

    "title": "Commentary: Has China’s great relocation helped Southeast Asia industrialise?",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary China’s extensive investments in the region have delivered mixed results, say these researchers. Labourers work at a private garment factory in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Jan 8, 2021. (Photo: REUTERS/Kham) SINGAPORE: In recent years, China’s manufacturers have increasinglyshifted production to Southeast Asia, driven by rising labour costs, geopolitical tensions – particularly the US-China trade war – and efforts to diversify supply chains (the “China Plus One” strategy). This mirrors Japan’s manufacturing relocation in the 1980s to 1990s, which helped drive industrialisation in the region. Yet the question remains: Will China’s “Great Relocation” foster Southeast Asia’s long-term development, or leave it toiling in the middle-income trap and unable to move up the technological and productivity ladder? With the US now threatening steep new tariffs on exports from Southeast Asian countries, the benefits of this shift may be at risk. Southeast Asia’s prospects for further industrialisation will depend on several factors related to China’s economic engagement in the region. These can be analysed using the World Bank’s three I’s framework: Investment, infusion, and innovation. The impact of China’s investment in the region depends on volume and type. The average annual value of Chinese greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) in manufacturing in ASEAN doubled from US$6.1 billion from 2016 to 2019 to US$12.9 billion from 2020 to 2023. In both periods, the average annual value of Chinese greenfield FDI in manufacturing was significantly larger than that from the US, Japan and South Korea. In 2023, a third of manufacturing investment in Southeast Asia came from China alone. Five ASEAN countries – Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia – ranked among the top 15 global recipients of Chinese manufacturing FDI from 2016 to 2023. In countries like Cambodia and Vietnam, the total Chinese manufacturing FDI between 2016 and 2023 was significantly larger relative to their manufacturing value added and merchandise exports in 2016 (the base year). For example, the total Chinese manufacturing FDI to Cambodia between 2016 and 2023 was US$2 billion, compared to its manufacturing value added of US$3.2 billion and merchandise exports of US$8.5 billion in 2016. However, manufacturing operations yield different development benefits, depending on the type of investment. Chinese investment that is capital-intensive and resource-oriented, such as Indonesia’s refining and processing industries, primarily supplies processed critical minerals back to China. Other export-oriented investments stand out for their location between China and the US in manufacturing supply chains. For example, a third of Chinese FDI in Vietnam’s manufacturing sector has gone into electronic components, semiconductors and communication equipment, boosting Vietnam’s global market share in electronics from 2.68 per cent in 2016 to 4.48 per cent in 2022. Countries like Vietnam have benefited from China as a source of cheap raw and intermediate inputs and the US as a key export destination, allowing them to leverage both ends of the value chain. While contingent on the stability of the US-China-ASEAN trade, these export-oriented investments have significant potential to increase domestic productivity and competitiveness. In some new growth fields, such as electric vehicles (EVs) in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, FDI often aims to boost local industrial upgrading and capacity, and in some cases to eventually substitute for imports. Such investment has the potential to build national brands through foreign-domestic joint ventures, but the scope for growth might be limited to the domestic and regional markets. Infusion refers to how foreign investment and technology are absorbed into the local economies, boosting production capacity and productivity. Chinese and other FDI have played a role in increasing manufacturing value added across Southeast Asia. Cambodia’s and Vietnam’s industrial sectors have grown, as reflected in the increasing share of manufacturing value added (per cent of gross domestic product) and employment (per cent of total employment) between 2016 and 2023. However, FDI has not necessarily brought about higher-value-added processes – for instance, front-end wafer manufacturing instead of back-end outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing – or spurred transitions to higher-value goods – for instance, from producing garments and footwear to electronic integrated circuits. One indicator of this is the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), which measures a country’s productive capabilities by analysing the diversification and complexity of the export basket, a proxy for knowledge intensity in the economy. The ECI has notably risen in the Philippines, Vietnam, and even Myanmar since 2016, but remains stagnant in the other developing Southeast Asian countries. Of the five ASEAN countries that received the most Chinese manufacturing FDI, Malaysia and Thailand have seen little improvement in ECI scores, while Indonesia and Cambodia remain relatively undiversified and less capable of producing sophisticated goods and services compared to the global median. These findings suggest that investment influxes have yet to translate into greater knowledge intensity in many economies. Finally, innovation refers to the ability to develop and commercialise indigenous technologies. It is the last and most challenging step in escaping the middle-income trap. Have recent investments helped Southeast Asia develop innovative or research and development (R&D) capabilities? A firm-level analysis of recent Chinese investment in EVs, EV batteries and microelectronics shows that most R&D remains concentrated in Singapore. At the same time, resident patent applications have been rising across Southeast Asia, reflecting growing aspirations for domestic innovation. Countries are also investing in sovereign artificial-intelligence strategies, data centres, and computing infrastructure to support future technological development. Yet, increasing labour costs, talent shortages exacerbated by brain drain, and weak incentives for foreign firms to share advanced technology mean Southeast Asia remains a manufacturing base rather than an innovation hub. The region must continue to invest in workforce skills and create policies that enable transfers of deeper production or operational capability (the knowledge and skills to operate and control a production process) and innovative capability (the ability to carry out significant in-house R&D). The latter is something no previous wave of industrialisation in the region has achieved. With new economic headwinds and a possible full-blown US-China trade war, China’s great relocation to Southeast Asia could slow down, with investors delaying or cancelling expansion or relocation. At the same time, concerns over Chinese import surges and competition in third markets may reinforce the case for building more resilient regional integrated supply chains. To effectively navigate these headwinds – and turn them into long-term gains – Southeast Asia will need to continue addressing structural problems in its investment climate, including by building better-quality institutions, in line with its long-term strategic economic interest. Complementing the surge in FDI with stronger local supply chain linkages, greater participation of domestic small and medium enterprises, and targeted support for skills and technology transfer will be essential. Only then could the region fully capitalise on foreign investment and further cement its reputation as a global manufacturing hub.

    "article_text": "Business Business Specialist Philip Finale, left, and trader Robert Charmak work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, May 2, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks advanced on Friday (May 2), notching the second straight week of gains, helped by strong economic data andpotential easing of trade tensions between the US and China. The US economy added 177,000 jobs in April, exceeding expectations, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2 per cent. The data helped to assuage concerns of an economic slowdown following a Commerce Department report, showing a contraction in US gross domestic product for the first time in three years, weighed down by atariff-induced flood of imports. \"The stock market is cheering this morning's payroll report but I have to point out that job growth did slow on the month and I haven't seen too many comments about that,\" said Talley Leger, chief market strategist at The Wealth Consulting Group. \"I was a bit surprised because I was expecting a sharper slowdown given that non-farm payroll survey happened the week after the tariffs were announced. So I think the market is taking this in a positive light.\" Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks overPresident Donald Trump's 145 per cent tariffs, which he had imposed on Chinese imports. The tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies have kept investors on edge, with both sides unwilling to be seen backing down in a trade war that has roiled global markets. Still, Trump'sreversal of some tariffshas helped US stock indexes recover from recent losses. The S&P 500 has erased the slump set off by Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on Apr 2, with the index now up 0.3 per cent since the close of Apr 2. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was trading at levels last seen before April 2. The S&P 500 also reached its ninth consecutive session of gains, matching a winning streak from 2004, while the Dow hit a nine-day winning streak for the first since December 2023. For the week, the S&P 500 gained 2.9 per cent, the Dow climbed 3 per cent, and the Nasdaq added 3.43 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 564.47 points, or 1.39 per cent, to 41,317.43, the S&P 500 gained 82.54 points, or 1.47 per cent, to 5,686.68 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 266.99 points, or 1.51 per cent, to 17,977.73. \"I do think what today is saying is that the economy is a lot stronger than people thought and a lot more resilient in the face of all of these tariffs and fears about tariffs,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York. Apple fell nearly 4 per cent after the iPhone maker trimmed its share buyback program by US$10 billion and CEO Tim Cook told analysts that tariffs could add about US$900 million in costs this quarter. Other so-called Magnificent Seven stocks such as Meta Platform rose 4.3 per cent and Nvidia gained 2.6 per cent. Amazon dipped 0.1 per cent. Chevron rose 1.6 per cent and ExxonMobil gained 0.4 per cent after both energy giants reported quarterly results. Block slumped 20 per cent after cutting its profit forecast for 2025 and missing estimates for quarterly earnings. Video game maker Take-Two Interactive fell nearly 7 per cent after it delayed the release of \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" to May 2026. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 144 new highs and 47 new lows on the NYSE.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When David Harbour goes sneaker shopping, he gravitates towards silhouettes with a decidedlyfunctionalbent. (Harbourheads might remember the actor's 2022 campaign with the hardcore running brand Brooks.) But on thepress junket promotingThunderbolts*,the latest sure-to-be-smash entrant in the MCU, Harbour just can't get enough of the New Balance 991v2, a legendary sneaker with equal pedigreeamong retireesand their teenage grandkids. As its name indicates, the 991v2 is the sequel to thegenre-defining 991, one of New Balance'sall-time best silhouettes. The second edition made its grand debut in 2023 with a flashy Stone Island collaboration, and the Boston footwear juggernaut has been busy churning out worthy follow-ups ever since. New Balance Mr Porter New Balance Mr Porter What, exactly, makes the New Balance 991v2 so popular? Simple: It looks good and feels great. The mesh base keeps your feet cool and dry during the warmer months, while the premium leather and suede overlays prevent the look from veering too hard into ‘summer BBQ’ territory. Oh, and the reflective 3M accents throughout mean you can, in fact, flex your new kicks in the dark if you really want to. All of that aesthetic mumbo jumbo is really just a bonus, though. Because the midsole is infused with New Balance's signature Encap cushioning for crazy levels of comfort, and equipped with Abzorb SBS pods to make your stride even bouncier. Those types of specs are typically reserved for the brand's most advancedrunning shoes, so even though the 991v2 isn't specifically engineered to crush a 10K, it could probably do it without breaking a sweat. New Balance Mr Porter New Balance Mr Porter Best of all, the 991v2 is one of a few New Balance silhouettes made in England, on the rolling hills of Flimby, Cumbria, where the brand owns a factory responsible for some ofthe hottest sneakers on the planet. So, ultimately, are we surprised that David Harbour loves 'em? Certainly not. Because as soon as you lace up a pair you will, too. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Best Products for Thinning Hair for a Fuller-Looking Coif in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. I have fine hair—not thinning per se, but hair that benefits from volumizing stylers, thickeningshampoos, and more of the best products for thinning hair. I remember the first time I used Hanz de Fuko's Quicksand—it gave my hair fullness and reworkability and that gritty, matte texture that priorwaxesorpomadesup until then did not. The great news is that there is a world of stellar styling products that provide texture and density, but formulas and applications vary. Some guys swear by reworkable matte pastes, while others prefer atexturing powder'soil absorption. It's key to avoid anything that adds shine or weight, which can make fine or thinning hair fall flat. As David Connor, master barber and owner ofAnti-Gravity Salonin New Orleans, says, \"A matte finish styling product will achieve more volume, texture, and better coverage for thinning hair.\" Thickening shampoos and conditioners can also aid the thinness cause. “Thickening shampoos incorporate ingredients that plump or coat the hair follicle to expand its diameter and decrease the space between strands, creating the look of fuller, denser hair,” Dr. Sonia Batra, M.D., A.B., M.P.H, says. We've rounded up some of the best clays, sprays,mousses, shampoos, and even asupplementand tried-and-true treatment to help you pump up the volume. Maybe there's one hero clay that does the trick, or perhaps it'll take the right combo—but either way, the goal is the same: to help you zero in on the best thickening products for thinning hair. A great matte paste (or clay) is a holy grail for guys with thinning hair—it boosts volume while providing that piece-y definition that makes hair look textured and cooler. I always keep one in my rotation, especially a hybrid like R+Co’s, which is part paste and part dry shampoo—a game changer for a reworkable hold while also soaking up oil. “Pastes and clays both do the job, but they’re not the same and not really interchangeable,” says Connor. “Paste is creamier, softer, and spreads more easily through your hands, while clay is drier, thicker, and grippier.” Paste also provides a natural, sometimes slightly shiny finish for a softer, touchable style you can reshape throughout the day. To apply paste or clay, start with a dime- to nickel-sized amount in your palm and rub it between your hands until it forms a thin, even layer. “Apply from mid-shaft to ends—not the roots—to avoid clogging pores,” advises. \"And remember, you can always add more, but it's hard to dial it back once you've overdone it. Think of it like layering—less is more.\" It's the same deal for clay, but \"Stretch it from your fingertips across your palms to warm it up, which helps it spread easier and perform better.\" R+Co Amazon Hanz de Fuko Amazon Clay is generally thicker and denser than paste, with a grippy, dry texture that gives you more control and hold. Clay’s oil-absorbing properties can help if your hair gets oily, leaving a matte, natural-looking finish that creates the illusion of fuller, thicker hair. “Clay has a stronger hold than paste, and you’ll feel more friction when working it through,” says Connor. “That gives it structure and definition in the hair and adds texture and fullness with a dry, matte finish.” Baxter of California Amazon Church Church Texture powder is a (hopefully, not so after reading this) secret weapon for fighting thinning hair—it's lightweight, easy to use, and boosts volume while soaking up excess oil. Some form is always in my medicine cabinet. \"Texture powder is the ultimate styler for thinning hair,\" says Connor. \"It's super refined and easy to apply. Don't pour it on—shake it in and use your fingers to create friction.\" That friction activates the product, coating strands, absorbing oil, and texturizing. \"It builds space between strands, giving you volume that lasts,\" Connor explains. Start with less, here. It's super concentrated, and it's easier to add more than to dial it back. American Crew Amazon Davines Amazon A volumizing mousse is another stellar option for boosting volume, but it’s more of a softening primer that adds slight texture and can set the stage for other styling products. “Think of a lightweight mousse as a supporting tool,” says Connor. “Ablow dryerand mousse build an excellent foundation for clay, powder, or paste.” It absorbs excess oil and creates lift through subtle separation between strands, helping hair rise and appear fuller. While youcanuse mousse on its own without a blow dryer, it’s not ideal for thinning hair, as it might cause strands to clump together and reduce the appearance of volume. IGK Amazon Patricks Patricks Thickening sprays have long been the OGs in the volumizing game as they provide that lived-in texture—usually by using minerals or fibers to coat the hair. Bumble and Bumble’s Surf Spray is a tried-and-true classic for guys who want a just-back-from-the-beach vibe that’s easy to rework throughout the day. On the other end of the dial is R+Co’s Thickening Spray, which is more of a root-lifting styler or finisher you mist into damp hair, giving you volume with a softer vibe. While youcanuse these on dry hair, they shine on slightly damp strands when you can work them in, let them dry, and get that lived-in texture. Bumble and Bumble Amazon R+Co Amazon Shampoo cleans your hair and scalp, but some sudsers specifically (say that 3x) thicken and volumize by coating the hair to create the illusion of fullness or by helping lift strands. There are many options, but I always keep Sachajuan in the mix—its Ocean Silk Technology, made from two cold-water algae extracts, gives my hair a noticeable boost. And because I have fine hair, I’m also a fan of Living Proof’s volumizing conditioner; it uses a bio-derived fatty acid polymer to deliver shine, smoothness, and fuller-looking hair. Sachajuan Amazon Living Proof Amazon Some shampoos focus less on thickening hair and more on supporting hair health to combat thinning over time. These treatment shampoos improve circulation and strengthen hair at the source. According to Dr. Batra, some key ingredients to look for include caffeine (to boost blood flow), biotin (to fortify and thicken strands), keratin (to reinforce the hair shaft), and extracts like saw palmetto, which may help block DHT—a hormone linked to hair loss. Brands like Keeps use saw palmetto and biotin, while Feel Confident, founded by a board-certified MD and hair restoration surgeon, combines pumpkin seed oil for strength, caffeine, and saw palmetto and turmeric root to address DHT at the root. Feel Confident Feel Confident Keeps Amazon Batra explains that \"dry shampoos absorb scalp oils and add texture, making hair look fuller and feel cleaner without water—a temporary volumizer, not a substitute for actual cleansing.\" Many of these quick-fix thickeners use starches or silica to coat the strands and give the illusion of thickness. I'm a big fan of the Gold Lust spray from Luxe Haircare OGs Oribe—it smells salon-like and provides an instant lift. Oribe Amazon Nutrafol Amazon Healthier, thicker hair starts from within, and if you're seeking a natural, non-prescription supplement,Nutrafolhas done its homework with these potent capsules. The hype is legit. I've been taking it for over a year, and my hair feels fuller, denser, and stronger. They pack in a targeted blend of ingredients like saw palmetto, ashwagandha, biotin, zinc, vitamin E, and various extracts—all formulated to tackle root causes of hair thinning, such as hormone imbalances, stress, and inflammation. If you're curious, give it a go—but be patient. It takes a few months to see real results, but in my experience, it's worth the wait. Rogaine Amazon Rogaine is another over-the-counter classic that's been part of my routine for years—and with enough time and consistency, it can thicken and regrow hair. Scientists still aren't exactly sure how, but the general thinking is that it boosts blood flow to the scalp, which helps enlarge hair follicles and reverse the miniaturization that leads to hair loss. The trick is staying consistent: you've got to apply it twice a day, no skipping. I prefer the foam version, but the liquid might work better with whatever styling products you use. Regardless, if you've got thinning hair, get started and stick with it; there's a good chance you'll see growth in a few months.

    "title": "13 Best Boat Shoes for Men in 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Summer’s a wave, and the best boat shoes for men are cresting right about…now. The boat shoe has lived a few lives in the zeitgeist, from niche marine footwear to preppy staple, dad classic to frat bro basic. But the tides have once again turned in our favor when it comes to the boat shoe, becauseit’s back, and better than ever. Here in its 90th year, the boat shoe finds itself with more street cred than decades past, as cooler labels experiment with the easy-breezy footwear and old hands — like Sebago and boat-shoe inventor Sperry — riff on their bread-and-butter style. That also means you’ve got a marina’s worth of options to choose from before you set sail on the Good Ship Boat Shoe. There’s no shortage of classics that will channel the throwback cool of JFK Jr. at hispreternaturally chilled-out best— but you’ll also find upper-deck alternatives galore, like suede takes for a swankbeachside wedding, chunky-soled BBQ stompers, and dainty Japanese city-strollers. The best boat shoes are ready for you to board. Sperry Sperry Any list of the best boat shoes has to start with Sperry—as in, Paul F. Sperry, who invented the boat shoe in 1935 after realizing that his dog’s grooved paws could grip a ship’s wet deck better than his own kicks. So he made some rippling slices (“sipes”, technically) in the soles of his mocs, and created a whole damn shoe. Today’s Sperry Authentic Original, as the name suggests, shares a lot with the O.G.: a handstitched toe, leather uppers, and that tried-and-true siped sole. Timberland Timberland If the O.G. boat shoe’s slim, non-slip sole veers a little too prep for you, Timberland’s version puts some meat on its bones with a hefty lugged sole reminiscent of the New York brand’s famous boots. Thick Horween leather (a.k.a., the good stuff) and rawhide lacing add to the ready-for-anything stance. Even if “anything,” in this case, means going back for seconds on ribs and slaw. Yuketen Huckberry Yuketen is what you’d get if you mashed together L.L. Bean Americana with Louis Vuitton-level leatherwork. The brand’s known for finding artisans who can make beautiful, rugged pieces channeled through the heritage-obsessed vision of Japanese designer Yuki Matsuda. The Angler Moc’s full-grain leather from Chicago’s famed Horween Leather tannery is cut, sewn, and assembled in Maine using true moccasin construction. That means the leather uppers wrap around the bottom of the foot, giving these boat shoes a soft, socklike feel. It’s a difference you’ll notice the first time you slip on the Angler Mocs — and every time you hit your step count for the day. Bally SSENSE WhenBally designer (and Gucci alum) Simone Bellottitook a bow at his first show in 2023,his outfitwent mildly viral for its flawless expression of laid-back Italian style: faded baseball cap, vintage sweatshirt, pleated chinos, and boat shoes exactly like these. They’ve got the carefree sophistication ofVenetian loafersmixed with a boater’s heritage details, all packaged in a chocolate suede that feels as rich as you’ll look. Make your life easy, and steal from the designer who’s helping bringelegance back to menswear.. Paraboot Huckberry Morjas Morjas Visvim Mr Porter Pompeii Pompeii Vinny's Nordstrom Sesa Alex Mill Auralee SSENSE Sebago Mr Porter Boat shoes are meant to be as easygoing as a Bud Light on a back deck, and they’ll work anytime you’re relaxing in the sun. More on this below, but you can wear them with shorts, chinos, trousers, jeans, andespeciallybathing suits. Speaking of suits, that’s when things get a little more complicated. The boat shoe can absolutely anchor a two-piece, but that pairing depends heavily on the time of day and the dress code, explicit or implied. If you’re wearing a suit for your own sartorial satisfaction — say, to a friend’s birthday brunch, or just because — then a boat shoe should be fine. You’ll probably want a suit in cotton, linen, or something equally casual. When it comes to weddings or the office, unless the invite says “seaside casual” or your boss regularly conducts meetings on his yacht, we’d probably skip all but the most sophisticated boat shoes and opt for a more elegant member of the loafer family. Between theVenetian loafer, thehorsebit loafer, and otherloafer styles, you’ve got no shortage of options. Bottom line, the boat shoe is the sneaker of the seas; a casual, daytime-skewing piece of footwear best enjoyed without socks or Slack alerts. None of this is written in stone anywhere (that we know of), and you retain your legal right to freak anything, anytime. But if you’re in doubt about the boat shoe’s sea-worthiness at an establishment or event, we’d suggest going with something evenslightlymore formal to avoid any “uncle who only wears Hawaiian shirts” energy. As per our previous section, you can pull off boat shoes with most of your closet. Shorts or a bathing suit are absolute no-brainers. (Nothing goes from beach to boardwalk like boat shoes.) As are jeans — maybe inwhite or off-white, because it’s summer, and why not — as well as trousers,linen pants, andevery type of chino under the sun, wide-legged or straight, pleated or flat, beige or covered in small embroidered whales. Up top, if you can wear it with jeans or chinos, it’ll go great with boat shoes. Tees,polos of all types,camp shirts, crewneck sweatshirts, button-front shirts (tucked or untucked; white,Oxford, or other)... all besties with boaters. Asport coat with jeansand some boat shoes for a chill brunch? Ahoy-hoy! We love it. You will, too. If we had to make one of those warning signs near the lifeguard chair, the kind with all the DON’Ts written in red text, the list would be small: no black tie or business suits. Otherwise, go forth and live your best boater life. If you’re wearing a boat shoe while sailing on an actual boat, you’ll want what originally made the shoe distinct: a siped rubber sole designed to grip a slippery wet deck. But we’d wager that 99 percent of boat shoes wearers will never reef a mainsail, so you’re really looking for good construction and easy comfort. Quality leather is a good place to start. Anything from Horween, the heritage leather tanner in Chicago, means your feet are in good hands. Thicker leather will take a bit to break in, and may chafe at first (shout out toDr. Scholl’s moleskin, savior from achilles burn), but it’ll hold up well and eventually fit your feet like a glove. Waxed leather will shrug off most water short of you falling overboard. Suede, on the other hand, is suede: it’s not so hardy, but it’ll be soft on your dogs, and particularly supple from the box if you opt for a boat shoe without a lining. Genuine moc(casin) stitching, like in the Yuketen pair above, means the upper’s leather folds under the footbed. You’ll feel the extra softness in every step. You’ll also pay a bit more, because genuine moccasin construction requires more leather and more work. Finally, a note on fit: When you try on a pair, try them on the way you plan to wear them. If that’s without socks, do it without socks. Leather shoes will stretch a little bit, particularly as you wear them throughout a wet hot American summer. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping GQ readers get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the best affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ expertise is built on decades of combined men’s fashion knowledge, years of hands-on experience with these brands and products, and an insider awareness of what’s happening in menswear. So while GQ writers and editors can’t try on every single piece of clothing that we write about, the pieces we endorse are backed by first-hand knowledge of a brand’s strengths, bolstered by a deep understanding of the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing to craftsmanship and sustainability. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own experience with all the brands we select, review, and endorse, while also taking into account how a brand’s clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs.",

    "title": "18 Best Baseball Caps for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Until last year,GQhad never aggregated the best baseball caps for men. Much like a behatted celebrity avoiding the paparazzi’s flash, the category was somehow so obvious, it had evaded our radar systems. Well, that mistake is happily in the past now—and not a moment too soon. Because these days, a good cap is about as essential to themodern wardrobeasgood underwear. That's partly for practicality's sake: No other garment hides the sun, or a bad hair day, quite as easily. But it's also a default 2025 style move—just look at any of our current most fêted style gods, from courtside Timmy toKendrick at the Super Bowlto Jeremy Allen White…almost everywhere. In 2025, baseball caps—no longer the sole preserve of the diamond—come in all shapes, sizes, fabrics, and fits. Below, you'll find plenty of cotton twill caps ideal for breezy summer weekends—but there are also statement-making mesh truckers and not-so-quiet-luxury Loro Piana lids. In short, this is a guide that'll make you think twice about just buying that five-panel from the overpriced grocery store near you with “Provisions” or “Country” in its name. It's an acceptable move, sure, but they take enough of your money as it is. These days, the trend in baseball caps is to let yours getsun-faded, distressed, and essentially ripped to shreds. (Caps: The new selvedge denim.) Whether or not you're interested in getting that look, the best place to start is with a classic, comfy, cotton baseball cap. There aretens of thousandsout there, but these ten run the gamut from affordable, to familiar, to being stopped by a total stranger on the street and asked: “Dude, where did you get that hat?” Choose the one that speaks to your soul, then wear it until Thanksgiving. L.L.Bean L.L.Bean Cherry Los Angeles Mr. Porter Corridor Corridor 47 Brand Amazon Drake's Drake's Drake's Drake's Randy's Garments Randy's Garments J.Crew x FDNY J.Crew Of course, if your face is the first thing people look at, nothing makes a statement quicker than an extremely-confident cap. Which may explain the rise, in recent years, of bigger, louder, brighter baseball caps. We're not complaining: Putting a freaky hat on an otherwise simple fit is an excellent approach to dressing, and honestly, some of the hats below—from sweat-releasing mesh truckers to some Pleats Please polyester—are also a more practical cap choice for peak temperatures. And come on: Who's not going to smile when they see you rocking your “Happiest Girl In The World” headwear? Goorin Bros. Nordstrom Kapital Mr. Porter Balenciaga Nordstrom Ashley Williams SSENSE PAM Martine Rose SSENSE Homme Plissé Issey Miyake SSENSE Welcome, sir, to the first-class lounge of lids. From the slopes of Aspen to the set ofSuccession,designer caps have become yet another “Stealth Wealth” signifier—a way for the well-to-do to quietly telegraph caché if they're not the type to wear, say, the fiery Balenciaga bonnet above. But the best designer baseball caps—including the ones below—do a little more than slap a logo on. They're instead made of truly excellent materials, from Todd Snyder's linen caps to the world-famous Loro Piana storm system fabric blend, which guarantees you'll feel neither a summer showers nor an autumn chills on or anywhere near your brow. Loro Piana Mr. Porter Todd Snyder Todd Snyder E.R.L. Mr. Porter Brunello Cucinelli Mr. Porter Fitted:Fitted baseball caps come in different sizes, and have no adjustable closure—meaning you want to get it right first time. Usually, they're also structured with a flat, wide brim, and typically present a little moreupscale,because there's no plastic or metal tab at the back—rather a seamless, straight line along your noggin. Snapback:Similar to a fitted cap from the front, snapbacks have an adjustable plastic closure at the back (Snap-back, see). Yes, they're not as clean-cut as a fitted, but they do offer the option to play with sizing as the seasons—and your hairstyles—change. Dad cap:Typically softer than the above two styles, a Dad cap has an unstructured crown that ends up matching the shape of your head. It also has a curved brim, and usually a metal closure at the back to dial in an even better, more precise fit than a snapback can allow for. Trucker:The star of the cap world when it comes to ventilation, trucker caps have mesh panels at the bag to let heat escape and keep you cool. They rely on an equally-lightweight snapback closure, and usually have a flat brim, too. It's not all mesh, though—there's also a front panel that is either regular old cotton, or sometimes, foam. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories: quality, fit, and price. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Are Ballet Sneakers the Next Big Footwear Wave?",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Predicting the next big wave insneakersis always a crapshoot. Sure, brands can put millions of dollars behind complex marketing pushes for a silhouette, but you can’t force a shoe style to stick. Sometimes atrend rises with no rhyme or reason, or because theright celebrity wore the right shoe at the right time, or because hype fatigue heightens demand fora simple pair of black and white kicksyou can throw on with any outfit. We’ve spent the last couple of months calling out therise of the granddad shoeas an indicator as to where the culture is going, but some interesting stats suggest another major movement in the scene is upon us: against all odds, it’s ballet sneaker season. To clarify, we don’t mean you need to go pick up a pair of satinballet flatsto stay up these days (though we’d never stop you–lace those ribbons up if you feel the urge). Rather, we’re seeing the rise of a style of sneaker that draws heavy inspiration from the pared-down construction of ballet shoes. These are kicks with slim uppers that conform to your foot, often an accentuated arch support, and a thin sole. Think of them as the aesthetic inverse of dad shoes, if not quite mom shoes themselves. The shoe at the center of the trend is the aptly-named Ballerina by Adidas andBad Bunny. An original silhouette that blends the Adidas Taekwondo with some tweaks drawing from ballet flats, it proved an instant success in a way we haven’t seen yet since the superstar first collaborated with adidas. Anything with Benito’s name on it (these literally do, emblazoned on the side) tends to sell out pretty quickly, but there was a unique fervor around the Ballerina and its three launch colorways (two neutrals in black and white and a gold rendition heavy on theBruce Leevibes). Trends don’t always come down to which shoes celebrities wear but it certainly doesn’t hurt for one of the biggest stars in the world to give ballet sneakers such a substantial seal of approval. Adidas StockX Adidas StockX Speaking of the Taekwondo, it’s benefiting from the moment as well. While this silhouette was originally designed as a shoe for, you guessed it, taekwondo, the aesthetic similarities between it and ballet sneakers are strong. From a functional standpoint they largely serve the same purpose as ballet shoes (support stemming from a shoe that molds to your foot and keeps your sole low to the ground), plus what is taekwondo if not ballet for boys? The Stripes have leaned into the similarities with a pared-down incarnation of the Taekwondo called the Mei Ballet. It features an upper that bares most of the top of your foot to a lengthy lace window and long enough laces to provide ankle support as well. Adidas isn’t the sole brand in the ballet sneaker game, though.PumaandOnitsuka Tigerhave both leaned into it, both offering ballet-friendly versions of classic silhouettes in the Speedcat Ballet and Mexico 66 Ballet. Both trim down the uppers of reliable favorites and replace laces with straps. They’re exclusively available in women’s sizing, but personally we’d advise to never let something like that stop you from getting on the wave. It’s also worth noting that the Puma Speedcat itself has been wildly popular over the last year. While it’s not a ballet shoe (its origins are in motorsport) it shares the same sense of design and minimalism as ballet shoes, speaking to a broader desire in the scene for simpler, slimmer silhouettes these days. Other brands are incorporating the influence of ballet shoes into silhouettes in more off-kilter ways.Salomon, for example, in a collaboration withSandy Liangreplaced the traditional lace system of the Speedcross 3 with a thick ribbon, getting in on the ballet moment without creating a shoe that strays too far from the aesthetic they’ve cultivated over the years. PUMA Foot Locker Salomon StockX Don’t take our word for it, though–the numbers don’t lie here. Regardless of your opinion on the resale market as an industry, StockX remains one of the most valuable hubs of trend data in the sneaker world. They recently reported that between February and March (around the time of the Bad Bunny Ballerina drop), sales of shoes featuring “ballet” or “ballerina” in the name increased well over a whopping 1,000%. That’s a lot of sales of a lot of shoes and certainly enough to warrant calling it to attention. Trends are trends and there’s no telling if ballet sneakers are just having a moment or having a year. We won’t know until we get there. In any case, it’s a refreshing moment in a sneaker scene that’s been spinning its wheels over the same retros and reheated nachos over the last few years. Ballet sneakers are slim, sexy, and fun. They offer the chance to incorporate a style of sneaker that might be seen as traditionally feminine into more menswear-centric fits. They won’t bite. They’re far from gatekept and you don’t have to audition forSwan Lakefor the right to lace up a pair.",

    "title": "9 Best Back Shavers of 2025, Tried & Tested",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If there's one thing to remember when hunting for the best back shaver, it's that there’s no shame in having a hairy back. In fact, more power to you if you rock asweater’sworth of fuzz without a care in the world; we could all learn something from ya. And you know who else can learn something? The guy whoDIYsa hasty solution to get rid of his back hair and ends up withredness,ingrown hairs, or a shoddy half-shorn finish. For this guy, we’re here to first and foremost recommend the best back shaver,trimmer, ormanual razor, which makesback hair removala one-man task. (Later on, we’ve got some best practices on how to put your newly acquired electric back hair shaver to use.) Let’s get to it. Philips Norelco Amazon Key features:Dual-function trimming and foil shaving head; three body-trimming guards (3, 5, and 7mm); detachable and extendable rubber grip; waterproof| Battery:Rechargeable; 1-hour charge; 1-hour runtime Why we love it:Name one category of body grooming devices that Philips Norelco doesn’t absolutely dominate. This brand has your back—and literally, in this case. Their 5000 series body groomer brings dual-action efficiency to the thickest thatches, with each hair getting chopped down by the trimming teeth, then mowed over by the foil head shaver. It is a great manscaper for your front and back half, but for the back specifically, I love its clip-in extendable handle that bends to whichever degree you need. I do like this one as abody hair trimmertoo—it’s adept for that, but prefer it as an actual shaver, especially on the backside. (I don’t know many guys who “trim” their back hairs to anything but a barely-there 0.1mm.) So just go bare-guarded with this and shear it all off. If you do want a dual body hair trimmer/shaver from the brand, I suggest upgrading to the dual-endedBodygroom 7000. But when it comes to straightforward back hair handling—especially for the solo shaver who doesn’t have a helping hand from his +1 or roommate—the less expensive and equally adept 5000 series is unbeatable. BaKblade Amazon Key features:Wide blades designed for wet or dry shaving; rubber-grip foldable handle; detachable exfoliating brush Why we love it:This one looks all kinds of funny—maybe it could catch a pop fly before it clears the outfield fence, or maybe it’s an ancient torture device. When put to the test of shaving the back, though, this one truly is a home run. Its nearly two-foot-long handle allows you to hold it high up over your shoulder and down to the lower back. Its widerazorscover enough real estate to do the entire task in a few simple minutes, too. My first time out, I wondered if it would really hit every spot, with no irritation or redness. And yet every time I have used the BakBlade, I get the same smooth results, no matter how long I’ve let my hair grow out. The one trick I have is an odd raised mole on the one side of my back (I have had it looked at, yes); I’m anxious to just glide this one over top that mole, so I do have to deploy some extra strategy in that section of the back—typically, just taking it slow with this same BakBlade is more than enough to get the results I want and need. I’ve become a BakBlade evangelist—my texts are riddled with friends bragging about no longer having to ask their partner or roommate for help. The BakBlade does go through razors fast, since it uses three (sigh, proprietary) blades at once, and only includes three when you purchase. I suggest bundling in an extra dozenblade replacements, which should get you six months or so of smoothness. Gillete Amazon Key features:5 blades; flexible head navigates contours; double lubrication strips to reduce skin irritation Why we love it:If you’re committed to shaving your back with the same cartridge-style razor as your cheeks (dealer’s choice on which “cheeks” I mean), then I’d happily endorse this manscaping sensation from Gillette. It’s built for your fragile, awkwardly shaped junk, which is why I trust it to navigate the blindspots on my back. (I like to apply the same thinking to my skincare and shaving: When in doubt, buy the product that’s built for the sensitive stuff.) I often ask my partner to shave my back for me, too, especially ahead of a long beach-sprawling week, and that’s when I want to deploy something that allows for this kind of precision and sensitivity, packaged into one. As for self shaving: While the Gillette doesn’t let me reach every square inch of my back like I can with the electric and expandable options, it’s a terrific solution for battling wooly collar creep: shoulder-level shaves and upper-back cleanups. Be sure tostock up on some extra cartridges, too. Amazon Key features:Two swappable shock-absorbing heads (trimmer and foil shaver); extra-wide shaving head and extendable neck; 135-degree trimming angle for perfect clip; power-burst button for added oomph; foldable handle; waterproof| Battery:80-minute runtime on 2.5-hour charge Why we love it:Long before I employed my partner for my back hair maintenance, Mangroomer was a lifesaver. It’s the best electric manscaping option for any combination of shaving and trimming your backside; its two interchangeable heads allow for whichever task you need to tackle. And above all, this foldable and adjustable trimmer gives you full control over your shaving domain—that is, your backside and its many blindspots. My preference is to use it as a dry shaver, since it won’t cut quite as riskily close as an actual manual razor. I’ve never had any issues with nicking or razor burn with the Intellimax Pro’s main trimming head, and honestly, I just leave its trimming head attached. It cuts to a 0.5mm stubble—so short it’s not even stubble—which feels as good as a shave for me (especially considering that it eliminates the threat of razor burn and ingrowns). Panasonic Amazon Key features:Angled vertical trimming head, swappable guard lengths: 3mm, 6mm, and a sensitive-skin “helmet” guard| Battery:Rechargeable; 50-minute runtime; 1-hour charge Why we love it:Panasonic’s all-star manscaper won gold in ourbest body groomerslist for a few years running, for two key reasons. First, Panasonic always delivers serious power and performance. Second—and specific to back hair trimming—its vertical trimming head makes snipping hairs—even from behind your back and over your shoulder—ridiculously easy, skating over hairy skin without any friction or agony. (It does require the slightest flexibility to hit the centermost part of your back, but it’s a trick you’ll master after the first few uses.) This design also makes it great for snipping hairs in odd crevices, like at the top of your haunch, and in the armpits. For back hair mitigation, I prefer to use the bare blade, no guards; I assume the same of you, since leaving short hairs feels against the point. And although I sometimes get a slight red streak due to the proximity of the trim, it never stings and it always disappears within a couple hours. Remington Amazon Walmart Key features:5 rotary panels; slip-proof grip; waterproof| Battery:50 minute runtime on 4-hour charge Why we love it:Lots of guys don’t need a back hair shaver, butdorequire the aid of a good shoulder hair mitigation plan. For that, use the same device that tops our list of thebest bald head shavers: This rotary-faced shaver from Remington hugs every curve of your shoulders, and can intake the coarsest or curliest of hairs without requiring a dozen passes. Plus, if you’re bald, you can just do everything together in the shower, in one single stretch. BroShaver Amazon This manual back shaver has two settings: Mild and Saucy. While the names are a little goofy (and undeniably fun) this unique two-setting approach lets you control how close you want your shave to be. Mangroomer Amazon For seriously hairy backs, we like the power of the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro. It's a personal grooming workhorse, and features Flex Necks that contour your back to help with blade-skin alignment while you trim. BakBlade Amazon With a 23-inch-long handle and six BakBlade refill cartridges so you can actually swap out your blades when you'resupposedto, this device lets you hit every spot on your back for a smooth shave every time. Hatteker Amazon Hatteker makes great budget grooming products—from beard trimmers to hair clippers—and with four removable heads and skin-safe blades, this is no exception. Choosing the right back shaver for you boils down to that classic debate: Manual razor orelectric shaver? You have terrific options for both—including a range of options within each bucket. Manual (razor) back shavers:Like thebest facial razors, back razors shave your hairs slightly below the surface of skin, meaning you get a baby-smooth finish that should last all weekend. You also get all of a blade’s potential downsides:razor burn,razor bumps, and ingrown hairs. The risk is worth the dolphin-esque reward if you have particularly thick hair that grows fast. You can choose from broad-based razors (like that of the BakBlade), or standard cartridge razors (like Gillete’s). I’m typically not one to endorse using a safety razor on your own back, given the blind spots and degree of difficulty navigating your shoulders while risking charlie horses—all while you handle a sharp blade at awkward angles. Remember to stay on top of yourrazor hygieneand swap the blades out after 2-3 weeks of use or after 6-8 shaves (whichever comes first). If you choose a manual razor for your back, be sure to shave it the day or night ahead of any sun exposure so it gets a moment to heal before getting cooked at the beach. Electric back shavers:Like thebest electric shaversfor your face, battery-powered back shavers will cut slightly above the surface of the skin. That means that you might feel the stubble after the first day (though visually, you should look hairless for a few days to a week). If you need an emergency beach day shave, an electric shaver will be faster and prevent double damage to your skin. In my own opinion, it’s worth having an electric back shaver on back-up duty even if you prefer a razor. Most electric back shavers resemble body trimmers because of the ergonomics involved; since so many of these trimmers cut your hair to a smooth finish, I oftentimes consider body trimmers and body shavers as one in the same—and when you open your box, you may find attachments in your body shave to help you with hard-to-reach places. Actual shavers for your back will often have trimming teeth buffering both sides of its foil shaving panel (as used in the Philips Norelco option above). This design allows you to mow through any stray hairs ahead of the shearing blades, and to save time without having to first trim the hairs down with a separate device. Rotary shavers work just fine if you can manage the contortions. (Rotary options are great for the shoulders, in particular, so if that’s the only place you want to shave body hair, don’t bother getting a dedicated back hair trimmer, instead sticking with a rotary shaver.) Properly shaving your back doesn’t have to be complicated, but there are a few things you’re going to want to brush up on before you head to Amazon to stock up on the best clipper and do-it-yourself. Look for an adjustable handle that allows you to reach areas of your back that you might not otherwise be able to (note: some electric razors and beard trimmers have these included when you buy them, so if you have one of those tools you may already be set). Make sure your blade is sharp and that you have replacement blades at hand. And then go easy. “Developingrazor burnis very common when shaving the body, especially when shaving areas you can’t see,” addsDr. Ryan Turner, board-certified NYC dermatologist and co-founder ofTRNR Skin, of how to stay pain free when shaving. “Besidesusing a dull blade, [the act of] dry shaving or shaving too quickly are leading causes of razor burn, and if you can’t see how much shaving cream you’ve applied or fully reach the area, you’re more likely to get razor burn. That lack of visibility can also cause nicks. I’ve seen backs look like the person got in a fight with a cat!” 1. Practice good razor hygiene Less is more when it comes to repeat uses with any back hair razors—specifically with manual razor blades. “We’re addressing a lot of surface area, which is going to dull the razor blade faster, so you don’t want to start with a blade that’s already begun to dull,” says Turner. “It’s optimal to use a fresh razor blade each time you shave your back. The sharper a razor blade is, the smoother the shave. A dull blade will snag on the hair or the skin, increasing your likelihood of causing nicks, cuts, razor burn, or ingrown hairs.” 2. Build out your regimen It’s a good idea to turn this whole process into a proper shave regimen, says Turner, similar to thebest face shaving routine. So, if you aren’t just doing a quick once-over with an electric trimmer, then you should add in a few more steps in order to prevent razor burn, bumps, and ingrown hairs. “Take a shower, then cleanse and exfoliate,” says Turner. “This gets off dirt, debris, and softens the hairs in preparation for shaving.” If you can manage the application (or have a friend to help, he says to use a shave gel to help improve razor glide across the skin. (Score one for using a close-cutting back hair trimmer instead of a bare razor, if you are handling this task on your own.) Then: “Use your fresh razor with gentle, light strokes, rinsing off the razor every few strokes to prevent clogging of the razor so that a smoother shave happens,” Turner advises. “Rinse away hair bits and the shaving products with warm water, pat the skin dry or air dry, and then apply moisturizer.” 3. Test your sensitivities Not all of us have the same sensitivities or reactions to things like shaving, so it’s good to experiment with different trimming and shaving techniques as you decide what works best for you—and never attempt something for the first time if you need a clean backside days later. If you don’t know how your back handles an actual shave (versus a simple trimming), then pre-beach is not the time to try, says Turner. 4. Buffer your buffing by a day Similar to the tip above, you should just never do a shave (or wax) right before you expect to show it off—even if you know your skin tends to handle it well. “Your skin is exposed to a lot of elements at the beach, like sun, sand, wind, and ocean or lake water,” says Turner. “And thus a lot of potential irritants [factor into play]. Shaving can exfoliate a significant amount of the topmost layer of skin, which can negatively affect the skin barrier, your first line of defense against external irritants.” So, giving skin a night or two to recover will help build back this barrier post-shave. “It also helps to properly moisturizing the skin post-shave,” says Turner. “Removing that first layer of skin also makes your skin more susceptible to sun damage, so don’t forget toapply sunscreen!” 5. Trim before you shave If your hair is grown out more than a couple weeks’ worth, then you shouldn’t just go in with a manual razor and expect a smooth shave, Turner says. Ditto if you have really coarse body hairs. You have to trim first, then go in with the actual razor. But again, I suggest simply defaulting to a trimmer in the first place, since they can trim your hairs so close to the skin that itlooksand feels smooth. Sure, that smoothness lasts a day or three, but it’s easy to go in with the trimmer again (and takes a couple minutes, tops), as soon as you need to show it off again. I wish I could tell you that I got professional IPL (laser hair removal), or that I never grew back hair in the first place. Alas, I am as fuzzy as the day is long, and I have needed back hair shavers ever since college. That’s a cool two decades of experience—over half of them spent as a professional grooming expert and product tester—so I have tested pretty much every significant product on this planet, and stay atop the trends with the latest new products to market, too. This list reflects all my favorites across a variety of executions, all resulting in smooth, problem-free skin.",

    "title": "The Story Behind Michael B. Jordan’s Sultry Sinners Tank Top",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. This story contains spoilers forSinners. There are a lot of thoughtful, serious costumes inSinners. DirectorRyan Coogler’s wildly successful, deeply horny, 1930s-set vampire movie is full of period references, fine details, and one ridiculously jackedMichael B. Jordan. And for large swaths of the film, Jordan’s rippling biceps are framed by a ripped, sweaty, bloodytank top. During my screening, the woman next to me muttered a very earnest “Oh mygod”when Smoke—one of Jordan’s twin protagonists—strips down to his ribbed tank and leather gun holsters to fight off the hoard of Irish-jigging vampires in act three. My group chat debrief involved equal amounts of “That was amazing,” and “MBJ fine as hell.” Everyone is reminded ofthat poor girlwho bit clean through her retainer when Jordan took his shirt off inBlack Panther,and everyonegets it. Anyway. I’m getting carried away. The point is: Smoke’s tank top = good. Very good. Ruth E. Carter,Sinners’ Oscar-winning costume designer (who also worked on bothBlack Panthermovies with Coogler), says the choice was all about practicality. Smoke and Stack are army vets. So, Carter and Jordan cycled through a few options before landing on the vest. “Once we got in the fitting room, and we’re trying different ideas about how we would end this movie with Smoke, we knew that there was a military aspect to their story,” says Carter. “Both [Smoke and Stack] served in World War I. I tried on a vintage green army thermal, you know? I thought about what he could have [on] his chest that he could pull out when it was time.” In the end, they went with a less militaristic option—but one that still spoke to Smoke’s pragmatic nature. (This was also the ethos behind the twins’ suits, too: Stack, more of a lothario, sports sharpItalian tailoring, collar pins, and matching pocket squares; Smoke, the everyman, is inworkwear-inspired tailoring, with room to conceal his weapons.) But, of course, there’s no denying the other factor: “Michael B. Jordan is just the most handsome,” says Carter. “He’s so conscious about his health and working out and staying fit… It just made sense that [the tank top is] where we would end up. “More than likely [Smoke] had the tank top on for, you know, someotherreason,” says Carter with a smile. You know: real character stuff. But when you’ve got the rippling biceps of Mr Jordan at your disposal, and blood and sweat to splash on him, you put him in that ribbed tank. Carter says Jordan is a keen collaborator on sets, and they often riff off each other during the fitting process. “He’s not dictating. We’re conversing. He’s excited. We get excited about the possibilities,” she says. “This is the time when we can actually speak our mind in a fitting. It’s a transformation process, and there’s no pressure. There’s not an audience watching you. You’re laughing. You’re playing.” Sadly, we have (semi-) bad news for anyone whose cinema experience left them frantically googling ‘Michael B JordanSinnersvest buy now’ (and maybe also: ‘Michael B Jordan pec routine overnight results’). The tanks aren’t available for mass purchase—they were made in collaboration with California brandRunabout Goods. “We made everything,” says Carter. “That tank top is from a small designer brand that specializes in men's workwear from the ’20s and ’30s, and he manufactures right out of his house. That tank top is based on the cut of a real original tank top that was worn in the ’20s, down to the ribbing style.” If you’re looking to recreate Jordan’s smolderingSinnerslook, you can custom order the tank top through the brand’s website. Sweat, blood, and biceps not included. Merz b. Schwanen Huckberry Gap Gap This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "My Grandfather Is the Most Powerful Dandy I Know",
    "article_text": "I prefer to write in my grandfather’s shirt. I’m wearing it now, a blue-and-white-striped Brooks Brothers button-up he passed down to me as a teen. It’s one of several garments I have of his, among them a Christian Diordress shirt, a broadcloth button-down fromBarneys New York’s private label, and a pale pink tie with a diagonal stripe pattern by Oscar de la Renta. I cherish them because they’re his; they express his style. And when I wear that shirt I feel most at home, so to speak. But I also take pride in wearing or simply having his clothes because he’s a Renaissance man. Eight years ago, for the Butler Institute of American Art’s Black History Month programming, my grandfather curated a self-titled exhibition, “Maj. Amos Randall Sr.: Love You Greatly,” which included a self-portrait he drew in elementary school and other illustrations of his own work. (“LOVE YOU GREATLY” is his signature sign-off, even when texting. All caps, always.) As a Vietnam War hero, he was inducted into the Ohio Military Hall of Fame in 2005, receiving numerous awards for his service and leadership. He’s a devoted woodsman. And during the cozily structured summers I’d spent with him—writing essays and book reports for prompts he’d given me, most memorably—he was one of my earliest editors. I texted him last June asking if he still kept stacks of books and newspapers at the foot of his bed. It’s no surprise that he does; his astute, creative, affective word use is present as ever. For what now seems a rather prescient family history project I was working on, I once had him send photos of his clothes. The man’s got taste. Herewith his “ASSORTMENT OF ATTIRE”: feathered Stetson hats, a London Fogtrench coat, his collection of ties mirroring my preference in them—go bold or bust! Not to mention his three or soPierre Cardinboots from when the designer was better known for menswear. He has a fine eye for clothes that he has applied to his art, as seen in another of his self-portraits, all dandy-like in a white, peak-lapel suit and burgundy polka dot tie with a matching pocket square. To paint the full image of my grandfather sporting such clothing would mean including these accessories: cologne and a nice car. Smelling good, like a good haircut, has always been as vital to Black men’s style as our clothes. And his cars were parked in a neighborhood with only three Black families, in Lawton, Oklahoma, where he still lives. When my mom was growing up, he drove “a pearl white 300 ZX with cognac leather interior. Always detailed and nice and clean,” she recalls. By the time she was in high school, “he drove a white Lexus with chrome wheels.” Maj. Randall took pride in all facets of his appearance. Throughout his life, my grandfather has kept that up with the disciplined consistency one expects from an army veteran. “We were always concerned with ironed clothes, crisp clothes, starching our clothes,” Phillip Randall, my grandfather’s brother, tells me. The two were inseparable growing up, sharing personality traits and an appreciation for fine clothing. Recounting how my grandfather’s time in the military informed his style, Uncle Phillip added, “Amos was always neat and pressed. He wanted to have the best look, but not overtly so.” It’s just that “you would expect all that to be in the uniform.” My grandfather is the kind of man who wielded his dandyish flair at will, oscillating between vibrant and reserved expression, but always keeping it classic. The pictures tell it. There’s one of him with his hand on his hip, afro patted to perfection, clad in a black mesh shirt and light blue shorts. In another, he’s dressed in a dagger-collared floral shirt, white flares, and a navy blue blazer, an ensemble his favorite blues artist B.B. King might’ve worn. I think I would characterize his style today as Mister Rogers-meets-Nat “King” Cole. During a Voice of America interview from the mid-’50s, Cole was prompted to speak on his wardrobe. “Do you have any idea what your wardrobe consists of? How many suits and things like that?” the interviewer asked. Though Cole didn’t keep count, he admitted to preferring “conservative, gray and black and, you know, dark blue suits.” He was the version of a dandy Monica Miller describes as “tastefully reserved” in her monographSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity. I could say the same about my grandfather. He’d wear his three-piece, stone gray, zoot-style suit by Giovanni Testi with a smoothness—the “easy grace that floats around the body like smoke,” as put by Lloyd Boston in his bookMen of Color: Fashion, History and Fundamentals (1998). But, using Cole as an example, Lloyd makes a point much bigger than the clothes, or music, for that matter. “Nat ‘King’ Cole’s barrier-breaking style influence was so powerful that it resonated throughout more areas of Black male culture than just music: The reality of a Black man whose lifestyle was equal to that of any other mainstream public figure was incredibly inspiring.” As a recent high school graduate, Grandfather left Youngstown, Ohio, for basic training down South. Uncle Phillip remembers getting a call from him, disoriented at being forced to sit in the back of the bus due to the region’s racial segregation. He went on to get an education and become a decorated major. Indeed, it was he whom the US Army had chosen one year to explain the country’s mission during the Vietnam War. For months I felt iffy about a World War II-era Burberry coat I bought that was owned by Lt. Gen. William H. Stratton. Which is to say I couldn’t settle, comfortably, into a dead white man’s garment without a new mentality. I needed to shed the coat of its old power and summon a new authority. Turns out, I’m two generations removed from it.",

    "title": "The 18 Most Expensive Sneakers Ever Sold",
    "article_text": "In July 2019, the paradigm for the most expensivesneakersever sold shifted forever. That's when Sotheby's registered its first-ever sale of a pair of sports shoes at auction: vintage Nike “Moon Shoes” from 1972, which hammered for a record-setting $437,000—nearly triple the expected sale price of $150,000. Less than a year later, in May 2020, the auction house moved a pair of autographedAir Jordan1s for an eye-watering $560,000, making it clear that this was not a one-off fluke. “Loco prices like these are not just a high-water mark for collectors,” the Sneaker Freaker editor-in-chief Woody writes inTheWorld’s Greatest Sneaker Collections. “They also represent an influx of moneyed investors looking at sneakers as blue-chip investments.” In the sake of these legitimized auction-house trades, private sales of rare sneakers have exploded on the market, reaching some truly dizzying heights. “Today, both prices perversely look like bargains,” Woody writes of those first two sneaker sales, “if you can stomach the idea of old sports shoes worth as much as a house.” It seems all but guaranteed that these numbers will only continue to rise from here, so watch this space—the age of the sneaker auction is only just beginning. From more rare game-worn grails to insane one-of-one gems, here are the most expensive sneakers ever sold. Earlier this year, Sotheby's registered the most lucrative sneaker sale in the history of the auction house, when the eight-shoe pack known as the “Dynasty Collection” racked up an impressive $8 million sale. The Dynasty Collection included eight sneakers actually worn by Michael Jordan during the NBA playoffs across eight different seasons. Tim Hallam, the public relations officer for the Chicago Bulls for many years, asked MJ for one of his game-worn shoes after the Finals in 1991—a practice Jordan continued after every playoffs performance thereafter, perhaps out of superstition. These eight shoes represent theothersneaker that Hallam did not receive in these cases. What’s especially impressive about this sale is that none of the sneakers came in pairs. The lot also included a set of signed photos by Bill Smith of Jordan following each of the Finals, in which he can be seen wearing a shoe on just one foot. After the runaway success of ESPN’sJordan documentaryThe Last Dancein 2020, interest in Air Jordan sneakers worn during MJ's final season with the Chicago Bulls surged. Last year, a buyer completed a sale at Sotheby's for an ultra-rare pair of Jordan 13s that were on His Airness's feet for the iconic final game of the 1998 NBA Finals. The grand total?A staggering $2.2 million, negotiated in advance and in line with estimates from the auction house.It was a landmark sale for a single pair of sports shoes and a reminder that when it comes to sports memorabilia, it’s hard to beat Michael Jordan. The kicks were in the “Bred” colorway and appeared to be in good condition, especially considering they saw some serious action on the hardwood. LA-based conceptual artist Matt Senna is known for his resin sculptures made to look like classic sneakers, which he creates in small batches and sells off for $450 a pair. In 2020, however, took the concept one step further by crafting an Air Jordan 10 out of solid 24-karat gold. The one-of-one work of art was commissioned by Drake (who else?), and while they’re not actually wearable—each shoe clocks in at a hefty 100 pounds—they nonetheless belong on this list for their sheer audacity alone. Of course, it’s not just Jordans making noise on the high-end sneaker market, as this monumental sale proved. In the spring of 2021, Sotheby's registered a sale at auction of a one-of-a-kind pair of Nike Air Yeezy prototypes, which Kanye West debuted onstage at the Grammys in 2008. The sneakers were the first-ever pair sold for more than a million dollars. The Yeezys were purchased by the investing platform RARES. The company’s CEO and founder, Gerome Sapp, told the press that the shoes were acquired “in order to increase accessibility and empower the communities that birthed sneaker culture with the tools to gain financial freedom,” adding that buying them was like securing “a piece of history.” When this pair of Nike Air Ships sold for nearly $1.5 million at auction via Sotheby’s in late 2021, they briefly became the most expensive sports shoes of all time and remain one of the most expensive pieces of sports memorabilia ever sold. Worn by Michael Jordan during his fifth-ever NBA game in November 1984, they are a definitive part of sneaker history. Serious sneaker fans know the Air Ship as the first model Jordan sported in the league, while the design for the Air Jordan was still being finalized by Nike. This particular pair of Air Ships would have been one of the first and only shoes Michael ever wore on the court that weren’t part of his signature shoe line, making them in some ways even more special. Following Game 5 of the 1998 NBA Finals, a Utah Jazz ball boy by the name of Preston Truman was given a once-in-a-lifetime gift: the sneakers Michael Jordan wore during the game. In 2020, in the wake of the release ofThe Last Danceand the uptick in collectors’ interest in Air Jordans, Truman sold the shoes to Grey Flannel Auctions for a little over $200,000. Just three years later, in early 2023, they sold again at auction for an incredible $1.38 million. It helped that the shoes were worn during the legendary Flu Game, in which Jordan overcame a debilitating bout of food poisoning to deliver one of his most clutch performances ever. To this day, the black-and-red Air Jordan 12s are known as the “Flu Game,” which means that these sneakers are the OG version of one of the most beloved Jordan colorways of all time, too. Few game-worn sneakers have as much illustrious history attached to them. The story does have a down side:Truman launched a lawsuit against Grey Flannel in 2023, claiming that they pressured him into selling the shoes. The lawsuit is still ongoing. In August 2020, as post-Last DanceJordan hype was reaching record levels, a single pair of game-worn Air Jordan 1s turned heads when it sold atauction via Christie’s for more than half a million dollars. Worn by Michael Jordan during an exhibition game in Italy, according to the auction listing, they were actually estimated to fetch an even higher figure, closer to $850,000. (Still, the price was impressive.) What made this particular pair of Jordan 1s so unique was what else was included with them: a shard of broken glass, embedded directly into the shoe and apparently caused by Jordan shattering the backboard during a slam dunk. (These, of course, are not to be confused with the “Shattered Backboard” Jordan 1s.) During the same auction, a pair of sneakers worn by Jordan during Team USA’s gold medal game at the 1992 Olympics fetched over $100,000. On April 12, 2013,Kobe Bryantdelivered one of the most unforgettable performances of his career: despite tearing his achilles tendon mid-game, he managed to drop 32 points on the Golden State Warriors—even remaining on the court after the injury to drill two clutch free throws on one foot. It remains perhaps the finest example of Kobe’s famed “Mamba Mentality.” No surprise, then, that in February 2025, Sotheby’s managed to fetch well over half a million dollars at auction for the purple-and-gold kicks he wore that night. Mere months before the previous entry, another pair of Air Jordan 1s hit the auction block and shattered the previous record for the sale of shoes, which was set in 2019 (see below). Signed by Michael Jordan, the shoes were worn during a game in his rookie season. Like MJ's vertical, the bids for the sneakers were downright explosive in the final hours of the 10-day auction,rocketing up by $300,000 to close at an incredible $560,000. In 1972, when Nike was still just a fledgling upstart, the company's co-founder and running guru Bill Bowerman cobbled together one of the Swoosh's first-ever performance shoes. Dubbed the “Moon Shoes”—because their waffle-tread soles left astronaut-like footprints in the dirt—only about a dozen pairs of these crude prototypes were made and handed out that year to competitors at the US Track & Field Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon. They eventually served as the inspiration for Nike's legendary Waffle Trainer, which launched in 1974. Forty-five years later, the sneakers made history all over again by becoming the first collectible sport shoes to be sold at auction by Christie's. The 2019 sale helped establish the precedent for the market, which continues to expand and grow even now. At the time, no one expected sneaker auctions to be quite so coveted: initial estimates placed the Moon Shoes at a conservative $160,000, but the pair hammered for nearly triple that. Canadian business Miles Nadal, who scooped up these mammoth grails in the auction, called them “a true historical artifact in sports history and pop culture.” The “Broken Foot” Air Jordan 1s are yet another historic pair of game-worn Js that absolutelysmashedthe initial estimate. They sold fora jaw-dropping $422,130, almost double the starting bid of $250,000in an auction at Leland's in January 2022. The shoes take their name from an infamous game between the Bulls and Golden State Warriors on October 29, 1985, during which Michael Jordan fractured a bone in his left foot. The injury would become career-defining for Jordan, derailing his second season and igniting the fire that drove him toward his first championship, as detailed in the ESPN documentaryThe Last Dance. Leland’s said it acquired the shoes from “a cosigner whose father was gifted the game-worn sneakers personally from Jordan at the time,”according to a report in Complex. The sneakers come in Jordan’s own slightly mismatched sizing: size 13 on the left, size 13 and a half on the right. In February 2022, just months after the tragic passing ofVirgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton auctioned off 200 pairs of the late visionary's most coveted sneaker designs: aNike Air Force 1entirely covered in LV's iconic monogram and Damier check. The auction at Sotheby's was organized in support of Abloh's acclaimed scholarship fund “Post-Modern,” which was founded to “support the education of academically promising students of Black, African American, or African descent.” Most of the pairs sold in the low six figures. This particular pair, a US size 5, sold for nearly 25 times the original auction estimate and for twice the price of the second-most expensive pair sold, a US size 5.5 that went for $176,400. Demand for Abloh’s work only continues to skyrocket, and it seems likely that other rarities bearing his signature will sell for increasingly high figures as time goes on. “Power laces! Alright!”There’s perhaps no more famous sneaker scene in movie history than Marty McFly slipping on his futuristic, auto-lacing Nike Air Mag kicks in 1989’sBack to the Future: Part II. After decades of lobbying from fans, Nike finally released the fictional sneakers to the public via two highly limited drops: first in 2011, without the power laces; and then again in 2016withthem. All of the proceeds from both launches went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which supports the search for a cure for Parkinson's disease. The 88 pairs of the 2016 version alone raised more than $6 million for the charity, including a single pair auction off at a gala for awhopping $200,000. On December 5, 2012, at 34 years and 104 days old, Kobe Bryant surpassed Wilt Chamberlain to become the youngest player ever to record his 30,000th point in the NBA. (That record has since been eclipsed by LeBron James, who managed the feat at 33 years and 24 days old.) The Nike Kobe 7 PEs he wore during that game were sold at auction for $200,000 in March 2025. Both shoes are autographed and inscribed by Bryant, and the package included an actual ticket and a DVD of the game. For sneakerheads of a certain age, there's no more covetable shoe than the Air Jordan 11 “Space Jam,” named for its appearance in the movie and worn by MJ during his post-baseball return to the NBA playoffs in 1995. And the rarest, most alluring version of the “Space Jam” is this deadstock sample created for the film and signed by Jordan himself. Dubbed the “MJ’s Secret Stuff” Jordan 11s, they sold at auction in 2021 for an impressive $176,000. In December 2024, a truly insane find hit the auction block: a signed pair of original, never-worn Air Jordan 1s. Technically billed as “player samples” from the first factory run of Jordans back in 1985, the sneakers were presented as a gift to the head of advertising at the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company from a sports marketing agent who represented Jordan during his rookie season. They remained unblemished in their original packaging for nearly 40 years, before fetching an impressive $80,000 at Sotheby’s. Not quite a game-worn grail, but an incredible piece of sneaker history nonetheless. Sotheby’s recently auctioned off one of the more unusual sneakers on the collector’s market: an ultra-rare pair of Omega sports shoes that had been offered as a freebie to Apple employees at a sales conference back in the 1990s. Apple’s cultural cache was at an all-time low at the time, with the iPod still to come and the success of the Mac a fading memory, but allegiance to the brand still ran deep. When the company made its unexpected resurgence in the 2000s to become the most dominant tech brand on the market, employee merch like these sneakers became must-have collector’s items—hence the impressive price tag of $50,000. The Los Angeles-based sneaker boutique Undefeated, founded in 2002 by Eddie Cruz, remains one of the most beloved retailers in the industry. In 2005, the shop collaborated with Jordan Brand to release an extremely limited edition pair of Air Jordan 4s: the “Undefeated 4s,” inspired by the look of military flight jackets and covered in olive nubuck. The shoes were limited to only 72 pairs, and they have come to be regarded as one of the rarest and most coveted collabs ever. Last December, a single pair of this collaboration was auctioned off for $50,000, a testament to the shoe’s ongoing legacy. (Keep your eyes peeled, though:the Undefeated 4s are rumored to be making a long-awaited returnsometime this summer.)",

    "title": "Kevin Hart and Ed Sheeran Know This Rolex Is the Ultimate Collector’s Piece",
    "article_text": "If you’re a super-collector these days—a true member of the Swiss-made cognoscenti—then you better have Rolex’s limited- and extremely special-edition“Le Mans” Daytonaon your wrist. Immediately upon its 2023 debut in white gold, this impossible-to-source chronograph shot to the top of the Most Wanted list of every collector from here to Hong Kong. Case in point: BothEd SheeranandKevin Hartsaw fit to wear theirs this week. Don’t know precisely whichDaytonawe’re referring to? Let’s restart our chronographs for a moment, winding the proverbial watch back to 2023… We thought Rolex had played its hand in early April of 2023 at Watches and Wonders with its“Emoji” Day-Date, “Celebration” Oyster Perpetual, and 1908. All of these would have been perfectly good headliner releases for the year! Little did we know that the pièce de résistance would come out one random day in June of that year. The“Le Mans” Daytona, made in celebration of 100 years of the famous 24-hour endurance race, was a bombshell. The design is inspired by vintage Daytona designs and bespeckled with tiny Easter eggs and broke the collective mind of the horological internet while sending collectors into an absolute tizzy. And if you thought it was tough to secure a $15K steel Daytona, try snagging one of these highly limited-production totems of Swiss-made beauty. With a retail price of $51,400, they were quickly trading on the secondary market for a cool quarter-milly. As quickly as the white-gold version (ref. 126529LN) entered the Rolex catalog, it just as swiftly exited stage left to make room for one inyellow gold. Either way, both watches feature the same notable quirks. Those details include 24-hour totalizer, rather than the traditional 12-hour counter, in reference to the race’s day-long run time. Speaking of the chronograph subdials, these are pure white (without contrasting rings) much like those on the vintage and highly collectible “reverse panda” models. Even more significantly, the typeface used within the small confines of the subregisters is based on the one found on the “exotic” dials used in so-called “Paul Newman” Daytonas. Those dials, made by Singer, were originally unpopular and languished on shelves. However, their association with actor and driver Paul Newman—whose ownreference 6239 hammered for nearly $18M back in 2017—saw their value skyrocket over the past several decades. But, wait, there’s more! Take a look at the “100” index on the watch’s tachymeter bezel and you’ll notice it’s in red to highlight the 100th anniversary of Le Mans. (It also matches the red “Daytona” text, a feature of current-production Daytonas but also a reference to vintage “Big Red” versions such as the beloved ref. 6263.) No doubt it’s this special model’s many little quirks that caught the eye of Sheeran, who wore his white gold version at the 2025 Time100 Gala this week, and Hart, who wore his yellow gold version while seated courtside at the Nuggets-Clippers game this week. And to be fair to these two gentlemen, this is a killer watch. Handsome and heavy, it’s the type piece that every Rolex is desperate to own.",

    "title": "8 Omega Fans Pick Their Favorite Speedmasters Ever",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. If you were to rank the most important individual Omega watches—not just the brand’s model families, as we did last week—variants of the legendary Speedmaster would make up a large majority of the list. The watch isn’t merely iconic because it went to the moon—it was groundbreaking long before then and, over the decades, it’s been adopted by rally clubs, design enthusiasts, and everyone in between. “It’s utilitarian without being cold,” says Cam Barr, founder and CEO of the vintage watch store Craft + Tailored, of the Speedy’s enduring appeal. “Elegant without trying too hard. And that balance—function meeting design in such an intentional, almost stubborn way—shows up in nearly every Speedmaster reference, no matter the era.” The Speedy’s sublime design isa major reason it’s such a powerhouse for Omega. The watch looks as great in classic stainless steel as it does in solid yellow gold. Few watches are versatile enough to help astronauts time engine burnsandhost Snoopy on the dial. Here, we asked several Omega-obsessed members of the Watch Illuminati to select their favorite Speedmasters ever. It’s important to note that this is not a list of thebestand/ormost importantSpeedmasters—there are some very important references missing, like the supersized bright-red Alaska Project; the “Ed White” ref. 105.003, worn during the first space walk conducted by an American; the CK2915, the first Speedy ever, in 1957; or the ST 105.003, the one tested by NASA that resulted in the model’s selection for space travel. Instead, the watches you’ll find below go beyond the established greats for quirkier, off-the-beaten-path versions from throughout the watch’s rich history. Courtesy Robert-Jan Broer “The Apollo XI 50th anniversary in 18K Moonshine gold is the perfect tribute to the original gold Moonwatch that was given to the NASA astronauts in 1969. It combines elements from the original model—the burgundy bezel, two faceted onyx hour markers, a solid-gold dial, and a bracelet that tapers to 14 mm at the clasp—with Omega’s modern 3861 coaxial movement, ceramic and gold tech, and Moonshine gold alloy. For me, it’s the best of both worlds!” Courtesy Ashley Budgen “My personal favorite was always the 2005 Limited Edition Gemini IV ref. SU 145.0229 with a metallic blue-and-white reverse panda dial. I bought it very cheaply and in a very weird way: in a hospital maternity ward while the seller’s wife was giving birth (and checking in on him repeatedly to ensure he sold it). Though I had a lot of Speedys—including a lot of 321s—I loved and wore this one 90% of the time, until I eventually sold it to help fund another vintage purchase. As a modern watch, I knew I could always get another Gemini IV, while I couldn’t replace a vintage piece as easily. Nobody really liked these and they languished unsold. Then, after a few of us spammed photos of them on social media, they blew up in price, so I sold for about a third of what they’re worth now and haven’t found the right replacement yet. Definitely a deep regret that I let it go, in hindsight.” Courtesy Matteo, Master of Speed “Without a doubt, the reference I love the most is the very first ‘Professional’ asymmetrical-lugs Speedmaster equipped with the Caliber 321. Today, I’m happy to share with you one of the first watches I bought around 15 years ago, a 105.012-63. It was one of my earliest purchases when I first entered the world of vintage Omega Speedmasters. “I came across this piece with the inscription ‘A.C.P.’ on the dial. At the time, there was very poor information about—just a few books, many of which contained inaccuracies. Over the years, through research, with the Omega Museum and fellow enthusiasts, it was discovered that 50 of these watches were ordered in 1964 by a prestigious rally club in Peru. “This piece truly embodies the racing essence of the Speedmaster—before it became the Moonwatch and before it was chosen by NASA.” Courtesy Sacha Davidoff “My favorite Speedmaster ever is the CK 2998-3 ‘Lollipop.’ I love the look of it. I’ve sold a bunch of them over the years but kept one for myself. They’re damn near impossible to find anymore.” Courtesy William Roberts “My favorite reference is the Omega Speedmaster 14512. This watch flew on Apollo 11 with Michael Collins but didn’t make it to the moon. Later, in Apollo 14, Alan Shepard took it to the surface. “At the time, I think, Speedmaster sales were falling, and Omega made an effort to raise interest or even shift unsold stock by adding some unusual parts. There is the Ultraman, with the orange hand, which was initially thought to be limited to 50 pieces. “Then came the black racing dial with red markers, and it is this execution that I like most. With only approximately 10 pieces [in existence], with another 10 non-Professional examples, this is the rarest production Speedmaster.” Courtesy Cam Barr “I've handled my fair share of Omega Speedmasters over the years—dozens, probably more—but even before doing this professionally, I knew I needed one in my collection. “It wasn’t the whole ‘first watch on the moon’ thing that drew me in, at least not at first. It was the design language. The Speedmaster just makes sense. It’s utilitarian without being cold. Elegant without trying too hard. And that balance—function meeting design in such an intentional, almost stubborn way—shows up in nearly every Speedmaster reference, no matter the era. That’s what pulled me in. “Sure, the fact that it passed NASA’s insane testing and ended up strapped to the wrists of astronauts walking on the lunar surface? That’s a flex. But for me it's always been about how the Speedmaster wears, works, and looks on the wrist. “One of my favorite Speedies is actually a birth-year piece—something I don’t usually chase. But this particular 145.022 came through the shop, and it just ticked every box. It had that warm, golden tritium patina you see in a lot of the 1980s and early ’90s models. It’s got this glow that makes the whole watch feel alive and a bit different. Speedmasters from that era are still relatively attainable, but they offer history, wearability, design, and usually a striking patina. In my opinion, that is tough to beat. They’re the sleeper hits in the neo-vintage world.” Courtesy Phillips “Gold is good. That’s especially true when it comes to choosing my favorite Omega Speedmaster reference of all time. This conundrum was made easier by my affection for yellow gold, which took me to an obvious place: the BA145.022. “This reference is, of course, the Speedmaster created in the wake of the 1969 moon landing and the Apollo missions. Many of the watches were engraved with a message to the recipient—and those lucky owners included some pretty famous Apollo astronauts, like Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Scott Carpenter. One was even presented to President Richard Nixon. He famously turned it down due to its high value, but the watch with his name engraved still exists. “I love this watch because it has such a weird little history. It was limited to just over 1,000 pieces and was given to all manner of folks—with some made available to the public. It’s a Speedmaster, but gold-er, with a gold case, bracelet, and dial. It has these very late-’60s-style black markers, and a dreamy burgundy bezel. This one was re-created by Omega in 2019, but my heart lies with the classic, the OG. This is the Moonwatch for those back on Earth, the Earthwatch. Maybe my adventureless spirit has something to do with my affection for this piece of Speedy lore.” Courtesy Anthony Marquié “During the research for ourMoonwatch Onlybook, we were fortunate enough to purchase and study many, many Speedies. In fact, the vast majority of the watches illustrated in this book were our own. It is very difficult to choose one reference from all those that have contributed to the history of this absolutely iconic watch. Among them, I could mention the first 2998s from the early 1960s, of course, or the solid gold Apollo XI model from 1969. “But this time, for emotional reasons, I'm going to choose my Speedmaster ‘Holy Grail’ ref. 376.0822, bought years ago from its first owner.\" (This was the first Moonwatch with an automatic movement and Omega produced fewer than 2,000 of this reference over just two years.)

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Adam Pally, Who Might Scarf a Half-Eaten Sloppy Joe Left Outside a Hotel Room Door",
    "article_text": "Adam Pallywould like to make something clear: “I did not treat myself any worse than the normal person in their 20s and 30s who thinks they’re going tolive forever,” the now-43-year-old says. “Taking a look at your health is the last thing you really want to do. It's like, ‘Let me get health insurance before I go to the doctor.’” Now, rather than staying up all night and fighting off the impending hangover with more alcohol, Pally has found that a great night of sleep is often on the other side of a Postmates cheat meal. You can tell just from the names of two of his projects—the truTV show he once hosted with Jon Gabrus,101 Places to Party Before You Die, and now his new podcast with Gabrus,Staying Alive,which has a new episode every week—thatpersonal healthhas moved to the front of his brain. TheHappy EndingsandSonic the Hedgehogactor still loves to “throw down,” but as a celebration, not a retreat. In discussing his current state—somewhere betweenwellness kingand fun-loving dad—Pally mentions drinking condiments, the healing power of a hotel shower, and the logic behind “earning” your hangover. There’s a balance to everything, as one of his fitness mantras goes. Adam Pally:No, but the planwasto go to 101 places. We went to eight. For me and Jon, two of our parents died young. With that hanging over your head, there's also a positive to it, which is like you live life to the fullest, because you've experienced loss at a young age. The negative side of that is that sometimes you're not checking in with your body and seeing how long you can keep yourself around. I would say that's where the title came from. But again, you hit an age where death doesn't sound as romantic anymore. When you lose a parent, it's obviously horrible and hard and your world is shattered—if you had a good relationship with them. You have to figure out new things. But there's also a bit of a positive in it, which is freedom. You are in charge now, and I think in becoming in charge of oneself, you start to really take agency [as in], \"Well, if I'm in charge, I want to stick around.\" Pally and Gabrus in 2022. Absolutely not. Look at me. No, man. Look how fat my face is. I literally dranksoy saucelast night. I do my best. I think one of the things I've learned in the podcast—and through tons of therapy—is that life is about balance. You can't even feel the highs and lows if you're not balanced most of the time. So, I try to be balanced. It can't all be one way. I think the only thing in life I'm obsessed with is myself. I just hadn't had sushi in a while. In our house we're trying not to order in as much, just because we want to cook more. All the things that my generation—I don't even know what we are—try to say and do to make ourselves feel better about our carbon footprint. But last night I got to eat by myself late. The kids had eaten, and so I did one of thoseThe Rock-style cheat meals of sushi where they bring you five chopsticks but it’s for one person. It was nice to do. I haven't done that in a while, and Islept great. I slept like a boa constrictor digesting a mouse. App dining is so different. You have your places that you love. That's it. That's where you app dine from. You're not like, super adventurous. I've never been to the sushi spot before, but when I click it, Postmates should have my order. Everything’s a balance. Is it great? No. But do those people order from Amazon? You can’t pull a thread on everything. Just try to do the best you can to stay alive. I think maybe my cardiologist would say, “There's things that should make you shudder,” but I don't feel that way. I just feel like I am lucky. I have a lot of friends that didn't make it out of their 20s and 30s. I'm really lucky to be here at 43 talking about how I can make it one more day. That feels...I never imagined that. I feel very fortunate for that. So, nothing really makes me cringe. I don't think anything like that. I just think that I'm lucky. But, look. A lot of it’s well-documented. I went to theUniversity of Arizona. I was insane. That’s okay too. But I feel lucky enough now at 43 to be like, “Okay. Let's get it together.” Usually you get introduced to that [on the] first day. You're like, I don't need to—it's not something you go back to. It's a one-time experience. Violently high sounds like Tucson, Arizona. It is one of the greatest places. If you want to talk about smoking mushrooms and going camping, I highly suggest Tucson, Arizona. Sure, sure. Atherapistwould say, “You are lying to yourself.” But yes, I think an outlet is good. Again, I don't judge any of my behavior, because I still love to throw down. But I do know I am able to identify it more now as intent—whyI really want to get down. Maybe I'm not doing it anymore out of loneliness. Maybe I'm doing it truly out of release, and that is a different party or a celebration. I think sometimes when you're young, partying is like, “Friday night is a party,” and that's great and fun, but those parties sometimes are not as fun as the big party for when your show gets picked up, or you get a raise, or your kid’s bar mitzvah, or whatever. That just happened to me. I went hard. But the fact that I don't as much anymore made that night so much more fun, and it made that hangover so much more worth it. I love it. I want the latest check-out possible. I want to order room service in a bathrobe. I want to have a headache so bad, and the only thing that fixes it is one of those showers in a hotel where you don't know where the door is. That is something you would've never heard from me 10 years ago. I would've been like, “Are we bringingMolly? Or are we buying it? Does anyone have a number?” The drinking is not the problem. When you're coming back late and you see a half-eaten room service thing outside the door, you pull something off that? I pretty much do it all the time. If I've tied one on, I'm going back to my room, and someone has left out a coconut shrimp, it's getting killed. I’ve eaten half-eaten burgers. I’ve picked uppasta dishes, brought them back to my room, and eaten it with a fork or with the coffee stirrer. Disgusting human garbage. No one’s eating that sloppy Joe at the Ace Hotel at 4 in the morning in Portland? I’m going to crush it. If you're in Los Angeles, you go to the Beverly Hills Juice, you get the apple lemon, triple ginger juice. You suck down as much of it as you can, and then you just let that burn through your head, your face, your body. Eventually it'll burn through your butt, depending on what you did the night before. That and a shower, and you should be able to go somewhere. The New York hangover, it's a little softer. It sets you off into this chaos of the day, more like a pillow. Whereas in Los Angeles, you're going to be in the sunlight, so you need that shove I think. For me, [in New York], pastrami and matzo ball soup. The matzo ball soup, you can get that down no matter how nauseous you are. The salty broth will calm you, like settle you in a way. InChicago, you're fucked, because most likely you've been up the whole night. Chicago, the best hangover cure is just to keep going. Drink it. Chicago hangover is, \"How long am I going to get through this so I can socially introduce the idea of a drink to my co-workers?\" I think the older I get, the less skinny. Skinny is really a term for the youth. I probably identify more now as just extreme chubby. Pally at the premiere of “Hell of a Summer” [It] pales in comparison to what I’m sure my co-stars have received in their time. But yeah, I've been told to lose weight or gain weight. Sometimes I've had to gain weight for roles. I've gained weight for movies that didn't end up going! You're stuck like 30 pounds heavy, and you're like, Oh, my God. But I liked getting there. I was having a milkshake with every meal and working out. You are drinking a lot of margaritas and shit. Smoking. It was great. It really was funny. They were like, \"We're going to start shooting in a month and a half. You think you can gain 40 pounds?\" I was like, \"No problem.\" In three weeks I was [at] like 30 pounds, and they were like, \"Wow. That's impressive!\" I do the best I can. The podcast has been super helpful. We had an immunologist on, Dr. Shruti Naik. She was like, one of the simplest things that our parents didn't do was make sure to incorporate cruciferous vegetables. That's pretty simple, broccoli and cauliflower. If it's just three meals a week, you can get that in. That's pretty easy. I didn't have to do much to up my broccoli intake, but be conscious of it. When I'm at a diner and I'm getting eggs, I try to get broccoli. My Chinese food order had to switch to mainly broccoli-based. Stuff like that is simple and easy. You can get away with a California Pizza Kitchen cauliflower thing. You can get aJimmy John'ssandwich with a ton of protein on it, or whatever your sandwich place is. We got this guy, Ryan Stanger, who's a personal trainer to the stars, helps dudes get in shape for movies. He gave me a piece of advice that I think was really helpful. One of the few times I've actually seen a change in myself was [when] he was like, something is better than nothing. If you can, every day, do something. So often we get caught up in, okay, I'm going to go to the gym in the morning before work. You hit snooze four times and you're like, fuck, missed the gym. Or you’re going to this exercise class after work, but then everyone’sgoing for drinks. We get caught up in, if the exercise doesn’t fit into the routine, then we’re not going to do it. I have taken on the idea that I can really just dosomething. Even if it’s 10 minutes, push something, pull something, and squat. You can do 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats in 15 minutes. Just adding that, I’ve seen a change. I don’t believe anybody like that. Truly, I’ve lived inNew Yorkmy whole life. I’ve been fat. I’ve been thin. I just don’t believe. I feel like most of the time when actors are like, “I got thin when I moved to New York, I started drinking water.” It's like, yeah, and Wegovy. Because [you’re] drinking so much here. I don't know how anybody loses weight here because of water? I'm just walking from bar to bar. The walking is canceling out the fact that you're not worried about getting a DUI, which is a good thing on both accounts. There’s some things. Cold plunging is a hot topic right now. I wish I had learned that it's not as important as the ads on my phone make it out to be. There was a certain moment about a year ago where it was like, you had to cold plunge or you were going to die, and I really got caught up in it. Then we had a couple of experts on, and even some actors who were obsessed with fitness who cold plunge regularly. The truth of it is that the science is neither here nor there. But what it does, prescriptively, is make youfeelbetter. So that's good. If you can give yourself acold plunge, do it. But it's not something where you have to pay a bunch of money to go cold plunge. The wellness space is unfortunately full of a lot of snake oil salesmen. There's new things every day that sometimes come into the consciousness and become something you have to be doing. And I feel like I'm very susceptible to that pressure. And so it's been nice to talk to real psychologists and trainers and doctors and find that a lot of that is just noise. I think a lot of times the thing that we are susceptible to with longevity coaches and wellness and all these things is that they let you not focus on the here and now in front of you. They prolong it and say, if you do this thing down the road, you will get better. Most of the time that's not true. Usually what's ailing people is money or health, and a lot of times that's out of your control. I feel pretty good. For a 43-year-old, I feel like I'm in good shape. I feel like I've gotten in better shape over the year. Last year I was in a writers’ room and on set for more days than I wasn't. Especially when you're shooting in Chicago and writing in Chicago, it's very easy. A PA [production assistant] will come around and be like, “You want a Polish sausage? Want a pierogi? Feeling low? You want a spike? I'll go get you a deep dish.\" I think that weighed on me for a year. That's truly what it would be like. You'd be doing a scene and someone would come over and be like, \"It looks like your energy's dipping a little. We got a pierogi bar over there. I can put some boiled ones on there for you.” At 4 in the morning doing a night shoot? Yeah I’ll have a couple pierogi. I don’t know the next time I’ll be eating at a pierogi bar. Exactly. And it’s Chicago, so you go to the bar when you’re done. But I feel pretty good. I’m a year older than my grandfather was when he died. Last year, if you'd asked me how I feel, I would've been like, \"I'm not doing great. I have this impending doom feeling.\" Today, I feel pretty good despite the state of everything being so horrendous. My diet's pretty good. I'm getting good exercise. Family's good. I feel pretty good. I’ll give you one from each region. West Coast, it’s In-N-Out. Fairly easy. Chicago is going to be controversial. Lou Malnati’s is now, to me, fast food. There is one in every section of Chicago, and you can get it in under 20 minutes. In New York, White Castle. White Castle is great because you feel like a giant. You can pitch me a movie. InReal-Life Diet,athletes, celebrities, and other high performers talk about their diet, exercise routines, and pursuit of wellness. Keep in mind that what works for them might not necessarily be healthy for you.",

    "title": "The Best Bruce Willis Movies (That Aren't ‘Die Hard’ or ‘The Sixth Sense’)",
    "article_text": "Last year marked the first time in 37 years that there wasn’t a new movie featuring Bruce Willis released in any capacity. Granted,Willisalready hadn’t appeared in a theatrical release since 2019, with his small but key role inEdward Norton’sMotherless Brooklyn, which at the time inspired a glimmer of recognition of the best Bruce Willis movies of the past. But Willis remained a presence in the world of straight-to-video titles, appearing in a whopping dozen such movies in 2022 alone, usually for 10 or 15 minutes of well-paid screen time. That was the same year that his familyannounced his retirement from acting in 2022due toaphasia; they shared an updated diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia in 2023. His DTV forays, which started out resembling any number ofolder stars’ attempts to pick up a decent paycheck for relatively little work, took on asadder dimension; these were either projects he was taking in hopes of banking as much money as possible for when he was no longer able to work, projects he was being ushered into without full consideration, or some combination of the two. Yet the sheer volume of interchangeable Willis-starring DTV thrillers has some fierce competition in the form of the rest of his eclectic and substantial filmography. Willis was always a consistent worker; like fellow ‘90s superstarNicolas Cage, he has so many movies that there are entire subgenres in his filmography, like Movies Where Bruce Willis Appears As Himself or Some Approximation of It (The Player;Loaded Weapon 1;Ocean’s 12;Nancy Drew;What Just Happened;The Lego Movie 2), Movies Where Bruce Willis Acts Opposite a Child (North;Mercury Rising;The Sixth Sense;The Kid); and Bruce Willis Assembling the Troops Throughout the Ages (The Siege;Hart’s War;Tears of the Sun). None of these subgenres are represented on this list of the best Bruce Willis movies—no, not evenThe Sixth Sense. Who needs a rec to watchThe Sixth Sense? We’re also leaving out anything withDie Hardin the title. The first one is perfect, the sequels are fun, except the terrible fifth one; who doesn’t know this? Instead, these best Bruce Willis movies have been selected to pay tribute to Willis’s old-fashioned strengths as a leading man and occasional character actor. Though he understandably became identified with action movies in the wake ofDie Hard, he worked across genres like a studio contract player in the 1940s, doing drama, comedy, adventure, sci-fi, thrillers, often with steadfast understatement and efficiency (though he could ham it up when required, too). These thirteen movies are ranked by their strength as Bruce Willis movies, meaning his specific performance is given greater weight than it might otherwise bear, especially given his willingness to take less-glamorous supporting parts in offbeat films. The movies aren’t quite the same without him. One of the most endearing elements of Willis’s career, and why it’s easy to overlook all the 15-minute walk-ons in junk later in his filmography, is that he seems to really like working, even or especially if that means taking an under-the-radar part. The neo-noirMortal Thoughtswas a pet project of Willis’s then-wifeDemi Moore, who gives one of her best performances as a New Jersey woman whose best friend (Glenn Headley) may be fixing to murder her abusive lout of a husband—and Willis stepped in to play the lout. Spoiler: He does get murdered relatively early in the picture, but not before giving a truly convincing performance as a total dirtbag given to only the merest flashes of charm. Plenty of early ‘90s thrillers took inspiration from ‘40s and ‘50s noir, taking the material in a more sexualized direction;Mortal Thoughtscertainly takes advantage of greater freedom to depict sex and violence, but it’s grittier than your standard erotic thriller. Willis showed further loyalty to director Alan Rudolph by later starring in his perversely faithful adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’sBreakfast of Champions, an even less commercial prospect than this one. Maybe I'm giving this extra points for being Willis' last real one. Or for the nature of the Willis role here, a private detective and father figure to a bunch of grown-up orphans, including Lionel (Edward Norton), who’s living with Tourette syndrome and OCD. When Frank gets killed working a case, Lionel takes it over; the movie is a showcase for Norton, who also adapted the screenplay and directed, and this is another case of Willis supporting someone else’s dream project with a supporting role. Regardless, I can remember the pure sense of comfort Willis’s presence provided; his warmth doesn’t always emerge in his crime pictures, yet he’s note-perfect here, just sweet enough to create a character worth missing but not so treacly that it feels like a blatant manipulation. Like his exit from mainstream movies, his death within half an hour of this one feels both earned and realistically abrupt. People don’t really talk aboutSin Cityanymore, do they? I guess as far as fastidious, animation-assisted recreations ofFrank Miller-scripted comic panels go,300sort of ate this movie’s lunch a couple of years later (and like300, this movie saw a belated, less-successful follow-up featuring Eva Green naked in 3-D in 2014). But around a time when Willis was playing a lot of police officers —Hostage;16 Blocks; things of that nature—Sin Citystands out for both distilling and distorting the grizzled-unsmiling-cop routine into its near-black-and-white, noir-soaked essence. There are, admittedly, a lot of generic Willis performances that coast on his natural charisma and the pre-existing rapport he developed with audiences, and in some ways,Sin City’s John Hartigan, boozy/smoky cop on the edge and in need of redemption, is one of those. But it shows you just how much context matters, because in this weird and extremely entertaining Robert Rodriguez experiment, Willis becomes a near-parodic archetype and a figure of instant authority in a young-skewing cast. Willis hit an extraordinary run of world-beating flops in the early nineties, with a major role in Brian De Palma’s adaptation ofThe Bonfire of the Vanities, followed by the imposition ofHudson Hawkon unsuspecting financers, audiences and, from the sound of it, his co-stars, who describe an egomaniacal producer-star Willis insisting on constant rewrites. (The movie was his idea and he also receives a “story by” credit on the finished film.) It’s a well-kept secret, then, thatHudson Hawk, for all of the mess it makes, is actually pretty fun, a loopy and whimsical adventure picture about a professional thief roped into heisting the hidden components to create a lost da Vinci machine. Rather than simply knocking off Indiana Jones for theDie Hardage, Willis introduces elements of screwball farce, genre spoof, and Looney Tunes slapstick into the would-be blockbuster. Hardly anyone got it. But it’s a better goofy-guys-on-a-crazy-trip comedy than that summer’sCity Slickers, I swear! Beneath the steely Willis exterior must lurk an abiding affection for absolute nonsense; there’s no way a completely serious man would conceive Hudson Hawk and then, just a few years later, say yes to this kind of Luc Besson sci-fi maximalism. One of the angriest comment sections I’ve ever inspired was beneath a piece where I casually referred to this movie as more of an overstuffed boondoggle than a flawless classic; that’s a compliment, guys! Willis has the unenviable job of playing the one recognizable human in Luc Besson’s teenage fever dream of aliens, flying cars, talking planets, and a fifth element (love) made into waifish flesh (Milla Jovovich). IfDie Hardprovides his instant-classic movie star performance akin toHarrison Ford’s Indiana Jones (perfect first one, some good sequels),The Fifth Elementis (in this context alone) his version ofStar Wars, trash-compacted into a single piece of entertainment. An early sign of Willis’s seriousness as an actor: He followedDie Hard, his big-screen breakthrough, with a role as Emmett Smith, a PTSD-suffering Vietnam veteran, helping his teenage niece Samantha (Emily Lloyd) learn more about her dad, who was killed in the same war. In other words, not exactlyDie Harder(though he did do that one the following year). It’s a disarmingly earnest movie, and while Willis hits some of the haunted-vet notes you might expect, he also has scenes that show more than they tell, as when taciturn Emmett shows his gentler side interacting with animals. It’s a lovely, underseen piece of work that was recently and deservedly featured in a Criterion Channel Vietnam collection. From the gentle to the venal: Willis took another great chance by playing the faithless, shallow, cowardly male lead in Death Becomes Her, a vicious satire of vanity featuring Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as aging women quite literally maiming each other over the opportunity for eternal life—and, hilariously inexplicably, for the right to bed down with Dr. Ernest Menville (Willis), the nebbishy plastic surgeon whose services become increasingly outmoded as the more fantastical elements of the movie take hold. It would be churlish to say that in such a woman-driven narrative, the male lead gives the best performance; I will say, however, that by 1992, it was more than clear what Streep and Hawn could do with this sort of grasping, spiteful character, while Willis still operated with the element of surprise. The last great year for Willis, maybe his best year ever just in terms of movie quality, came ten years before his retirement, when he starred in new movies fromWes Andersonand Rian Johnson, months apart.Looperfelt more in the Willis wheelhouse at the time; whether because of hisFifth Elementsuccess or a personal affinity for the genre, he seemed to have a soft spot for science fiction, andLooperis one of his best forays into that genre. It’s a time-travel story about Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an assassin retained to knock off people who have been thrown back in time as a means of disappearing them from their present; naturally, Joe one day winds up staring an older version of himself in the eye. He doesn’t hesitate—but Old Joe (Willis) sure does, determined to change his future by fixing things in the past, while his younger counterpart tries to kill him. The story gets even more complicated than that, yet stays emotionally legible because of the mirrored switcheroo executed by Gordon-Levitt and Willis: The former’s pitiless semi-nihilism morphs into redemptive protective instincts for a young boy and his mother, while the latter’s personal redemption slips through his fingers in desperation. Related to the Bruce Willis As “Bruce Willis” Cameo, but far more satisfying, is the Bruce Willis Character Actor Side Career. Rather than featured roles in ensembles likeDeath Becomes HerorPulp Fiction, Willis sometimes pops up as a workaday supporting role, like the criminal dad inAlpha Dog, a fast-food exec inFast Food Nation, or a military guy inPlanet Terror. The best of these parts is Carl Roebuck, a contractor at odds with Sully (Paul Newman), the shiftless hero ofNobody’s Fool. For the most part, Willis is just playing a regular guy—and not in the relatable-everyman sense of the word. He’s not malicious enough to be the villain of the piece, yet not automatically sympathetic, either; he’s successful, he sees through Sully, and he’s a bit of a womanizing prick. Willis plays all of this stuff just right—as good in his own smaller-scale way, as Newman himself. It never feels as if you’re watching a scene where Paul Newman, legend, is squaring off with Bruce Willis, newer-generation movie star. They genuinely come across like two guys in a small upstate New York town. In a career full of unfussy performances, this is one of his most precise. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman got the Academy Award nominations, and the biggest career boosts: Travlota, a massive comeback; Jackson, household-name status; Thurman, a bump from pretty starlet to frequent leading lady. But man: Willis is just astonishingly good inPulp Fiction, too. (Maybe 1994, not 2012, was his greatest year; hell,Northis terrible, but he’s awfully charming in it.) As Butch, the boxer who takes a bribe to throw a fight, reneges on the deal, and accidentally kills his opponent in the ring before going on the run, he comes across with surprising tenderness at first—a film-noir antihero pushed too far but redeemed by the love of a good woman (and his rapport with a weirdly seductive cab driver in the film’s most endlessly drawn-out scene). But when he realizes his wife Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) has forgotten to pack his father’s treasured watch for their escape, he flies into a terrifying rage that offers a glimpse of the demons he’s dealing with. (Writer-director Quentin Tarantino, always happy to toy with our emotions, also puts a comic button on the scene by having him softly apologize to Fabienne for his outburst, before cutting to Butch alone in his car, back to screaming and swearing up a storm.) Then, fittingly enough, Butch finds himself in hell. (Oh, and he kills the movie’s ostensible main character halfway through his story.) Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman all get bigger laughs, but when the movie needs its greatest streak of sustained tension, Willis is the professional Tarantino trusted. There’s a knock on Wes Anderson that, save the occasional irascible and undeniable figure like Gene Hackman or Ralph Fiennes, he tends to flatten all of his actors into a similarly unemotive deadpan, the faces changing more than the delivery. I prefer to think of it as him stripping some of his favorite movie stars down to their essence, revealing new layers of humanity in their seemingly blank affect. InMoonrise Kingdom, Willis plays another cop, unexpectedly placed in charge of another kid; familiar stuff for him, in other words, that doesn’t do justice to how affecting he is with the usual thriller melodrama peeled away. Captain Duffy Sharp doesn’t have much backstory (we know he had an affair with the mother of Suzy, one of the two kids who run off together to set the story in motion), which somehow only enhances his low hum of loneliness. Willis didn't join the unofficial Anderson rep company; he probably wouldn't have been a great fit forGrand Budapest Hotel, and most of Anderson’s other films would have been made during his cognitive decline. While it would have been wonderful to see him pop up again, this also makes his presence inMoonrise Kingdomall the more special. Toss a Sunday School shoe through an Anderson movie and you’ll hit a Tilda Swinton or an Adrien Brody; Willis seems as if he’s still dwelling on that quaint New England island. I loveM. Night Shyamalan, especially his contained yet rococo later-period work, but I think most of his partisans will agree that after a few movies, it became hard not to notice that his films tend to sound a certain way—they're written with a particular 1950s-B-movie-meets-George-Lucas verbal clunkiness that you just have to go with. If anything disguised that quality in his earliest hits, it was Bruce Willis, who in bothThe Sixth SenseandUnbreakablelends the material such quiet, aching melancholy that it may obscure how infrequently his adult characters sound quite like real people. How satisfying, too, that Willis never succumbed to the Marvel/DC morass, and instead got his superhero kicks as the anguished David Dunn—who returned for a brief appearance inSplitand an appropriately downbeat ending in the underratedGlass—in a film that mostly uses camera tricks and suspension of disbelief (rather than CG fireworks) to show off the powers he belatedly realizes he possesses. In a lot of ways, Willis’s performance as James Cole, a time traveler from a post-apocalyptic future often presumed to be out of his mind, is unusually demonstrative for him. As Cole is yanked back and forth in time, he shows sorrow, paranoia, eagerness to please, mooney-eyed affection, intense fear, and a kind of cracked, disoriented innocence. He rarely, if ever, grimaces manfully! That fullness is a great acting exercise for Willis; in Terry Gilliam’s most accomplished mainstream entertainment, it’s also an expression of lost humanity, as if returning to pre-apocalyptic time knocks loose the character’s emotional receptors. What comes through no matter what James is going through is the sheer vulnerability Willis shows in scene after scene, even in moments of violence, even as the story hurtles ever forward/backward/and so on. Willis doesn’t seem remotely like a match in sensibility for Terry Gilliam, even at the latter’s peak; this is a guy who vibes with Robin Williams, Johnny Depp,Jeff Bridges,Matt Damonin fake-nose mode, and (sometimes) various fellow members of Monty Python. Yet Willis is such a solid presence in12 Monkeys, even as his most fragile, that it’s as if Gilliam himself reached back in time and grabbed a star from half a century earlier. That’s the Willis touch: Recalling an earlier, unvarnished form of Bogart-like masculinity while staying, somehow, rooted in the moment.",

    "title": "King Charles Intervening in Prince Harry’s UK Case Would Have Been “Constitutionally Improper,” Says Source",
    "article_text": "Prince Harryhas said he is “devastated” he won’t be able to come back to the UK with his family after losing a high-stakes appeal against the Home Office over his security in the UK. In a shattering blow, he was told by a judge that his “sense of grievance” over his downgraded security had not “translated into a legal argument.” In a candid and extensiveinterview with the BBCfollowing the judgement, the duke said he didn’t “want any more battles” over his security, and is now drawing a line. He added that he felt he had been cut off by his father,King Charles III,because he had chosen to pursue the Home Office through the courts. He also said that his bond with the UK was strong, but he would never be able to safely return with his family. “I love my country and always have done,” he said. “Despite what some people in that country have done. So I miss the UK. I miss parts of the UK. Of course I do. I think it’s really quite sad that I won’t be able to show my children my homeland.” He also launched a scathing attack on the royal household—some of whom Harry said he’d learned sat on the Royal and VIP Executive Committee, the government body known as RAVEC that made the decision on his security arrangements—for jeopardizing his chances of coming back to the UK. He described the court’s decision as “a good old-fashioned establishment stitch-up.” The king is said to have advised Harry early on to drop the legal action. Harry told the BBC that he did not ask King Charles to intervene in the case. “I’ve asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their job.” The duke said he is no longer in contact with his father. “Life is precious. I don’t know how much longer my father has,” Harry said. “He won’t speak to me because of this security stuff.” “I would love reconciliation with my family,” he added. “There’s no point continuing to fight anymore.” Harry said that the publication of his 2023 book,Spare,affected his family relationships. “Some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book,” he said. “Of course, they will never forgive me for lots of things.” The duke noted that he has only come back to the UK for funerals, court cases, and occasional charity events since leaving Britain, adding, “I can’t see a world in which I will be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at this point.” Harry isreportedlyfacing an estimated 1.5 million British pounds (about $2 million) in legal costs. He previouslysaidin court he believed he’d been “singled out” for “unjustified, inferior treatment” since he and his wife,Meghan,left five years ago. Buckingham Palace responded to the ruling in a statement, saying, “All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion,” the palace said. A royal source added that it would have been “constitutionally improper for His Majesty to intervene while this matter was being considered by the government and reviewed by the courts.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

    "title": "Haliey Welch, a.k.a. Hawk Tuah, Tries to Explain Herself",
    "article_text": "This time last May,Haliey Welchwas working at a spring factory in her native Tennessee. Twelve months later…well, are you familiar with the phrase“hawk tuah”? Welch went viral last summer after using that colorful turn of phrase to describe how best to please a male lover. “It happened very fast,” she says over Zoom from her home “in the sticks” of Tennessee. Welch’s camera may be off, but her voice—that deep Southern twang coupled with a perkiness befitting an anthropomorphized cartoon chipmunk—is unmistakable. “I don’t really consider myself a celebrity. When I go out to grocery stores and stuff, and people are staring at me, I’m like, What are they looking at? Then I’m like, Wait…oh yeah. I don’t know. It don’t feel real to me.” That’s surprising to hear from Welch—since unlike many flash in the pan internet presences, she’s managed to sustain her viral fame. Welch has sold thousands of dollars of merchandise, amassed millions of followers on social media, and started a hit podcast called, what else,Talk Tuah. But her notoriety has also come with consequences. At the end of 2024, Welch began hawking (get it?!) a meme coin, $HAWK, which she and her partners atOverHereclaimed would“redefine the crypto space.”But within 20 minutes of launching, $HAWK lost more than 90% of its value—falling from a peak of $490 million to $60 million. Soon, Welch and her partners were being accused of participating in a “rug-pull scheme,” with detractors claiming that they quickly, and intentionally, inflated the value of $HAWK, then sold off their coins—causing $HAWK’s value to crash and allegedly leaving many regular people holding the bag. “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,”wrote one X user. “I hate that that’s even a thing,” Welch says now of the crypto mess. “Half of those people that done it were, like, my fans. They trusted me, like, guiding them to it. And I don’t know…it really hurt my feelings when it turned out the way it did. I wish it hadn’t have happened.” In the immediate fallout, Welch’s team maintained that there had been no “pump and dump” scam. “Team hasn’t sold one token,” Welch wrote on her personal X account on December 4, though the post has since been deleted. Nevertheless, crypto influencers likejournalistStephen Findeisen,better known as Coffeezilla, ripped Welch a new one for the alleged scam, and several investors in $HAWK filed a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On March 31, the SEC closed an investigation into Welch, finding“no evidence”against the influencer. Her initial response to the drama was to disappear. On December 4, Welch ended an X livestream with the famous last words,“Anyhoo, I’m gonna go bed”; just like that, her podcast and social media channels went dark for about three months. Where was she? At home in Tennessee, being “a 24/7 dog mom,” she says. “It was nice.” Welch also had human companionship: her boyfriend,Kelby Blackwell,whom podcast listeners may know as Pookie. But a celebrity can only be a dog mom and girlfriend for so long. On March 25, Welch returned to social media and started her podcast again. Her dream guests?Britney SpearsandMiley Cyrus.“Those are just the women I’ve always looked up to,” she says. “I hate how Britney turned out because of the things she was put through. But her book that she came out with, it explains a good bit of it, why she’s the way she is now. I don’t know. She’s inspiring.” Given her roller-coaster year, the exceedingly polite Welch can probably relate a bit more to Spears’s saga now. “I see things a lot differently than I used to,” she says. “My eyes are open a lot wider.” Below, Welch chats withVanity Fairabout taking a much-needed mental health break, her acting aspirations, and how she learned to embrace being Hawk Tuah. Vanity Fair:You recently took an extended break from public life. How does it feel now to be back in the spotlight? Haliey Welch:Um, it’s definitely been a little bit of a struggle, but I feel like rebuilding is what I needed to do. And it’s my perfect chance to rebuild now, so that’s really what I’m working on. Some of the comments you get on Instagram are so mean. Do you read comments? How do you handle them? I do my best not to read ’em, but sometimes you just can’t help yourself. Everybody’s entitled to an opinion, obviously, but I don’t know. I try not to let it get me down. Obviously, there was the meme coin incident. Of course, it’s a complicated issue. Of course. I can barely understand it myself. Crypto is so confusing. Yeah, I don’t really understand it much myself either [laughs]. I don’t know. It was one of those things that just happened, and I feel sorry for everybody that just lost money…. I don’t know. I’ve learned from that. You got to be really careful what you tie your name to, and you definitely need to know what you’re getting yourself into when you agree to do it. That’s something I definitely should have done beforehand. I don’t know. It’s a crazy world we live in. What have you learned from that experience? Do you have anything to say to the people who lost their money? I would say, personally, what I learned from it…let’s see…I don’t know. I just feel really bad for anybody that lost money. All my comments, if you read those, people are like, “Oh, well, I lost a lot of money in this. Now my kids have to go without stuff.” I don’t know. It makes me feel, like, really sorry for it. After the crypto scandal, you went off the grid. What were you doing for those three months? Where were you? Oh, I hate to say this, but it was a much-needed mental health—just…what do you call it? A mental health break, I guess, is what you can call it. I would see my friends. I would go out and eat. That’s really about it. I don’t ever get out and do much when I’m home. I like being by myself. How badly did the scandal affect your mental health? I would say it probably didn’t get as bad as it did when the video—like, my interview on Broadway [in Nashville]—got leaked, but it was almost the same. I don’t know. It’s really overwhelming. Your whole life’s basically online, and then people can say anything they want to you. And then you got to sit there with the thought, Oh, a lot of people just lost money because of something you did, like, [something] you led them to. You got to be really strong to be in this kind of space, I feel like. Can you talk a little bit about that roller coaster: the “hawk tuah” video being so terrible for your mental health, but also creating all these amazing opportunities? Yeah. It took me a while to finally see that too. I’ve always been a person that just kind of kept to myself. I would go to work, I’d hang out with my friends, and I’d just stay out of everybody’s way. I wasn’t really on social media much besides Snapchat. But everything changed after that interview. I’ve always been one to struggle with mental health, and I’m still struggling with it a little bit. But it’s been like…I just kept getting kicked when I was down. It’s something I never in a million years would’ve expected. But then I was like, Okay, everybody else is making money off of it, and they’re not even the ones that got interviewed, you know? So I wanted to do something about it. And the first thing I did, I went and found an attorney, and then he led me to my team that I’m with now.[As of December 2024, Welch had in fact been represented by Los Angeles–based PR firm the Agency Group. On April 1, that firm confirmed toVanity Fairthat it was no longer representing Welch. She’s now with Penthouse Management.] You recently parted ways with Jake Paul and his production company, Betr. How did you make that decision? It was kind of a mutual thing to go our separate ways, but we’re not on any bad terms. They’re great people and they’ve done a lot for me. Jake Paul, he’s good as gold. He was the one to give me the opportunity. How do you feel about being known as the “hawk tuah” girl? Are you tired of that? Honestly, at first I was like, I need to move away from that because that one moment shouldn’t define me. But that moment made me, so it’s part of my…I don’t want to say part of my brand, but it’s definitely part of me, and it’s something I will never escape from. So I’ve kind of just embraced it. I would love to know what you have to say about the incident in early February when a canceled episode ofTalk Tuahabout the crypto scandal briefly appeared online, then was removed from the internet. YouTuber FaZe Banks was on the show, and he’s accused your team of“leaking” the canceledTalk Tuahepisodeto further manipulate the markets.Do you have anything to say about that? Amy Sisoyev [Welch’s publicist]:Oh, we can’t speak on that. I’m sorry. You went viral in the lead-up to the presidential election. A lot of people were projecting their politics onto you and making assumptions about your own political beliefs. You became sort of a political figure by accident. What was that like? [Long pause] Yeah, I don’t know if I consider myself a political figure. I try not to get into politics too much. I don’t know. It’s too much beyond me to understand. It was kind of a breath of fresh air, because everybody stopped fighting about who they’re voting for. And I don't know—it kind of just made everybody laugh in the middle of it. You could have done anything you wanted after becoming a celebrity overnight. You could have made a reality show, you could have gone on TV, you could have done anything. Why did you decide to go the podcasting route? I really liked the podcast route because it was a way for me andChelsea [Bradford]to do something together. And it’s not scripted. We can say whatever we want on there. We can express ourselves. We can get guests on there, and then they’re entitled to say whatever they’d like to on there. I don’t know. I’m just not much of a reality-TV [person], I guess. What are your future plans for the podcast? So my plans for the podcast right now are just rebuilding it, rebranding, and then trying to get really good guests on so more people will start watching it. I don’t know. It feels good because now I’m the official owner of it, so it’s my show and I can make it however I want to. When you’re not podcasting, what do you do for fun? What brings you joy right now? I really like cooking. I like flower shopping. That’s really my favorite thing to do. What’s your favorite flower? Oh man, you got me. Let’s see [long pause]…probably a peony. They smell so good. It’s so nice that you and Chelsea have been successful and managed to stay friends. Do you guys ever see or talk to Tim Dickerson and DeArius Marlow, the creators ofTim & Dee TV, who asked you that question on the street? Absolutely not. We just kind of parted ways with them. I don’t really know if there’s bad blood there or not. It’s not from our end, but I think from their end it definitely is. But I don’t know. I never wished anything bad on them. [Editor’s note: In two separate statements issued toVanity Fair,Dickerson and Marlow denied there being any bad blood with Welch on their end. Marlow said that he believes Welch “definitely [has] ‘ill will’ towards us,” and that his cocreator “genuinely wanted the best” and “tried to help her.” Dickerson said the following: “We don’t have any bad blood or ill will towards her. We just don’t like how we were portrayed in the situation.” They both further addressed their feelings toward Welchin a YouTube video.] So they’re not going to come on the podcast or anything like that? Probably not [laughs]. Is it harder to trust people now, after all this has happened? I would say so. It’s not really that it;shardto trust people. It really makes you sit there and question them more than you probably would have before. Just because you don’t want to get in another pickle. Your instagram bio includes the phrase “influence for good.” What does that mean to you? I don’t know. I want to give back to people because I never really asked for this. It just kind of fell in my lap. And I have so much, and I think it’s only fair that I give back. You also have a role in Glen Powell’s new TV show,Chad Powers. What was it like filming that? Would you like to act more? It was definitely something I would do again. It was so much fun. The whole team was great. I honestly think I could do it. I don’t know if I could do a whole movie by myself, because that’s a lot of work and lines to remember. But I don’t know. Bits and pieces, just popping in here and there—I think that would be so much fun. Do you have any advice for people who go mega viral? Yes. Definitely be careful what you tie your name into and who you trust. What would your dream be career-wise? Well, I’m hoping my podcast gets rebranded in the way I’m seeing it in my head—the vision I’ve got. And I hope it grows. You keep saying “rebranded.” What is it that you’d like to change about it? Just making it more girlier and more authentic to me. It feels more of a show that I’m comfortable talking on, talking with guests on. Comfortable for Chelsea to be on. Were you not super comfortable, you and Chelsea? Oh, when we first started, I was scared to death. I got used to being on other people’s podcasts, when they would interview me and they did all the asking questions. But when it was my turn to ask the questions, I froze up a little bit…I feel like I’ve definitely improved since the beginning. I feel like I’ve definitely improved a lot. I’m sure I could still improve more. What does the immediate future look like for you? I go to Vegas tomorrow for poker. This week is a small table, and the next week is the big table. Are you a good poker player? Absolutely not. I hang on as long as I can. Is it high stakes? Are you playing with your own money? Welch:I don’t know. I don’t know, really, how it works. I just tell them I’ll be there, and then I kind of be there. I think they normally do it for you, but don’t hold me to that. Amy, do you know? Sisoyev:I know it’s a celebrity poker tournament, so usually they supply the chips. Welch:It will probably be like last time. You’re playing in a celebrity poker tournament fresh off the crypto scandal. Do you have anything to say about those optics—gambling after some people lost their money on your coin? Sisoyev:Say the question again? Sorry, I’m just confused. Some might say that it’s not a great look to be gambling so soon after a money-related scandal. I’m just wondering if Haliey has anything to say to that or has a response to that? Sisoyev:Oh, we’re going to skip over that one. This interview has been edited and condensed.

    "title": "Trump's Push to Defund NPR and PBS Is Actually Terrible for Red States",
    "article_text": "The White House has castDonald Trump’s crackdown on public media as an effort to cut off government funding from “left-wing propaganda.” But if Trump intended to hurt the stereotypical coastal yuppies listening toAll Things Consideredin their Subarus on the way to the food co-op in coastal cities, his aim is way off. The president signedan executive order Thursday instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS and is reportedly pressuringCongress to rescind$1.1 billion in funding for the CPB, which would drain local television and radio affiliates, too. But experts argue Trump’s attempt to dismantle public media exceeds the powers of his office and will most likely hurt the states that put him into that office in the first place. “The ones who are harmed probably aren't NPR and PBS, who are the main targets,” saidEric Nuzum, the former vice president of programming at NPR, who is now co-founder of the audio production consulting company Magnificent Noise. “The local stations get harmed, and then the communities get harmed, and it’s one more thing that disadvantages them.” Just look at who uses federal funding for public broadcasting the most. According toone recent report, West Virginia’s public broadcasters were most reliant on federal funding in 2023, followed by Alaska, New Mexico, and Montana. Indeed, among the 20 states that relied the most on federal funding for public broadcasting that year, 15 were states Trump won in 2024. The groupProtect My Public Media surveyed230 stations across America in 2023 about what would happen if they lost their federal funding: 26 stations said they would have to shut down completely, particularly in rural, island, and tribal communities, while another 23 said they would need to cut off access to rural areas that are more expensive to serve. “Defunding public media, of course, doesn't just hurt the left because public media doesn't just serve the left,” saidCraig Aaron, president and co-CEO of the advocacy group Free Press.Research showsthat when local news dries up, corruption in the local community explodes. “The public good provided by accountability journalism goes far beyond daily listeners and donors. The whole community benefits, whether they tune in or not,” Aaron said. The executive order signed Thursday is, in a way, only the tip of the iceberg. It instructs the CPB to cease funding of NPR and PBS “to the maximum extent allowed by law.” It also bars CPB from funding either entity in the future and seeks to prevent local TV and radio affiliates from using federal funds to pay NPR and PBS for popular shows. But it does not directly seek to restrict funding to those local affiliates. The biggest issue with the order is not what the loss of funding would do for NPR and PBS—which derive a relatively small amount of their operating income from CPB money. The biggest issue is that the president is exerting power he doesn’t have. AsPatricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPBnoted in a statementFriday, “CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority.” It is, instead, authorized and funded by Congress, as an independent non-profit. Paula Kerger, president and CEO of PBS, similarly calledthe president’s order“blatantly unlawful.\" AndKatherine Maher, NPR’s president and CEO,vowed to“challenge this Executive Order using all means available.” TheCPB is already suingthe Trump administration, after three members of its board received emails saying they had been fired, something CPB argued in its lawsuit “is of no legal effect given that the President has no power to remove or terminate CPB’s Board members.” This is not the first time Trump has tried to take over an organization given independent status by Congress. In March,Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiency seized controlof the independent US Institute of Peace in what the former CEO called “an illegal takeover.” A lawsuit surrounding that case remains ongoing, and Thursday’s order targeting NPR and PBS seems destined for the same fate. Meanwhile, both entities arefacing an investigationby Federal Communications Commission chairBrendan Carr, who wrote in a letter in January that they “could be violating federal law by airing commercials.” (Bothentities have arguedthey’re in compliance with the law). But an arguably even more catastrophic outcome for public media would be if Trump succeeded in pressuring Congress to rescind the already allocated $1.1 billion in funding to CPB. Nuzum says this is likely to hurt small, rural communities the most because they likely won't be able to recover the funds from donors as readily as stations in big cities. “It's not going to accomplish what they think it is going to accomplish,” Nuzum said of the Trump administration. Nuzum said it’s for this very reason that some Republicans have, in the past, stood up to defend funding for public broadcasting. After Carr announced his investigation into NPR and PBS and floated the possibility of pulling federal funding, Nevada RepublicanMark Amodei, who co-chairs the Public Broadcasting Caucus, joined his Democratic colleagues in the Housein a letter to Carr. “In states such as Alaska, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Texas, rural public radio stations are often the only weekly or daily news source in their communities,” they wrote. “Even in places with other daily or weekly news sources, those outlets may not be directing resources toward original or locally based stories, leaving it to public stations to fill the gap.” But Amodei, who did not respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment, has been a lonely voice in the Republican Party on this issue of late. Beyond the damage Trump’s actions would do to the communities that support him, Aaron of Free Press underscored that this is the definition of the type of government censorshipTrump once claimedhe was ending when he took office. “It's one thing to complain about coverage you dislike, it's another to try to impound congressionally approved funds and try to silence and shake down your critics,” he said. “That's exactly the kind of government censorship the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Trump’s LiesAre Finally Catching Up to Him The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad atMeghan Markle “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security Why Are Americans SoObsessed With Protein?

    "title": "Tim Walz Thinks Democrats Didn’t Do “a Good Enough Job” of Listening to Voters—but He’s Not Despairing",
    "article_text": "Tim Walzhas been keeping busy since the 2024 election. Not only has the Minnesota governor been working to insulate his state fromDonald Trump’s extreme agenda—he’s also gone on the offensive, headlining town halls in red districts across the country to turn up pressure on Republican lawmakers. When Icaught him at one last month—in Lorain, Ohio, a manufacturing town near Cleveland—the event hearkened back to the optimism of the early days ofKamala Harris’s campaign. She and Walz seemed to have the wind at their backs, and it felt like “good vibes” might prevail over Trump,JD Vance,and what the Minnesota governor memorably described as “weird” MAGA Republicans. It didn’t exactly work out last fall, of course: Trump was returned to power, and Democrats were cast into the political wilderness. And yet the former veep candidate remains hopeful. In a follow-up conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length, Walz sounded off on Trump’s “dangerous” agenda, his own party’s shortcomings, and the “opportunity” Democrats could have on the other side of Trump’s term: “Trump has shown us that, in 100 days, we can significantly change this country,” Walz told me. “We’ll simply do it for the good of the people.” Vanity Fair:One thing I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how radically different things would be if the election had gonejust a little differently. I mean, Trumpclaimedto have this “mandate” because he won the popular vote and Republicans won unified control in Washington—which isn’t insignificant, obviously. But we’re talking abouta small fraction of votes in a handful of statesthat, if they go the other way, the country is on an entirely different trajectory. It’s striking to think about that as someone on the outside. But on a personal level, I wonder what that’s like for you, as someone whose name was actually on the ticket. Tim Walz:I certainly wanted Kamala Harris! We would not have had this chaos. We would have had a serious leader. She’d have been surrounded by serious people—not these unserious clowns who sit around Donald Trump. And I think Americans would have seen a trajectory, especially on the economy and our global relationships, continue on. But a lot of people say that, like, there would have been this radically different world—I don’t think Donald Trump would have quit. I think January 6 would have been very small compared to what he would have done. He’s that dangerous. And so, you know, it’s all speculation, but I think, for me, I respect how dangerous he is. I respect when he says he’s going to do something, no matter how unhinged it is, he’s going to attempt to do it. I think the foundational values of America would have been much more in place. I think that’s what these town halls are about. I think people are coming looking for a different way of doing things. I don’t think anybody should pretend it’s going to go back to the way it was before so quickly. It’s going to take work. You mention the town halls. At the one in Lorain, Ohio, it seemed cathartic for those who were there. But talking to folks afterward, there was also this sense of powerlessness still—like, at least for the time being, we can sound all the alarms we want, but at the end of the day, there are limits to what can be done to check this guy’s whims. What do you say to that? And do you feel that to some extent as well? What I try to tell people—even the power of a proactive approach, of going there, I talk about how you feel a sense of community. You’re surrounded by people. You’re not going crazy; other people think this way too. It gets you away from the negative. I have to tell you, I’m blessed here in Minnesota with [state attorney general]Keith Ellison.The attorneys general in states are doing a hell of a job, and the federal bench at this point in time is still holding. How long that happens, I don’t know. What does the Supreme Court do when those federal cases reach them? I also don’t know. But I do think that this is not performative protest. What I thought was different, and I don’t know how you took it—I’ve done town halls and everything, and what I found so interesting about these, and I think Democrats would be wise to listen to this…people are telling their stories. They’re sharing and trusting others with their stories, and they’re telling stories about how this impacts them. To be candid with you, I’m not sure Democrats have done a good enough job of that. We talk about the need to protect the Department of Education. I don’t think we always get to thewhy.At my town hall down withBeto O’Rourkein Texas, a young man named Aiden, a middle schooler—he understands that if the Department of Education goes away, him and his friends who might have Individualized Education Programs are put at risk. And I think that’s what the town halls have done differently. I think this willingness of people to tell what government means to them is stronger than I’ve seen it. Well, speaking of the effects the Trump administration is having on everyday Americans, Trump just released hisbudget plantoday, and, as expected, it includes massive cuts to nondefense spending, diversity initiatives, and clean-energy initiatives, among others—upwards of $160 billion in total, all of which will be meant to offset his planned tax cuts. It’s hard to be surprised by this; this is essentially the wish list he ran on. But what do you make of the proposal, and what do you think it would mean for everyday Americans? I’m just digesting like everybody else. But I think what is significant about this coming out is not just that it is horrific and not that it favors the wealthy and not that it is cruel—it’s that it is now on paper. And members of Congress who are avoiding these town halls are now going to have to vote for it. You already see a couple of them cracking. That was the purpose of the town halls—to put the pressure on them that we are watching you. We are watching you if you are going to make these cuts, if you’re going to make cuts to Social Security, if you’re going to make the cuts to veterans’ benefits, education—things that poll very highly amongst Republicans and Democrats. Now you’re on the clock. It was theoretical. It was Mr. Lie During the Campaign—I’ll reduce prices; I’ll end the war in Ukraine; I’ll do this, I’ll do that.Well, none of it was true. He can get away with trying to make those lies. But now he put it on paper. What I would say is this is a rallying point. I think a lot of the town halls and a lot of the rallies were pretext. Now it’s real. This is the fight to this CR vote. If we get this thing to fail, or significant backing off of these, not only does it protect the American public—it puts Donald Trump at huge risk, and it puts those members of Congress at huge risk. And he has, amid some of this pressure, backed off certain things. I’m thinking about tariffs here. He has backed off some tariffs or amended them. He “modified” his auto tariffs in anexecutive orderthis week, for example, amid a lot of warnings from industry leaders about the effect they would have. And I guess you could look at that as some relief, that perhaps he can be moved, but to me it also adds to this other concern: that he’s basically holding the economy hostage and using the promise of relief to force the private sector to kiss the ring. I agree with you 100%. If he’s making any changes, it has nothing to do with the pain it’s causing the American public. It has nothing to do with whether experts agree with it or not. It has everything to do with Donald Trump’s personal poll ratings, which are tanking. So as long as they continue to tank, he may modify himself. And look, I’m grateful if it’s providing a little relief to Americans. But this flip-flopping, putting a tariff on and off—the damage is already done. People are looking for trading partners they can depend on. The stress is already showing up. The tariffs are already hitting. You know, he goes andpressuresJeff Bezos—well, Americans are not stupid. When the Xbox they’re planning to buy their kids over Christmas has gone up from $300 to $380, which it did today, they’re going to know it’s totally Trump. So the only way Trump will change is if he thinks it’s a personal threat to him. Look, we’re going to win the governor’s race this fall in New Jersey and Virginia. You’re going to start to see—any special elections, they’re going to start losing members of Congress who are in districts that Kamala Harris won, and Republicans are going to start jumping ship, and Trump’s going to have a problem. What I worry about is, just like a cornered rat, he’s going to start lashing out again. That’s why I would expect you to see him double down on his horrific policies around immigration and no due process. He will scapegoat the LGBT community. He will go after political rivals. We need to be buckled up and ready to go. They’re showing that. This resistance feels different to me. In what way? I just think it’s more focused and it’s less dependent on an election or a candidate. It’s more focused on, You’re not going to do this to America. You’re not going to do this to my neighborhood. One thing that feels different to me compared with the first term is that some of it feels more antagonistic to Democrats as well. It seems like there’s broader frustration—not only with Trump for doing all this, but toward Democrats for not putting forward enough of a competing vision. It feels more wide-ranging. I think that’s fair too, and I think you should have to respond to people. I’ve been saying this. People are frustrated that when we get power, we haven’t moved the ball far enough. They were happy with the [Affordable Care Act] 15 years ago, but they’re still battling with their insurance company and getting denials and things. We are seeing jobs go overseas. Trump assesses their pain, even though he caused most of it and is not going to fix it. He assessed their pain. And Democrats—I heard it especially in Ohio that, you know,You guys said you were going to help and you didn’t.So I think what it’s doing is refocusing. I know people say,We don’t need a circular firing squad. We don’t need to fight internally.I think wedoneed to reclarify who we are. If our brand is damaged, we need to make sure, without a doubt, the working class knows we’re with them. So I’m glad for people to challenge us. I’m glad for them to challenge me if I’m not moving in a direction that helps them. I think that makes us stronger. Especially with Democrats in the minority right now in Washington, and Republicans not doing a ton to curb Trump at the moment, state leaders like yourself have taken on even more importance. Democratic governors have made a lot of moves to shield their states from Trump. But there does seem to be some divergence in approach. I’m based in Chicago—JB Pritzker, in my state, hastaken a very aggressive approach;Gretchen Whitmer, in Michigan, has established this“working relationship”with Trump on certain things, even as she warns that he has brought the United States into aconstitutional crisis.How do you think about your approach? And more broadly, how do you think Democrats should be coming at this political moment? First and foremost, Democratic governors have a responsibility to protect their people in their state. Each state’s a little different. Each state’s circumstances are a little different, in how they approach them. And I found that out during COVID. I had a good working relationship with Vice PresidentMike Pence,who I had served with in the House, and he was very helpful—I don’t know if that story ever got told. But you find your way to make a difference. JB is out hammering on this; you’ve gotMaura Healey;you’ve gotAndy Besheardoing his thing by showing that there’s a way to bring people together. For me, it’s a little bit different, having been the vice president’s running mate this last time. It brings a little more attention, so I have a platform, and I’m going out and using that platform to challenge these folks. But I think it goes back to, how can we best make sure that the damage he’s doing is mitigated? And I trust my Democratic governor colleagues are trying to use their skills and their unique position to the best of their ability. I keep saying this, Eric, and I think this is true: Democratic governors, senators, Senator[Cory] Booker,others that are out there, House members,Bernie Sanders,[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]—I think all of us need to fill a lane that’s best for us. I don’t think one voice can counter where Trump is at. He sucks up too much oxygen. So I’m actually quite comfortable with each of these folks finding what they can do. And I can tell you, again, going back to the governors—their styles may look differently, but it’s all focused on protecting their states. This week marked 100 days of this presidency. It’s stunning to think of all the destruction he’s wrought in that time. It’s stunning, too, to think there’s over 1,300 days more. Looking ahead at that… Look, he’ll be a lame duck after the midterms, and that’ll significantly change things. I see it as an opportunity. He has massively changed and rearranged us as a nation. He’s destroyed our relationships, our credibility. He’s put us into the camp with the autocrats—North Korea, Russia—and he did it in 100 days. So my thinking is, Why the hell should we wait a generation to fix health care? Why should I wait a generation to pull people out of poverty? I’m of the sense now that Trump has shown us that, in 100 days, we can significantly change this country—we’ll simply do it for the good of the people. This guy will be gone at one point in time. You’re right—1,300 days. I do think he’ll be dangerous during that time. But I think we should see it as an opportunity when we get back in power: God help us if we don’t move fast to improve people’s lives. That’s how I’m looking at it. An opportunity, as well as an endurance test right now. It is. We’ll stick together. I’m in for the fight, and I can tell Americans are.

    "title": "Walton Goggins Abruptly Ends Interview After Aimee Lou Wood Questions",
    "article_text": "Walton Gogginsdoes not seem ready to talk about his most recent ex-costar.The White Lotusstar abruptly ended an interviewwith the UKTimesafter the interviewer repeatedly brought up his former scene partnerAimee Lou Wood.“There is no conversation to be had about that,” Goggins told the outlet. After their star-crossed loversRick and Chelseamet their fatein theWhite Lotusseason three finale, Goggins and Wood apparentlyunfollowed each other on social media—leading to rumors of a rift between the two. In the interview,Timeseditor and writerEd Pottonhit on that seemingly sore subject a few times. First, he asked Goggins if he and Wood had had a falling out. “I’m not gonna have that conversation,” Goggins replied, and two separate publicists urged Potton to move on. But Potton brought up Wood again in the context of Goggins’s upcoming gig hostingSaturday Night Live. A few weeks ago, the sketch show made headlines for aWhite Lotusparody that includedan impression of Woodthat the actor found“mean and unfunny.”Goggins had left a comment under theSNLpost of the sketch on Instagram—he wrote “Hahahahahhahaha amazzzingggg”—but soon deleted the comment. Potton wondered if, as CNN correspondentElizabeth Wagmeisterrecently implied, the pair might be preparing to bury the hatchet on live television during his hosting gig. Goggins was apparently not having it. According to theTimes,Goggins sat there “saying nothing,” while his British publicist tried to change the subject. “Shall we talk aboutThe Uninviteda bit more?” she said, directing the line of questioning to Goggins’s recent film withPedro Pascal.As Potton hesitated, Goggins interjected: “Thinly veiled, my friend. The thing you’re least interested in.” In the story itself, Potton agrees with that assessment: “Frankly, yes.The Uninvitedis a decent movie but the more interesting stuff lies elsewhere.” But out loud, Potton writes, he brought up Wood again—leading to Goggins reportedly “cutting him off.” “There is no conversation to be had about that,” said Goggins. “Sharing politics on social media—it’s in a vacuum.” Potton reportedly made one final effort to broach the delicate subject, which was apparently the last straw for Goggins: “What the f-ck, Ed!” the actor said. “Come on buddy. Wow.” At this point, his American publicist stepped in: “We’re going to end it there,” she said. Vanity Fairhas reached out to Goggins for comment.

    "title": "I Asked the State Department What Was Up with the Venice Biennale. Then Things Got Interesting",
    "article_text": "Every two years, the cultural exchange staffers at the State Department start the long journey that will end at the Venice Biennale’s United States Pavilion, the Palladian-style grand exhibition space in the middle of an art-filled garden in the city of canals. The event is often called the “Olympics of the Art World,” and appropriately, the Giardini is filled with a pavilion for each country, spaces for exhibiting the work of a single artist chosen to represent their nation that year. It’s the world’s most prestigious cosmopolitan cultural expo, and drew a record 800,000 visitors in 2022. Artists who snag the coveted perch inside the US pavilion can turn from critical darlings into mega-gallery-backed art stars. After the Biennale opened in 2024, US-submitted artistJeffrey Gibsonwaspicked upfor representation by Hauser & Wirth. And like the Olympics, the Biennale is a competition: The best national pavilion is awarded the Golden Lion—past winners includeBruce Nauman, Jenny Holzer,andDaniel Buren. Usually, the selection process in the US starts when the Department’s Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs posts a grant for around $375,000 to fund the pavilion, and invites applicants to submit proposals for artists through a portal on the website for its Office of Citizen Exchanges. (The rest of the considerable cost of mounting the exhibition isusually raised from donors.) In past years, the grant has usually gone live about 18 months prior to the Biennale’s opening. A few months after that, the National Endowment for the Arts will post a federal notice saying that it will convene a panel of museum experts and arts scholars called the Federal Advisory Committee on International Exhibitions to oversee the applications. A month after that, the artist and curators who submitted the winning proposal get word that they’ve been chosen, and a month after that, it’s announced to the public. But a funny thing seemed to be happening with that timeline ahead of the 2026 edition of the Biennale, which opens to VIPs in April of next year. As a few sources have pointed out to me in recent days, as of earlier this week, with a scant 12 months to go until the exhibition, none of the above had yet happened. Even in a best-case scenario, that would mean selecting an artist, prepping an exhibition, and transporting it from the US to Italy on a timeline that might diplomatically be described ascompressed.WasDonald Trump’s State Department slow rolling the American entry? Was it doing so purposefully? By accident? Certainly, the idea of the chainsawed and DOGE-ified federal government endorsing contemporary art, even tacitly, even with a sum as relatively paltry as $375,000, does feel increasingly far-fetched. Then again, this is acompetition, a chance for the country to exert its international dominance, and we do know our 47th president sure loves him some blood sport. “I honestly think it might already be past the point of no return,” saidKathleen Ash-Milby,who co-commissioned the US Pavilion in 2024 and serves as the curator of Native American art at the Portland Art Museum. Just a year ago,during the invitation VIP opening weekof the Biennale, Ash-Milby was standing alongside her cocurators,Abigail WinogradandLouis Grachos,in front of the pavilion, where Gibson’s large-scale sculptures spilled out from the building and into its large courtyard. “When they open the portal, it’s not like it’s open for two weeks. They open it for a couple of months, and then they need a couple of months to process it,” she explained. “And if you don’t get notified until September or October, I don’t know how you could manage it.” The US has programmed its pavilion during every two-year cycle, apart from the years leading up to World War II, when they were boycotting fascism in Italy, and then during the war years of 1942 and 1944, when the entire exhibition was cancelled due to the blood being shed in Europe. When I started reporting this column late last week, sources who had discussed the matter with current State Department employees said there appeared to be no movement in getting the application portal up and running. As I spoke to former pavilion curators, as well as current and past State Department employees, many questioned whether the US government might be intending to leave the pavilion entirely empty this round, joining the ranks of recent Venice abstentions. Russia has not had pavilions in the Giardini for the last two years due to the war in Ukraine. The Israel pavilion stayed closed in 2024, after its chosen artist refused to open her show until there was a ceasefire in Gaza and an agreement to release Israeli hostages. Fear started rippling through the museum world last February, when it became obvious that something was amiss in the State Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which stilldoes not have an assistant secretary, who is usually the point person for coordinating the State’s Biennale pick. Confusion was pervasive. It’s typical for past commissioners to field inquiries from colleagues who are putting together proposals, and this year, the candidates all had the same question for Ash-Milby: How do weapplyfor this thing? The portal was nowhere to be found. Usually, the grant for the pavilion is posted by the State Department about 18 months before the exhibition is set to open in La Serenissima. The grant for the 2011 biennale waspostedin December 2009, the grant for the 2013 Biennale waspostedin May 2011, and the grant for the 2015 Biennale waspostedin August 2013. So that timeframe has varied over the years, but, in recent times, the latest that the State Department activated a portal was for the last Biennale. That one wentlivein February 2023, announcing the State Department would allot $375,000 for the 2024 edition. “The Biennale is one of the oldest and most prestigious international exhibitions of visual art, showcasing leading contemporary art from around the world,” readthe text of the 2023 grant. “The Biennale is a unique opportunity to reach non-traditional and underserved audiences (e.g., youth, urban communities, and people with disabilities), and the US Department of State has special interest in engaging these audiences through outreach activities associated with the exhibition.” Typically, after the grant is posted, curators submit their proposals for an exhibition by a single artist, a demanding exercise that requires rigorous scholarship, keen politicking, and a taste for the zeitgeist. The application is nearly a hundred pages long—theTimesoncecalledit a “bureaucratic marathon”—but for those who want to put forth a horse in the race, the form is, in a normal year, at least easily accessible on grants.gov. After several months of fielding applications, the State Department farms out the selection process to the National Endowment for the Arts, which forms the committee that sifts through the options. As detailed bynoticespreserved by the federal register in the National Archives, the meetings are typically announced in May of the year prior to the Biennale, and then actually go down the following month. Right up until early Wednesday afternoon this week,there was no grant on grants.gov, and there was no landing page for the 2026 Venice Biennale—thepageon the State Department website redirects to the 2025 Architecture Biennale, which opens next week. The United States does have a pavilion up in the Giardini, asJoe Biden’s ECA funded it in January 2024. “If you were to say, ‘Well, what if they opened the portal in May?’ that means they wouldn’t be notifying someone until October—and then you have to raise all the money and plan and get your reservations for all the different things, including shipping and storage and contractors and event spaces,” Ash-Milby said. “The timeline thatwewere on was so incredibly tight. So I can’t even imagine how anyone could do it faster than we were forced to do.” After months of planning an exhibition, the literal making of the exhibition also takes months, as shipping artwork to the loggia-filled Venetian islands is a nightmare unto itself. Interestingly, even in a DOGE world, the pavilion funding was there the whole time. After a leaked memo in mid-April suggested that the ECA would be demolished due to sweeping budget cuts to Foggy Bottom, Secretary of StateMarco Rubioannounced later in the month that the bureau would, at least for now, survive—though Trump’s proposed 2026 budget,made public this week, intends to cut cultural-exchange funding. At present, the ECA rolls up to acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public AffairsDarren Beattie,whom Trump fired as a speechwriter during his first term, after CNN revealed that Beattie spoke at a conference attended by white nationalists such asRichard SpencerandPeter Brimelow. In the years that followed, Beattie founded the right-wing media outlet Revolver News and kept tweeting. “Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,” hewroteon X in 2024. (As of deadline, Beattie had not responded to a request for comment for this story sent to the State Department.) On Wednesday afternoon, around lunchtime, I asked the State Department, NEA, and ECA about plans for the 2026 pavilion. A State Department spokesperson told me that the agencies were going to discuss internally and get back to me. At 4:16 p.m., an NEA rep wrote to let me know the portal was now open. Coincidence? Maybe? Probably? A question for the ages. (As of deadline, the State Department hadn’t provided comment, though we’ll update the story if and when they do so.) In any case, there it was. You can applyherenow if you so desire. But before you fire up your grant-writing team, there’s some fine print you’ll want to inspect. The stipulations put forth by the ECA’s program statement do typically get an edit from edition to edition, and the latest iteration is pretty Trumpy. Right off the top, the ECA has added language that was not previously included in program statements: The artist who shows in the US pavilion must “advance international understanding of American values by exposing foreign audiences to innovative and compelling works of art that reflect and promote American values.” The 2023 grant said applicants will be chosen based on four main criteria, including: “Support of Equity and Underserved Communities.” That is gone, replaced by: “Promotes American Values.” Where the 2023 program listed among its foreign policy goals, “democracy, Diversity and inclusivity, the environment, Health and food security, human rights,” we now have “fostering peaceful relations between the United States and other nations.” Also new is the ominous-sounding “monitoring site visits,” which promises that the State Department will drop in from time to time to “gather additional information on the recipient’s ability to properly implement the project.” Both versions ask that the pavilion be “non-political,” but the way in which the text was edited is telling. Here is the 2023 version: … programs must maintain a non-political character and should be representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. “Diversity” should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences, including but not limited to ethnicity, race, gender, religion, geographic location, social-economic status, and disabilities. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle both in program administration and in program content. And here is the 2025 version: …programs must maintain a non-political character and should be representative of the diplomacy of American political, social, and cultural life. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle both in program administration and in program content. The program spells out that any applicant must certify two things: “compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws,” and, of course, “does not operate any programs promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion that violate any applicable anti-discrimination laws.” That seems sure to narrow the talent pool. Still, as previously noted, the selection carries plenty of prestige and the prospect of a serious career boost. We’ll see how this all shakes out over the course of the next few months. For now, you know where to apply. Your crib sheet for the comings and goings in the art world this week and beyond… …Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. In an entirely predictable but ultimately reassuring development, Frieze was sold by Endeavor Holding Group to an investor consortium led by…Ari Emanuel,the Hollywood master-dealmaker and art collector who acquired the fair group for Endeavor in 2016. Sources indicate that his partners in the deal are the private equity unit RedBird Capital Partners and the asset manager Apollo, who were Emanuel’s partners in acquiring Endeavor’s tennis-related holdings earlier this year. The most surprising thing, from speaking to insiders, is the price tag: $200 million is a lot to pay for an art fair group in 2025, even if it does include seven expos around the world and some potent media holdings. But more than anything, there’s a sigh of relief. Frieze CEOSimon Foxwill stay the course, and fair directors are all full speed ahead. …Speaking of which, Frieze New York is next week, and last week the Frieze–owned Expo Chicago went down in the Windy City. I was in town for a quick trip, and in addition to the fair itself, I got a sneak peak atPaul Pfeiffer’s retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago from the artist himself, and went to a fabulous dinner atTheaster Gates’s studio—well, it’s just one of his South Side studios and this one wasenormous—hosted by Gagosian’sAntwaun Sargentand Bottega Veneta. There were plenty of great shows around town, including a group show at Gray, and the final exhibition put on by the legendary 90-year-old galleristRhona Hoffman.Perhaps the highlight was the RenBen, a gala for the Renaissance Society, one of the country’s oldest contemporary art organizations, which went down at a helicopter hangar near the West Loop, with the sound of choppers permeating a blissfully warm night. …Another city, another gala: On Monday, the New Museum honoredPaula Cooper,who has run her gallery for nearly six decades. Museum directorLisa Phillipsgave a heartfelt tribute beforeLaurie Andersonput on one of the most truly surreal, stunning performances you’ll ever see at a benefit dinner. It ended with the whole suit-wearing crowd doing Lou Reed’s tai chi routine, cool stuff. More of that, gala season. …We’ll fully dig into Frieze New York next week, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that Gagosian will be presenting a solo booth of work byJeff Koons,who cut off his representation withLarry GagosianandDavid Zwirnerin 2021, defecting exclusively to Pace. At the time, Gagosian and Zwirner, who co-represented Koons, seemed a little miffed that the world’s most expensive living artist was leaving them for one of their primary rivals. When asked about Koons going to Pace, Gagosian told theTimes,dry as can be, “It seems like a good fit.” But according to sources, the relationship with Pace cooled after a few years due to delays in the studio and cost overruns, though Koons is still on the roster. (Pace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) His one exhibition with the gallery was a one-work one-off at its small Palm Beach outfit that was only up for two weeks. Seems like the Jeff and Larry Show can proceed—in the booth next week will be three works from Koons’sHulk Elvisseries. Expect it to be the center of gravity when the fair opens Wednesday at the Shed. Have a tip?

    "title": "Kate Middleton Is Back Behind the Camera for Princess Charlotte’s 10th Birthday Portrait",
    "article_text": "Princess Charlotteturned 10 on Friday, and the royal family celebrated by ushering back in some recent tradition.Prince WilliamandKate Middletonshared a new portrait of the grinning tweenon social media, taken, as had always been the case for such snaps until some recent experiments, by Princess Kate. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The proud parents kept the caption simple, writing, “Happy 10th Birthday Princess Charlotte!” alongside the photo, with requisite photo credit to the princess. Charlotte, the couple’s second-born, wears outdoors gear including a camo jacket and blue hiking backpack, her hair is pulled back in a windblown ponytail as she pauses to look at the camera on a hilly landscape. She's also the spitting image of photos of dad Prince Wiliam when he was around the same age. The portrait marks a return to Wales family tradition after a slight diversion: For youngest siblingPrince Louis’ recent seventh birthday on April 23, it wasn’t Kate, but photographerJosh Shinnerwho was behind the lens for the annual portrait. Shinner is also the artist behind theWales family’s 2023 holiday card, edited in a tasteful black and white. In all but a few instances, like Louis’ recent milestone, passionate amateur photographer Kate has taken on the role of family archivist. The family of five—William, Kate, eldest sonPrince George, Charlotte, and Louis—recentlycelebrated Easter privately togetherinstead of participating in the royal family's traditional group observance. The Prince and Princess of Wales also recentlymarked their 14th anniversary, making a trip to Scotland, where they first met while students at St Andrews University.

    "title": "All of Kim Kardashian’s Met Gala Looks From 2013 to Now",
    "article_text": "Kim Kardashianknows how to get people talking, especially when it comes to Met Gala fashion. Since her first appearance at the fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in 2013, when she walked the famed steps that serve as the dramatic backdrop to the night’s arrivals, wearing a long-sleeve, turtleneck Givenchy gown whose tight-fitting floral fabric made no secret of her late-term pregnancy with her first child,North West,Kardashian has made headlines with her Met looks. Since then, she’s never missed the event, serving up 10 moremust-see looksin the years since. Who could forget the flesh-coloredThierry Mugler“wet look” dress she donned in 2019, or the 2022 controversy over Kardashian borrowing theBob Mackie–designed dress famously worn by Marilyn Monroe to sing “Happy Birthday” to President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden? The dress, on loan from Ripley’s Believe It or Not, was allegedly damaged during its sojourn with Kardashian, andMackie later said it had been “a big mistake”to let Kardashian wear it. (Ripley’s later issued astatementsaying that Kardashian “did not, in any way, damage the garment.”) Yet more controversy: Kardashian was quoted saying shelost 16 pounds in three weeksin order to fit into the garment. Then, in 2024, she wore aSleeping Beauty–inspired lookdesigned by Maison Margiela Artisanal byJohn Galliano,with a corset so tight she called breathing in the getup“an art form” that she had to practicebefore the big night. Whether she’sdripping with thousands of pearlsorcovered from head to toe—face included—in black fabric, Kardashian is a can’t-miss at the Met Gala. Ahead, take a look at all of her looks through the years so far. For minute-to-minute coverage of all things Met Gala, be sure to head toVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblog.

    "title": "The Day Quentin Tarantino Flipped Off the Cannes Film Festival",
    "article_text": "On May 23, 1994,Clint Eastwoodwas set to present the Palme d'Or at the closing ceremony of the 47th Cannes Film Festival. Many members of the group gathered at the event expectedKrzysztof Kieslowski’s celebrated filmTrois Couleurs: Rouge.But instead, in a shock to the system,PulpFiction took the prize instead. The room was filled with clamor and whistling as the director of the winning film,Quentin Tarantino, took the stage. It hadn’t died down by the time he arrived at the podium to give his acceptance speech. While a stunned Tarantino gathered his thoughts, a woman in the crowd shouted out her displeasure: \"What a piece of crap! What a piece of crap!\" Without hesitation—and as seen inthis archival video—Tarantino responded by giving her the finger. At the time, Tarantino was still in the early stages of his film career. He was 32 when he attended the Cannes Film Festival to premiere of his new independent film, which featured a star-studded cast:John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, andSamuel L. Jackson, who were about to make film history. The filmmaker hadn’t expected the Palme d'Or; in fact, he’d even thought of leaving the festivities before receiving a call fromGilles Jacob, the festival president, asking him to stay. After his flippant gesture, Tarantinohad this to say: \"I never expect to win anything when a jury has to decide, because in general I don't make films that bring people together. I make films that divide them.\" (left to right) ThePulpFiction crew: Samuel L Jackson, Maria de Medeiros, director Quentin Tarantino, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and John Travolta, at the Cannes Film Festival, May 21, 1994. Clint Eastwoodlater saidthat the decision had been made democratically, and thatPulp Fictionhad simply stood out from the rest of the pack. “We sat there and watched it, and it caught everyone's attention pretty well,” he told the American Film Institute. “I was surprised that the members of the European jury jumped out of their seats... A few of them turned around and said, ‘This is the best film, this is the film of this festival!’” PulpFiction, which cost $8.5 million, went on to become one of the most profitable independent films in cinema history, grossing $214 million. Today, Tarantino's success is undeniable, and his reputation is well established. TheKill Billsaga,Inglourious Basterds,Django Unchained,Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood: the director continues to present his singular style of aesthetic violence. But not everyone may agree about which of this films is Tarantino’svery best. Original story fromVF France.

    "title": "A Yachtmaker’s Trove of Photographs and Ephemera Offers a Glimpse of a Rarefied Lifestyle",
    "article_text": "In the opening of the 2014 short filmThe Gentleman’s Wager,Jude LawandGiancarlo Gianninisit beside each other, each clad in soft white pants and sunglasses, on the sundeck of an exquisite sailboat. It’s a commercial for Johnnie Walker Blue Label, and the pair does appear to be sharing a bottle of scotch, but it’s the vessel, not the drink, that takes center stage. “I want this boat,” Law says. Giannini gives him a wry look. “Built in 1928, designed by the Baglietto yard,” he replies as the sea glitters cerulean behind him. “Nothing like it in the world. Rarer than rare. It’s not for sale.” The film may be aTalented Mr. Ripley–inflected fantasy that finds its climax in a choreographed dance number, but the 95-foot sailing yacht is the real deal—and it does have a price. Those unable to scrounge the millions needed to purchase such a dreamboat might instead turn over $13,500 to $30,000 a week for private charters, depending on the time of year, to buy four guests a window into the world of Baglietto. Another option, for an even friendlier figure: a new book,Baglietto: The Art of Yachting Since 1854,published by Rizzoli with text byAntonio Macaluso,traces the shipyard’s trajectory from founder Pietro Baglietto’s first skiffs and dinghies to its racing sailboats and military vessels tomegayachtswith names likeThunderballandBlue Ice.(The latter, according to the case file forUnited States v. One 1999 135-Foot Baglietto Yacht,which litigated the fate of the pleasure cruiser after Florida prosecutors attempted to seize it from Venezuelan “boligarchs” in 2017, “can accommodate nine guests and eight crewmembers for as long as it takes to consume 40,000 liters of fuel and 6,000 liters of water.”) The book is a rich visual trove, with painterly interior sketches by architect Lorenzo Castello, archival newsclips of important voyages, photographs of shipyard metalworkers crafting imposing steel hulls, large as leviathans, and image upon image of the gleaming finished product. It’s also something of a historical Social Register of rarefied seafarers. For the richest and most famous, six degrees of separation can prove too broad—one is often sufficient, and sometimes the hinge relationship is a very big boat. In 1969, Baglietto produced 72 units of a model it dubbed the 20M, a 69-foot yacht outfitted with a soon-to-be-ubiquitous flybridge. One of these boats, originally calledCochise,was first owned by racecar driver and auto importerJohn von Neumannin 1972, and passed through the hands ofThierry Roussel(fourth husband to Christina Onassis, who had her own 20M, as did her stepfather, Stavros Niarchos) and Saudi arms dealerAdnan Khashoggi(who renamed itCujo) before it was purchased byDodi Al-Fayed, for whom it served as one of two vessels on which he and Princess Diana spent their first and last summer together in 1997. Macaluso refers to the proliferation of big-name clientele as “the incredible Baglietto web.” Also ensnared: Rizzoli’s founder Angelo Rizzoli, who had the shipyard refit a military vessel as his personal yacht; Prince Rainier of Monaco, who called his boatCarostefalin homage to his children; Gianni “L’Avvocato” Agnelli, infamously photographed jumping naked from the side of his Baglietto sailboatAgneta;Pope Leo XIII, to whom a group of Genoese nobles gifted a yawl in 1888; and Peter Sellers, who invitedRingo Starronto his beloved yacht while the drummer was on hiatus from The Beatles—where, after a meal of boiled octopus, Starr retired to his cabin and wrote “Octopus’s Garden.” Macaluso quotes Sellers in the 1969 documentaryWill the Real Mr. Sellers Please Stand Up?“When the weather is nice, I know nothing more beautiful than being at sea aboard a yacht, entering ports when you want, disembarking when you want, eating on board, swimming,” Sellers said. “If someone asked me what the greatest luxury in life is, I’d say it’s my boat.” Indeed.

    "title": "In ‘The History of Sound,’ Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor’s Tender Romance Defines a Complex Life",
    "article_text": "Paul Mescaldid not have much time. He wasbuilt like a Roman gladiator, but about to jump into life as an introverted music student in New England circa 1916. There would be virtually no break between the two jobs. He started hitting the treadmill for hours a day. Between filming the epic Colosseum scenes and going toe to toe withDenzel Washington,he was getting a crash course in Kentucky dialect and studying old folk songs. “I didn’t have as much time as I would’ve liked to lose as muchGladiatorbody as possible,” Mescal says. “In those last two weeks of the shoot in Malta, when I was still filmingGladiator II,my trainer saw a lot of ugly sides to my hungry self.” But this was how the timing had worked out, and Mescal felt determined to seize the opportunity. Along with his costarJosh O’Connorand directorOliver Hermanus,he’d been waiting years to makeThe History of Sound.When all three were initially attached to the project, Hermanus hadn’t yet made a movie outside of his native South Africa, while Mescal and O’Connor were rising stars coming off of hot TV roles—the former onNormal People,the latter onThe Crown.The project floated in limbo. Financing was difficult; the pandemic kept raging; guild strikes shut down the industry for months. All the while, Mescal and O’Connor (who alsoearned acclaimfor last year’sChallengersandLa Chimera) were becoming movie stars. “Their lives were literally changing, and it was always this groupthink situation of, Where can we find the time to force the universe to let us make this film?” says Hermanus—whose last film, the British period pieceLiving,earned two Oscar nominations. “We probably wouldn’t have been able to make this film when we wanted to, in 2022, because they weren’t the Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor that we now know today.” So here arrivesThe History of Sound,a sweeping, wrenching historical drama starring two of the most exciting actors of their generation. (The film premieres this month at the Cannes Film Festival, before Mubi releases it in US theaters later this year.) The timing feels apt for everyone involved, and that spirit infused the making of the film. “How many times do you hear people who really try and get something made over five, 10, 15 years, and it just falls away?” Mescal says. “I remember feeling very lucky. Like, We have to enjoy this. Because we’ll come across other opportunities in our life where we love a script as much as this, and we just don’t get to get it made.” Adapted byBen Shattuckfrom his own short story,The History of Soundexamines the seismic impact of a fleeting romantic encounter between Lionel (Mescal) and David (O’Connor), two students at the New England Conservatory during World War I. They meet at a piano bar, where Lionel hears David singing a folk song familiar from his youth. He’s swept off his feet, transported back to his childhood—so we’re told in the lyrical narration of an older Lionel, voiced byChris Cooper—and instantly infatuated. They lock eyes, smile at one another, drink, go home together. They talk about how they grew up and their dreams for what’s next. They set a schedule for how often they can see each other, until life starts getting in the way. “David is vocal, David has ideas, David is wealthy. And Lionel is kind of just being overwhelmed by this person, but in a very slow-drip way—taking a long time to quantify the impact of this moment in his life and this relationship,” Hermanus says. “That’s just relatable to me, I guess. We all have people who define us, but we don’t realize they defined us until it’s too late.” In the mold of Americana dramas that were far more common a few decades ago,The History of Soundcovers the expanse of a life—with particular, melancholy focus on each moment that Lionel and David share within it. Years after school, they meet at a train station in Portland, Maine, and embark on a trip around the Northeast. They walk dozens of miles and collect folk ballads from different corners of the country. “My grandfather once said that happiness isn’t a story,” Lionel narrates at one point. “So there isn’t much to say about those first weeks.” The effortless, palpably sweet connection between the two men runs contrary to most depictions of queer love in this time period, usually defined by danger and secrecy. “I’m a gay man. I would love to go to the movies and watch a movie about a same-sex relationship that maybe makes me cry, but feels fulfilling. So much of queer cinema—and I’ve made queer cinema like this—is about the struggles,” says Hermanus, who’s known for brutal queer South African dramas like 2019’sMoffie.“For me, this has always been about wanting it to be accessible to everyone. We’re not going to make a movie about the problematizing of their relationship or their sexuality.” Following the song-collecting trip,The History of Soundtakes surprising, sometimes tragic plot turns. Life goes on. Youth and the love that blossomed around it starts to feel like a bittersweet memory. This is specifically true for Lionel, our main character. “The film definitely has romantic gestures in it—intensely so in some places—but it is fundamentally about Lionel’s life,” Mescal says. “It’s actually important to let audiences know not to come just expecting [romance]. It’s a beautiful section of the film, and it has a lasting impact, but it’s a subjective understanding of Lionel’s experience of that love.” Mescal first met O’Connor on Zoom during the pandemic, following the release ofNormal People.O’Connor reached out; he was a new fan. “We had a sweet Zoom,” Mescal says. “He was one of the first people that I was starstruck by afterNormal Peoplecame out. He’s now one of my best friends, and I just adore him.” The two had separately gotten attached toThe History of Soundover the years with no idea which character they’d play. In fact, Mescal wanted to portray David, not Lionel. “A little bit of me at that point was reticent, if I’m being honest, to lead a film to that extent,” the actor says. But Hermanus had a vision in the middle of the night that Mescal should play the part, and told the actor about it the next day. Mescal took a few weeks away, poring over the screenplay again, before saying yes. This was before Mescal’s Oscar nomination forAftersun,or the offer to toplineRidley Scott’s massiveGladiatorsequel.The History of Soundfelt like a homecoming in some ways—“Gladiatoris the anomaly in terms of the genre of films that I’ve played in before,” he says—and O’Connor only aided in that experience. The two radiate an intimate, singular chemistry. “We felt very boyish in each other’s company throughout,” says Mescal. “I’ve always said this to Josh, but he brings out a childlike version of me. I haven’t felt that kind of degree of boyishness in myself for a long time.” The duo sell a romantic connection that extends well beyond the bedroom. “There is a kind of real sense of companionship, and the joy and loss that comes with the presence and absence of that,” Mescal says. “It’s not just about sex and the intensity of falling in love. It’s deeper than that.” In fact, there isn’t much sex at all inThe History of Sound—though the film carries a romantic sweep beginning to end. “I didn’t want the sex of it to be the transgression, or the big idea, like, ‘Oh, it’s 1917, and these two men are taking the risk of being sexual,’” Hermanus says. “Ben wrote it in a way where there was no hesitation, no moment of fear. For me, the sex scene is when Lionel is walking around David’s apartment the morning after [their first encounter], and he’s smelling everything and sitting everywhere. He’s absorbing the energy of this person.” One reason Hermanus thought Mescal needed to play Lionel: “Paul loves singing.” While the first musical voice we hear in the film is technically David’s, it’s Paul who is attending the conservatory for voice. He’s also the one who ultimately embarks on a career as a singer. “I get nervous when it’s committed to film and could potentially be or will be there forever,” Mescal admits. “But these are beautiful songs. To get to sing them and have them recorded—they’re not songs that I think tons of people will be overly familiar with, so it’s nice to hopefully introduce some people to that kind of world of music.” He adds that the music was one of his initial ways into the project—he knew these songs well even as he was reading the script. Shattuck is from Massachusetts, and wrote the short story in part as a love letter to richly emotional folk ballads—the sorts of songs whose origins often go back hundreds of years. One of key songs shared in the film between Lionel and David, “Silver Dagger,” dates back to the early 19th century. “Narrative songs historically tell the stories of love, or love lost, or morals and ethics. They kind of become these oral history subjects,” Hermanus says. The director spent years immersed in them, listening to a Spotify playlist with hundreds of entries, which he later handed to the actors. He was inspired to give the film a shape that echoed that of the music. “The story ofHistory of Sound—as a story itself, as a movie—is in itself one of these songs. It’s the concept of the movie.” The film team worked closely with composerOliver Coates(who also worked onAftersun) and contemporary singer-songwriterSam Amidonto nail down an unforgettable soundscape. Lionel and David hear the music they study in its original forms from town to town, against Coates’s soaringly emotional score. “It’s not about the beauty of the performance; it’s understanding what you’re singing about more so,” Mescal says. “It was an easy thing for me to submerge myself in.” The balance between performing and watching others perform is precisely where Mescal’s performance comes alive. “Something that really turns Lionel on creatively is to observe, is to record. And I tried to inform that as much as possible in his physicality,” Mescal says. “He’s got a totally different physical language to that ofGladiator. He’s a voyeur to the world. He does stand up for himself, but to try and play that truthfully requires a level of restraint that I love playing in. But this, I think, is the most extreme version of that that I’ve played.” The full scope ofThe History of Sound’s thematic power gradually reveals itself through to the film’s final act. The big scale of Hermanus’s filmmaking snaps into focus, as does the text’s subtle queerness, in what it means to hold onto love that feels so far away. Mescal’s delicate lead performance completes its shape too. “I spent a lot of time on set turning to Oliver, being like, ‘Is this going to read?’ And I think it does in the finished product. But that was something that I was nervous about,” Mescal says. “You’re chartering a life. You’re just trying to let time do the work in the film, and let it percolate through Lionel. For some people, that will be something that interests them. Other people, they might not get it.” Time comes up a lot when speaking with those involved inThe History of Sound.You’ll often hear the phrase “labor of love.” Mescal has never been attached to a project longer in his career. He now thinks back to when he first read the script in his mid-20s, afraid to take on such a big role. “The thing that I’m most proud about,” he says, “is that the feeling I had when I read the script for the first time is what I got when I saw the film for the first time.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Alan Alda at 89: A Legend on ‘The Four Seasons,’ Life with Parkinson’s, ‘MAS*H,’ and Carol Burnett",
    "article_text": "It’s been 44 years sinceAlan Alda’s movieThe Four Seasonswas released, and it turns out that marriage and friendship are still complicated, fraught, and surprising—and an enticing topic for a comedy icon.Tina Fey’s Netflix series adaptation of the 1981 comedy, which starred Alda,Carol Burnett,andRita Moreno,reimagines a year of couples getaways withWill Forte,Colman Domingo,andSteve Carell,along with a cameo from Alda himself. At 89, Alda still has the impeccable comic timing he did inM*A*S*H,along with a few more decades of perspective on human connection, his Parkinson’s diagnosis, and why hedoesn’twant to be remembered. Vanity Fair:In episode two of the newFour Seasons,you masterfully deliver a monologue involving the line, “Congratulations. Take off your pants; it’s a sex day!” What’s a memory that stands out to you about that day? I was glad I could remember my lines. And I remember, as we were standing outside to go into the room to shoot the scene, I was warming up my voice with a Shakespeare sonnet, and Tina said, ‘Is that from a play or is that a sonnet?’ And I had this really nice feeling that we were two actors waiting to go on stage together, that little exchange before going out into the light. You have a warm-up sonnet? “When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes.” When did you first hear Netflix and Tina Fey would be adapting your film into a series? Did your30 Rockcostar reach out directly to ask you to make an appearance? I don’t know how old Tina is, but I think she was barely born when the movie came out, so it was very flattering to hear that she was interested in doing a series based on it. It was really interesting to me that she based it not only on the movie but on how times have changed, relationships are different, the lingo is different. I guess she thought it’d be fun to have me suddenly show up as a character that wasn’t even in the movie. I found an oldNew York Timesarticle written in 1981 from the set ofThe Four Seasons.It says this about you: “Although he is one of the least macho of leading men, he tends to use quite salty language in private—but not even this takes the gloss off his squeaky-clean image. Friends describe him with adjectives more commonly found on pedestals: concerned, considerate, generous. As for enemies, he doesn’t seem to have any.” What do you make of that? I’ve killed them all. Did you ever get sick of being known as the nice guy with no enemies? It’s led to a couple of lawsuits because people thought they could steal from me, and I wouldn’t mind. They didn’t realize that I really enjoy a goodlawsuit. Netflix is hosting a one-night-only screening of your 1981 film at NYC’s Paris Theater. Will I see you there? I’m face blind, so I won’t recognize you. When we were makingThe Four Seasons,my daughter was one of the actors in the movie. She didn’t look like the two people playing her parents because her hair was dark and their hair was light, so I sent out to have her hair color changed. She came back on the set with blond hair and big glasses, and I said to the assistant director, “Don’t let these strangers on set.” Isn’t that awful? Let’s talk aboutM*A*S*Hfor a second. It’s still hard to wrap my mind around the fact that 120 million people watched the finale. It was at least half the people in the country watching it at the same time. We had an inkling at the time because we were watching it on a big screen at the studio and then driving to dinner, realizing the streets were empty. What’s a subtle thing about how you played Hawkeye Pierce that makes you proud? I don’t get “proud” about things. I get “glad I’m able to do things.” I got better at everything I did onM*A*S*H. I got better as an actor, I got better as a director and writer. But I think the thing that I came away with that was the most valuable to me for the rest of my life was what we did between scenes—sitting around waiting an hour for them to light the next shot. We would kid one another and play. Sometimes we would rehearse a scene, but mostly we would just connect. During COVID, a lot of home-bound people discovered another of your beloved series,The West Wing.Did you find yourself with a new generation of Arnold Vinick fans? Yeah, I did. The thing that comes to mind aboutThe West Wingis the live debate. It was like an improv because we had so little time to rehearse, so we had to get most of our lines off of monitors. I couldn’t see the monitor without glasses, but I had not established wearing glasses in the show. So I had to get contact lenses, but I had never worn contact lenses. I remember two minutes before going on the air live, I was still trying to stick my finger in my eye. You helped raise this feminist withFree to Be… You and Me,and you championed the Equal Rights Amendment. Can you believe it still hasn’t passed? The arguments against it were all things that changed just by natural process. There was the idea that if the ERA passed, there would be unisex bathrooms or that women would be serving in combat in the military. And these things did happen. But the thing that didn’t change is that it’s not unconstitutional to discriminate against women. A decade ago, you were diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. How are you feeling these days? Well, when people ask me, “How are you?” I often say, “making progress.” I don’t mention which direction. [pause] This may sound Pollyanna-ish, but it really is so: The little things I used to be able to do, I have trouble doing now. Something as simple as buttoning or unbuttoning a shirt might take 10 tries until I get the right angle. Instead of being impatient about it, I find it’s like an exploration, like learning a new dance step. I finally find an angle to come in on, and I get it done, and there’s such a moment of pleasure, a shot of dopamine. It’s a little victory, and these little victories that fill my day, I wouldn’t have if I didn’t have Parkinson’s. Not that I welcome Parkinson’s, but I’m really glad I stumbled into this attitude. You’re so fascinated with science. Do you find yourself researching new treatments? Oh, yeah. You have to. There’s always the latest new thing coming up. Often, the latest new thing involves drilling a hole in your head, which I save as a last resort. Your culture and science podcast,Clear and Vivid,always ends with seven quick questions for your guest, so I thought I’d hit you with seven more. What’s one role you wish that you had taken that you didn’t? I was asked to doThe Killing Fields,but my father was in the hospital dying, and I wanted to be there. There was no question that I wouldn’t do it, but it would have been nice if it had worked out because it was such a good movie. [The role ultimately went toSam Waterston.] What’s the strangest question anyone has ever asked you? I was at a resort hotel, and a boy, about six years old, looked up at me for a long time and said, “How did you get out of the TV?” What’s a book that changed your life? The book that turned things around for me was when I was eight years old, and I readTop Horse at Crescent Ranch,and I decided I wanted to be a writer. So I wrote a book, and since I was always interested in the underdog, my story was calledNot the Top Horse at Crescent Ranch. What happens in your book? He wasn’t the favorite horse, but he could do things that nobody else could. In 100 years, what descriptive word do you want attached to your name? “Who?” You don’t want to be remembered? Have you ever been to the graveyard in Paris calledPère Lachaise? Yves Montand is buried there on a little slab that’s surrounded by acres of three-story monuments to mayors from tiny towns, people you never heard of. That, to me, is what thinking about the future is. When you’re gone, it’s over. How many people are worthy of thinking about from 100 years ago or 500 or a 1,000? If there is a second season ofThe Four Seasonsand Don returns, what do you want his storyline to be? I’m no TV writer, but I’d like to put in a formal request to incorporate your 1981 film costar Carol Burnett. The story is: I meet this wonderful woman.

    "title": "Jean Smart’s View From the Top: On ‘Hacks’ Season 4, Her Broadway Return, and the Lack of Women in Late-Night TV",
    "article_text": "In the latest season ofHacks,Jean Smart’s Deborah Vance is warned that her late-night series won’t survive unless it’s a hit by the end of its first year. Head writerAva Daniels(Hannah Einbinder) wonders if “hits” even exist anymore. Of course,Hacksitself proves they do. Amid a saturated entertainment landscape,Lucia Aniello,Paul W. Downs,andJen Statsky’s award-winning Max series is an unmitigated succcess—earning Smart threebest-actress Emmysand finally capturingbest comedy seriesat the awards last September. At 73, Smart is aware of the rarified air both she and her series occupy. “I don’t stop realizing and appreciating that I am on a show that I absolutely love, that is so brilliantly written and so smart, with such incredibly cool people—and I’m home every night,” she tellsVanity Fair.“I don’t have to be away from my family, in Atlanta or wherever. Well, I probably wouldn’t have done the job if it had been set or shot in Atlanta.” Things aren’t going as smoothly for Smart’s character, who learns in this week’s episode ofHacksthat she isn’t testing well with women. “I like when she’s funny, but not when she’stryingto be funny,” says one focus group participant. Others complain about her age and her hair. The criticism sends Deborah down a road of desperation, one that involves stealing demo-friendly guests likeKristen Bellout from under an irateJimmy Kimmel(“Go jam your dick up Fallon’s ass! You fucked with the wrong Jimmy,” he snarls) and welcomingJulianne Nicholsonas “Dance Mom,” a popular TikTok creator. “Being canceled is just absolutely not an option,” Smart says of her character’s perhaps ill-fated efforts. “She thinks she’s getting her dream, and she’s just not going to let anything or anybody screw it up.” Like Deborah, Smart isn’t content to rest on her laurels. Later this month, she’ll return to Broadway for the first time in 25 years with the one-woman showCall Me Izzy,before returning for the presumed final season ofHacks.Ahead of her busy spring, Smart speaks toVFabout the show’s “down and dirty” fourth season, one of the most important decisions of her career, and why women are still absent from late-night TV: “Do you have a couple hours?” Vanity Fair:This season ofHacksairs amid the premiere of your one-woman Broadway show. How are you feeling in the lead-up? Jean Smart:I am gearing up. I have the first third of the play recorded on my phone, and I fall asleep listening to it every night, because it’s about 75 to 80 pages of material that I need to learn. I have done a couple readings of the play in Los Angeles and New York, so I do have it in my bones a bit already. People say, “How can you possibly memorize that much?” But it’s sort of like when you have a fun anecdote or funny joke—you don’t usually forget any of the details because you can’t wait to tell somebody. So that’s how it feels, because I love this piece so much. Ava blackmailing Deborahat the end of season threeis still looming large over their relationship. But how much does the act that led to the betrayal—Deborah sleeping with Tony Goldwyn’s media CEO, then getting a show on his network—alter Deborah’s confidence? Well, I think she has a lot of guilt about that. She knows that Ava’s right about certain things, which makes her even more angry, because she doesn’t want to admit that Ava was right. But at the same time she’s thinking, Why doesn’t she understand that this has been my dream my entire adult life? I am moments from getting and enjoying it. Why can’t you understand that I have to make certain decisions? But she knows she’s going to have to make some compromises, which she’s not used to. Does Deborah have imposter syndrome, or is her personal doubt tied to something else? I mean, she has a great deal of confidence in her ability. But at the same time, betrayal is the ultimate sin to her. So when she feels that Ava betrays her, all bets are off. I mean, the gloves are off big time—because all that does is bring up all her personal demons and her past, and everything that has driven her and made her the person she is. She thrives on bitterness and resentment. You andHannah Einbinderhave built such a rich onscreen dynamic together. Was there a moment this season where you most felt that history? We have a lot of scenes in season four that get pretty down and dirty. Hannah and I were discussing that yesterday. We concluded that it would probably be much more difficult to do those scenes, and the scenes would not come out as well, if we weren’t good friends—if we had an antagonistic relationship, which I can’t even imagine, being in a work environment like that. That would be so awful. But if indeed we had that, scenes like that would be so excruciatingly uncomfortable. But we actually are able to do them better, I think, because we’re friends. And it gets pretty nasty, season four. The fifth episode is where outside opinions on Deborah’s late-night show really come into focus. Did this episode make you reflect on any criticism that you’ve received as an actor? I’ve been very, very fortunate—knock wood—in terms of feedback. I’m the kind of person who could have continued on in this industry if I hadn’t gotten a lot of positive reinforcement. Some people seem to do okay with directors who scream and yell at them, or bad reviews. I couldn’t handle any of that. I don’t function well with that kind of stress. I’ve learned from an actress who was much older than me at the time, the wonderful late Nancy Marchand. I shared a dressing room with her in an off-Broadway play years ago. And she taught me the wisdom of not reading reviews. I remember there was a poor young man who worked in the theater, and he said to her shortly after we opened, “Oh wow, congratulations on thatNew York Timesreview.” It was a love letter like you couldn’t buy, this review that she got. And she just went off on this poor kid. He was so horrified and embarrassed and shocked. And she says, “Why the hell should I care what they think? Do I tell them how to do their job?” And she had a good point. But at the same time, as much as actors don’t like to admit it, critics do have a place, because they see absolutely everything. They’re not just your average audience member. I learned to not read reviews. Now, if somebody wants to stick a great review under my nose, I will definitely read it. After her successful stand-up special where she leaned into her real industry experiences, why is Deborah’s gut instinct to pander and revert back to material that isn’t true to who she is? Same way I found out when I first came to LA after doing nothing but stage for years: If you’re on a TV show, you’re there to sell the products, because that’s what pays for the show. That’s kind of a bitter pill to swallow at first for most actors, especially theater actors. But Deborah’s smart. She’s a good businesswoman; she knows that’s just part of the deal. I still think it’s really, really hard for her, because she’s not used to being told what to do and she writes her own material. But she’s going to do whatever it takes to make sure she’s not canceled. There is this push and pull between Deborah and Ava regarding artistic integrity vs. appealing to the masses—getting the numbers. Have you felt in any of your past projects like the art was overly compromised for the commerce aspect? I’ve always tried to be picky about what I’ve done, and I have been extraordinarily lucky, because most actors don’t have that luxury. And it is indeed a luxury in this business to not just say, “Well, I got to pay the rent. I got to take this job.” I was in that position one time—not that it got down to having to pay the rent, but I was married, I had a young child. I hadn’t been working for a little bit. I was committed to a pilot of a TV show. And for some reason, contractually, they were able to drag it out and keep us waiting. There was a long, long, long break where I really wasn’t allowed to take anything else. We were still committed to the show. I had discussed the role with the producers because I had some real reservations about it. And when they came back with the new rewrite, not only had they not addressed my issues, it seemed like they’d almost gone out of their way to do the opposite. And I thought, I can’t do this. I won’t be able to look at myself in the mirror. My child’s not going to end up starving on the street, so I’m going to have to politely move on. And I did. I’d never done that before, but I felt that I had committed to it for so long, I had done my duty. And it was the next day that my agent called and said thatNoah Hawleywanted me toaudition forFargo.I thought that was the universe telling me that I had done the right thing, that I had respected myself. What a great ending to that story. I know. That was one of my favorite jobs. In this episode, Deborah confronts Ava about being in a throuple. I always love seeing them interfere with each other’s personal lives, but it’s particularly delightful this season, as it’s one of their only interactions without a network-mandated HR rep present. Aren’t those HR scenes screamingly funny? Oh my God, [Michaela Watkins,who plays network HR rep Stacey] is great. You just go, Okay, I’m handing the scene over, because she’s going to steal it anyway. There are a lot of fun guest stars this season—Carol Burnett in last week’s episode, then Kristen Bell and Jimmy Kimmel this week. Three incredibly delightful human beings. I’d never met Kristen before—she’s just a doll. What can you say about Carol Burnett? I had worked with Carol very briefly years ago on a TV show [Hot in Cleveland]. I mean, who doesn’t admire and adore Carol Burnett? If I can be like her when I’m her age, I will be one lucky lady. Jimmy, of course, I’ve met, but I thought, How did they mine the nasty side of Jimmy Kimmel, which I don’t think exists? He’s such a great guy. It was so funny to see him do that turn. What was it like watching Julianne Nicholson, yourMare of Easttowncostar, transform into “Dance Mom”? Oh my God, isn’t she fab? She was having a blast. She said, “Nobody lets me play parts like this. People are going to go, Oh, she smiles?” She was just amazing. The only time I got to see it live was the little bit she does with Deborah on the show. Oh, and then of course when she comes in and auditions. But I don’t think I ever got to see the TikTok scene that they shot. It’s incredible to see her truly commit to the TikTok-style dancing. And like me, she has a teenager. She said when she first showed the dance to her daughter, her daughter went, “Oh God, no, don’t do that. That's not funny.” But then she just got over it and said it was kind of cool. Then pretty soon the two of them were doing it together. In her rebrand, Deborah really leans into what are thought of as daytime gimmicks. Why does late-night still feel like such a boys’ club, and daytime the spot where women actually get to host shows? Oh boy. Do you have a couple hours? I don’t know. It may be something that we never get over completely. Hannah would hate to hear me say this; I think there are inherent things that people are more comfortable hearing from men than from women. Lord, it may even come down to a subconscious reaction of a woman doing a show at 11:30 at night: “Well, why isn’t she home with her kids?” Even if you don’t think that consciously, you know what I mean? There’s also a feeling that no matter what Deborah does, she was set up to fail—and may have only gotten the showbecauselate night as a medium is arguably in its last gasps. Is there a part of Deborah that recognizes this? Well, I think that’s shocking and disheartening to her when she’s basically told that byHelen Hunt’s character. She’s sort of just ignoring all that because she’s wanted [late night] for too long. She doesn’t have anything else to wish for. It’s like, Who am I if not bitter and angry about that and about my ex-husband? It’s so much a part of her identity. She doesn’t even know how to feel about herself without that. Paul referred to it as her white whale. And it could almost end up destroying her. It’s kind of like, be careful what you wish for. This episode is very much about outside validation and how it can impact the creative process. You’ve won many accolades for your performance. I won’t ask if it gets old winning— [Smart shakes her head and mouths “No” with a smile.] But does each win feel different, in the same way each season feels a bit distinct? A little bit, yes. And you’re right, because the overall tone of the show is similar, but there’s definitely thematic differences in each year. It’s the cherry on top oftheTom Cruisecoconut cake. No, it never gets old, being honored by your industry. Earlier this year, in the aftermath of the LA fires, youurgedTV networks to “seriously consider” not airing any award shows and instead donating the revenue to first responders and fire victims. How do you think the awards shows landed? Well, one of the shows was postponed for quite a while. Some time went by where people were able to understand that [awards shows] employ so many people. I actually said not that the shows shouldn’t be done and that people should not have their work recognized, but that they didn’t need to air them. Because they would still be employing almost the same number of people by putting on the shows, but not necessarily airing them. Then, of course, somebody pointed out, “Well, yes, but if they air them, they’re going to get a lot of money from sponsors that could be donated.” And in essence, that is what happened. So it turned out to be a good thing. It was really moving to see that the season’s fourth episode, “I Love L.A.,” is dedicated to the city’s first responders. When Deborah’s LA mansionburned in Altadena, that was so shocking. It really brought it home, because we had just finished shooting there days before. I can see it so clearly—the beautiful fountain in the front, the beautiful roses in the backyard, the pond. To think of that beautiful house that had been there for almost 100 years and had never been touched by fire, I mean, it’s just shocking to think that’s gone. The creators have discussed afive-season planfor the show. With that in mind, what else do you want to explore with Deborah? I would like to sing one more time.Last timeI needed a lot of prep time. It was embarrassing, but it was fun. I would want a lot of warning. I’m actually going to start taking voice lessons next week, because I want to get my apparatus in shape for my Broadway play. And also, I want to see what happens with her relationship with Marty (Christopher McDonald). I’m very curious as to what they have in mind for him.

Maternal and child health centres under the Department of Health offer local children free vaccines, based on recommendations of the Centre for Health Protection’s scientific committee on vaccine preventable diseases. The jabs, such as ones against hepatitis B, pneumococcal infection, and a four-in-one vaccine against whooping cough, polio, diphtheria and tetanus, provide protection against major infectious diseases. An infant will usually receive 14 doses of different vaccines by the time he or she is 18 months old under the service.

    "title": "Four months after wildfires, Kentucky Derby favorite Journalism embodies symbol of resilience",
    "article_text": "At 8:26 on the morning of Wednesday, January 8, a silver 53-foot, 18-wheeled horse transport van rolled up alongside Barn 59 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, seven miles due west of Pasadena and about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Workers efficiently loaded 15 horses in the care of thoroughbred trainer Michael McCarthy up a short ramp and into small travel stalls on the van. The process took just 25 minutes. At 8:51, driver Ysidro Cruz — everybody calls him Sid — slowly negotiated the hulking van off the backstretch to Baldwin Ave. and toward his final destination at the San Luis Rey Downs thoroughbred training center just north of San Diego. McCarthy also has stalls there, although unlike at Santa Anita, no parimutuel races are contested. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby Cruz took the I-210 Freeway west to the I-15 Freeway south before exiting on Route 76, a few miles from the end. The 107-mile trip took two hours and seven minutes, pretty good time in L.A. traffic on a weekday morning. (Kerrie Sahadi, the third-generation horse transport owner whose company, KC Horse Transport, moved McCarthy’s horses, provided the exact travel times from her GPS tracking database.) The horses were offloaded into McCarthy’s barn at San Luis Rey, and bedded down. “Nothing remarkable about the trip...,” Sahadi told me. And that is true. There was nothing remarkableabout the trip. It was what horses do every day in America and around the world: They get on vans and they travel from place to place for an array of functional reasons. To race, to rest, to retire. It is manifestly ordinary. But the rest of that morning in Southern California, and the days and weeks that followed, were not ordinary; they were apocalyptic. In the evening before McCarthy’s (and others’) horses moved, a wildfire had started in the steep hills above and to the west of Santa Anita; eight hours earlier, a larger fire had exploded in Pacific Palisades, dominating cable news coverage and stretching emergency resources. By late night, the second fire was encroaching on residential areas and was ominously visible from the racetrack. Fed by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, it would become the Eaton Fire (for Eaton Canyon, where it started), the second-most destructive wildfire in California history, wiping out more than 9,000 structures, most in Altadena, and upending daily life for what is likely to be years. It would kill 18 people before containment. Many track employees stayed overnight on the grounds, not only to help oversee emergency operations but because many of their own homes were endangered. McCarthy’s family had left their Altadena home in the fire’s path and moved into a hotel, but McCarthy slept only fitfully and got up at 4 a.m. to check on his house before going to work. By early morning, as the van was loaded, the winds had ebbed slightly, but remained fierce. “A crazy wind,” says Sahadi. “And there were embers flying around.” There was a justifiable sense of uncertainty, and down some neural pathways from there, fear. Among the total of 17 horses (two on another van) that McCarthy sent away was a handsome and well-balanced three-year-old bay colt named Journalism. He had raced three times before the fire — losing a maiden six-furlong race that was too short for his long stride and big body, breaking his maiden at a mile on Nov. 17, and then just 27 days later, winning the 1 1/16-mile Los Alamos Futurity by a widening and dominant 3 1/2 lengths. It is a weary narrative tool to explain a successful racehorse’s story as a “journey.” Where he was born (and who were his parents), where he was sold and then taught to run, where he landed in the sprawling ecosystem of the sport, and under whose ownership and in what trainer’s hands. We do this in large part because horses cannot tell their own stories. Today, Journalism is the favorite to win Saturday’s 151st Kentucky Derby, to the extent that any horse can be favored to win a 20-horse rodeo witnessed by more than 150,000 raucous partygoers at a distance of 1 1/4 miles, which none of them have run previously and most will never run again. The longer view: Journalism was moved from his home in the midst of a natural disaster, and then returned, just as tens of thousands of Californians hope to do. As North Carolinians and Floridians are still doing from hurricanes and their side effects. Journalism has plowed through disruption, as millions of Americans attempt to do every day in these disquieting times of ours. His name is symbolic of that disruption, a once-trusted institution, splintered. Hisjourney is our journey. On a mid-April morning, I drove my rental car north out of downtown Pasadena on Lake Ave., across the border into Altadena and up into the hillside streets most damaged by the Eaton Fire. It is part of small-j journalism to observe the detritus of tragedy where possible and to not accept others’ descriptions of painful landscapes. It can be unpleasant work, tinged with guilt from voyeuristically co-opting pain. In January of 2007, I rode with New Orleans Saints’ quarterback Drew Brees through the city’s Lower Ninth Ward, which had been disproportionately punished by Hurricane Katrina. Six years later, in May of 2013, I spent a week in Moore, Oklahoma, with members of a high school football team after an F5 tornado leveled many of their neighborhoods. It’s not possible to experience what took place, but it’s important to see it. So it is in Altadena today. Many streets are, as Michael McCarthy said to me, “just chimneys.” Chimneys and foundations. And melted cars. The destruction goes on until blocks turn into miles, each empty parcel representing a family or some other collection of humans. Inexplicably, the carnage is intermittently paused by a home that was seemingly untouched, as if the fire hiccupped. Work crews are everywhere, and will be for a very long time. Amid the rubble, trees have blossomed in vibrant shades of green, insisting. From the grandstand at Santa Anita, mountains stretch horizontally across the field of vision; the areas toward Altadena and Sierra Madre, recently brown and black, are now dotted with green spots. That is vegetation, not residences. But life. McCarthy’s home survived, although many nearby did not. It will be at least late summer before McCarthy, 54, and his wife and teenaged daughter, can return. And of course, even then, it won’t be the same. It won’t ever be the same. McCarthy was raised in Altadena, and after more than a decade living the successful but itinerant life of a trainer, he came back and started his own operation in 2014. As we stood outside his barn and talked, and then walked to the track and talked some more, he pointed in one direction and then another, and another. “My parents live across the street over there,” he said. “My in-laws’ house backs up to the turf course. We’re over there on the hill.” He could hear race calls from his childhood yard. His middle school friends were the sons and daughters of horse trainers, so there he went, from mucking stalls and hot walking, on up the ladder until he was a trusted assistant for Hall of Famer and two-time Derby winner Todd Pletcher. His life unfolds in the 24/7/365 rhythm of the racetrack, and now there is more with the aftermath of the fire. He is thankful that his home survived, but that brings challenges of its own, with severe smoke damage. He struggles with the contrary emotion that those who lost their homes entirely can find a fresher start. But he is also self-aware. When I characterize his situation as “Pain,” he corrects me: “Not pain, inconvenience.” These are degrees of massive upheaval; it will take time to work through it all. To the morning of Jan. 8: McCarthy remembers winds, still howling. “Eighty or 90 miles an hour.” His thoughts: “The horses were in their environment,” McCarthy said. “They were in the corner of their stalls, which is where they go when they know something is going on. Journalism was in the back right corner, which is his place. I felt like this was the safest place for them.” But? “I did put some horses on a van, mostly horses that were sitting on a race, to make sure we didn’t upset their routine. Journalism was one of those horses.” It was a strange time. I asked McCarthy if he feared the fire might make it all the way across the freeway and onto the track. “I didn’t,” McCarthy said. “From those mountains to right here is two-and-a-half miles, plus a huge fire break with the 210 Freeway.” Pause. “But things happen,” he said. “Is it possible for a fire to get here? I don’t want to find out. But we’ve got wells, and sprinklers. But really, I don’t want to find out.” Journalism spent four days at San Luis Rey. It is another layer to this story that the eventual Kentucky Derby favorite was sent from one place upended by fire to another. On Dec. 7, 2017, the Lilac Fire in North San Diego County tore through San Luis Rey Downs and killed 46 horses, severely burned trainers Martine Bellocq and Joe Herrick and left many other deep scars. (To know more about that event, please read the Eclipse Award-winningstorymy friend, Bryce Miller, wrote two years after the fire. Bryce died of cancer last March at age 56. Apologies for that detour, but this is a story about living with and moving past all kinds of pain.) On January 12, Journalism came back to Santa Anita. Sahadi remembers both his departure and his return. “He travels like a champ,” she said. “Loads, unloads, he leads us. No problem, like he’s saying, ‘I’ll walk right on there for you.’ Some horses are fearful. Not him. All business.” McCarthy said, “He came home and fell right back into his routine. No problem.” Journalism is the son of two-time Horse of the Year Curlin, who McCarthy helped Pletcher defeat in the 2007 Belmont Stakes with the filly Rags to Riches; and of a mare, Mopotism, sired by Uncle Mo, a Pletcher colt who was scratched from the field on the day before the 2011 Kentucky Derby. McCarthy was there for that, too. The human side of racing can sometimes seem as familial as the equine piece. Journalism came back to the races this year on the first day of March and won the San Felipe Stakes by 1 3/4 lengths; the third-place finisher was Rodriguez, the Bob Baffert-trained colt who went on to win the Wood Memorial prep race, and would have been among the Derby contenders had he not been scratched Thursday afternoon. McCarthy’s home survived, although many nearby did not. It will be at least late summer before McCarthy, 54, and his wife and teenaged daughter, can return. And of course, even then, it won’t be the same. It won’t ever be the same. McCarthy was raised in Altadena, and after more than a decade living the successful but itinerant life of a trainer, he came back and started his own operation in 2014. As we stood outside his barn and talked, and then walked to the track and talked some more, he pointed in one direction and then another, and another. “My parents live across the street over there,” he said. “My in-laws’ house backs up to the turf course.

He is thankful that his home survived, but that brings challenges of its own, with severe smoke damage. He struggles with the contrary emotion that those who lost their homes entirely can find a fresher start. But he is also self-aware. When I characterize his situation as “Pain,” he corrects me: “Not pain, inconvenience.” These are degrees of massive upheaval; it will take time to work through it all. To the morning of Jan. 8: McCarthy remembers winds, still howling. “Eighty or 90 miles an hour.” His thoughts: “The horses were in their environment,” McCarthy said. “They were in the corner of their stalls, which is where they go when they know something is going on. Journalism was in the back right corner, which is his place. I felt like this was the safest place for them.” But? “I did put some horses on a van, mostly horses that were sitting on a race, to make sure we didn’t upset their routine. Journalism was one of those horses.” It was a strange time. I asked McCarthy if he feared the fire might make it all the way across the freeway and onto the track. “I didn’t,” McCarthy said. “From those mountains to right here is two-and-a-half miles, plus a huge fire break with the 210 Freeway.” Pause. “But things happen,” he said. “Is it possible for a fire to get here? I don’t want to find out. But we’ve got wells, and sprinklers. But really, I don’t want to find out.” Journalism spent four days at San Luis Rey. It is another layer to this story that the eventual Kentucky Derby favorite was sent from one place upended by fire to another. On Dec. 7, 2017, the Lilac Fire in North San Diego County tore through San Luis Rey Downs and killed 46 horses, severely burned trainers Martine Bellocq and Joe Herrick and left many other deep scars. (To know more about that event, please read the Eclipse Award-winningstorymy friend, Bryce Miller, wrote two years after the fire. Bryce died of cancer last March at age 56. Apologies for that detour, but this is a story about living with and moving past all kinds of pain.) On January 12, Journalism came back to Santa Anita. Sahadi remembers both his departure and his return. “He travels like a champ,” she said. “Loads, unloads, he leads us. No problem, like he’s saying, ‘I’ll walk right on there for you.’ Some horses are fearful. Not him. All business.” McCarthy said, “He came home and fell right back into his routine. No problem.” Journalism is the son of two-time Horse of the Year Curlin, who McCarthy helped Pletcher defeat in the 2007 Belmont Stakes with the filly Rags to Riches; and of a mare, Mopotism, sired by Uncle Mo, a Pletcher colt who was scratched from the field on the day before the 2011 Kentucky Derby. McCarthy was there for that, too. The human side of racing can sometimes seem as familial as the equine piece. Journalism came back to the races this year on the first day of March and won the San Felipe Stakes by 1 3/4 lengths; the third-place finisher was Rodriguez, the Bob Baffert-trained colt who went on to win the Wood Memorial prep race, and would have been among the Derby contenders had he not been scratched Thursday afternoon. In the April 5 Santa Anita Derby, California’s premier Derby prep race, Journalism was twice cut off by other horses in the running of the race, incidents that would discourage many horses, and went on to win. It was harrowing, but instructive. “Love that he overcame that adversity,” said McCarthy. “He just doesn’t get discouraged.”Metaphor alert.And this: Both prep races were run at Santa Anita, against the backdrop of burned mountains in the nascent stages of recovery. Now we’re standing in Journalism’s stall No. 40, McCarthy near the colt’s nose, which is pressed against the wooden barrier at the back of the stall; and me, closer to the other end. Journalism stands 16 hands and nearly two inches tall at the base of his neck, where such measurements are taken. He is a big horse, an inch shorter than Secretariat (just for reference, calm down), but big does not always mean fast, and almost never means nimble. (But Journalism is verifiably fast and has shown he can recover from trouble, if not avoid it altogether.) Straw is gathered around Journalism’s feet like a blanket, nearly a foot deep. McCarthy, smitten, ticks off meaningful qualities. “Big powerful neck, sloping shoulder, thickness around the cannon bone, like a runner with big quads.” As McCarthy talks, Journalism shifts his right eye in our direction for reasons entirely unknown. We don’t know what he thinks. But we do know where he has been.",

    "title": "Steve Kornacki's guide to the Kentucky Derby: Biggest storylines, best bets",
    "article_text": "From a drama standpoint, the151st Kentucky Derbyhas a tough act to follow after last year’s three-way photo finish. But Saturday’s edition features an intriguing handicapping puzzle, with the possibility of a wild result and a nice payday for those who can figure it out. I’d love to be one of them, and while my track record makes me something far less than an authority on these matters, here are a few angles that I’m looking at. His name is Journalism and he towers above the field in at least one notable metric: speed figures. For every race that’s run across the country, each horse is assigned a Beyer speed rating, based on an algorithm designed to flatten out variances between different race lengths and track conditions. The higher the number, the better the horse. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby In one of the two key Kentucky Derby prep races he won in Southern California,Journalismposted a Beyer of 108, tops of anyone in this field. Having the best Beyer doesn’t automatically translate to victory, but notably in last year’s running, the top four finishers were all horses who came in with among the five highest Beyers in the field. The knock on Journalism? He put up those numbers against tiny fields — just four rivals in each of those races. In the Kentucky Derby he’ll be facing 19 foes and vastly more traffic than he’s ever had to contend with. On paper, there’s tons of early speed in this year’s Kentucky Derby — horses that want (or need) to be on the lead or just off of it to run their best. The problem with lots of speed is that these horses tend to push each other to go too fast, too soon, burning them all out and opening the door for a fresh-legged rival to mow them down in the stretch. Four of the five inside horses in this year’s race have the potential to flash early speed (Citizen Bull, Neoequos, American Promise and Admire Daytona). So do East Avenue and Owen Almighty, who will start farther out. That’s the recipe for a pace meltdown, and maybe even for someone to come from the clouds to win at a big price. Sandman and Sovereignty are the most highly touted deep closers in the field; Tiztastic, Burnham Square and Chunk of Gold will also be coming from far back and would all blow up the tote board. Follow the latest sports coverage fromNBC News and NBC Sports. Stream the Kentucky Derbylive on Peacock. The best-known trainer in horse racing, 72-year-old Bob Baffert, is making his return to Churchill Downs after a three-year ban. Officially, Baffert has won the race six times (a seventh winner, Medina Spirit, was later disqualified after the discovery of a medication violation, which triggered his suspension) and has the backing of some of the sport’s most ambitious and deep-pocketed owners. He typically boasts the deepest roster of Kentucky Derby prospects, though this year’s crop has underwhelmed a bit — at least so far. Baffert’s entry, Citizen Bull, might end up a decent price. He likes to be in front and could therefore be compromised if that hot pace develops. (Note: Baffert’s other entry, Rodriguez, was scratched late Thursday. He is also a speed horse, so his exit could boost Citizen Bull.) Citizen Bull has the added challenge of drawing the dreaded No. 1 post, jammed inside by the rail. The last horse to win from that spot was Ferdinand back in 1986. But dismiss Baffert’s duo at your own peril. Better than anyone, he knows how to win this race, even when the pace scenario looks unfavorable — something he once did at odds of 21-1 with War Emblem back in 2002. With Rodriguez scratching from the race, Baeza will now join the field from the far outside post. Don’t let his late entry fool you: This horse is a major contender. He ran against favorite Journalism in the Santa Anita Derby and put up a whale of a fight, losing by less than a length and posting an impressive 100 speed rating. Like Journalism, he figures to sit off the pace and potentially be in position to capitalize if the horses up front burn out. Japan is a relative newcomer to the international racing scene, and for a while, simply getting a horse into the Kentucky Derby field was considered a feat. But in the last few years, the Japanese program has blossomed, with Japan-based horses taking down major races in the Middle East and here in the U.S. Last year, Forever Young came within inches of becoming the first Japanese horse to win the Kentucky Derby, losing out in a three-way photo finish for the ages. This year, there are two Japanese runners, Admire Daytona and Luxor Cafe, who has bested Admire Daytona twice and seems the stronger of the two. But no one quite knows what to make of Luxor Cafe, who has done all of his racing in Japan, never facing any American horses. Video from his wins looks very impressive, but just how good were the horses he was beating? And will that form translate to the U.S.? Lonnie Briley was never supposed to be here. The folksy 72-year-old Louisianan has been training horses since 1991 and has had success, but mostly with cheap horses running for small prizes in racing’s backwaters. Until now. His horse, Coal Battle, may lack the regal breeding of his foes in this race, but that only makes what he’s achieved that much more impressive: an improbable four-race win streak over the fall and winter, from a small stakes at lowly Delta Downs to a triumph in the Grade 2 Rebel Stakes at venerable Oaklawn Park and a berth in the Kentucky Derby. It’s made him — by far — the most accomplished horse Briley has ever conditioned. Almost 15% of all of the purse money Briley’s horses have ever won, in fact, is from Coal Battle over the past few months. Before this, Briley had never come remotely close to the Kentucky Derby, and just by getting here he’s defied the odds. Coal Battle’s odds are long in this race (his speed figures are on the light side), but even his rival trainers will probably be smiling if he can pull this one off. I’m still torn as I type this. But I’ll be sharing it along with the rest of the NBC Sports team around 6:30 p.m. Saturday.",

    "title": "Macron accused of interfering in papal conclave – media",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to influence the upcoming papal conclave in favor of a French candidate to become the next Pope, several conservative Italian media outlets have claimed. The reports emerged following meetings between the French leader and several cardinal electors, as well as a leader of an influential Catholic movement ahead of the conclave set to determine Francis’ successor. Macron had lunch with four of the five cardinal electors of French descent, including Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille, last Saturday on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. The pontiff passed away on April 21. Last Friday, the French president also had dinner at a restaurant in Rome with Andrea Riccardi, the head of the Community of Sant’Egidio, a powerful Catholic association with more than 70,000 lay members in 74 countries, and which reportedly has clout over some members of the upcoming conclave. According to the Italian daily Il Tempo, the French leader asked the cardinals about ways to build a consensus around Aveline. The outlet called the cardinal – who is considered a contender to become the next Pope – an“ultra-European, anti-sovereignist”and“one of the most liberal”members of the conclave. The daily also described the meetings as an example of“interventionism worthy of a new Sun King,”in an apparent reference to France’s 17th century King Louis XIV, who sought to influence the election of a Pope through French cardinals. Another Italian paper, La Verita, directly accused Macron of seeking to choose the next Pope. The Elysee Palace did not officially comment on the agenda of the two meetings. The Community of Sant’Egidio denied the allegations, telling Le Monde on Thursday that Macron“seeks to understand the process, not influence it.” Conservative Italian media linked the president’s actions to his desire to regain international influence and mend ties with the Holy See, which reportedly soured under Pope Francis. These claims caught the attention of French news outlets, including Le Monde, which said their Italian colleagues were spreading“rumors,”reflecting the mutual distrust between Paris and Rome. A conclave involving 135 cardinals is set to convene at the Vatican on May 7 to elect the next Pope.",
