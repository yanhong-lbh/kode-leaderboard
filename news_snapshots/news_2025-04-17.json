    "article_text": "Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, discusses DOGE cuts and high-profile aviation accidents in the U.S. on ‘Fox News Live’ The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pointed out that only half of its D.C. headquarters is being used after the agency's building was added to a list of federal properties marked for sale by the Trump administration Thursday. HUD's headquarters became the first major federal agency building to be added to the General Services Administration's list of \"assets identified for accelerated disposition\" amid GOP efforts to slim down the government'sreal estate portfolioand potentially relocate agency headquarters outside the nation's capital. Simultaneously, Democrats have taken steps to block these efforts, including through the introduction of legislation in Congress. Last month, the GSA retracted a list of 440 \"non-core\" assets, including the HUD headquarters and more than a dozen other federal buildings it had initially listed for sale or disposal, according to the Federal News Network. The GSA subsequently posted a new list, but HUD is the first major executive agency headquarters to be included.

Highsmith/Buyenlarge/Getty Images) PresidentDonald Trumpcampaigned on relocating federal agencies outside the nation's capital in 2024 as part of his wider efforts to clean up waste, slim down the federal government and \"dismantle the deep state.\" Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order rescinding two prior executive actions put into effect under the Carter and Clinton administrations, which the president said in his directive \"prevented agencies from relocating to lower-cost facilities.\" Trump's directive also points out that by moving federal agencies closer to the people they are serving, rather than being centrally located in the nation's capital, it will help the departments more successfully carry out their missions. \"HUD’s focus is on creating a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability and purpose,\"HUD Secretary Scott Turnersaid Thursday. \"We’re committed to rightsizing government operations and ensuring our facilities support a culture of optimal performance and exceptional service as we collaborate with our partners at GSA to deliver results for the American people.\" HUD indicated Thursday the timeline and final location for the headquarters relocation is still being considered.(Getty Images; Fox News) SEN. DICK DURBIN: CLOSING FEDERAL OFFICES PUNISHES EVERYDAY AMERICANS HUD indicated Thursday the timeline and final location for the headquarters relocation were still being considered. But the agency did note that the Washington, D.C., metro area remains one of the top options under consideration. The HUD headquarters is located inside the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, which is in the Southwest part of D.C. According to HUD, the building is facing $500 million in \"deferred maintenance and modernization needs,\" which the agency said costs taxpayers more than $56 million annually in rent and operations expenditures.

    "article_text": "Veteran democratic strategist James Carville urges young progressives to get over their ‘moral superiority’ when looking for a potential romantic partner. Matchmakers near America’s capital say that liberals are refusing to date supporters of President Donald Trump, and are now wary of Tesla owners as well. Political polarization, particularly thatbetween young men and women,has become an internationally recognized phenomenon in recent years. One example from pop culture came last month when \"Love is Blind\" stars Sara Carton and Ben Mezzenga did not get married during the season finale because Carton had reservations about Mezzenga's religious and political viewpoints, including Black Lives Matter. Axios’ Mimi Montgomeryreportedthat political polarization is acutely felt in the Washington, D.C., area, as government officials and operatives of political parties look for love. ‘LOVE IS BLIND’ STAR SARA CARTON REJECTS BEN MEZZENGA AT THE ALTAR OVER VIEWS ON RELIGION, BLACK LIVES MATTER Trump supporters on dating apps are reportedly being more forthcoming about their political views than they were during Trump's first term.(IMAGN) \"It's just so polarizing,\" DMV-based matchmaker Susan Trombetti told Axios. \"It always has been, but it's on steroids now.\" One new aspect driving tension in the dating world is the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) laying off government workers inthe Washington, D.C., area. A new fixture in many dating app bios, D.C. singles reportedly told Axios, is \"Laid off by DOGE.\" D.C.-based matchmaker Kat Markiewicz spoke about current polarization, noting that many clients quickly declare they will never date someone from the opposite political before she can even ask. The problem has worsened with the new administration, particularly with Tesla founder Elon Musk’s involvement at DOGE. \"Four years ago, five years ago, I was hearing, 'Oh, I couldn't date a Trump supporter,'\" Markiewicz told Axios. \"Now it's like, 'I cannot date someone if they drive a Tesla.'\" OKCupid, a popular dating app known for analyzing trends among their users, gave Axios statistics confirming how thedating gamehas changed. The app’s representatives claimed that before last summer, 45% of the app’s users in D.C. said they wanted to match with a member of their own political party. That number rose to 51% after Trump was elected in November and then to 58% after Inauguration Day.

One DC resident reported seeing numerous photos on dating apps of people posing with the president or appearing in his Oval Office. \"It's interesting how the new administration has allowed people to feel more open about what they believe in this city,\" she said.

    "article_text": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams tells Fox News host Lara Trump what 'everyday New Yorkers' want on 'My View with Lara Trump.' Although New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced he's running for re-election as an independent, theincumbent told Fox Newsthe Democratic Party \"left\" him. During an interview on \"My View with Lara Trump\" airing Saturday, Adams explained he was focused on \"common sense\" ideas and fighting for what \"everyday New Yorkers want.\" \"People say, well, you know you left the Democratic Party — you know, the party left me,\" Adams said. \"I wanna talk about what working-class people believe, what they're feeling, and they're afraid, and we can't continue to be so philosophical and intellectual that we're talking over the heads of people who are afraid.\" NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS HE'S LEAVING DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION AS AN INDEPENDENT One of those \"common sense\" issues Adams is \"in alignment\" with New Yorkers on is immigration. New York Citywas one of many sanctuary cities that bore the brunt of the surge in illegal immigration under the Biden administration. Adams has taken heat for his handling of the crisis, but he was also a critic of the previous administration's immigration policies. As of February, there were \"fewer than 45,000 migrants in the city’s care, down from a high of 69,000 in January of 2024,\" according to Adams' office. New York City taxpayers have forked out potentially billions of dollars to pay for housing for more than 232,000 who have arrived inNew York Citysince the spring of 2022. \"That should not have been our problem, and it was, and it was extremely difficult to deal with it, but we did, and it's going to have a long-term impact on our city,\" Adams warned. NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS ADMITS THE DEEP STATE IS ‘REAL,’ CREDITS KASH PATEL'S BOOK FOR GETTING IT RIGHT Adams recently signed an executive order to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to return to its Rikers Island prison. The move, encouraged by the Trump administration, isfacing legal action from the Democrat-controlled city councilof New York City. The mayor defended ICE's return to Rikers during his interview withFox Newshost Lara Trump. \"I also respect the law, but areas where we can go after dangerous gang members that are incarcerated and the danger that they are producing onRikers Islandcan also spill into our community. I'm not apologizing for that, and I'm not going to ever relinquish my authority to keep New Yorkers safe,\" he said, adding that the far-Left's narrative around ICE is one of the party's \"big mistakes.\" Adams expressed his support for the Trump administration's approach to immigration and explained his willingness to work with the GOP executive is grounded in his \"respect\" for the office and his goal to \"produce\" results for New Yorkers. \"What we must do is what is happening, I believe, underthis [Trump] administration, we're securing our borders so cities don't have to deal with a federal problem that we're seeing in many of our major cities,\" Adams said. \"I respect the office. There's a president called President Trump. I'm going to work with that president to produce for the people of our city because I respect the office.\" To catch the rest of Adams' interview, tune in to \"My View with Lara Trump\" on Saturday, April 19, at 9 p.m. E.T.

    "article_text": "The family of accused killer Karmelo Anthony read a prepared statement from their attorney during a press conference Thursday. Anthony is charged with killing Austin Metcalf at a Texas track meet. Chaos unfolded during a press conference in Dallas Thursday afternoon as the spokesman for Karmelo Anthony's family took jabs at Austin Metcalf's father, who was escorted from the site of the event before it began. Anthony is accused of fatally stabbing fellow 17-year-old Austin Metcalf at an April 2 high school track meet inFrisco, Texas. Jeff Metcalf, Austin's father, attempted to attend the news conference Thursday led by Dominique Alexander, the head of the Next Generation Action Network, an activist group speaking on Anthony's behalf. Jeff Metcalf with his son, Austin Metcalf, a junior at Memorial High School in Frisco, who was allegedly stabbed in the chest by 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony, a student-athlete from Frisco Centennial High School.(Courtesy Jeff Metcalf) TEEN SUSPECT FREE ON BOND AFTER ALLEGEDLY STABBING TEXAS TRACK STAR AUSTIN METCALF TO DEATH Metcalf confirmed to Fox News Digital he was escorted from the event under the threat of criminal trespass charges. \"The preliminary investigation determined that one person was asked to leave the location and did so without incident,\" the Dallas Police Department told Fox News Digital. \"No offense was reported.\" Anthony is facing first-degree murder charges forallegedly stabbing Metcalf to deathduring a dispute under a tent at a track meet. He wasreleased from the Collin County Jailafter his bond was reduced from $1 million to $250,000. The news conference addressed more than $450,000 in GiveSendGo funds that have been donated to the Anthony family after his arrest and rumors the money was being spent improperly. The second focus was supposed to be Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, who read a statement on behalf of the family that was prepared by attorneys. Dominique Alexander of the Next Generation Action Network hosted a news conference on behalf of Karmelo Anthony's family Thursday, April 17.(Next Generation Action Network via Facebook) MOURNING MOTHER, TWIN BROTHER OF SLAIN TEXAS TEEN SPEAK OUT: ‘LOST MY BEST FRIEND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE’ But the event devolved into accusations of racism and bigotry, along with Alexander's admonishment of Jeff Metcalf before either topic was even discussed. \"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words — don't quote anybody — is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" Alexander said. \"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close,\" he said. \"We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss. Austin Metcalf’s father, Jeff Metcalf, previously told Fox News his \"life was destroyed\" by his son's killing.(Jeff Metcalf) GRIEVING TEXAS FATHER SPEAKS OUT AFTER SON WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET \"That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character,\" Alexander said. \"He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.\" Alexander said Jeff Metcalf wanted to focus on politics and bigotry. \"What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism,\" he said. \"We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case.\" Accused killer Karmelo Anthony, center, walks out of jail after posting bond.(KDFW) He then moved onto the issue of the online fundraiser. Alexander said none of the money from the GiveSendGo has been spent, and any suggestion otherwise is \"intentional disinformation.\" \"Let's be clear,\" he said. \"The family has not received one dime.\" Alexander then ranted about the Frisco Independent School District's plans to expel Anthony a month before graduation. He noted that Anthony has a 3.7 GPA, and that even if he didn't go to class for the rest of the year, he would still be able to graduate. THE STABBING DEATH OF AUSTIN METCALF DEVASTATED OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY, SAYS GREG WILLIS He also appeared to subtly shift blame for Metcalf's death from Anthony to the school district, intimating that the school should have canceled the April 2 track meet in the first place because of inclement weather. \"Because as a person who is the administrator of yet children, you are responsible for the safety of the children,\" he said. \"And so it seems as if Frisco ISD is trying to push this off by making [the decision to expel Anthony] that they do not have to make.\" Mugshot of Karmelo Anthony, left, and Austin Metcalf in football pads, right.(Fox DFW/Jeff Metcalf) \"While Frisco ISD cannot comment on an individual student's disciplinary record due to student privacy law, we can provide general information about district protocol andrelevant law,\" a spokesperson for the district told Fox News Digital. \"If the school recommends expulsion, which means the student is removed from school, the student is not allowed to go on any Frisco ISD property while the decision is being made,\" the spokesperson said. \"A meeting will be held where the student can share their side of the story and show any evidence. After the meeting, the district will decide whether to go through with the expulsion and will let the student and parents know.\" Before finally turning the conference over to Hayes, Alexander commented on Judge Angela Tucker, a Black Republican presiding over the case. \"But the ugly attacks on her just shows Black America that no matter what you pick in the ballot box — and that is your constitutional right — it's people out here reminding us of the Black struggle in America.\" Austin Metcalf, 17, was stabbed to death at a Texas track meet.(Jeff Metcalf) TEXAS TRACK MEET STABBING SUSPECT TOLD RESPONDING OFFICERS HE ‘DID IT’: DOCS An emotional Hayes spoke only briefly. \"Our family has been under attack,\" she said. \"Whatever you think, what happened between Karmelo and the Metcalf boy, my three younger children, my husband and I didn't do anything to deserve to be threatened, harassed and lied about.\" She said such lies have put her family in danger, along with the community and those involved in the investigation. \"Our address and my husband's previous employer's address has been put on all social media platforms,\" she said. \"My husband had to take a leave of absence because he's afraid of what may happen to our family.\" She said her husband's mental health is deteriorating, and her daughter is afraid to sleep in her own bed. Hayes echoed Alexander's sentiment that the GiveSendGo funds have not been used by the family at all. Karmelo Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, speaks at a press conference Thursday, April 17, 2025.(Next Generation Action Network via Facebook) After Hayes spoke, Alexander returned to the issue of race. \"Because these racist bigots try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, he should be afforded the same rights that Kyle Rittenhouse had, Daniel Penny and all the people who have claimed whatever their defense was – he should be afforded the same right,\" Alexander said. \"Nobody in the public media has one video, but we got the video of Kyle Rittenhouse with an AK-47 shooting three people in the back,\" he said. \"We got that, and he raised more than $2 million publicly, and nobody said anything about that.\" Jeff Metcalf previously toldFox News,\"I want to clarify something right off to start because I've already heard some rumors and gossip. This was not a race thing. This is not a political thing. \"Do not politicize this. It's not … this is a human being thing. This person made a bad choice and affected both his family and my family forever.\" Metcalf added that \"Austin was the light of my life.\" He said on \"America Reports\" that Austin died in the arms of his twin brother, Hunter, who desperately tried to stop the bleeding. \"They were so tight. They had the best bond. They were best friends,\" Metcalf said of the pair. \"And now I have to focus on taking care of Hunter.\" Metcalf also mentioned forgiveness. \"People ask me, how can you forgive this other person? I said I forgive the other person because the forgiveness is not for him. The forgiveness is for me so I can have peace,\" he said. \"His life is destroyed. My life is destroyed.\" Austin Metcalf, 16, died at a track meet after getting stabbed.(FOX DFW Chopper) Metcalf was killed after an altercation under a Memorial High School tent at the track meet. The arrest report from the incident said Anthony \"grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it\" and told Metcalf, \"Touch me and see what happens.\" In the next moment, a witness told police, Anthony \"reached into his bag and the male took a knife out of the bag and stabbed Austin.\" The witness told the officer Anthony fled after the stabbing. Metcalf died in his twin brother's arms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Anthony told theresponding school resource officer, who cuffed him upon arrival, he was protecting himself. The officer also noted blood on Anthony's left middle finger. One responding officer referred to Anthony as the alleged suspect. Anthony made a \"spontaneous statement,\" according to the report, saying, \"I'm not alleged, I did it.\" Anthony also asked the officers if Metcalf was \"going to be OK\" and asked if what happened could be considered \"self-defense,\" the report said.

    "title": "Supreme Court poised to make major decision that could set limits on the power of district judges",
    "article_text": "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, discusses the upcoming congressional hearings on national injunctions against the Trump administration on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ The Supreme Court has agreed to examine theTrump administration’schallenge to judges issuing nationwide injunctions, setting a date for a case that could have a major impact on the president’s ability to carry out his agenda as well as on the entire country. This comes after three federal judges issued separate nationwide injunctions blocking an executive order by President Donald Trumpending birthright citizenshipfor the children of illegal immigrants. On Thursday, the court consolidated the three cases into one and set oral arguments to examine the fundamental question of whether district judges can issue rulings that affect the entire country. The court will hear oral arguments for the case at 10 a.m. on May 15, which is about two weeks after the court normally stops hearing oral arguments ahead of its recess, which begins in July. SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE The Supreme Court has agreed to examine the Trump administration’s challenge to judges issuing nationwide injunctions, setting a date for a case that could have a major impact on the president’s ability to carry out his agenda as well as on the entire country.(Getty Images) Nationwide injunctions are court orders that prevent the federal government from implementing a policy or law that has a cascading effect impacting the entire country, not just the parties involved in the court case. Since Trump’s return to the Oval Office in January, his administration has facedhundreds of lawsuitstargeting his executive orders and actions, some of which have resulted in nationwide injunctions, stalling key portions of his agenda, including immigration enforcement.

(AP Photo/Amanda Andrade-Rhoades, File) In March, the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal asking theSupreme Court to narrowthree injunctions that were issued to halt Trump’s nullification of birthright citizenship. The emergency appeal requested the injunction only cover individuals directly impacted by the relevant courts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The administration’s acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued in the emergency appeal that nationwide injunctions have hit \"epidemic proportions\" under the second Trump administration, noting that the federal government faced 14 universal injunctions in the first three years of the Biden administration compared to 15 leveled against the Trump admin in one month alone. Beyond impacting the question of birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants, the court's ultimate decision will likely have the even larger impact of finally answering the limits of federal judges' power to decide questions of national and international policy.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. NBA legendKareem Abdul-Jabbar used his speech at the Los Angeles Dodgers' commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day to call out President Donald Trump’s policies. Robinson was honored, as always, Tuesday on the 78th anniversary of him breaking the color barrierin MLB. He did so with the Dodgers, who had a celebration for the late Robinson that involved Los Angeles Lakers great Abdul-Jabbar, who grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in New York. In between telling stories about getting into fights with New York Giants and Yankees fans as a kid, saying he always made sure his Dodgers hat wasn’t knocked off, Abdul-Jabbar also called out Trump for wanting to \"get rid of DEI,\" or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Former Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (left) and forward James Worthy attend a game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium.(Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports) \"I think it’s just a ruse to discriminate,\" Abdul-Jabbar told the crowd, viaThe New York Times. \"So, I’m glad that we do things like this, to let everybody in the country know what’s important. They also tried to get rid of Harriet Tubman. But that didn’t work. There was just uproar about that. But you have to take that into consideration when we think about what’s going on today.\" Trump issuedan executive order last month to terminate DEI offices, positions and programs within the federal government. It also terminated equity-related grants and contracts, among other orders. The White House provided a\"fact sheet\" for the executive order, saying it is \"restoring the values of individual dignity, hard work, and excellence.\" YANKEES STAY COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AMID MLB'S QUIET ROLLBACK OF DEI \"President Trump believes that hiring in all parts of government should be based solely on merit,\" the fact sheet from the White House said. The executive order, however, led to the scrubbing of many websites where DEI was involved, which included the Department of Defense website that highlighted Robinson’s military service. Abdul-Jabbar also brought up Tubman, whose page with the National Park Service had to be restored, just as Robinson’s with the Department of Defense. For Robinson, a story titled \"Sports Heroes Who Served: Baseball Great Jackie Robinson Was WWII Soldier,\" was taken down briefly before being restored. ESPN initially reported it was taken down, which led the media to pounce on the executive order. The DOD released a statement saying a group was instructed to flag any pages considered DEI content. They were only given a week to examine thousands of documents, and human error came into play due to the condensed timeline. Mistakes were made, including the flagging of Robinson’s article. Late MLB icon Jackie Robinson(Hulton Archive/Getty Images) \"Over the past few weeks, we've taken action to identify and archive DEI content from our websites and social media platforms,\" Sean Parnell, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said in a statement last month. \"Without question, this task was an arduous but incredibly important undertaking. We enforced an aggressive timeline for our DOD services and agencies to comb through a vast array of content, while ensuring that our force remains ready and lethal.\" But it wasn’t just federal. MLB removed references to diversity in its career page in the past month, according to the Times. Abdul-Jabbar believes what Robinson fought for in baseball is still being dealt with today. \"Jackie had an idea of what we had to confront,\" Abdul-Jabbar said. \"We had to confront segregation. And, in many ways, we’re still confronting it. But it’s worth it. And it certainly makes people respect us as a country when they see that there is some tension there, and good people are trying to do the right thing.\" The Dodgers were ridiculed by some for visiting Trump at the White House to celebrate their 2024 World Series victory. President Donald Trump speaks during a ceremony honoring the members of the 2024 World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the East Room at the White House.(Leah Millis/Reuters via Imagn Images) Manager Dave Roberts explained the team’s reasoning for going to the White House Tuesday. \"I don’t personally view it as talking out of both sides of our mouth,\" he said. \"I understand how people feel that way. But I do think that supporting our country, staying unified, aligned, is what I believe in personally. I just believe in doing things the right way, and I think people are going to have their opinions on what we did last week. \"But I do know that we all stand unified, and we all have different stories and backgrounds and economic, political beliefs. But I was proud that we all stood together.\" Roberts was also peppered with questions about Robinson, DEI and more before facing the Colorado Rockies Tuesday. \"This country needs a wake-up call,\" Roberts said. \"I kind of touched on it a little bit (during the remembrance). This is not a one-day situation. It’s Jackson Robinson’s day for breaking the color barrier, but this is like an everyday sort of mindset, appreciation.\" The Yankees remain committed to diversity and inclusion despite the national rollbacks of DEI programs.

    "article_text": "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses Democrats' 2026 midterm strategy on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan on Wednesday denied an emergency appeal by four Mexican nationalsfacing deportation. The request asked the court to temporarily block their removal so they could file a formal petition for review. Kagan denied the application without comment and did not refer the matter to her colleagues. The petitioners, Fabian Lagunas Espinoza, Maria Angelica Flores Ulloa and their two sons, were ordered to report to immigration officials on Thursday. Their legal team argued they face cartel violence if returned to Mexico. According to their court filing, the family fledGuerrero, Mexico, in 2021, after being threatened by the Los Rojos drug cartel. The petition stated that cartel members demanded the family vacate their home within 24 hours or be killed.

That ruling was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals in November 2023, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in February 2025.

The Trump administration announced sanctions against the International Bank of Yemen Y.S.C. (IBY) on Thursday for its financial support ofHouthi terrorists. Along with the bank, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning key leaders of IBY, like its Chairman of the Board of Directors Kamal Hussain Al Jebry; Executive General Manager Ahmed Thabit Noman Al-Absi and Deputy General Manager Abdulkader Ali Bazara. By sanctioning IBY, the U.S. hopes to stop Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. \"Financial institutions like IBY are critical to the Houthis’ efforts to access the international financial system and threaten both the region and international commerce,\" Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender said. \"Treasury remains committed to working with the internationally recognized government of Yemen to disrupt the Houthis’ ability to secure funds and procure key components for their destabilizing attacks.\" Based in Sana’a, Yemen, the IBY is controlled by theIran-backed Houthisand provides the group with access to the bank’s Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) network to make international financial transactions, the Treasury said.

    "title": "Letitia James reaps what she sows after leveling 'laughable' case at Trump: expert",
    "article_text": "New York City real estate attorney Pierre Debbas spoke to Fox Digital Thursday to discuss mortgage fraud allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James. TheTrump administration'scriminal referral targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James for reported mortgage fraud likely never would have unfolded if not for the Democrat's years of targeting the president in court, a New York City real estate attorney and expert told Fox News Digital. \"To be perfectly frank, this is a retaliatory case brought by the president for what the attorney general did to him over the last several years,\" New York City attorney Pierre Debbas, partner and founding member of real estate law firm Romer Debbas, told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview Thursday morning. \"Both cases, quite honestly, are very weak cases. \"The attorney general's case that was brought against Donald Trump was honestly a pure manipulation of the legal system, and it was laughable,\" he continued, referring to the civil fraud case she brought against Trump. \"Something that's never taken place in the history of New York that was isolated at one particular person for a politically driven purpose. \"Now, on the flip side, this serves the same purpose, right? This is the president's way of seeking retaliation against the attorney general for something that, in reality, is, while it's considered mortgage fraud, it's not criminal,\" he continued. \"And it's not something that would have been brought upon had the attorney general not pursued a similar case with low merit against the president a few years back.\" TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REFERS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FOR POSSIBLE PROSECUTION OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a news conference Sept. 21, 2022, in New York.(Brittainy Newman, File/The Associated Press ) The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice Monday arguing the attorney general appeared to have falsified mortgage records to obtain more favorable loans. At the heart of the case is a Norfolk, Virginia, home James purchased in 2023, which she identified on mortgage documents and a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac form as a property that would serve as her primary residence, according to the FHFA letter dated Monday. James is legally required tolive in New York asa statewide elected official in the Empire State, the letter adds. Identifying a home as a primary residence versus a secondary home or vacation home comes with financial incentives, Debbas explained, because banks will offer lower interest rates to primary residences, with homeowners less likely to default on such loans compared to a second home. \"As a real estate attorney, we represent every major lending institution in the country,\" he said. \"And a common underwriting requirement for banks is to solidify what the use of the property is going to be, meaning, is it a primary residence, second home or investment property.\"And the reason banks do that is that clearly there's a higher rate of default when it comes to investment properties and second homes as opposed to primary residences.\" The Trump administration's criminal referral targeting New York Attorney General Letitia James for reported mortgage fraud likely never would have unfolded if not for the Democrat's years of targeting the president in court, a New York City real estate attorney and expert told Fox News Digital.(Seth Wenig, Pool/The Associated Press) \"The reason being is people, you know, don't want to leave their homes,\" he said. \"Now, a second home investment property, you may be a little more inclined to throw the keys to the bank.\" COURT NAMES NEW JUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE BEFORE REASSIGNING PREVIOUS JUDGE HOURS LATER The bank then requires the borrower to sign an affidavit confirming that the home being acquired will be used as a primary residence, he explained. \"Now, if that is not the intent or that is in fact inaccurate, and you sign that agreement, you are in fact committing mortgage fraud,\" he said. \"And the bank relies on that agreement in giving you the loan. Now, would they have given you a loan if it were a second home? Potentially, but the difference is the interest rate would be significantly higher.\" The bank's recourse when discovering such mortgage fraud related to misidentifying a property as a primary residence to obtain more favorable loan terms is \"simply to call the loan,\" he said. State Attorney General Letitia James is a longtime political foe of President Donald Trump who campaigned for the attorney general job in 2018 by vowing to aggressively pursue legal charges against Trump if elected.(Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images) \"They would call the loan, force you to pay it off by a certain date,\" he said. \"If you're unable to sell the property or take other liquidity that you have to pay off the loan, they have the right to pursue a foreclosure action. They'd be legally granted this right. It would be very difficult to contest under those circumstances because, technically speaking, this is a default and this is fraud.\" TheNew York City real estate attorneyadded that this type of fraud is common. LONGTIME TRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES REVIEWING POSSIBLE INSIDER TRADING OVER PRESIDENT'S TARIFF PAUSE \"What extent is it fraud? To be quite honest with you, this is a very common thing that does take place in the real estate market,\" he said. \"I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying Letitia James … the full extent of the law shouldn't be applied to her. But it is something that takes place. Because if the loan is current, the bank hasn't really suffered any detriment, but it's still mortgage fraud. So that doesn't take away the fraud component to this.\" Debbas argued this type of fraud does not rise to the level of criminal activity because the bank can call the loan,take back the property or force it to be liquidated. \"The attorney general's case that was brought against Donald Trump was honestly a pure manipulation of the legal system, and it was laughable,\" New York City attorney Pierre Debbas said, referring to the civil fraud case she brought against Trump.(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) James' office toldThe New York Timesthat a separate loan application for the 2023 Norfolk, Virginia, home purchase reportedly indicated she would not live at the property full time, and that her mortgage agreement did not require her to occupy the property as her primary residence. James is a longtime political foe of Trump's who campaigned for the attorney general job in 2018 by vowing to aggressively pursue legal charges against Trump if elected, adding she'dexpose the \"con man\" afterher win that year. Her office leveled nearly 100 legal challenges against the first Trump administration and added after his second presidential win in 2024 that she would continue challenging him in the courts to \"defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.\" NY AG LETITIA JAMES SKEWERED FOR 'DISTASTEFUL' REMARKS AFTER TRUMP VICTORY: 'UTTER ARROGANCE' Most notably, James pursued a civil fraud case against Trump and the Trump Organization for inflating the values of properties to obtain more favorable loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions, which resulted in a $454 million judgment in 2024. A spokesperson for James' office told Fox Digital Thursday that \"multiple times during the attorney general’s trial against President Trump and the Trump Organization for years of financial fraud, President Trump’s attorneys repeatedly made the argument that the attorney general’s lawsuit was politically motivated. \"Every single time, the judge rejected that argument and even sanctioned the attorneys for making it,\" the spokesperson added. \"Attorney General James won her lawsuit, and the judgment against President Trump now exceeds half a billion dollars.\" Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley noted the irony of Trump's criminal referral over allegations of James fudging numbers to obtain more favorable loans after pursing Trump for something similar. \"This is a person who prosecuted Trump for everything short of ripping a label off a mattress, and among the charges that were brought in New York, in not just the civil but the criminal case, was making false or misleading statements to financial institutions,\" the legal scholar said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Tuesday. \"As for James, if we apply the Letitia James standard that she created, there'd be little question here. This seems pretty straightforward.\" The administration is looking into the allegations put forth by the FHFA while underscoring that \"no one is above the law,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said on Newsmax Wednesday. \"With the Democratic Party, they love to throw stones in glass homes when they realize that they're committing the crimes that they're actually trying to go against,\" Fields said. \"So, this is now a criminal referral that the Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi will have to look at,\" he added. \"The allegations from the FHFA are very serious. We're going to look at them, and no one is above the law. And Tish James, she'd like to say that about the president, but she should look in the mirror and realize that if you have skeletons in your closets about abusing the law and doing illegal things, maybe you shouldn't be purveying around like some justice queen, because you're not.\" NY AG LETITIA JAMES RESPONDS TO ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD The criminal referral also cited past reported issues with James' properties, including a 2001 purchase of a Brooklyn property. The certificate of occupancy lists the property as a five-unit residence, while James' mortgages list the property as four units. Debbas explained thatfive-unit propertiesare identified as commercial properties, which would require a commercial loan that has higher interest rates than a residential loan. However, the banks carry the burden of confirming whether a building is commercial or residential. \"If the borrower has the ability to tell the bank or convince the bank that it's actually four units, it's to their financial benefit,\" he said. \"Now, when you look at a certificate of occupancy, certificate of the occupancy is issued by the Department of Buildings, which tells you the legal use of the building. Letitia James' office leveled nearly 100 legal challenges against the first Trump administration and said after his second presidential win in 2024 she would continue challenging him in the courts to \"defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.\"(Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) \"This is a five-family dwelling,\" he said. \"Now, this is unequivocally a commercial property. The burden was on the bank to confirm this, but if the borrower did, in fact, have concrete knowledge … an argument can be made that mortgage fraud did take place in the application of this law.\" James’ office told The New York Times a rider attached to the Brooklyn mortgage stated the building was four units, not five. Debbas added that before the 2008 market crash, there was a lot of \"shadiness\" in the world of mortgages. \"As an elected official … there should be a heightened standard for honesty and obliging by your legal requirements not falsifying documents or committing fraud,\" Debbas said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While reflecting specifically on the Virginia home alleged mortgage fraud, he added, \"Now, how would this impact her seating as attorney general of the state of New York? At the end of the day, that's going to be determined largely based on how many enemies she's created. But from a purely mortgage standpoint, it is certainly mortgage fraud, but, in my opinion, it does not warrant any criminal activity.\" A spokesperson for James' office said Wednesday morning she has been \"focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution. She will not be intimidated by bullies — no matter who they are,\" Fox Digital previously reported.",

Francis offered words of encouragement and gifted inmates with a Rosary and pocket-sized Gospel, according toVatican News. \"I have always liked coming to prison on Holy Thursday to do the washing of the feet like Jesus,\"the pontiff said.\"This year, I cannot do it, but I want to be close to you.

PresidentDonald Trumpis the greatest challenge Canada is facing, Prime Minister Mark Carney said during a Wednesday night electoral debate with conservative challenger Pierre Poilievre. \"This election [is about] the question of who will succeed, and who will face up to Trump,\" Carney said in French, according to a Reuters translation. His comments came in retort to Poilievre, who moments prior, had accused him of being too similar toJustin Trudeau, who stepped down from the top job earlier this year following a rapid decline in approval ratings.

The most serious crisis of our lives,\" Carneyreportedly added. \"We have to react with strength, which will allow us to succeed with Trump.\" Carney, who was voted into the role by the governing Liberal Party last month in a landslide win, is believed to be thefavored candidate to winthe prime minister's seat in a nationwide election later this month, though recent polling suggests polling margins could be narrowing. Just prior to Trudeau’s exit, the Liberal Party was expected to take a nosedive in the federal election against Poiliervre’s Conservative Party – but Trump appears to have changed all that. Immense concern over a trade war with the U.S. and Trump’s threats to annexCanada as the 51st statehave rallied support once again for the Liberal Party under Carney. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.(Getty Images) HERE’S A CLOSER LOOK AT TRUMP’S TARIFF PLAN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DUTIES Reports suggest that Carney is now viewed as the candidate more equipped to take on the tough negotiations that Canada will face to ease the steep tariffs Trump implemented this year. Poilievre has also reportedly faced a drop in support for his Canada First message, which some reports suggest may be too similar a message to Trump’s America First agenda. The conservative candidate has also reportedly faced criticism within his own party for not responding fast enough to the threat posed by the U.S. president. Some reporting has suggested the race to be Canada’s next prime minister could be narrowing between Poilievre and Carney. Canadians concerned by cost-of-living tend to back Poilievere, according to aPolitico report, while voters concerned with the economy and relations with the U.S. tend to back Carney.

Carney’s background is in running first the Bank of Canada in 2008 and then the Bank of England in 2013 – prompting some to believe he may be best suited to take on the financial crisis looming over Canada amid Trump’s tariff war.

The buffer zones that Israel established along the Gaza border make up 30% of the strip,according to the Times of Israel. The outlet also reported that Israeli troops have been working to create the Morag Corridor, which would cut off the southern city of Rafah from Khan Younis.

A massive island-wide blackout hitPuerto Ricoon Wednesday as residents were looking ahead to the Easter weekend. A spokesman forLuma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power for the U.S. territory, told The Associated Press that all 1.4 million customers were affected, including the main international airport and several hospitals. At least 328,000 customers were without water. Power had only been restored for around 175,000 customers – or 12% – by Wednesday. Hotels were near capacity, with thousands of tourists celebrating Easter vacations on the island.Tourism officialsrushed to reassure them that many hotels and other businesses were operating with generators.

Jenniffer González, who cut her vacation short and flew back to Puerto Rico, wrote on X. \"I’m with you because the people of Puerto Rico deserve their officials to respond in times of crisis, and that’s why I’m here.\" It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, which is the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years. In December, another massive blackout left nearly 1.3 million in the dark as residents were beginning preparations to celebrate New Year’s Eve.

González also said that she has requested an in-depth investigation into the blackout, noting that officials have already warned there won't be enough generation of power for this summer, when demand peaks. \"Puerto Rico can't be the island where the power goes out all the time,\" González said. \"We're going to take action.

    "article_text": "Investigative video journalist Nick Shirley joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss his visit to the El Salvador mega prison where the Trump administration has sent alleged Venezuelan gang members. After visiting the controversial Salvadoran mega-prison known as theTerrorist Confinement Center (CECOT), freshman Congressman Riley Moore, R-W.Va., says he is \"even more determined\" to support the president’s efforts to secure the U.S. from criminal illegal aliens. This comes as theTrump administration’sscheme of sending the \"worst of the worst\" migrant gang members to CECOT has caused national controversy, with some outraged Democrats accusing President Donald Trump of\"kidnapping\"people for deportation. Moore said that while at CECOT he came face to face with some of the country’s \"most brutal criminals, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and terrorists,\" and \"extremely violent criminals recently deported from the U.S.\" After his visit to El Salvador, he said: \"I leave now even more determined to supportPresident Trump’sefforts to secure our homeland.\" 'MARYLAND MAN' KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA EXPOSED IN POLICE RECORDS AS 'VIOLENT' REPEAT WIFE BEATER Rep.

Riley Moore) Moore told Fox News Digital he visited the prison with a congressional delegation led by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo. The delegation toured the prison this week and spoke with several inmates. \"These are dangerous individuals,\" he said. \"We had several of them tell us, and they were not afraid to share it, [that] they are killers and committed homicides.\" \"It's not something that it seems that they regret one way or the other, from what I could glean from it,\" he explained. While touring the prison, Moore said he spoke with two deportees from the U.S., both of whom were originally from El Salvador and had been deported from Virginia and California. He said one had been in the U.S. for 20 years and was a high-ranking member of thebrutal gang MS-13. According to Moore, both deportees \"were not afraid to admit\" that they had killed people. TOM HOMAN 'DISGUSTED' BY DEM SENATOR'S TRIP TO BRING HOME ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBER Moore told Fox News Digital he visited the prison with a congressional delegation led by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith. The delegation toured the prison this week and spoke with several inmates. He said there is a lot of misinformation about the prison, leading the American public to believe that it is a kind of \"death camp\" for deportees. \"That is not true,\" he said, pointing out that of approximately 14,000 inmates in CECOT, only a few hundred were deported from theUnited States. CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE \"They are in austere conditions in that prison, there's no doubt about that,\" he explained, adding, \"to be clear, they don't have the death penalty in El Salvador.\" That being said, Moore said the impact of CECOT and SalvadoranPresident Nayib Bukele’scrackdown on gang crime has been \"miraculous\" for the people of El Salvador. BUKELE SAYS TRUMP HAS 350 MILLION AMERICANS TO 'LIBERATE' BY ENDING CRIME, TERRORISM While touring the prison, Moore said he spoke with two deportees from the U.S., both of whom were originally from El Salvador and had been deported from Virginia and California. He said that one who had been in the U.S. for 20 years was a high-ranking member of the brutal gang MS-13. According to Moore, both deportees \"were not afraid to admit\" that they had killed people. He said he spoke with ordinary people on the streets of El Salvador’s capital city, San Salvador, who told him that \"they were living in a terror state, being terrorized by these gangs and controlling their lives and taking their lives many times.\" Now, he said, \"they have their lives back.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That is why Moore’s resolve to support the Trump administration’s crackdown on gang terrorism is stronger than ever. \"It is very tragic that all of these young people have just thrown their lives away because they decided to basically not only destroy themselves, to destroy their own country and community and people's lives… It's hard to really wrap your mind around,\" he said. \"[But] the fundamental building block of any nation state is security.

    "title": "Supreme Court to hear oral arguments in birthright citizenship case",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Trump administration's hopes to change birthright citizenship amid some pushback on 'America Reports.' The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month in the case challenging PresidentDonald Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship, in what is likely to be one of the most highly anticipated cases to be reviewed by the high court since Trump took office. The justices said Thursday that they would hear arguments on the consolidated cases on May 15, roughly four weeks from now. The Trump administration in March asked the Supreme Courtto intervene and allow a narrow version of the president's executive order ending birthright citizenship to proceed. Trump signed the order on his first day in office and was immediately met with a flurry of lawsuits across the country. The administration's appeal concerns three nationwide injunctions brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. TRUMP ADMIN APPEALS RULING BLOCKING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor attend the inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images) All three states had issued nationwide injunctions blocking the birthright citizenship ban from taking force — a move that lawyers for the Trump administration argued in theirSupreme Court filingwas overly broad. Acting U.S. Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the justices to limit the scope of the rulings to cover only individuals directly impacted by the relevant courts. \"These cases — which involve challenges to the President's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship — raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" Harris wrote in their appeal. To date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it from taking effect.

The policy would have affected hundreds of thousands of children born in the U.S. each year. The order sought to reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Under the Trump administration’s proposed interpretation — later blocked by federal courts — children born to illegal immigrants or to those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright. More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups quickly sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and \"unprecedented.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The states have also argued that the 14th Amendment does, in fact, guarantee citizenship to persons born on U.S. soil and naturalized in the U.S. The U.S. is one of roughly 30 countries wherebirthright citizenshipapplies.

The Trump administrationplaced roughly 75% of full-time AmeriCorps employees on administrative leave on Wednesday as the administration looks to rebuild the Clinton-era volunteer agency from scratch, Fox News Digital learned. A total of 535 full-time AmeriCorps employees out of the agency's 700 staff were placed on leave, an administration official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday. Volunteers with AmeriCorps’ National Civilian Community Corps, a program that focuses specifically on volunteer opportunities for youth between the ages of 18–26, were preemptively pulled out of the field ahead of the Trump administration placing the agency's full-time staffers on leave Wednesday, Fox Digital learned. Roughly $250 million in AmeriCorps contracts have also been canceled. AmeriCorps is expected to remain in existence, according to the admin official, but the operations will essentially restart from scratch.

The agency has received roughly $1 billion in taxpayer funds every year, the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee previously found, but had failed eight consecutive audits across the past decade. \"Unfortunately, AmeriCorps has a long history of abusing taxpayer dollars,\" chair of the House subcommittee,Republican Utah Rep. Burgess Owens,said in a statement in December 2024. \"AmeriCorps is entrusted with over $1 billion of taxpayer funds every year, with the result of failure of eight consecutive audits,\" he continued. \"In 2023, the AmeriCorps Inspector General issued a 'Management Challenges' report detailing significant challenges AmeriCorps faces. This includes being unable to detect fraud. We have no real idea when AmeriCorps will be able to have a clean audit again.

The Biden administration proposed a budget of $1,342,093,000 for fiscal year 2025. The agency'sannual management reportfor fiscal year 2024 showed that it had $3.7 billion in assets, including over $1.5 billion in investments. Diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change initiatives have been a top priority for the volunteer-focused agency, with the 2024 annual management report identifying \"advancing racial and economic equity\" as one of its top priorities, Fox Digital found.

We can tell AmeriCorps to modernize and reform until we are blue in the face, but nothing will change unless we recognize the system is built on a flawed idea. It is time to admit that this is a failed program that needs a complete overhaul or elimination. It should be on DOGE’s chopping block.\"",

Conservatives are speaking out against the Trump administration’s plans to finally enact long-expected REAL ID laws in a bid to crack down on illegal immigration. \"If you think REAL ID is about election integrity, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. Someone has lied to you, or you’re engaged in wishful thinking. Please don’t shoot the messenger,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X earlier this week. Responding to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) SecretaryKristi Noem'svideo announcing the May 7 REAL ID deadline, the former vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin questionedin a lengthy post: \"Or what?? Evidently, existing ID requirements for American citizens just aren’t adequate now, so Big Brother is forcing us through more hoops for the ‘right’ to travel within our own country.\" Palin continued: \"Other administrations delayed this newfangled, burdensome REAL ID requirement.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., right, is critical of the Trump administration's REAL ID rollout.(AFP via Getty Images | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005, but the federal government has yet to implement it 20 years later. It requires all U.S. travelers to be REAL ID compliant when boarding domestic flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced last week that REAL ID would go into effect May 7, and that no other state-issued ID cards would be accepted forair travel. TSA senior official Adam Stahl said in the announcement that REAL ID \"bolsters safety by making fraudulent IDs harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.\" While an overwhelming majority of Republicans appear to have few issues with the change, some on the right have cried foul. Massie argued in an X post, \"As long as the pilot’s door is locked and no one has weapons, why do you care that someone who flies has government permission? REAL ID provides no benefit, yet presents a serious risk to freedom. If a person can’t be trusted to fly without weapons, why are they roaming free?\" REAL ID DEADLINE FOR TRAVELERS, SOME FEDERAL BUILDING ACCESS QUICKLY APPROACHING Massie targeted PresidentDonald Trumpmore directly in response to another X user who asked whether he was opposed simply because of his differences with the commander in chief.

    "article_text": "'Common Sense' Department: Bernie Sanders takes his billionaire-bashing tour to Coachella, because nothing says 'down with the rich' like $1,300 tickets and $75 nachos. A former Michigan public health official and Democratic candidate for governor entered the race for the state's open U.S. Senate seat on Thursday in what could be one of the most watched races in the2026 midterm elections. Abdul El-Sayed, 40, is the second Democrat to put his name in the running to replace Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, who is not seeking reelection. El-Sayed, a prominent figure in a movement that was highly critical of support for Israel in the 2024 election cycle, aims to set himself apart from the other Democratic candidates in the race to replace Peters, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. McMorrow has said she would vote against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., retaining his leadership position should she prevail in the primary and general election to represent the battleground state in the upper chamber of Congress. However, El-Sayed held back criticism of Schumer. \"Anybody who tells you that they’re going to unilaterally oppose one potential candidate without knowing who the alternative is, is either unnuanced or unsophisticated,\" El-Sayed told Politico. \"So I want to know who is available, who is actively seeking the leadership. I’ll make a decision from there.\" GRETCHEN WHITMER RIBBED ONLINE FOR SEEMING TO HIDE FACE IN OVAL OFFICE Michigan Democratic then-gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed campaigns with support from New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a rally on the campus of Wayne State University on July 28, 2018, in Detroit.(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images) \"What we need right now is somebody who’s willing to take the fight directly to Trump and Musk, but then also knows how to rebuild a version of our federal government that better serves working people after the carnage that Musk and Trump are going to leave behind, and I think I offer that,\" he told Politico. Other Democrats considering a run to replace Peters include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. El-Sayed was active in the\"uncommited movement,\"a group of anti-Israel, traditionally Democratic voters in Michigan, a critical swing state, who threatened to withhold support from then-President Joe Biden, and then then-Vice President Kamala Harris, over the administration's stance on Gaza. He did say he would back whoever was the eventual Democratic choice for the presidential ticket to oppose now-President Donald Trump, according to Politico. The Israel-Hamas war exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party last election cycle, and there is concern the conflict could again make for a messy Senate Democratic primary in Michigan if the American Israel Public Affairs Committee intervenes. The powerful pro-Israel lobby group financially backed Stevens in 2022, when redistricting forced a competitive primary run against fellow Democrat, Rep. Andy Levin. \"Everybody is unified around leadership that reminds the Democratic Party that we ought to be the party of peace and justice, that we ought not to be the party sending bombs and money to foreign militaries to drop bombs on other people’s kids in their schools and their hospitals, when our kids need more, our hospitals and schools need more, and we should be spending that money here at home,\" El-Sayed  told Politico. Abdul El-Sayed speaks during a coronavirus public health roundtable with presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday, March 9, 2020.(Erin Kirkland/Bloomberg via Getty Images) FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES SECOND STRAIGHT BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT-HELD SENATE SEAT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND El-Sayed ran for governor in 2018 as a progressive Democrat and was endorsed bySen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. He came in second in the Democratic primary, losing toGretchen Whitmerby more than 20 points and beating now-U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar by more than 12 points. Whitmer went on to win the general election and is in the midst of a second term. She cannot run again because of term limits. A resident of Ann Arbor, El-Sayed recently served as director of the Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services in Wayne County, home to Detroit. Before that, he was the public health director of the city after it declared bankruptcy in 2013. El-Sayed cautioned Democrats against learning the \"wrong lessons\" from their defeats.

Bernie Sanders participates in a coronavirus public health roundtable with healthcare professionals, including Abdul El-Sayed, left, as he campaigns on March 9, 2020, in Detroit.(Scott Olson/Getty Images) \"If you cut corners and trim your message, and you triangulate to the least common denominator, you can find something that’s perfectly inoffensive to everyone, and the problem with that is that you’re not actually saying anything,\" he told Politico. El-Sayed said he met with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Tuesday. He told Politico that it was his \"understanding\" that the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm would not get involved in the primary. If that happens, that deviates from how the DSCC previously acted to clear the field of potential primary candidates to make for an easier primary victory for then-Rep. Elissa Slotkin. Now-Sen. Slotkin, D-Mich., easily won the primary over Hill Harper, and then won the general election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP El-Sayed is also the second candidate this week to launch a campaign to replace Peters. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep.

    "title": "FLASHBACK: Liberals are fine with Harvard getting a tax break but were against it for a Christian college",
    "article_text": "'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Jeffrey Lax and Roger Severino discuss nationwide college protests and the Trump admin slashes over $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard. Democrats arenow defending elite universities like Harvard and Columbia from threats to their federal funding and tax-exempt status for allegedly violating public policy despite once championing the same legal precedent now being used against them. The left championed the 1983 Bob Jones University v. United States ruling, which upheld the IRS’ decision to revoke tax benefits froma religiouscollege that banned interracial dating. At the time, Democrats agreed with the federal government's argument that no institution engaging in discrimination should receive public funds, even on religious grounds. Now, as theTrump administrationcites that very precedent in urging the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status over claims the university is tolerating antisemitism and campus unrest, the left is accusing the administration of violating free speech laws to target ideological opponents. ‘SAFER WITHOUT HIM’: COLUMBIA STUDENT CLAIMS CLASSMATE ARRESTED BY ICE 'HATES AMERICA’ Democrats are defending elite universities like Harvard and Columbia from threats to their federal funding and tax-exempt status.(Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi) \"The Bob Jones case is a very strong precedent inthe government'scorner on this,\" Joe Bishop-Henchman, vice president of tax policy and litigation at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"The Bob Jones precedent makes it a hard case for Harvard to win. It'd be a lot easier if that case wasn't there, because I think they'll have to argue that they're being singled out, that this is politics,\" he said. \"If the administration can argue that it's a violation of public policy, then the Bob Jones precedent follows.\" Today, Bob Jones University, a Christian liberal arts college in Greenville, South Carolina, has a student body of more than 2,700. In 1983, it had policies banning interracial dating and marriage among students and expelled students who violated that policy. The IRS said that because of those racially discriminatory policies, the school did not qualify fortax-exempt status. TRUMP ADMIN ASKS IRS TO REVOKE HARVARD'S TAX-EXEMPT STATUS The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism.(AP Images) The school argued that revoking its tax-exempt status violated its religious freedom and that it was being punished for adhering to sincerely held beliefs. However, the government countered that it should not subsidize organizations—through tax breaks—that defy established public policy, particularly laws against racial discrimination. The Supreme Courtruled 8 to 1 in favor of the federal government in the landmark Reagan-era case. The justices determined the IRS was allowed to deny tax-exempt status to schools that practice racial discrimination since it was against public policy. Even though the school claimed religious freedom, fighting racial discrimination was a \"compelling government interest.\" \"That is the letter of what Bob Jones said, but maybe it shouldn't just be one university,\" Henchman said. A drone view shows anti-Israel protestors voluntarily packing up their encampment in the Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 14, 2024.(Reuters/Brian Snyder TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) The high court held that the institutions failed to provide the \"beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life\" required to receive special tax status supported by taxpayers, according to the judicial archive Oyez. Because of their bans on interracial relationships, the schools could not meet that standard. The justices concluded that racial discrimination in education conflicted with a \"fundamental national public policy.\" While acknowledging the schools’ religious beliefs, the Court found that the government may limit religious liberties when it is necessary to serve an \"overriding governmental interest,\" in this case, prohibiting racial discrimination. As the court noted, \"not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As such, the Trump administration argues that Harvard'shandling of antisemitismon campus should disqualify the university from keeping its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. The IRS is expected to make a final decision soon, according to a report from CNN, which first broke the story.

    "title": "Democrats’ vice chair ignites civil war, targeting 'asleep at the wheel' incumbents in primaries",
    "article_text": "Political strategist Tiffany Marie Brannon on President Donald Trump's Holy Week message and DNC Vice Chair David Hogg's plan to take down some fellow Democrats. A move by a top Democratic Party official to spend millions of dollars through his outside political group to primary-challenge some older Democrats in blue districts is further igniting intra-party tensions that have rocked the party since PresidentDonald Trump'sconvincing election last November. The reverberations started instantly after Leaders We Deserve, a political organization led by recently elected Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chairDavid Hogg, announced on Wednesday that it will spend $20 million to help elect younger Democrats. The effort includes supporting primary challengers to House Democrats in safe seats that Hogg argues \"are asleep at the wheel.\" The move by the 25-year-old Hogg, a survivor of the horrific shooting seven years ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in south Florida, to spend money against fellow Democrats is seen as an unprecedented action by a DNC official. FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOWCASES MASSIVE HAUL Democratic National Committee vice chair David Hogg is causing a stir in the party with his efforts to primary incumbents he believes are insufficiently progressive.(Reuters/Emily Elconin) \"There are strong opinions on both sides,\" a DNC voting member told Fox News Digital. The voting member, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely, said that \"behind the scenes, people are expressing their strong opinions towards each other. There's certainly not a consensus.\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S FAVORABLE RATINGS DROP TO HISTORIC LOWS DNC chair Ken Martin, who along with Hogg and other party officials, were elected to their positions at the beginning of February, praised Hogg in a statement but also spotlighted the DNC's longstanding position of staying neutral in primaries. \"David Hogg is a passionate advocate and we are grateful for his service to the Democratic Party, whether it be in his role as a DNC Vice Chair or in an outside capacity,\" Martin said in his statement. Newly elected Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin speaks after winning the vote at the Democratic National Committee Winter Meeting at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, on Feb. 1, 2025.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.) But Martin added, \"In order to ensure we are as effective as possible at electing Democrats to office, it is the DNC's longstanding position that primary voters — not the national party — determine their Democratic candidates for the general election.\" Those comments were echoed by another DNC voting member who asked to remain anonymous. \"David Hogg is a great activist who is inspiring young people and injecting enthusiasm into our political bloodstream, which is sorely needed,\" the committee member said. \"But he is also now an elected DNC vice chair, which means that he should not be getting into primaries,\" the DNC voting member cautioned. \"There is a reason that the DNC maintains neutrality, because we are the arbiters and the referees at the end of the day. You can’t be a referee and also pick a side because then you lose credibility.\" The move by Hogg comes as the party's base is angry, and very energized, in fighting back against Trump's sweeping and controversial moves, since returning to the White House three months ago, in upending the federal government and longstanding national policies. That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at Democrats many in the party's base feel haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president. CASH DASH: BERNIE SANDERS, AOC, AND OTHER LEADERS ON THE LEFT LEADING FIGHT AGAINST TRUMP SEE SURGE IN FUNDRAISING The energy has been evident at town halls this winter and early spring held by both Democratic and Republican members of Congress. And progressive champions Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have drawn very large crowds to their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" rallies across the country over the past six weeks. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., right, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., acknowledge the cheering crowd during a \"Fighting Oligarchy\" event in Los Angeles, Saturday, April 12, 2025.(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and other politicians who are leading the fight against Trump — including Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut — have seen a surge in their fundraising over the past three months. Another leader on the left who has been among those vocal in their resistance to the Trump administration, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview that \"we have to have a whole rebrand of the Democratic Party with a coherent platform and a future-oriented platform, and many leaders need to do that, new leaders, not the old guard. And I hope to be part of that.\" Khanna, who was interviewed on Tuesday, ahead of Hogg's news, added that \"we need Democrats speaking out, not just on the economy. We need them speaking out on civil liberties, on the rights of immigrants and on the rights of universities.\" While Democrats are increasingly energized to resist Trump, a slew of national polls earlier this year indicated the favorability ratings of the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. Hogg, in a series of social media posts, pointed to one of those polls as he explained his move. \"The party has hit an all-time low approval rating of 27%,\" Hogg wrote on X. And he argued that \"too many elected leaders in the Democratic Party are either unwilling or unable to meet the moment and are asleep at the wheel while Trump is demolishing the economy, challenging the foundations of our democracy, and creating new existential crises for our country by the day.\" Pointing to Democrats whom his group may target, Hogg said \"through all of this, some incumbents will rise to the challenge and emerge stronger. Others will demonstrate why they should be replaced. Either way, we all win. Especially when we are not challenging frontline Democratic incumbents — we all want the House back.\" A Democratic Party operative who works on campaigns and who asked to remain anonymous told Fox News Digital that \"this is unusual, but we do need some better Democrats in office and there's been a push to have a new generation come in and replace the 70- and-80-year-olds who have been in elective positions and shown that they're not up to the fight.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DNC vice chair David Hogg is critical of incumbent Democrats he sees as ‘asleep at the wheel’ in their opposition to President Donald Trump.(AP/IMAGN) Chris Moyer, a Democratic strategist and communicator who is a veteran of presidential and statewide campaigns, noted the timing of Hogg's move. \"It's all about how you break through, and the old ways of doing things have not worked. And this is an inflection point,\" Moyer said. \"So it's understandable that there's a desire to get some new blood into important roles and take the party in a more effective direction.\" But a DNC voting member who was granted anonymity to speak more freely said that \"because we are so close to winning the [House] majority, having that money spent picking up seats to win the majority is probably a better use of the funds.\"",

    "article_text": "Soldiers given false arrest records have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for years. President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say. EXCLUSIVE:Abipartisan group of lawmakersis joining forces to introduce a bill aimed at strengthening veteran suicide prevention programs. \"Too many veterans are dying by suicide every day, and we have to do more to prevent it,\" Rep. Greg Landsman, the Ohio Democrat leading the effort, told Fox News Digital. \"If we focus the VA resources on the most effective programs, we can make a significant impact in reducing these heartbreaking and entirely unacceptable rates of veteran suicide. Our veterans deserve the best care possible.\" The comments come as Landsman readies to introduce the \"What Works at Preventing Veteran Suicide Act,\" a bill that would require theU.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA)to establish new pilot and grant programs aimed at eliminating veteran suicide. The new legislation would aim to make the VA secretary responsible for \"setting clear and measurable objectives for funding and programs\" that would evaluate \"how effective those funding programs are\" in helping to prevent veteran suicide, according to a release about the bill provided to Fox News Digital.

Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., anothermilitary veteranlawmaker, added in comments to Fox News Digital. \"This bill ensures the VA is focused on proven, effective programs to combat veteran suicide. One veteran lost is one too many – we owe it to them to get this right.\" Veterans still account for a disproportionate share of the national suicide rate, according to the VA's most recentNational Veteran Suicide Prevention Report, released in December 2024. Analyzing dates from 2001 to 2022, with 2022 being the most recent year with available data, the report found that 6,407 of the 47,891 (13.3%) nationwide suicides were committed by veterans.

Sanders boarded the luxury Bombardier Challenger private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon, according to a photo captured by a source on the ground and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, whom the source also spotted boarding the private jet, spoke at their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" event in Bakersfield just hours earlier. Flight records revealthe jet landed at Sacramento Mather Airport on Tuesday evening, which is about a 20-minute drive to Folsom, California, where the self-identified Democratic socialists hosted their second rally of the day. The jet Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were seen boarding made stops in Salt Lake City and Boise prior to landing in Bakersfield, according to flight records. The arrival dates match the duo's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" events in Salt Lake City and Nampa, which is about a 25-minute drive from Boise Airport.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.(Fox News Digital) \"Champagne socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demand Americans surrender their pick-up trucks, air conditioning and meat from the luxe leather seats of their private jets that cost more per hour than most Americans earn in months. Their hypocrisy is staggering,\" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Ben Petersen said in a statement to Fox News Digital. BERNIE SANDERS COMPARES TRUMP, MUSK AND OTHER 'OLIGARCHS' TO 'HEROIN ADDICTS,' SAYS DRUG OF CHOICE IS 'GREED' The Bombardier Challenger private jet isoperated by Ventura Air Services, which touts \"one of the widest cabins of any business jet available today\" and provides \"superior cabin comfort for its passengers.\" According to their website, the private jet can cost up to $15,000 an hour. Sandershas long been ridiculedfor relying on luxury private planes while crisscrossing the country, warning Americans about climate change and the threats of billionaires seizing political power. Despite his Democratic socialist platform advocating for universal healthcare, the Green New Deal and ending wealth inequality, Sandersflying privatehas become infamous. Sanders' campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, spent over $221,000 chartering private jets during the first quarter of 2025, according toFederal Election Commission (FEC) filingsreviewed by Fox News Digital. The filing, which was released on Tuesday, shows that Sanders dropped the massive haul between three private jet companies: Ventura Jets, Cirrus Aviation Services and N-Jet. Sen.

A Fox News Digital review found that Sandersdished out almost $2 millionto Apollo Jets and the Advanced Aviation Team, a Virginia-based private jet company. Private jets have faced the ire of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's fellow climate activists. According to2021 Transport and Environment report, private jets are up to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes. \"For real, how many private jets do these CEOs need? It is insatiable. It is unacceptable,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in 2023, in one example of the New York congresswoman herself railing against private jets. Rep.

    "article_text": "'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants. The Trump administration on Wednesday asked afederal appeals courtto review a lower court order that threatened to hold officials in contempt over March 15 deportation flights – the latest flashpoint in a wave of immigration disputes playing out in federal courts nationwide. The emergency request came hours after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said he found probable cause that administration officials had violated court directives to return those flights. In his ruling, Boasberg threatened criminal contempt charges and directed the administration to submit additional declarations by April 23 explaining why such proceedings should not move forward. Boasberg said that if officials fail to submit the declarations, the court will consider holding further hearings and potentially refer the matter for prosecution. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? The Trump administration is appealing an order from Judge James E. Boasberg that could lead to administration officials being found in contempt.(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images) The Trump administration filed its appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday night. The Trump administration's brief appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court does not include any new details, as the facts of the case have already been heard by the district and appellate court. The appellate court last monthruled 2-1 to upholdBoasberg's temporary restraining order. The Supreme Court, however, ruled 5-4 last month that the Trump administration could resume its deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act, so long as individuals subject to removal under the law were given due process protections, and the opportunity to pursue habeas relief – or the ability to have their case heard by a U.S. court prior to their removal. Boasberg said Wednesday that the court found that the Trump administration had demonstrated a \"willful disregard\" for his March 15 emergency order, which temporarily halted all deportation flights to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, a1798 statute providingfor such deportations during \"a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion\" by a foreign nation. \"The Court ultimately determines that the Government's actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,\" Boasberg said Wednesday. Boasberg said he will give government officials the opportunity to propose \"other methods\" of coming into compliance, which he will evaluate.

The lack of information provided had sparked frustration from Boasberg, who described their compliance last month in a blistering order as \"woefully insufficient.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration, for its part, had argued in an earlier emergency appeal that Boasberg's actions amounted to a \"massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive’s authority to remove dangerous aliens,\" whom they alleged \"pose threats tothe American people.\" \"If you really believed everything you did that day was legal and would survive a court challenge, you would not have operated the way that you did,\" Boasberg told Ensign earlier this month.

    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses President Donald Trump’s possible 25% tariff on overseas medication and a new study on the relationship between Ozempic and dementia risk on ‘America Reports.’ The first generation that has been exposed consistently to digital technology has reached the age where symptoms of dementia tend to emerge. Some have claimed thatdigital technologycould negatively impact cognitive abilities, but researchers from Baylor University have discovered just the opposite. \"You can flip on the news on just about any day and you’ll see people talking about how technologies are harming us,\" said study co-author Michael Scullin in a press release. DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY \"People often use the terms ‘brain drain’ and ‘brain rot,’ and now ‘digital dementia’ is an emerging phrase. As researchers, we wanted to know if this was true,\" Scullin said. A new hypothesis termed \"digital dementia\" predicts that a lifetime of exposure to digital technology could negatively impact cognitive abilities.(iStock) The researchers analyzed past studies to determine the impact of technology onmental aging. Their findings, which were published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, suggest that digital technologies can actually preserve cognitive abilities. AMERICA'S SENIORS ARE VULNERABLE TO THESE DIGITAL THREATS, EXPERTS WARN For the meta-review, researchers analyzed more than 136 studies that included 400,000 adults, with an average of six years of follow-up data. The team concluded that the use of digital technology correlates with a 58% lower risk ofcognitive impairment, even after adjusting for gender, age and education level. Digital technology use correlates with a 58% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to the study.(iStock) One contributing factor, according to Scullin, could be the cognitive challenges thatolder adults facewhen interacting with technology. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"One of the first things that middle-aged and older adults were saying is that ‘I’m so frustrated by this computer. This is hard to learn,'\" he said in the release. \"That's actually a reflection of the cognitive challenge, which may be beneficial for the brain even if it doesn’t feel great in the moment.\" ALCOHOL LINKED TO BRAIN DAMAGE FOR HEAVY DRINKERS, STUDY FINDS Technology can be cognitively challenging because it is always changing, forcing users to learn and adapt, the researchers noted. This \"exercises\" the brain and helps keep it sharp. Because technology is always changing, it forces brains to adapt and become stronger, according to researchers involved in the study.(iStock) Dementia diagnoses often involve loss of ability to independently perform daily tasks, such astaking pills, keeping track of appointments and navigating directions, per the Alzheimer’s Research UK website. Digital tools like web calendars, phone reminders and navigation apps can allow for greater independence in older adults. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The study found that \"digital scaffolding\" – the process of using these tools to perform daily tasks – \"facilitates better functional outcomes in older adults while general cognitive functioning declines.\" One highly debated aspect of digital technology’seffect on our brainsis the use of social media, but according to the researchers, it’s not all bad. Researchers say one benefit of technology is the greater potential for social connection.(iStock) Another benefit of digital technology, according to experts, is the ability for aging adults to maintainsocial connections, which has been linked to a decreased dementia risk. \"Now you can connect with families across generations,\" Scullin said.

New data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed climbingautism ratesamong children. In 2022, a surveillance program called The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network began monitoring children aged 4 to 8 across 15 U.S. states, focusing on multiple benchmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Among 8-year-old children, researchers found that one in 31 children — more than 3% of America's kids — had ASD. BILL GATES LIKELY HAD AUTISM AS A CHILD, HE REVEALS: ‘WASN’T WIDELY UNDERSTOOD' ASD was found to be 3.4 times more likely in boys than girls, and the prevalence was lower among non-Hispanic White children. ASD prevalence among 8-year-olds was higher in 2022 than the previous year, the CDC reported.(iStock) The CDC confirmed that ASD prevalence among 8-year-olds was higher in 2022 than the previous year, asone in 36 kidswere diagnosed with autism in 2020.

Maine Gov.Janet Millsreleased a statement justifying the state's enabling of trans athletes in girls' sports on Wednesday after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state over the issue. Mills' response included a sentence that read, \"I have fought tirelessly for the rights of women and girls, for the health and well-being ofchildren and families.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Prominent GOP state representative Laurel Libby has spoken out against Mills for including mention of the sentence in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"Let me be clear, Governor Janet Mills’ claim that she has always stood up for the rights of women and girls in Maine is completely false. The Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Maine for refusing to comply with Title IX is proof of that, as it would not exist if she had. Her insistence that this issue has nothing to do with biological males in girls' sports is not only baseless—it’s absurd,\" Libby said. \"This isn't about states’ rights, as she claims; it’s about Governor Mills and Maine Democrats pushing far-left ideologies that ignore biological reality. By disregarding Title IX, they’ve discriminated against and endangered women and girls, and put Maine students and families at a disadvantage. Frankly, by promoting policies that erase the identities of women and girls in Maine, it’s hard to believe even Governor Mills believes what she’s saying.\" MAINE GOV JANET MILLS RESPONDS TO DOJ LAWSUIT AGAINST HER STATE OVER TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS Libby, who was at Wednesday's press conference where U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit, has been one of Mills' harshest critics over the last two months as the state has refused to comply with President Donald Trump's Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports executive order. After Trump signed the order on Feb. 5, Maine was one of the earliest states to show its intent not to comply with it. Libby brought attention to the state's ongoing trans inclusion policies when she made a social media post that identified a biologically male trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition for Greely High School in mid-February. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since the post, two federal agencies have launched investigations into the state. The Department of Agriculture has frozen funding to it, and now an official lawsuit by the DOJ has been filed. Maine has filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over the funding freeze and a federal judge has ruled the funding must be unfrozen. Meanwhile, Libby was censured by the Democrat majority in the Maine House of Representatives for her social media post on the premise that she identified a minor. Libby has since sued House Speaker Ryan Fecteau to have the censure overturned, arguing that the minor she identified had already been publicized in other media.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. WrestleMania 41will feature some of the best and brightest talent the WWE roster has to offer. Throughout the year,WWE starshave jockeyed to be in position to either headline WrestleMania or at least be on the card. There is no wrestling event like WrestleMania in the industry. WWE Chief Content Officer Paul Levesque made it clear after the Elimination Chamber that nothing was set for the main events, stressing the value of making the most of the television spots each competitor received. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM As the cards for each night of the event were put together and the main events were put into focus, some fans were disappointed about not seeing their favorites in Las Vegas. There will be plenty of time over the next year for those who didn’t get on the card to be there. Here are seven WWE stars who weren’t on the WrestleMania 41 card and should be on the WrestleMania 42 card in New Orleans. Chelsea Green during the Women’s Royal Rumble at WWE's Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis Feb. 1, 2025.(Joe Camporeale/Imagn Images) Chelsea Green may have been the most underrated performer of the 2024-25 season between WrestleMania 40 and 41. Green was close to winning the women’s Money in the Bank Ladder Match but took a huge bump through multiple tables, which allowed Tiffany Stratton to win. Green later became the first-ever women’s United States champion and has carried that into WrestleMania 41. She also may have the most underrated storyline going on \"Friday Night SmackDown\" with the Secret Hervice protecting her at all costs. She was not on the WrestleMania 41 card but should definitely be in the mix next year. WRESTLEMANIA 41 NIGHT 1 WILL FEATURE THE END OF SEVERAL EPIC FEUDS Roxanne Perez during the Women’s Royal Rumble at WWE's Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis Feb. 1, 2025.(Joe Camporeale/Imagn Images) Roxanne Perez’sseason ran from last year’s Stand & Deliver to this year’s Stand & Deliver event as NXT’s premium live event during WrestleMania weekend occurs before the first night. Perez defeated Lyra Valkyria to become the youngest two-time NXT women’s champion, and she did her best to keep the title around her waist all year long. Perez’s second title reign lasted 276 days, ending at New Year’s Evil against Giulia. But she saved her best performance for the Royal Rumble. Perez was the No. 2 entrant in the women’s Royal Rumble match and made it all the way to the end before eventually losing to Charlotte Flair. Perez will be on the Stand & Deliver countdown show this year, but her WrestleMania moment is coming very soon. Sami Zayn makes his entrance wearing a Johnny Gaudreau jersey during Monday Night RAW at the Scotiabank Saddledome Sept. 9, 2024, in Calgary, Canada.(WWE/Getty Images) Sami Zayn was an integral part of the Bloodline storyline going back to the buildup to WrestleMania 39, where he and Kevin Owens won tag team titles over the Usos. At WrestleMania 40, Zayn ended Gunther’s reign as intercontinental champion. But this year, Zayn doesn’t have a spot on the WrestleMania card. Zayn has been in the world title picture and had a bitter feud with Owens come to an end at Elimination Chamber. He’s been out of action since that match. But if there’s anyone who needs some rest and relaxation after putting in work, it would be Zayn. Could the 2025-26 season see Zayn finally win a world title in WWE? Only time will tell. WRESTLEMANIA 41 NIGHT 2 WILL SEE JOHN CENA TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY AGAINST CODY RHODES Chad Gable wrestles Sami Zayn during WWE's \"Monday Night RAW\" at Toyota Center March 11, 2024, in Houston.(Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images) Technically, Chad Gable isn’t on the WrestleMania 41 card. Despite allegations he’s El Grande Americano (along with the evidence against him), Rey Mysterio specifically challenged the luchador from theGulf of Americato a match. Gable turned heel this season, separating himself from Otis and Maxxine Dupri. He nearly won the WWE Speed Championship against Dragon Lee but couldn’t get the win. His talent has been largely praised, and he competed against Zayn for the intercontinental championship at Clash At The Castle. Surely, there will be room for Gable and El Grande Americano next year. Ray Fenix may have entered a WWE ring two months too late, or he would have been on the card along with Penta. Fenix is the latest luchador to take the WWE Universe by storm, and he’s been building a rivalry with the members of Legado del Fantasma. It will be interesting to see how his first few feuds play out and if the crowd will get behind him for a major push.

It was cool to see the buildup and the calls back to the late Bray Wyatt. Bo Dallas was spilling his soul to the WWE Universe each Monday, and then things came to a halt, reportedly due to injuries. Alexa Bliss made her stunning return to WWE during the women’s Royal Rumble and, in subsequent appearances on \"Friday Night SmackDown,\" it appeared the Wyatt Sicks were set for a return with Bliss being involved. But things came to a sudden stop after her Elimination Chamber appearance. Whatever the case may be, a healthy Wyatt Sick along with a healthy Bliss is what’s good for business.

I have personal commitments I’ve made not knowing what my future was going to look like after last year that are important to me.

One is we do it on a pretty regular basis. There will be activations at the airport, there are activations both outside and inside a number of properties on The Strip. \"You’ll just see it and feel it in a way that’s hard to replicate elsewhere and we’re just kind of built as a platform for these major events. Then, the fans come and WrestleMania takes over a city, too, you can feel the excitement, you feel the energy and it’s unlike you’ll see any other place.\" The atmosphere around the city is akin to Super Bowl week. Fans from all over have flocked to the city to see their favorite wrestlers perform on \"The Grandest Stage of Them All.\" All the excitement will eventually lead to the match for the Undisputed WWE Championship between Cody Rhodes and John Cena.

WRESTLEMANIA 41 NIGHT 2 WILL SEE JOHN CENA TRYING TO MAKE HISTORY AGAINST CODY RHODES Not to mention the countless number of independent wrestling shows that are taking place at several hotels and facilities across the city. The events don’t even scratch the surface of what’s to come for the entire weekend. \"We’re starting to feel that headed into this weekend,\" Hill said. \"I’ll point out that this is Easter weekend, which is typically not one of the busiest weekends in Las Vegas. Understandably, it’s often a weekend that’s spent with family and not necessarily here. And so, (WrestleMania) really elevates this weekend for us in a number of different ways. \"You’re starting to see marquee takeovers on The Strip. You’re starting to see the presence. We’ve got big WrestleMania belts on iconic figures at Caesars and the lion at the MGM Grand and those kind of things. So, you start to see those types of Super Bowl and Formula One feel as you’re just starting to walk around and that’s what really elevates the excitement.\" Hill told Fox News Digital he wasn’t really a pro wrestling fan growing up but has gotten more interested in it over the last year or so.

    "article_text": "Maine cross country high school athlete Cassie Carlisle breaks down her experience with biological males in women’s sports amid the Justice Department suing Maine for Title IX violations on ‘America Reports.’ Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey addressedthe lawsuitfiled against his state by the U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday over the state's stance regarding transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports. In an interview with CNN, Freydefended his state'scontinued support for trans inclusion, insisting that \"there are no issues of safety\" for letting biological males compete with girls. \"We’ve been working though to understand what, if any problem, exists with the participation. If some of the harms that are being alleged really are of some concern and what we’ve identified, there really are no concerns of safety,\" Frey said. Frey also said there are \"no concerns\" about trans athletes who are \"just choosing\" to compete in the girls' category. \"There are no concerns about individuals who are just choosing which gender they want to give themselves in order to participate. So that too is really after a lot to work on whether or not there’s any issue here that warrants this intrusion by the federal government on what’s going on in Maine schools,\" Frey said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM National awareness of trans athletes in Maine was ignited when state Rep. Laurel Libby identified a pole vault jumper who won a girls' competition for Greely High School after competing in the boys' category in previous seasons. Safety concerns over trans inclusion in girls' and women's sports were heightened nationally after former high school volleyball player Payton McNabb suffered a concussion, brain bleed and permanent whiplash after getting struck in the face with a volleyball hit by a trans athlete. Still, Frey insists that safety and competitive concerns are not on the radar of the Democratic officials in Maine, claiming they are only currently aware of two trans athletes competing in girls' sports in the state. \"There is just a small number of trans students who are participating in sports, that two number is all that we've come up with,\" Frey said. He also suggested that Maine is following both state and federal law by allowing trans inclusion in girls' sports. MAINE GOV JANET MILLS RESPONDS TO DOJ LAWSUIT AGAINST HER STATE OVER TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS \"Our position is that Title IX, consistent with the Maine Human Rights Act, so both federal and state law, supports that trans girls will be able to participate in high school sports consistent with their gender identity,\" Frey said. \"So my contention is Maine is following Title IX, Maine is following the Maine Human Rights Act.\" U.S. Attorney GeneralPam Bondiannounced the lawsuit at a press conference on Wednesday morning. Bondi said they were seeking an injunction and have titles returned to the girls who \"rightfully\" won competitions in which trans athletes participated in. The Justice Department accused the state of \"openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News. \"By prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine’s policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and psychological harm,\" the complaint added. The complaint also said the U.S. will seek \"judgment granting declaratory injunctive, and damages relief for Defendant’s violations of Title IX and the federal funding contracts it signed promising to comply with Title IX and its implementing regulations.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maine Gov. Janet Mills released a statement later on Wednesday in response to the lawsuit. \"Today is the latest, expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine to ignore the Constitution and abandon the rule of law. This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law. Federal Judge Woodcock's ruling of last Friday awarding the state a temporary restraining order reinforces our position that the federal government has been acting unlawfully,\" the statement readin part. Meanwhile, aschool districtin Maine is moving to comply with Trump instead of the state over the issue. The MSAD #70 School Board voted unanimously on Monday night to comply with Title IX, and Superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital that he will amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls' sports.

The Huskies knocked off the defending champion South Carolina Gamecocks to secure Bueckersfirst career NCAA title. On Sunday,sources confirmed to ESPNthat Bueckers was set to ink a three-year deal with the upstart Unrivaled, a professional women's 3-on-3 league.

    "article_text": "Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever are on a 6-1 run, with Clark seemingly running away with the Rookie of the Year award. Colin Cowherd and Nick Wright ask if the WNBA is doing enough to support Clark's rising stardom. Caitlin Clark was not included on Time Magazine's list of The100 Most Influential Peopleof 2025, which released Wednesday. Clark was left off the list despite the fact that the publication named her itsAthlete of the Yearfor 2024. Time also included other athletes on its \"Most Influential\" list on Wednesday, including fellow WNBA players Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier. The main premise of Stewart and Collier's place on the list is their recent launching of the \"Unrivaled\" women's basketball league as co-founders. Other athletes included on the list were U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, former women's tennis star Serena Williams, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback and Super Bowl LIX MVP Jalen Hurts and France's Olympic gold medalist swimmer Leon Marchand. Clark's absence from the list prompted questions and criticisms by fans and pundits. Fox Sports host Colin Cowherd brought awareness to the snub when with a rant during his show on Wednesday. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"That's idiotic! That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen!\" Cowherd said. \"That's a dumb list… she's the most influential athlete, I would argue, man or woman in America over the last year.\" Other social media users agreed with Cowherd's take. \"Clark is the main reason the league is so popular and she’s not on the list?\" one X user wrote. Another user asked, \"How...HOW is she left off this list[?] CRAZY!\" INSIDE CAITLIN CLARK'S IMPACT ON MEN'S BASKETBALL Caitlin Clark was not included on Time Magazine's list of The 100 Most Influential People of 2025.(Ron Hoskins/NBAE via Getty Images) Clark's influence on the popularity of women's basketball over the last year has been evident in various statistics. Clark made the Fever the most-watched team in the WNBA by a landslide inher rookie year, as the 14 most-watched WNBA games of the season all included the Fever. On top of that, she broke the record for most All-Star votes for any player in WNBA history. In early September, Clark’s Indiana Fever played in front of a TV audience of 1.26 million viewers in a game against the Minnesota Lynx that was played at the same time as a Week-1 Friday night NFL game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers. In Clark's first regular-season finale against the Washington Mystics on Sept. 19, the 20,711 fans that showed up at Capital One Arena set a new record for the highest-attended WNBA regular-season contest. Clark drew a WNBA record1.84 million viewers to her first playoff game against the Connecticut Sun on Sept. 22, while competing with an NFL Sunday. She followed it up with another record audience of 2.54 million viewers for Game 2.

The first game between the Aces and Liberty, a rematch of last year's WNBA finals between two of the league's most popular and successful teams, drew an audience of just 929,000, which was 50% less than the Fever's Game 1 against the Sun. Meanwhile, in women's college basketball, after Clark played in the first women's NCAA title game to get more viewers than the men's in 2024, the sport saw a steep decline in ratings this year. Without Clark in the tournament, the broadcasts of UConn vs. UCLA and South Carolina vs. Texas averaged just 3.9 million viewers for ESPN.

    "article_text": "Dr. Josef Wegner, Penn Museum curator who is based in Philadelphia, recently uncovered a groundbreaking discovery: an unknown pharaoh's tomb, dating back 3,600 years. (Credit: Josef Wegner for the Penn Museum) Archaeologists were perplexed by a strange pair of discs found in Oman – only to discover these items were actually a single 4,000-year-old instrument. The cymbals date to the third millennium B.C. They wereunearthed at a sitein modern-day Dahwa, Oman, located on the southeastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula in southwestern Asia. The scientists released their findings in an article entitled \"Bronze Age cymbals from Dahwa: Indus musical traditions in Oman,\" in the journal Antiquity on April 8. ANCIENT SETTLEMENT REVEALS REMAINS OF 1,800-YEAR-OLD DOG, BAFFLING EXPERTS: ‘PRESERVED QUITE WELL’ Historians uncovered the cymbals during an excavation of an ancient building in 2018, according to the article. The cymbals date back to somewhere between 2200 B.C. and 2000 B.C. Pictures show the cymbals as identical in size. Neither appear to have surface damage, which the study's authors said \"support[ed] the idea of a deliberate and careful deposition.\" Archaeologists found ancient cymbals in Oman. The excavation's findings were recently published.(iStock; Y. Al Rahbi via Antiquity/Cambridge.org) \"Both are circular, with an outer diameter of 138mm and an embossed middle (17mm deep and 76mm in diameter) that is perforated by a 4.2mm-diameter hole,\" the journal article says. \"The walls of the cymbals are thin, with a thickness of 1.5–2mm that increases slightly at the edges where it reaches 3mm.\" ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT Though well-preserved, the cymbals also experienced some degradation over the millennia. The greenish surface ofthe cymbalssuggests copper oxidation, and archaeologists noted that they became \"corroded together.\" \"Over the millennia of being buried in the ground, the cymbals became corroded together,\" the study said. \"When trying to separate the pair, two small fragments detached from one of the sides; one of these was submitted for chemical analysis using portable x-ray fluorescence.\" The cymbals may have been used in ancient rituals.(Antiquity/Cambridge.org) The authors added that general knowledge aboutancient musical instrumentsis hindered by \"poor preservation of perishable materials and the relative rarity of durable examples.\" The only ancient musical instruments that still survive tend to be made of metal or bone. \"These cymbals are the first of their kind to have been found in good archaeological contexts.\" \"Copper-alloy cymbals are among the relatively rare musical instruments recovered from Bronze Age contexts in the Near East,\" the study said. \"These percussive instruments are found from as early as the third millennium BCin Mesopotamiaand the Indus Valley, with Levantine examples appearing from the second millennium BC onward.\" A diagram shows copper oxidation on the surface of the cymbals.(Antiquity/Cambridge.org) But the slight degradation of the artifacts did not hamper the experts' excitement. Speaking to Archaeology magazine, the study's author, Khaled Douglas, described the cymbals as unique. \"These cymbals are the first of their kind to have been found in good archaeological contexts in Oman and are from a particularly early context that questions some of the assumptions [about] their origin and development,\" the archaeologist said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Historians believe the cymbals were used in rituals, such as during temple construction. But the study cautions that not much information is available at this point. The cymbals are roughly 4,000 years old, though they may date back as early as 4,200 years.(Y. Al Rahbi via Antiquity/Cambridge.org) \"Across the wider Near East, cymbals are consistently associated with ritual activity,\" the study said. \"[P]ending further studies, it is hypothesized that the Dahwa cymbals represent a similar connection between cult,music and dancing.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle Archaeologists plan to continue studying the artifacts in order to determine how they were used in social contexts. \"From their inception, cymbals appear to have been tied to ritual activity and temple settings and the discovery of the pair at Dahwa … suggests that music and musical instruments were important cultural components of inter-regional contact and co-operation around the Arabian Gulf,\" the journal article concludes.

    "article_text": "Travel expert Colleen Kelly shares the hottest travel destinations for this summer and provides tips for travelers planning a cruise. As you rush through busy terminals, juggling bags and boarding passes, your credit cards may be at risk, not just from pickpockets, but from digital thieves usinghigh-tech toolslike RFID (radio-frequency identification) skimmers. While today’s chip-enabled cards are more secure than old magnetic stripes, it’s still wise to take extra precautions, especially in crowded places like airports. Here's how to keep your cards protectedwhile traveling. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW A person holding a passport while traveling(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Before diving into how to protect yourself, it helps to understand the most common ways credit cards are compromised during travel. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET The good news is that protecting yourcredit cardswhile traveling doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. With a few smart habits and the right tools, you can avoid the most common threats and enjoy your trip with more peace of mind. Here are some easy ways to keep your cards safe while you're on the move. A man holding a credit card wallet(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. UsingRFID-blocking gearsuch as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans. Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,take only one or two credit cardsthat you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a password manager. This can be helpful if you need to cancel or replace a card while you’re abroad. Get more details aboutmy best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you’ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off. Public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels and cafés is rarely secure. Avoid entering credit card information or logging into banking websites while on these networks, unless you're using a virtual private network (VPN). A reliable VPN encrypts your internet traffic and protects your data from prying eyes on shared networks.For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE A woman using a mobile payment method(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) TOP 6 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A VPN WHEN YOU TRAVEL Before using an ATM or card reader, take a moment to inspect it.Skimming devicesare sometimes placed over the card slot or keypad. Gently wiggle the card reader or look for anything that seems loose, bulky or out of place. When possible, use ATMs inside banks or secure buildings instead of freestanding machines, which are easier for thieves to target. Many credit card apps now allow you to temporarily lock your card with a single tap. If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it’s locked, the transaction will be declined. Apple PayandGoogle Payprovide an additional level of security by creating unique, one-time-use codes for every transaction. Your actual card number is never shared with the retailer, which lowers the risk of your data being stolen. Mobile payments are also faster, touch-free and less vulnerable to physical theft. HOW TO STAY CONNECTED NO MATTER WHERE YOU TRAVEL IN THE WORLD DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH Traveling with credit cards doesn’t have to be stressful. With a few simple steps, like carrying only the cards you need, using RFID-blocking gear, enabling transaction alerts and avoiding public Wi-Fi without a VPN, you can reduce your risk of theft or fraud significantly. Digital tools like card-locking apps, mobile payments and identity monitoring services add even more layers of protection.

    "title": "What HBO's 'The Dark Money Game' won't tell you about the left",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Aishah Hasnie covers former president Joe Biden’s first major speech since leaving the White House. ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-host Charlie Hurt weighs in on Democratic backlash and what it means for the party’s future. \"The Dark Money Game\" – two new feature-length documentaries from Alex Gibney that debuted this week on HBO make it sound like the network’s initials stand for Helping Bernie on Oligarchy. Some leftist journalists and filmmakers have suggested Donald Trump represents the end of American democracy, but the bitterest socialists suggest democracy was ended by the Supreme Court in the 2010 Citizens United decision. To paraphrase a famous bank commercial, it’s apparently the worst decision in the history of decisions. Radical documentarian Gibney – dyspeptic enough that he told the Daily Beast in 2013 that Pope Benedict XVI was a \"criminal\" – made two films under the heading \"The Dark Money Case.\" They debuted this week on HBO. In the two documentaries, he uncorked a large conspiracy theory, that religious conservatives and rapacious corporate capitalists have overthrown democracy since 2010. This conspiracy was realized with the help of those evil conservatives at the Federalist Society. TIM DILLON SAYS REBRANDING OF CORE AMERICAN VALUES AS 'RIGHT-WING' IS THE 'CRAZIEST THING' HE'S EVER HEARD The first of the two Gibney documentaries, \"Ohio Confidential,\" is about a bribery scheme within the Republican Party, but to Gibney the \"corruption\" in Ohio included the passage of a pro-life bill. \"Flush with campaign cash from dark money donors, the anti-abortion side was all smiles, like a team that plays the game knowing the fix is in.\" All the journalism exposing dark money from George Soros or Reid Hoffman or Arabella Advisors or Act Blue is never going to get a minute on HBO. Ohio’s scandal is presented as a national scandal for the GOP.  But, any local scandal for the Democrats is never national. Gibney was inspired by leftist New Yorker writer Jane Mayer and her 2017 book \"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.\" She echoed the thought that a pro-life bill in Ohio represented \"private interests\" taking overpolitics. When the Left loses, the \"public interest\" loses. In ‘The Dark Money Game,’ Alex Gibney uncorks a large conspiracy theory, that religious conservatives and rapacious corporate capitalists have overthrown democracy since 2010.(Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Journalists should expose bribery when it happens in politics, of course, but Gibney and HBO proceed as if one side of the democracy is corrupt, and that \"dark money\" is somehow something that is never scandalous when employed on behalf of the Left. So, all the journalism exposing George Soros or Reid Hoffman or Arabella Advisors or Act Blue is never going to get a minute on HBO.Ohio’s scandalis presented as a national scandal for the GOP. But any local scandal for the Democrats is never national. 10 YEARS AFTER SUPREME COURT'S CITIZENS UNITED RULING, BIG CORPORATIONS HAVEN'T HIJACKED OUR ELECTIONS The second Gibney documentary, \"Wealth of the Wicked,\" focuses on the origin of theCitizens United case, how the McCain-Feingold \"campaign reform\" bill made it illegal for the group Citizens United to air ads for its film \"Hillary: The Movie\" within 60 days of an election. \"Campaign reform\" was designed to prevent conservatives from going around the liberal media elite with critical films about Democrats. Now they try to suppress that information as a \"misinformation\" offense. Mayer complained that in 90% of races, the candidate spending the most money is the winner.  \"And if you have so much more money than the other side has, you can completely drown out the other side.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The problem with an argument like this is that many House andSenate racesare not competitive. According to Ballotpedia, in 2024, 43 House and Senate candidates won an election by five percentage points or fewer, representing 9% of all congressional elections. Eighty candidates won an election by ten percentage points or fewer, representing 17% of all congressional elections. Candidates who aren’t expected to have a chance won’t get funded. Then there’s the umbrage about \"completely drowning out the other side.\" This is unintentionally hilarious, because these Gibney films for HBO always drown out the other side. In this case, Gibney offered \"conservatives\" like former pro-lifer Rob Schenck, who is now in favor of abortion. Hence, they are no longer conservatives. Schenck underlined the Gibney thesis: \"We have a little aphorism built on a Bible verse: ‘The wealth of the wicked is laid up for the righteous.’ So, yeah, let’s baptize the billionaires’ money. We can do that and it eventually brought together this alliance.\" The leftist critique of big money in politics, and their demands to somehow remove it, is utopian wishful thinking.  Trying to take money out of politics is like trying to take the bark out of dogs. It can’t be done. It’s especially near-sighted because it doesn’t acknowledge the centrality of TV advertising and the news media in campaigns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Left complains that speech is money, but leftist journalists can propagandize on HBO and that somehow doesn’t count as \"money in politics,\" which it certainly is. What’s the advertising equivalent of that kind of airtime? The Left doesn’t see it that way, because dominating the national discussion is what they define as democracy. \"Non-commercial\" non-capitalist media outlets likePBS and NPRpromote a lot of leftist messaging and drown out conservatives, which represents Gibney’s radical goal of \"taking the money out.\" But they’re taking the money out of conservative pockets and using it to smear them. That’s somehow the antonym of \"oligarchy.\" Documentaries like these imply the political system is unfair when conservatives win anything. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM",

    "title": "New study about IRS reveals just how much Trump tax cuts saved you",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump’s tax policy and more on ‘Special Report.’ In Washington, facts are often the first casualty of politics. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the debate over the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 — President Donald Trump’s signature tax reform law from his first term in office. As debates rage whether to extend the TCJA’s individual tax cuts, left-wing politicians and legacy media outlets are ramping up their usual misinformation campaign. We’ve all heard the talking points: The TCJA was a \"wealth transfer\" that came \"at the expense of working families,\" a \"giveaway to billionaires,\" or my personal favorite, a \"reverse Robin Hood\" scheme to rob the working class for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy. There’s just one problem: none of that is true. Not even close. TAX TIPS: LAST-MINUTE ADVICE FROM EXPERTS AS TAX DAY NEARS Earlier in April, I co-authored a new policy study for The Heartland Institute examining the latest IRS personal income tax data. Our goal was to determine if the Republican tax law is still saving taxpayers money, and if so, how much? Trump can point to the success of his tax-cut strategy in aiding the middle class, according to a new study. What we found is that lower- and middle-income Americans have received the largest tax breaks due to the TCJA — and these are not small amounts, either. We estimate tens of millions of filers have saved thousands of dollars because of the Republicans’ tax reform law, savings that are now at riskshould Congress fail to extendthe cuts before they expire at the end of 2025. The evidence is clear, compelling and impossible to ignore — unless you’re a partisan activist masquerading as a journalist. Using government data, we were able to calculatehow much in taxesthe average filer in each IRS income bracket paid annually from 2017 to 2022. TCJA was passed into law in 2017 but didn’t go into effect until 2018. By comparing the data from 2017 to later years, we can determine the effect of the tax cuts on individuals and families. The IRS data shows that every income bracket received a tax cut because of the TCJA, but the taxpayers who received the biggest cuts, in terms of percentage saved, went to those who earned less than $75,000. For example, the average filer in the IRS’s \"$40,000 under $50,000\" bracket paid 18.8% less in taxes in 2022 than they did in 2017. Similarly, the tax bill for filers in the \"$50,000 under $75,000\" bracket was 16.5% less in 2022 than it was in 2017. For comparison, those earning between $5 million and $10 million paid 2.3% less over the same period. So much for the \"billionaire tax cut\" narrative. (You can find data for other income brackets in our published paper, which is availablehere.) Some critics of the TCJA have claimed that although middle-income Americans received large cuts to their tax rates, those tax rate reductions didn’t amount to significant savings in terms of total dollars. But these assertions are also false. Many middle-class Americans have saved thousands because of the TCJA. A new analysis of IRS tax data indicates that everyone benefited from the Trump tax cuts, but those who earned less than $75,000 received a much-higher percentage of savings.(Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Our analysis found from 2018 to 2022, filers earning between $50,000 and $75,000 annually saved an average of $4,516 because of the personal tax cuts contained in the TCJA. For those in the $75,000 to $100,000 bracket, the savings jumped to $5,923. And those earning $100,000 to $200,000 saved an astonishing $9,638 over five years. These numbers do not tell the full story, however. Because the most recent IRS data available is from 2022, total savings estimates do not include the numbers from 2023 and 2024. To account for these years, we developed projected figures using the average amounts saved in 2018 to 2022. After extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive. In 2022, more than 50 million middle-class filers fell into brackets that saved on average between $6,322 and $13,494 in total savings. Even lower-income and working-class Americans saw substantial relief. We estimate that households making between $30,000 and $50,000 saved $2,537 to $3,833 over the same period. Ironically, the very law Democrats call a boon for the rich has made the U.S. tax code more progressive. We came to this conclusion by examining the tax burden paid by each IRS income bracket in 2017, the year before TCJA went into effect, compared to their burdens in subsequent years. What we found is that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, every income bracket earning less than $200,000 paid a smaller share of the total personal income tax burden than they did in 2017. Conversely, every bracket above $200,000 paid a greater share. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That means that although every income group received a tax cut because of the TCJA,the Trump tax cutscaused wealthier filers to pay for a bigger chunk of the personal tax revenue pie than they did in previous years, the exact opposite of what Democrats frequently claim. If Congress does nothing, the TCJA’s personal income tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025. That means tens of millions of Americans will face a stealth tax hike. For many middle-income families, it could mean paying $900 or more in taxes annually. After extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive. Washington elites might not feel it, but working families sure will. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That’s why this fight matters. This isn’t about President Donald Trump or partisan point-scoring — it’s about whether the government should take more from families already struggling under the weight of inflation and stagnant wages. The data is in. The verdict is clear. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked — for everyone, but especially for working-class and middle-income Americans. It’s time to tell the truth about the tax cuts, and then make them permanent.

    "title": "GREGG JARRETT: Trump’s deportation wins are a rebuke to scheming lawyers and activist judges",
    "article_text": "Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the DOJ responding to a Supreme Court ruling that the Trump administration must bring back a deported Maryland man. President Donald Trump ran on the promise to fix what his predecessor broke. That is a tall order, given the copious calamities thatJoe Bidenwrought. At the top of the list was shutting down our southern border.Donald Trumpaccomplished it with lightning speed, putting an obvious lie to Biden’s claim that it couldn’t be done by executive fiat. Americans cheered. Then, Trump kicked into overdrive another promise to deport those who are in the U.S. illegally, particularly violent criminals and terrorist gang members. Democrats sprinted to the federal courts to defend the indefensible – not because they like thugs and terrorists, but because they despise Trump. President Donald Trump and U.S. Judge James Boasberg(Getty Images) Their unscrupulous trick was to shop around until they found a liberal jurist to their liking. It worked like a charm. DEMOCRATS KNOW 'JUDGE SHOPPING' IS ANTI-DEMOCRATIC AND WRONG Activist judgeshanded out restraining orders and injunctions like Halloween treats. The Trump-hating media, myopic as usual, celebrated with reckless abandon. But the confetti parade they threw for themselves was fleeting. In short order, district court judges found themselves bedeviled by reversals for mangling the law and abusing their authority. It was all so predictable. And it won’t stop. Whenever another lawsuit pops up – sometimes daily – it forces Trump’s Justice Department to play an interminable game of \"wack-a-mole.\" For those trying to keep score, here are three of the most recent cases in this popular arcade attraction. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was in the U.S. illegally, picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and given a one-way ticket to El Salvador from whence he came. Despite an early statement by a since-sidelined DOJ lawyer that his deportation was an \"administrative error,\" evidence to the contrary has since emerged. SCOTUS MUST STOP LEFTIST JUDGES' LAWLESS SABOTAGE OF TRUMP AGENDA Compelling evidence exists that Garcia either is or was a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. According to Attorney General Pam Bondi, two different immigration courts in 2019 concurred but allowed him to stay conditionally. However, since that group is now aU.S.-designated terrorist organization, Garcia was subject to immediate arrest and expulsion. Any prior withholding order was nullified by the terror designation. Any dispute over Garcia’s gang status became irrelevant once he landed on Salvadoran soil. Why? Because reversing his deportation constitutes both a practical and a legal impossibility. Undeterred, if not unaware, federal District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to \"effectuate\" his return to the U.S. In doing so, she fails to comprehend that she has no jurisdiction over someone held in a foreign country inasmuch as she holds no power to tell a sovereign nation what to do. The U.S. Supreme Court weighed in, offering Xinis a basic law school tutorial by reminding her that under our constitutional framework the president dictates foreign policy, not judges. The high court instructed her to give \"due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\" It was a hint cloaked in a directive. Manifestly, the U.S. could attempt to exert some diplomacy to \"facilitate Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador,\" as the Supremes urged. But that is not the same thing as ordering his physical return to the U.S. The semantics are important, which the justices tried to subtly explain to Xinis, who nevertheless seems incurably obtuse. COURTROOM COUP: ENDING THE DISTRICT JUDGES' WAR ON PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY All of this is now moot. In his Monday meeting with Trump in the Oval Office,Salvadoran President Nayib Bukelemade it abundantly clear that he has no intention of releasing a suspected terrorist onto the streets of his country, much less returning him to the U.S. Without referring to Xinis by name, he mocked the delusion that a judge might have some say in the matter. In a court hearing on Tuesday, Xinis continued to push forward, seemingly resolved to keep chasing her own tail in a circle. If she is determined to treat the Constitution as a collection of recommendations and the justices as a mere advisory board, her errant decisions will once again land on the steps of the highest court. I doubt that the outcome next time will be so tepid. Mahmoud Khalil, a one-time graduate student and full-time Palestinian activist allegedly behind the violent protests at Columbia University, was arrested by ICE and is now being held in Louisiana pending deportation. Once again, his lawyers went \"judge shopping\" in New York but the wrongful maneuver forced the case to New Jersey, where Khalil was detained when his lawyers originally filed their habeas corpus petition (the right to challenge detention or deportation). DOES THE CONSTITUTION REALLY PROTECT COLUMBIA AGITATOR MAHMOUD KHALIL FROM DEPORTATION? Meanwhile, a Louisiana immigration judge ruled that the government can, indeed, deport Khalil. This was an easy decision. Green card holders like Khalil are defined under U.S. law as \"aliens.\" They are not citizens. Their presence on our soil is a conditional privilege, not a right. Under law, an \"alien\" who endorses or promotes a designated terrorist organization such as Hamas can have his green card privilege revoked and be expelled. The evidence is considerable that Khalil helped organize pro-Hamas uprisings on campus that involved disgusting antisemitism, vandalism, destruction of property, and physical attacks on Jewish students and law enforcement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked an expulsion provision in the immigration statute by stating that Khalil’s presence and support of Hamas is antithetical to our national security and foreign policy.  The Louisiana judge determined that this was legally sufficient for his deportation. Khalil won’t be boarding a plane out of the country quite yet. Legal wrangling over the First Amendment and other due process rights are still being waged in the New Jersey courtroom. Depending on the outcome, his case could also wind its way to the Supreme Court in the not-too-distant future. MANY FEDERAL JUDGES ARE OVERSTEPPING THEIR POWER, BUT 'IMPEACHMENT!' IS NOT THE ANSWER The most legally ludicrous of rulings arose from the Trump administration’smass deportationof members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), another designated terror organization. Under authority of the Alien Enemies Act, hundreds of violent criminals were arrested and jettisoned to prison in El Salvador. Liberal lawyers for five gang members still held in Texas flew like a bat out of hell to Washington, D.C., to do their usual \"judge shopping.\" It was no coincidence that the case landed in the lap of federal District Judge James Boasberg, who issued a preordained order to halt flights and turn around planes in midair. The absurdity of that order is self-evident. No judge has the authority to dictate the direction of travel beyond American airspace. Nor did it bother Boasberg that he had no jurisdiction over Texas litigants. Unrestrained, he proclaimed a nationwide injunction stopping all such deportations. This was well beyond his very limited district power. In a significant victory for Trump, theSupreme Courttossed out Boasberg’s erroneous rulings. The high court recognized that he should never have taken the case in the first place because it quite obviously belonged in Texas. In a broader sense, this was a stinging rebuke to lawyers everywhere who are addicted to \"judge shopping\" like it’s a half-off sale at Macy’s. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Not that the buying spree will stop. Deprived by the Supreme Court of jurisdiction, Boasberg stubbornly clings to it. On Wednesday afternoon, he disclosed that he will move to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for failing to return the planes over which he had no authority… in a case that he wrongfully commandeered. You can’t make this up. It’s a shame that SCOTUS did not seize a golden opportunity to finally extinguish the abusive habit of district judges declaring universal injunctions that impact the entire nation. For decades, both liberal and conservative justices have openly criticized the practice. Ducking the issue yet again was gutless, and their failure to act only opened the door to more of it. Sure enough, within days an Obama-appointed federal judge in Massachusetts issued an expansive order blocking Trump’s effort to end temporary legal status for more thanhalf a million migrantsfrom Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. Never mind that Biden created the program by executive action, which means that Trump can terminate it with the same discretion. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Supreme Court is the ultimate backstop against scheming lawyers and activist judges who are all too anxious to impede Trump’s agenda for purely political reasons. It is time for the court to grow a backbone and end the gamesmanship. Until that happens, fans of \"wack-a-mole\" can enjoy the legal gymnastics in perpetuity.

    "title": "This is how we'll know if California Gov. Gavin Newsom's epiphany on 'liberal governance' is real",
    "article_text": "'Common Sense' Department: Gov. Gavin Newsom says California’s doing just fine. Meanwhile, debt climbs, wildfires rage and Californians flee. 'Stable and reliable'? Only in his imagination. California Gov.Gavin Newsomseems to have received a political wake-up call. In a recent interview with Bill Maher, he admitted that many of California’s woes reflect \"an indictment of liberal governance and leadership.\" His candor is striking, especially coming after a seismic shift inthe Golden State: the resounding passage of Proposition 36. As a principal architect and senior leader of the Prop 36 campaign, I helped craft this citizens’ ballot initiative, which won nearly 70% voter approval – sweeping every county, even deep-blue San Francisco and Los Angeles. Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters in the spin room following the debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in Atlanta, June 27, 2024. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Frustrated Californians demanded tougher penalties for repeat thieves, fentanyl dealers and hard-drug offenders. YetNewsomand Sacramento’s Democratic supermajority fought relentlessly to kill it. I witnessed their resistance firsthand. GAVIN NEWSOM LEAVES AN UNEXPECTED LEGACY IN CALIFORNIA With decades as one of California’s longest-serving elected district attorneys and a former president of the California District Attorneys’ Association, I was ready for policy debates on crime. But nothing prepared me for the cynical tactics of those desperate to cling to power. Privately, Newsom’s staff admitted they feared the high-profile measure would boost turnout among moderate and conservative voters in November 2024. Publicly, they smeared Prop 36 as a far-right throwback, dismissing its broad support from Democratic mayors across the state. For years, California’s liberal leadership championed \"progressive reforms\" to decriminalize, decarcerate and dismantle acriminal justice systemthey branded racist and punitive. Accountability eroded, replaced by vague promises of safety through equity and compassion. The results were disastrous. Drug-ravaged homeless encampments spread through our cities. Open drug use, needle-strewn streets, locked-down stores, shuttered businesses, and viral videos of smash-and-grab thefts became all too familiar. HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED AFTER TALKING WITH GAVIN NEWSOM: GOP BEWARE These aren’t mere \"quality of life\" issues or victimless crimes. Organized retail thieves plundering California’s store shelves often tie back to international criminal syndicates dealing in scams, guns, drugs and human trafficking. Crime lords manage their portfolios like any investor, with store-robbing foot soldiers delivering steady, low-risk revenue at scale. Homeland Security investigations warn that stolen goods fuel money laundering, propping up the global black market. No surprise, then, that violent crime has steadily climbed. The public had seen enough. Prop 36’s landslide victory in a state of nearly 40 million laid bare a gaping disconnect between California’s liberal elite and its voters on crime and safety. It was a mandate for common sense – a rejection ofsoft-on-crime policiesthat had gone too far. That mandate, and the tools voters delivered, have empowered prosecutors like me to target repeat offenders and merchants of death selling fentanyl. It has also reinvigorated drug courts and mandated treatment for the chronically addicted. The electorate, wide awake, spoke with one voice, and many of us are listening. THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER Will Newsom and his party listen? Early signs suggest otherwise. Reports indicate they’re reluctant to fully fund Prop 36’s implementation – a serious misstep. Voters want results, not rhetoric or stubborn loyalty to ideology. This isn’t about ideology; it’s about reality. Californians are fed up withstepping over needles, witnessing brazen theft, and fearing for their safety. But it’s bigger than that. Prop 36’s success offers a roadmap for other states wrestling with the fallout of lenient crime policies. It proves that when leaders ignore the public’s commonsense demands, they risk waking a sleeping giant – and facing its wrath. Newsom’s recent epiphany about his party’s failures is a start, but words ring hollow without action. If he and Sacramento’s Democrats dig in their heels, they’ll only widen the divide. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION As someone whobattled Newsom’s machineto get Prop 36 on the ballot and secure its victory, I know what’s at stake. Californians didn’t just vote for tougher laws – they voted for accountability, deterrence and a return to sanity. The question now is whether Newsom will heed this wake-up call or hit the snooze button. For the sake of our state – and perhaps our country – I hope it’s the former. The people have spoken. It’s time to listen. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jeff Reisig has served as one of California’s 58 elected district attorneys since 2007.",

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: About that 100 days thing",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the president's optimism despite the stock market plunge on 'Special Report.' President Donald Trump’ssecond \"100 days\" ends April 30. It has already been a roller coaster and with almost two weeks to go, this column jumps the gun. But it isn’t about judgment on his fast start off the blocks. Rather, it is about the judges. The legacy media’s collective sunk costs when it comes toPresident Trumpare so enormous as to defy adequate description. ChatGPT tells me that a \"sunk cost is a past expenditure that cannot be recovered, regardless of future actions.\" \"It's a cost that has already been incurred and is irrelevant to future decisions,\" my artificial mind helper tells me. \"In essence, a sunk cost is money, time, or effort that's already been spent and can't be gotten back.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP REVEALS HIS PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS HISTORIC FIRST 100 DAYS When it comes to journalism, that is an inadequate description. Asunk costfor any sort of journalist is present in every judgment rendered about every public figure or controversy on which the journalist has reported, opined or both. Just about anyone in the world of journalism who is 30 and older has been pumping out \"takes\" on Donald Trump since he came down the escalator on June 16, 2015. I certainly have. So has every reporter for print and broadcast, every columnist on every platform, every podcaster and every poster on X, Instagram or any other social media conveyor belt. Hundreds of millions of takes have been taken,predictions madeand conclusions rendered. The \"sunk costs\" of having been wrong on any or most of all of them are, as noted, enormous. The effects of everyone being so wrong for so long vary. I’ve been just as wrong as some, not half or a quarter as wrong as most. I thought he was certain to lose in 2016, that he should have stepped aside a week before Election Day that year, that the GOP might have had to replace him before the convention in Cleveland, that he had no chance of winning again in 2024 until after Butler. For me, one effect of my sunk costs is, I hope, sustained humility about predicting what Trump will do or not do, succeed with or fail miserably to accomplish. I got out of the prediction business early in the last cycle as the naked partisanship of the lawfare directed at Trump had a wholly unforeseen effect of making him unbeatable. I didn’t see that coming. I certainly didn’t see him winning all seven swing states, or the popular vote, or achieving the greatest political comeback in American history. So when I routinely tell people they might want to hold on to their early assessments for at least six months, it is because I am chastened and we are dealing with something wholly new and wholly unique in American political history. Trump is a party of one. He has completelytaken over the GOPand dominated the Democrats. His past opponents are either his allies now or irrelevant for the next two years and perhaps four. The tidal charts of politics tell us his party should lose seats in 2026, but sometimes those charts are way off. Way, way off. If the GOP holds it together in Congress, revises and extends the tax cuts Trump pioneered and does so soon, rebuilds the American arsenal or at least gets a good start on doing so, gets the Wall finished and keeps the border closed while opening up America’s vast energy resources, well then, who knows? Not me. If Iran capitulates and demolishes its nuclear program, or Trump plus Netanyahu orders it done from the skies above, the consequences will be world history changing. The alliance of tyrants in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela have to decide what to do in response to Trump and that will take at least half a year to discern and probably much longer. Richard Nixon —the president whose unlikely career path and governing style most resembles Trump’s— took office in 1969 and didn’t get to China until 1972 or secure the Paris Peace Accords until 1973. And Trump is moving in his second term far faster than Nixon did in his first. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION So there is simply no rational guess to be made about how Trump’s story will turn out. But what isn’t rational —and what is actually the opposite of journalism— are the hundreds of \"journalists\" of whatever stripe or self-described category or ideology who profess to know what Trump is thinking or what is motivating him. Hardly a day goes by when I don’t hear more than a few takes on what Trump is planning, thinking, about to do or undo, or a \"4-D chess\" explanation of why he did what he did. Journalists of all sorts and shades of bias have cast off from the solid ground of telling you what Trump did and said, and what others did and said, in favor of sailing far out into the waters of psychology or some bizarre offshoot closer to phrenology than psychology and certainly it is not the world of journalism. It is bizarre. It is everywhere. It is also a product of sunk costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So many have been so wrong about so much that they are shattered in many ways. They can’t piece together the shards of their past \"reporting\" into a coherent story, or reconcile their confident assertions that collided with reality. So vast is the burden of their being so wrong so often that they have given up taking account of their past errors. Not for them any vow of humility. Perhaps the journalism market can’t bear much humility, but I think it can. It certainly can and does reward objectivity and calm assessment. A presidential term is 1,461 days long. When President Trump passes the much-watched mark on the 30th, he will have 1,361 days left in the White House. Assessments at 100 days are the fool’s gold of journalism. But that gold is about to tumble from every outlet. Unless it’s preceded by a candid disclaimer of the writer’s or speaker’s past record of error, pay for it what it’s worth.

    "title": "GORDON CHANG: Trump tariffing China at the worst possible time for Xi Jinping",
    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang discusses President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and the threat of Chinese hackers to U.S. national security on ‘Fox News Live.’ \"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,\" wroteXi Jinpingthis week. If he’s talking about China, he’s absolutely right. Across the board, the Chinese will suffer. In America, the story will be different. When the dust settles on PresidentDonald Trump’s tariffs, there will be 340.1 million people much better off. For more than four decades, China’s regime has been implementing predatory and criminal trade practices. For various reasons, the U.S. and other countries have let matters slide. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping Trump in his first term, in 2018, fired a warning shot with his 25% tariffs. Unfortunately, the Chinese regime did not take the hint. This month he raised the general tariff rate on China’s goods to 145%. 10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER Trump’s trade actions could not have come at a worse time for Xi. As an initial matter, his economy is stumbling. It cannot be growing at the 5.4% pace reported Wednesday for the first quarter of this year. Price data for March – the Consumer Price Index was negative for the second-straight month and the Producer Price Index was negative for the 30th-straight month – indicates the country has entered a deflationary spiral. That phenomena suggests the economy is now contracting and will do so for some time. And it’s going to get worse.Xi Jinping, despite what his technocrats say, does not want consumption to form the foundation of the Chinese economy. In fact, consumption’s share of gross domestic product – an abnormally low 38% last year – is now falling. In these circumstances, Xi’s only way to rescue an increasingly grim situation is to export more. Yet Trump’s elevated tariffs close off the U.S. market to most Chinese goods. The U.S. accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending. TRUMP’S TARIFF WAR WITH BEIJING IS PART OF A MULTI-PRONG STRATEGY TO SECURE AMERICA FROM A MUCH BROADER THREAT Worse for Xi Jinping, Trump’s tariffs are helping end the fast globalization that has marked the post-Cold War period. \"Due to many reasons, the world has been deglobalizing for years,\" trade expert Alan Tonelson told Fox News. \"Now, the Trump Liberation Day tariffs are greatly speeding up the process, and further threatening the well-being of the People’s Republic of China and other export-led economies.\" As Tonelson, who blogs on trade at RealityChek suggests, the world is de-integrating. \"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put anend to the globalizationwe have experienced over the last three decades,\" wrote Larry Fink in his March 24, 2022, letter to BlackRock shareholders. The world’s largest asset manager – BlackRock has $11.6 trillion under management – suggested the Ukraine war killed globalization because globalization had already been weakened by the COVID pandemic, which had lessened connectivity among nations, among companies and among people. In this deglobalizing world, other countries will not allow China to flood their markets with goods the Chinese would have otherwise sold to America. Those markets are not large enough to absorb those goods and, in any event, they will not permit China to decimate their local industries. China will be hurt. Even now, export factories in southern China, with nothing in their order books, are closing. Workers have begun to return to hometowns, many to subsist on farms. WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES The downturn in the export sector is occurring while the country is essentially having its 2008. In 2008, Hu Jintao, Xi’s predecessor, decided to avoid a downturn by embarking on what was then the biggest stimulus program in history. In the process, China took on an enormous amount of debt. Today,China’s total-country-debt-to-GDP ratiocould be as high as an unsustainable 375%. As a result, there have been for four years a series of high-profile debt defaults, especially in the property sector. Prices of flats in China have tumbled, a social stability issue: Approximately 70% of household wealth is in property. And if all of this were not bad enough, Trump has picked this moment to begin challenging China’s mighty export sector with tariffs. The obvious course of action for Xi Jinping would be to pick up the phone to call 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He has, however, made it clear that he won’t be doing that. \"China wants to make a deal,\" Trump said last Wednesday. \"They just don’t know how quite to go about it.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION No Xi Jinping doesn’t. And it’s not hard to figure out why something so easy is in fact so hard. Xi has configured the Chinese political system so that only the most hostile answers are considered acceptable. As a result, he cannot now back down or make concessions for fear that will lead to a challenge to his leadership. There are already signs of discontent with his rule, especially in the top ranks of the military. Xi remains intransigent. \"China does not flinch from any unjust suppression,\" he proclaimed during his meeting with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on April 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So Xi has boxed himself in. For him, there are no good outcomes. If he does not compromise, theChinese economywill fail. If he compromises, he will fail. For China’s willful leader, the choice is easy: He will not initiate talks with Trump. China, as a consequence, will bear the consequences. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GORDON CHANG Gordon G.

Instead of GPS, drone operators there have to use high-tech goggles to guide their drones by sight. But that leads to lots of problems, especially under poor conditions like thick fog or at night. At the end of the hackathon, Schoeller wished his two teammates well and parted, hoping their paths might cross again. But the tweet went viral and changed their lives. A day later, the three decided to apply to Y Combinator, successfully getting into itsSpring 2024 cohort. Now, their San Francisco-based company,Theseus, has just raised $4.3 million in seed funding in a round led by First Round Capital, with additional backing from Y Combinator and Lux Capital, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Theseus joins a flock of other drone-related startups. There’s Skydio, which focuses on replacing Chinese drones for U.S. law enforcement and waslast valued at $2.2 billion in 2023. Shield AI, which builds reconnaissance drones, recentlyraised at a $5.3 billion valuation. The biggest defense tech player, Anduril,launchedits own small drone last year, and is reportedly in talksto raise at a $28 billion valuation. Theseus says it doesn’t build drones, but focuses on the hardware components and software that will enable pretty much any military drone to fly unmanned without GPS. Schoeller, Theseus’ CEO, told TechCrunch the company doesn’t build targeting systems. Its software is not deciding whether a certain spot is a legitimate military target or not — the sole focus is getting a drone from point A to B. Theseus hasn’t won any U.S. military deals yet, and hasn’t been deployed in an actual battlefield. So it’s using its fresh capital to focus on further building out its tech,hiringfor three engineering roles. However, the viral hackathon tweet did get Theseus noticed by U.S. Special Forces, which has entered into an agreement for early testing and development. Theseus says it recently went to a secret Special Forces base to test out its latest system, sending TechCrunch a photo of it in action. Overall, starting a company with people you’ve known for under a week “generally isn’t advised,” but in Theseus’ case, it warranted the leap of faith, Schoellerwroteon LinkedIn.

The government’s internal expense card program, dubbed SmartPay, is a $700 billion program. It is estimated that the charge card pilot program contract for which Ramp is being considered is worth up to $25 million, according to areportby Pro Publica. Pro Publica claims that fintech Ramp has been lobbying for the administration’s attention since January, before President Trump was sworn in. In January, Ramp co-founder CEO Eric Glyman and Ramp VC investor Kyle Harrison wrote ablog posttitled “The Efficiency Formula” in which they listed the ways they imagined the government could “eliminate inefficient spending.” Harrison is a general partner at the firm Contrary. The post seemed to be an appeal to Elon Musk’s government agenda — which would be formally created a few days later as the Department of Government Efficiency — considering Ramp has ties to Musk’s and Trump’s world. Ramp’s investors include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund; Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, which was founded by Joshua Kushner, brother of Trump’s son-in-law Jared; Trump ally8VC’s Joe Lonsdale and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush. Ramp “is competing in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution,” Lindsay McKinley, head of communications told TechCrunch on Thursday. She added: “Ramp’s technology has prevented billions of dollars in wasted spend across the economy, and if chosen, we’ll bring those same results to the American taxpayer.” Despite McKinley’s strong rhetoric, she’s referring to how Ramp positions itself as a money-saving option for corporations. It offers similar spend management features as other corporate expense management platforms, like setting parameters to identify expenses that don’t conform to policies. The federal government hasmany such policies for employees in place. McKinley said that the startup sawa public post on Xshared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said “the US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for  ~$40B of spend in FY24.” A former customer, Ramp claims, introduced Ramp to GSA a few days later. “Since then we have demonstrated the product and are now part of a standard RFI process,” she said. “We have no indication of whether we’ll be selected.” In March, Rampdoubled its valuationto $13 billion after a $150 million secondary share sale. The startup has raised over $1 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception.

It reduces API costs by exactly half. For o3, Flex processing is $5/M input tokens (~750,000 words) and $20/M output tokens versus the standard $10/M input tokens and $40/M output tokens. For o4-mini, Flex brings the price down to $0.55/M input tokens and $2.20/M output tokens from $1.10/M input tokens and $4.40/M output tokens.

The deal was executed through Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a subsidiary of the oil and gas company, for an undisclosed amount. HeatMapfirst reportedthe news. Holocene had been racing to advance its amino acid-based carbon removal technology following a $10 million deal it signed in Septemberwith Googleto deliver 100,000 metric tons of carbon removal by the early 2030s. At $100 per metric ton, the price was significantly lower than what competitors could offer today. Currently, removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere is estimated to cost around$600 per metric ton. Occidental’s interest in carbon capture stems from a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, in which CO2is injected underground to stimulate oil wells. The companybought another direct air capture startup, Carbon Engineering, in 2023 for $1.1 billion. An Occidental spokesperson told HeatMap that the company will be using Holocene’s technology to further its direct air capture research and development.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us President Donald Trump’s tariffs have underscored the increasing geopolitical risk that almost all businesses now face. As the situation continues to shift with Trump’s unpredictable deal-making, it’s also becoming clear how challenging it is for companies, nonprofits, consultants, and lawyers to keep up with the rapid day-to-day changes. “We are drowning in trade updates every hour of every day,” Matthew Oresman, London managing partner of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a global law firm, told TechCrunch. The firm, whose clients span multinationals and high-net-worth individuals, as well as companies in tech, energy, and AI, is one of the first customers for London-based startupHence AI’s new software product, Hence Global. The product uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk. The tool does two things. First, it helps companies of any size track risk, and it advises them on actions they can take to mitigate that risk. Second, it helps service providers, like consulting and law firms, generate meaningful analysis about the world for their clients. Sean West, CEO and co-founder of Hence AI (formerlyHence Technologies), said to think of Hence Global as “an AI-powered business advisor that’s riding alongside you.” At only $1,500 per year for the base product, Hence is far more affordable than your typical consultant, argued West. “We want to democratize access to this information,” West told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview, noting that organizations like startups and NGOs can’t afford to call their lawyers every time they have a question about exposure or spend half a million dollars on a consulting contract. “Big companies know how to buy expensive advice, and the richest people will always talk to the smartest people, and they’ll pay for them,” West continued. “But most of the market can actually be served by technology.” West previously served as global deputy CEO of geopolitical advisory firm Eurasia Group and recently published a book, “Unruly: Fighting Back when Politics, AI, and Law Upend the Rules of Business.” One of his co-founders, Steve Heitkamp, is a Palantir alum with a background in political risk and counterterrorism. Hence Global is built on Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows the startup to blend different AI models to understand, summarize, and analyze relevant information based on a customer’s specific needs and industry. The system pulls in data from news headlines (and only the headlines, with a link to the source, says West), Wikipedia, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, press releases, and other public data like sanctions lists or World Bank information. West walked me through how the product works to show its potential impact. Customers start by creating a persona. For the purposes of the demo, we told the system that we were a cross-border cryptocurrency infrastructure company that offers stablecoin payments, crypto custody, and regulatory intelligence. We also told Hence Global that we wanted “a continuous, forward-looking analysis of geopolitical developments that could impact our operating environment,” and gave it a handful of topics to track. The idea is that, every day, Hence Global will generate a daily update with relevant news and information. In the case of the fictional crypto company, one of the stories the software flagged was that Trump’s trade war caused market volatility that resulted in Bitcoin and other crypto stocks falling. “Basically, it does the work that a mid-level analyst would have done in my organization,” West said. He added that it would’ve taken said analyst all day to produce a memo that Hence Global churns out in a minute. Hence Global’s daily briefing is great for companies that want to understand their own geopolitical and business risk, but it’s also helpful for services companies that are tracking this information for their clients. Crucially, when a customer asks Hence Global to monitor a company, the system asks if that company is a client, a competitor, or a supplier, which will cause the platform to think about how it provides information and analyses differently. “We were desperate for these kinds of tools that can synthesize [information], help us write the client alerts, give us that big kernel of information that we can augment and put our legal knowledge on,” Oresman said. “There’s just a fire hose of information out there. Having something like this actually gets it to a water fountain so we can actually do something useful with it.” Hence Global hasn’t been live for more than a couple of months, but Trump’s tariff situation has already begun bringing in new clients on top of existing customers like TravelPerk, Diversifi Capital, and Three Crowns. Rohitesh Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Metals and Mining, told TechCrunch he uses Hence Global to monitor market sentiment and policy. “We try to show the world that it is possible to produce mining in a responsible way,” Dhawan said. “But to do that, you’ve got to be really well connected to the pulse of society and what people care about and the issues that are top of mind, and that’s why we turn to Hence as a way to help us do that, because things are just moving so quickly in the world in general.” Dhawan likened Hence Global to Uber Eats — a product you didn’t know you needed until it showed up and made your life easier. He said that businesses in resource-based industries, like agriculture or oil and gas, and companies that are highly regulated or highly exposed to public sentiment, such as tech startups, would benefit most from using Hence Global. “This was the kind of always-on monitoring that we just weren’t doing before,” Dhawan said. “What Hence is helping me do as a CEO is to quickly get to the, ‘So what?’” Hence Global is the startup’s second product after Hence Legal, a “solution for outside counsel management, matter management, and litigation management,” per West. Hence AI, whose team is spread around the U.K., Rwanda, the U.S., and the Netherlands, has raised about $5.2 million to date and is actively looking to raise more for this product from investors who align with its mission. When asked about whether Hence AI would be open to being acquired by larger research houses, consultancies, or law firms, West said he and his team are less interested in going in-house at any one organization. “We’re trying to do big things,” he added. “And I think the big opportunity here is tapping the market of people who are global, but can’t access advice. And I don’t think that necessarily is what a large corporate service provider would do with this.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

    "title": "Chinese shopping app Taobao joins DHgate in Top 5 on US App Store",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Chinese e-commerce marketplace app DHgate,which is now the No. 2 free iPhone app in the U.S., isn’t the only one that’s oddly benefiting from President Trump’s tariffs on U.S. imports from China. Another Chinese shopping app,Taobao, has now also entered the Top 5 as of Thursday. U.S. consumers began flocking to these apps over the past several days in the wake ofnumerous TikTok videos from Chinese manufacturersexplaining how much of the luxury goods market operates out of China. The videos claim that many products from top luxury brands — like clothing, handbags, shoes, and accessories — are actually originally made in China. The items are then shipped over to the brand’s home country, like Italy or France, where they’re repackaged after the brand’s label is applied, according to these videos. Other U.S. and Chinese TikTok creators then pointed to e-commerce apps like DHGate and Taobao as a way to buy directly from the Chinese manufacturers, forgoing the huge markup the luxury brands charge. Already wary of theincreasing prices on popular apps like Shein and Temu,U.S. consumers quickly began downloading these alternatives. In April, Taobao’s estimated downloads totaled approximately 185,000 — a 514% increase from the 30,000 it saw during the same period last month, according to new data from app intelligence providerAppfigures. As with DHgate, Taobao’s downloads surged over this past weekend, with installs increasing 5.7x between last Friday and Saturday, the firm said. On Saturday, Taobao entered the Top Overall ranks on the iOS App Store (excluding games) at No. 461. By Sunday, it was No. 188. And by Thursday, it reached No. 5. The change in rank represents the growth in app installs as well as their velocity and other factors. Taobao also grew from the No. 49 Shopping app on Saturday to become the No. 2 app, topping Walmart, Amazon, Shein, and Temu. (Chinese app Alibaba.com is also climbing the charts here, now the No. 6 shopping app on the U.S. App Store.) Notably, Appfigures says that Taobao has never been in the Top Overall charts on the U.S. App Store according to its data, which goes back to January 1, 2017. While switching shopping apps won’t actually save U.S. consumers from tariffs on Chinese imports, shoppers likely think buying direct from manufacturers could potentially lower the overall cost of their purchases. For other consumers, it’s simply a way to seek out luxury-style goods or dupes at a better price. Of course, it’s still a case of “buyer beware” on any of these marketplaces, where quality can be hit or miss. Users are encouraged to read the individual sellers’ reviews and view other buyers’ photos of the items before making purchases.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Geoff Ralston, well-known in the startup community for his years at Y Combinator, is back in the formal investing ring, heannouncedThursday. His new fund is called Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund, or SAIF, which is both an explanation of its thesis and a play on words. Ralston is specifically looking for startups that “enhance AI safety, security, and responsible deployment,” as his fund’swebsitedescribes. He plans to write $100,000 checks as a SAFE, “pun intended,” he says, with a $10 million cap. A SAFE is, of course, the invest now/price later pre-seed investment tool pioneered by Y Combinator (it stands for simple agreement for future equity). While most VCs these days are looking to invest in AI startups, Ralston’s take is a bit more focused on the idea of safe AI, even though he admits the concept is a bit broad. “The vast majority of AI projects out in the world today are using the technology to solve problems or create efficiencies or create new capabilities. They are not necessarily intrinsically unsafe, but safety is not their primary concern,”  Ralston tells TechCrunch. “I intend to fund startups whose primary objective is safe AI — as I have (very broadly) defined it.” That list includes startups focused on improving the safety of AI, like those that clarify an AI’s decision-making process or benchmark AI safety. It includes products that protect intellectual property, those that ensure an AI conforms to compliance requirements, fight disinformation, and detect AI-generated attacks. He also wants to invest in functional AI tools with built-in safety in mind, such as better AI forecasting tools and AI-enabled business negotiation tools that won’t reveal corporate secrets to outsiders. This might sound like a list of AI startups that many VCs are pursuing, but there are areas Ralston says he won’t back. One example is fully autonomous weapons. “There are certainly uses of AI which would (will) be unsafe: using the technology to create bioweapons, to manage conventional weapons without a human in the loop, etc.,” he explained. In fact, he’d like to fund “weapon safety systems” that could detect or prevent attacks from AI weapons. This is an interesting contrarian viewpoint from many of today’s defense tech founders and VCs.As TechCrunch has previously reported, some of the people building AI weapons have increasingly been floating the idea that such weapons would be better operating without a human. Still, all things AI is a crowded field for VCs these days. That’s where Ralston hopes his YC connections could give him an advantage. Ralstondeparted YC in 2022, after three years as president(succeeded by Garry Tan) and over a decade as an adviser. Ralston plans to offer mentoring of the kind he did at the storied startup accelerator and has promised to coach them through how to apply to YC. And he’s offering to help them tap into his considerable investor network. Ralston declined to say how big this fund is, how many startups he intends to back, or who his LP backers are.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On Thursday, weeks after launching its most powerful AI model yet,Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google published atechnical reportshowing the results of its internal safety evaluations. However, the report is light on the details, experts say, making it difficult to determine which risks the model might pose. Technical reports provide useful — andunflattering, at times — info that companies don’t always widely advertise about their AI. By and large, the AI community sees these reports as good-faith efforts to support independent research and safety evaluations. Google takes a different safety reporting approach than some of its AI rivals, publishing technical reports only once it considers a model to have graduated from the “experimental” stage. The company also doesn’t include findings from all of its “dangerous capability” evaluations in these write-ups; it reserves those for a separate audit. Several experts TechCrunch spoke with were still disappointed by the sparsity of the Gemini 2.5 Pro report, however, which they noted doesn’t mention Google’sFrontier Safety Framework (FSF). Google introduced the FSF last year in what it described as an effort to identify future AI capabilities that could cause “severe harm.” “This [report] is very sparse, contains minimal information, and came out weeks after the model was already made available to the public,” Peter Wildeford, co-founder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told TechCrunch. “It’s impossible to verify if Google is living up to its public commitments and thus impossible to assess the safety and security of their models.” Thomas Woodside, co-founder of the Secure AI Project, said that while he’s glad Google released a report for Gemini 2.5 Pro, he’s not convinced of the company’s commitment to delivering timely supplemental safety evaluations. Woodside pointed out that the last time Google published the results of dangerous capability tests was in June 2024 — for a model announced in February that same year. Not inspiring much confidence, Google hasn’t made available a report forGemini 2.5 Flash, a smaller, more efficient model the company announced last week. A spokesperson told TechCrunch a report for Flash is “coming soon.” “I hope this is a promise from Google to start publishing more frequent updates,” Woodside told TechCrunch. “Those updates should include the results of evaluations for models that haven’t been publicly deployed yet, since those models could also pose serious risks.” Google may have been one of the first AI labs to propose standardized reports for models, but it’s not the only one that’s beenaccused of underdelivering on transparencylately. Meta released asimilarly skimpy safety evaluationof its newLlama 4open models, and OpenAI opted not to publish any report for itsGPT-4.1 series. Hanging over Google’s head are assurances the tech giant made to regulators to maintain a high standard of AI safety testing and reporting. Two years ago,Google told the U.S. governmentit would publish safety reports for all “significant” public AI models “within scope.” The companyfollowed up that promise with similar commitmentstoother countries, pledging to “provide public transparency” around AI products. Kevin Bankston, a senior adviser on AI governance at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the trend of sporadic and vague reports a “race to the bottom” on AI safety. “Combined with reports that competing labs like OpenAI have shaved their safety testing time before release from months to days, this meager documentation for Google’s top AI model tells a troubling story of a race to the bottom on AI safety and transparency as companies rush their models to market,” he told TechCrunch. Google has said in statements that, while not detailed in its technical reports, it conducts safety testing and “adversarial red teaming” for models ahead of release.

The updated rule will also prohibit automakers from rolling out improvements via software updates to advanced driver-assistance systems in vehicles already in the hands of customers. Automakers must now test any upgrades or new features in ADAS and receive government approval before rolling it out via software update. Wireless software updates that improve or fix features in vehicles — and first popularized by Tesla — have become a critical capability for automakers trying to stay competitive. The mandate stems from growing concerns over vehicle safety and incidents of fatal crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems. Last month, a Xiaomi Su7 sedan caught fire after crashing into a pole just seconds after the driver took over control from the ADAS. It also follows Tesla’s rollout of its “Full Self-Driving software” branding used for its advanced driver-assistance system.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A Florida draft bill that would require social media companies to provide encryption backdoors for law enforcement officials to access user accounts has cleared a key legislative hurdle and will now advance to the state’s Senate floor for a vote. Florida lawmakers unanimously approved pushing the bill through committee,per Florida Politics. The“Social Media Use by Minors”(SB 868) bill, if passed into law, would require “social media platforms to provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena.” The bill would also require social media companies to allow parents or guardians access to a child’s account, and would prohibit child accounts from using features that allow the use of disappearing messaging, the bill reads. Critics, including the tech companies and industry organizations that oppose the bill, have long argued that weakening encryption would make people less safe by compromising the security of their private messages, and could result in data breaches. Ina blog post last week, the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the bill, arguing that encryption is the “best tool we have to protect our communications online,” and that passing the law would likely result in companies removing encryption for minors and making those users less safe. “The idea that Florida can ‘protect’ minors by making them less safe is dangerous and dumb,” wrote the EFF. The Florida bill builds on a state law passed last year restricting social media for people under the age of 16. The law remains largely on hold while it remainsunder scrutiny in the courtsamid questions about the law’s constitutionality. Tech companies, like Apple, Google, and Meta, are increasinglyend-to-end encryptingtheir users’ data so that their private content is only accessible to the user, not even the companies themselves. This also helps to protect users’ private messages from hackers or malicious company insiders. By encrypting user data, the tech companies say they also cannot provide law enforcement with information that they themselves cannot access. It’s not clear if the proposed Florida bill, as written, would require social media companies to comply with only a subpoena, which are typically issued by law enforcement agencies and without judicial oversight. Subpoenas are usually not signed by a judge but can still be used by law enforcement to compel limited amounts of account information, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers, from tech companies about their users. Companies will often demand to see a court-authorized search warrant, which requires police to present a court with a higher degree of evidence of suspected criminality, before turning over a user’s private messages. Acorresponding billgoing through the Florida House (HB 743) has a final committee vote to clear before it will proceed to the House floor for a vote, per Florida Politics.

Blends are invite-only and can be created with a singular friend or with a group chat. The custom feeds are refreshed with new content each day. The launch doesn’t come as a surprise, as TechCrunchreported in March 2024that the social network was developing the feature. Once you join or accept a Blend invite, you will be able to browse through reels picked for each person in the chat. When someone in the group reacts to a reel, Instagram will notify you so you can keep a convo going in the DM (direct messaging) chat. The idea behind the feature is to explore what sorts of reels your friends are into, while also connecting with them and discovering new content together. Blend aims to introduce a new social element to Instagram, bringing it closer to its roots of sharing moments with friends, something that’s been overshadowed in recent years by an influx of influencers and ads. With the launch of Blend, Instagram is giving users access to a feature that isn’t available on TikTok, which is one of Instagram’s biggest rivals. For Instagram, Blend could be a way to boost reels’ discovery and watch time on the social network, as it’s encouraging users to watch short-form content together. To create a Blend, you need to open a one-on-one or group DM chat and tap the new Blend icon at the top of the chat. Then, you need to select “Invite” to invite people from your DM chat to join the Blend. The Blend will be created when at least one member of the chat accepts your invite. You can revisit a Blend by going to the DM chat and tapping the Blend icon. It’s worth noting that Blend is somewhat similar toSpotify’s functionality of the same name, which allows people to combine their tastes into one shared playlist that refreshes daily.

Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondiinstructedthe Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed anexecutive order banningDEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASAhas started to scrubmention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBShad to shutterits DEI office. Incorporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it wouldditch its requirementfor corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike abalance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorganhave indicated a commitmentto sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year,companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforcestarted scrubbingmentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removeda post from 2021that expressed a focus on DEI andremoved some mentions of diversityfrom its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’swebsitestill says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meetingrejected a proposalfrom a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, TheWall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI.Google alsoremoved underrepresentedlanguage from its grant website and scrubbed mention ofdiversity and equityfrom its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared tothe eight timesit was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year,it removed many cultural eventsfrom the default Google Calendar. IBM stillhas its inclusion page up.Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundationrequested the companydrop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intelcut back some of the languageabout DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, thecompany still states that“diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post thatit would remain committedto DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported byAxios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft releasedits 2024 inclusion reportin October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according toa memo leaked toBusiness Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietlychanged its “Commitment to Diversity” websiteto now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Salesforce isgetting rid of its diversityhiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing. Teslascrubbed mentionof diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only releasedonediversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workdayerased mentionof diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a2024 Global Impact Reportand it still has a chief diversity officer. Ubereliminated an incentivetied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value.

This week, OpenAI released its newest AI models,o3 and o4-mini, both of which can uniquely “reason” through uploaded images. In practice, the models can crop, rotate, and zoom in on photos — even blurry and distorted ones — to thoroughly analyze them. These image-analyzing capabilities, paired with the models’ ability to search the web, make for a potent location-finding tool. Users on X quickly discovered that o3, in particular, is quite good at deducingcities,landmarks, and even restaurants and bars from subtle visual clues. Wow, nailed it and not even a tree in sight.pic.twitter.com/bVcoe1fQ0Z — swax (@swax)April 17, 2025 In many cases, the models don’t appear to be drawing on “memories” of past ChatGPT conversations, orEXIF data, which is the metadata attached to photos that reveal details such as where the photo was taken. X is filled with examples of users giving ChatGPTrestaurant menus,neighborhood snaps,facades, andself-portraits, and instructing o3 to imagine it’s playing “GeoGuessr,” an online game that challenges players to guess locations from Google Street View images. this is a fun ChatGPT o3 feature. geoguessr!pic.twitter.com/HrcMIxS8yD — Jason Barnes (@vyrotek)April 17, 2025 It’s an obvious potential privacy issue.

TechCrunch ran a number of photos through o3 and an older model without image-reasoning capabilities, GPT-4o, to compare the models’ location-guessing skills. Surprisingly, GPT-4o arrived at the same, correct answer as o3 more often than not — and took less time. There was at least one instance during our brief testing when o3 found a place GPT-4o couldn’t. Given a picture of a purple, mounted rhino head in a dimly-lit bar, o3 correctly answered that it was from a Williamsburg speakeasy — not, as GPT-4o guessed, a U.K. pub. That’s not to suggest o3 is flawless in this regard. Several of our tests failed — o3 got stuck in a loop, unable to arrive at an answer it was reasonably confident about, or volunteered a wrong location. Users on X noted, too, that o3 can beprettyfar offin its location deductions. But the trend illustrates some of the emerging risks presented by more capable, so-called reasoning AI models. There appear to be few safeguards in place to prevent this sort of “reverse location lookup” in ChatGPT, and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, doesn’t address the issue in itssafety reportfor o3 and o4-mini.

The court will set a briefing schedule and hearing date to determine appropriate remedies for the antitrust violations, per a Thursday filing. The remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling its Google Ad Manager, which includes the AdX ad exchange and DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers), the ad server used for publishers. Or the courts could force behavioral remedies that would allow Google to keep its business intact, but would impose restrictions to ensure fair competition, like prohibiting Google from prioritizing its own exchange or demand in auctions. In a separate antitrust case, another federal judge last year found thatGoogle illegally monopolized the general internet search market. The judge has not yet issued remedies on that case, but is expected to do so in mid-2025. In the adtech case, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema wrote in her memorandum opinion that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the “open-web display advertiser ad networks” are a relevant market where Google has monopoly power. These networks help advertisers buy display ads across the open web, so they’re outside of closed ecosystems like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Search. The judge did agree that Google violated the Sherman Act by monopolizing and unlawfully tying two parts of the adtech stack together, specifically DFP and AdX, and that Google is guilty of abuse of monopoly power in the publisher-side adtech. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. “The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.” The Department of Justice – alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia – filed suit against Google’s alleged use of monopoly power over the digital ad marketin January 2023. The DOJ argued that Google achieved its monopoly through anti-competitive conduct when it purchased DoubleClick in 2008, which then became the backbone of its ad business. Google then bought AdMeld in 2011 to gain more control over the ad market’s supply side. The government says this allowed Google to hike up ad prices and harm publishers by taking larger cuts of each sale. The trial for this case began in September 2024 and lasted for three weeks, with closing arguments presented in late November. This article has been updated to include more background about the case.

The reports come from a packed first week of testimony in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s trial against the social networking giant. If the FTC’s lawyers prevail, the trial could potentially require Meta to spin out Instagram or WhatsApp as separate companies. Notably, Zuckerberg admitted on Wednesday that TikTok’s arrival had directly impacted Meta, saying his company had observed that its “growth slowed down dramatically” when TikTok became popular. He also said the ByteDance-owned app has continued to be a focus of Meta’s competitive efforts for several years. ByteDancepurchasedMusical.ly in 2017, andmergedit with TikTok the following year. Around the same time, Meta (then known as Facebook)stopped reporting Facebook’s user numbersin its quarterly reports, shifting to a new “family of apps” metric that encompassed Instagram and WhatsApp. The change was designed to hide the fact that Meta’s flagship app was seeing slowing growth. Zuckerberg made another interesting comment during the trial in response to a question about social media platforms’ “network effects.” He said it’s become less important for social media apps to leverage connections between friends and family to grow. “The apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,” Zuckerberg told the court. “People can take that content to messaging engines.” At the same time, however, Facebook is trying to return to its “OG roots”by turning once again to those network effects. The company recently released new features designed to make it easier to connect with friends, includinga revamped Friends tabthat highlights friend requests and activity. In January, Zuckerberg told investors that a “return to OG Facebook” was a key goal for 2025. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The 145% tariff on products made in China, along with Trump’s decision to end a customs exemption that had allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has disrupted the business models of both platforms. The report says nearly 4 million parcels, most of them from China, enter the U.S. every day under this soon-to-be-ended exemption. Shein and Temu have gained significant popularity in the U.S. over the past few years due to the platforms’ discount pricing and influencer advertising. TheWall Street Journalreported last year that Amazon now sees Shein and Temu as bigger threats to its business than retailers like Walmart and Target. In November, Amazon launchedAmazon Haul, a storefront that offers mass-produced and discounted items to take on Shein and Temu. Shein and Temu are encouraging customers to continue shopping.

    "title": "Syrians have more freedom after Assad, but could they soon lose it?",
    "article_text": "On the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect. Bashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free. Like many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians. I'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it. I assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once. For weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals. Only now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also aroundthe role of Islam in the new regime. So, how long might these social freedoms remain – or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived? At Rawda Café in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants. Today, it's a very different picture. The café hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too – many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum. Syrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable. \"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\" Reflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\" Odai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years  – he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime. \"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\" \"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.) \"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\" Syria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime. Even carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too. For weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene. Now, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious. There is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend for theatre. And after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears. \"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer. Mr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\" When Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\". But months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held. \"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\" In February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics. According to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus. \"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\" However, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\" Sharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\". He has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers. \"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi. There are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs. \"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed. Mr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\" The Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones. \"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely. \"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded. This represents a major challenge. \"There is little indication that the new authorities are genuinely committed to re-establishing an independent judiciary.\" Under Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that might point to how that could change – but there are some worrying signs. Only one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation. \"One important area to watch is whether women judges – who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary – will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\" As for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule. The Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils. In Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry. Some observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect). \"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\" However Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible. \"They don't want to, and they can't\". Even if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so. \"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\" Today there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces. Elsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria. The main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati. He claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members – those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted – from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\" The think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\". \"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\" For Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\" With a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\" And as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\" However there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a wider loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history? Mr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms… our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me. \"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\" Of the many challenges facing the new leadership, perhaps it is this that they would be wise to address first as they continue to carve out a new path for the future of Syria.

    "title": "US weapons left in Afghanistan sold to militant groups, sources tell BBC",
    "article_text": "Half a millionweapons obtained by the Taliban in Afghanistan have been lost, sold or smuggled to militantgroups, sources have told the BBC - with the UN believing that some have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda affiliates. The Taliban took control of around one million weapons and pieces of military equipment - which had mostly been funded by the US - when itregained control of Afghanistan in 2021, according to a former Afghan official who spoke to the BBC anonymously. As the Taliban advanced through Afghanistan in 2021, many Afghan soldiers surrendered or fled, abandoning their weapons and vehicles. Some equipment was simply left behind by US forces. The cache included American-made firearms, such as M4 and M16 rifles, as well as other older weapons in Afghan possession that had been left behind from decades of conflict. Sources have told the BBC that, at the closed-door UN Security Council's Sanctions Committee in Doha late last year, the Taliban admitted that at least half of this equipment is now \"unaccounted\" for. A person from the committee said they had verified with other sources that the whereabouts of half a million items was unknown. In a report in February, the UN stated that al-Qaeda affiliates, including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and Yemen's Ansarullah movement, were accessing Taliban-captured weapons or buying them on the black market. The BBC put this to Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, who told the BBC it took the protection and storage of weapons very seriously. \"All light and heavy weapons are securely stored. We strongly reject claims of smuggling or loss,\" he said. A 2023 UN reportsaid the Taliban allowed local commanders to retain 20% of seized US weapons, and that the black market was thriving as a result. These commanders are affiliated to the Taliban but often have a degree of autonomy in their regions. The UN noted that the \"gifting of weapons is widely practiced between local commanders and fighters to consolidate power. The black market remains a rich source of weaponry for the Taliban\". A former journalist in the city of Kandahar told the BBC that an open arms market existed there for a year after the Taliban takeover, but has since gone underground via the messaging service WhatsApp. On it, wealthy individuals and local commanders trade new and used US weapons and equipment - mostly the weapons left by US-backed forces. The number of weapons recorded by the US body tasked with overseeing Afghan reconstruction projects, known as Sigar, is lower than those cited by our sources, butin a 2022 reportit acknowledged it was unable to get accurate information. The reason given for this was that equipment has been funded and supplied by various US departments and organisations over the years. Sigar added that there had been \"shortfalls and issues with DoD's [Department of Defense] processes for tracking equipment in Afghanistan\" for more than a decade. It also criticised the State Department, adding: \"State provided us limited, inaccurate, and untimely information about the equipment and funds it left behind.\" The department denied this was the case. This is very much a political issue, and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he will reclaim weapons from Afghanistan. He said that $85bn (£66bn) of advanced weaponry was left there. \"Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world, you know why? They're selling the equipment that we left,\" Trump said during his first cabinet meeting of the new administration. \"I want to look into this. If we need to pay them, that's fine, but we want our military equipment back.\" The president's figure has been disputed, as money spent in Afghanistan also funded training and salaries. Also, Afghanistan did not feature in the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute'stop 25 largest exporters of major armslast year. In response to Trump's comments, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's chief spokesperson, told Afghan state TV: \"We seized these weapons from the previous administration and will use them to defend the country and counter any threats.\" The Taliban regularly parades US weapons, including at Bagram Airfield, which served as the main US-Nato base, and frame them as symbols of victory and legitimacy. After withdrawing in 2021, the Pentagon claimed US equipment left in Afghanistan was disabled, but the Taliban have since built a capable military using US weapons and gained superiority over rival groups, such as the National Resistance Front and Islamic State Khorasan Province - the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. A source from the former Afghan government told the BBC that \"hundreds\" of unused Humvees, mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs), and Black Hawk helicopters remain in Kandahar warehouses. The Taliban has showcased some of this captured equipment in propaganda videos, but their ability to operate and maintain advanced machinery, such as Black Hawk helicopters, is limited due to a lack of trained personnel and technical expertise. Much of this sophisticated equipment remains non-operational. However, the Taliban have been able to utilise more straightforward equipment, like Humvees and small arms, in their operations. While Donald Trump appears determined to reclaim US weapons from Afghanistan, the former head of Sigar, John Sopko, says such an attempt would be pointless. At a recent event hosted by the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, he said that \"the cost would exceed its actual value\". Whether Trump will take any action remains to be seen, but, in the meantime, concerns about the spread of weapons in the region and access by militant groups remain unresolved.",

    "title": "How much do bin workers get paid?",
    "article_text": "A strike among bin workers in Birmingham has left piles of waste around the city. At the heart of the dispute is the removal of the role of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO), who were paid more than some other bin workers. Bin workers can be paid differently, depending on their role in the process of bin collection. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)publishes estimated earningsfor the category \"refuse and salvage occupations\" whose role is to \"supervise and undertake the collection and processing of refuse\". According to the ONS, these workers earned an average £26,543 in 2024, which equates to a little over £13 per hour. The minimum wage for workers over 21 in 2024 was £11.44 per hour. TheNational Careers Servicesays that the pay range for a bin worker is on average between £24,000 and £30,000 per year, or equivalent to between £11.50 and £14.50 an hour. Birmingham City Council told us that the pay band for loaders - the most junior people working on a bin lorry - in Birmingham was £24,027 to £25,992 - that's about £11.50 to £12.50 an hour. Drivers are counted in a different category - heavy and large goods vehicle drivers - whose average earnings were £38,337, according to the ONS. In Birmingham, they are on a scale from £33,366 to £40,476. The bin lorry drivers in Birmingham were accompanied by two loaders and a WRCO, but the council now wants to cut the crews to three by getting rid of the role of the WRCOs. WRCOs are on a higher pay band than the loaders - £26,409 to £32,654. We asked Birmingham City Council for their full job description but were not given it. Unite, the union representing the striking workers, saysthis back of the lorry role is \"safety critical\"but the council saysthat \"none of the roles make any specific reference to there being a lead person responsible for health and safety\", as this is something all members of staff have a duty to follow. It also saidkeeping the higher-paid role could open up the council to more equal pay claims as refuse collection is a job overwhelmingly performed by men. Unite claimsthat the scrapping of the WRCO role will leave some workers having to accept pay cuts of up to £8,000. The council says that the figuresare \"incorrect\" and \"no-one will lose £8,000 per annum\". Their estimate is that the maximum amount anyone could lose would be \"just over £6,000\". The union has got to the £8,000 figure by considering somebody who decides to accept a position as a loader once their WRCO role is scrapped - and not take the council's alternative suggestions. They calculated the loss moving from the top of the pay scale for WRCOs - £32,654 - to the bottom of the pay scale for loaders - £24,027. Where you are on the pay scale is known as your spinal point and is usually determined by the number of years you've been doing the job and some additional factors. It's because of these spinal points that it's unlikely that somebody would move from the top of one pay scale to the bottom of a more junior one, especially when that junior role is in the same sector of services. Max Winthrop, a member of the Law Society's Employment Law Committee, said: \"I'd normally expect the spinal point on the higher grading to be maintained when a lower graded post was offered.\" He does say, though, that it's \"not impossible\" for the opposite to happen if both sides agree to such a contract. The council has reached its maximum pay cut figure by assuming that a WRCO, who decides to stay as a bin worker despite the lower pay scale for loaders, would preserve his spinal point. That is more realistic, but still a pay cut of at least 18%. A consultation on plans for compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on 3 April. In aresponse to a Freedom of Information request, the council said that, as of the end of 2024, it employed 736 workers directly in refuse collection and 493 agency workers. It said that the average cost of employing agency workers was £18.44 an hour, although that may include loaders, WRCOs and drivers and is the amount being paid by the council, not the amount received by the workers. That would work out at a cost to the council of about £38,000 a year if the worker was employed full time. The FOI also asked the length of service of the longest serving agency worker employed by the council and was told that they had been doing the job for 13 years. Additional reporting by David Verry What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? The Unite union had claimed the authority would not resume discussions until Wednesday. Industrial action by more than a hundred staff is expected to impact about 50 flights each day.

    "title": "Trump suggests UK state visit set for September",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has suggested Buckingham Palace is \"setting a date for September\" for his second state visit to the UK. The president told reporters in the White House on Thursday evening: \"I was invited by the King and the country - great country.\" It comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmerhanded Trump an invitation letter from King Charles in Februaryduring his visit to Washington. Buckingham Palace is yet to confirm a date for the state visit. Trump was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II during his previousthree-day state visitin 2019, which took place during his first term in office. Traditionally second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle. King Charles' letter proposed a meeting to discuss details of the state visit at either Dumfries House or Balmoral, both in Scotland, a country to which Trump has connections. Trump's mother was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis. This year he isplanning to open a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, to be named after his mother. Speaking on Thursday, Trump said: \"They're going to do a second, as you know, a second fest… that's what it is: a fest, and it's beautiful, and it's the first time it's ever happened to one person. \"And the reason is we have two separate terms, and it's an honour… I'm a friend of Charles, I have great respect for King Charles and the family, William, we have really just a great respect for the family. \"And I think they're setting a date for September.\" There has been no official confirmation from Downing Street, but if confirmed, the visit will be seen as an important way to strengthen relations with Washington, amid its ongoing trade war. Starmer - who is looking tocomplete a trade deal with the USandremove recently imposed tariffs on the UK- previously said the invite for the second visit was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\". During the UK prime minister's visit to the White House in February, Trump showed cameras thecontents of the King's letter. It read: \"Quite apart from this presenting an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest, it would also offer a valuable chance to plan a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom. \"As you will know this is unprecedented by a US president. That is why I would find it helpful for us to be able to discuss, together, a range of options for location and programme content. \"In so doing, working together, I know we will further enhance the special relationship between our two countries of which we are both so proud.\" The move would be a step towards a final deal derailed by a row at the White House in February. A hearing set to decide the fate of the convicted killers was delayed after bickering in court. The 20-year-old alleged gunman began shooting at around lunchtime near the student union building. The US vice-president will meet Italy's prime minister but an audience at the Vatican could also happen, the BBC learns.

    "article_text": "Four people have died after a mountain cable car cabin plunged to the ground near Naples in southern Italy, emergency services say. Another person was \"extremely seriously injured\" in the crash at Mount Faito and airlifted to hospital, officials said. Italian media outlets reported that the cabin had been near the top of the mountain when one of the cables supporting it snapped. A second cabin was also on the line at the time but located near the bottom of the valley - 16 people were rescued from it and winched to safety. Prosecutors have launched an investigation as officials confirmed the victims were three passengers and the driver of the cable car. The president of the region, Vincenzo De Luca, said all the victims were tourists. De Luca added that poor weather conditions including fog, wind and rain had made it difficult for rescuers to access the area where the cabin had crashed. More than 50 firefighters took part in the rescue efforts, the fire department said. Italian media reported that the cable car had been travelling over a steep area when the cable snapped. Mount Faito is some 1,100m above sea level. The mayor of Castellammare di Stabia - where the cable car was located - said it was believed a traction cable had snapped. \"The emergency brake downstream worked but clearly not the one on the cabin that was about to reach the top of the hill,\" he told Italian media. He added that there had been regular safety checks on the cable car line which runs three kilometres from the town to the top of the mountain. The company which runs the service, the EAV public transport firm, said the seasonal cable car had \"reopened 10 days ago with all the required safety conditions\". \"What happened today is an unimaginable, unforeseeable tragedy,\" EAV's CEO Umberto de Gregorio said. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who was on a trip to Washington at the time of the incident, expressed her \"sincere condolences\" to the families of the victims. The Mount Faito cable car has been operating since 1952. A similar accident on the line in 1960 left four people dead. In 2021,14 people died when a cable car linking Lake Maggiore in Italy's northern Piedmont region with a nearby mountain plummeted to the ground. The cause was determined to be a snapped cable and emergency brake failure.

    "article_text": "Warning: This story contains spoilers about the Apprentice winner Lord Sugar has hired his newest business partner in the final of the 19th series of The Apprentice. He had a choice between Anisa Khan, who sells Indian food-flavoured pizzas, and Dean Franklin, who runs an air conditioning company, in a battle he billed as \"chilli versus the chiller\". The final signalled the end of a bruising 12-week process that started with 18 budding entrepreneurs vying to become Lord Sugar's latest protégé. In the end, Lord Sugar chose to give his £250,000 investment to Dean, from Essex, despite noting there had been \"a few rocky moments\" where he had only remained in the programme \"by the skin of your teeth\". \"I can't believe I've just won The Apprentice,\" Dean said. \"This is going to mean the world to me and my family. My kids are going to be over the moon.\" He made it through to the final despite having a difficult time in the penultimate episode, the interviews with Lord Sugar's famously tough advisers. He froze and started laughing after one interviewer, Mike Soutar, challenged his nonsensical claims about climate change, including that there was \"an increase in climate control\" and \"the climate zone is depleting\". He was also asked about his company's website, which says his engineers would \"always treat your home as if it were their own\". Soutar then produced a picture from Dean's social media showing a sex toy that he had stuck to a customer's air conditioning unit. In the final, the show's previously fired contestants returned to help Dean and Anisa create advertising campaigns for their companies. Dean tasked some of his team-mates with making a TV ad - which had to be hastily reshot because it showed someone being persuaded to buy air conditioning to heat up their house, not cool it down. During the episode, Lord Sugar said air conditioning made Dean an \"honest living\" but he needed to show a \"scalable proposition\". Ownership of Dean's company was previously split between his existing business partner and their two wives, with each having a 25% share. Lord Sugar will now be given the wives' 50% in return for his investment. He asked Dean: \"They'll give it to me and they won't get the hump over that then, will they? They won't make you sleep in the spare bedroom?\" Dean assured him: \"They know the plan. We're still married so what's mine is hers. So it makes no difference.\" The amount Lord Sugar invests has remained the same since 2011, and previous winner Tom Pellereau - the first to receive that sum - said: \"Fourteen years ago, £250,000 went quite a lot further than it does today. \"My controversial point is, I do think they should double the money. \"I think £500,000 or £1m would be an incredible prize,\" Pellereau told BBC Radio 5 Live.

    "title": "Gender ruling offers clarity after years of ambiguity",
    "article_text": "After years of argument and dispute about the meaning of gender, the watchword of Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling has to be clarity. Equality law has been made clear with the unambiguous statement that the term \"woman\" refers to a biological woman and does not include biological men who identify as women. It is a \"victory for common sense\", according to the chairwoman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). Baroness Falkner added: \"If a male is allowed to use a women-only service, it isn't any longer a single-sex space.\" This is a world away from the carefully chosen language which has been used to navigate gender issues for much of the last decade. The Equality Act, which protects people who have been through gender reassignment from harassment, discrimination and sex discrimination, is enforced by the EHRC. It is now updating its statutory code of conduct to take account of the judgment, saying that, with this new framework, it should be in a better position to enforce the law where it finds breaches. It was directly involved in the Supreme Court case because it said inconsistencies over whether the term sex included or excluded transgender people with gender recognition certificates (GRC) was making equality law unworkable. The ruling removes any ambiguity. Now, a GRC will not change a person's legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act. Public bodies - from the NHS and prisons to sports clubs and businesses - will already be reviewing their policies. Women's toilets, changing rooms and other single sex spaces will be for biological women only. In theory, that means a transgender man or woman should use facilities that correspond to their biological sex. However, this is likely to present other difficulties as the person will be presenting as their gender identity to the outside world. Baroness Falkner argues that transgender people should use \"their power of advocacy\" to persuade organisations to provide third spaces such as unisex toilets. Cases such as that ofthe nurse, Sandie Peggie, who was suspendedafter refusing to share a changing room with a transgender doctor, are likely to be reviewed. NHS Fife, the health board involved in the case, told the BBC that it noted the clarity provided by the ruling and would \"carefully consider the judgment\". Following the ruling, transwomen cannot compete in women's sport, the EHRC says. Sport has been one of the most hotly contested areas in the debate about gender. In recent years, many sports have tightened rules around transgender athletics at elite levels. Athletics, cycling and aquatics, for example, have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events. Other sports have put eligibility criteria in place. Earlier this month, the English Football Association introduced stricter rules - but still allowed transgender women to continue to compete in the women's game on the condition that their testosterone was kept below a certain level. However, it will take time to consider the implications on eligibility in elite sport, so there will not be any immediate change. Governing bodies are not compelled to amend or reconsider their rules - but if their rules now break equality law, they could face enforcement action. For some there will be concerns about what the ruling means for transgender people. The Supreme Court justices emphasised that transgender people already have protections against discrimination and harassment written into the Equality Act. The EHRC will look to protect these rights, and Baroness Falkner said they \"stand ready to support those people\". Trans rights campaigners have said they will be examining the judgment closely to decide their next steps - and it is possible they could attempt to put pressure on the government to change the Equality Act. Campaigners say the trans community is now worried that \"people are coming after their right to exist\" as a result of the ruling. The call comes after the Supreme Court gave a legal definition of a woman under equality law. It comes after a Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. The suit comes after a public spat between the state's governor and Donald Trump over transgender women competing in sports. Sir Keir Starmer and other leaders have tied themselves in knots over the question: \"What is a woman?\"",

    "title": "Could JD Vance meet the most famous Catholic of them all?",
    "article_text": "When US Vice-President JD Vance comes to Rome on Friday, he is set to meet Italy's prime minister and the Vatican secretary of state. But one of his main objectives is not on the official schedule - to be seen alongside Pope Francis. According to four sources familiar with the matter, the vice-president, a devout Roman Catholic, is hoping for at least a brief encounter with the 88-year-old pontiff, which would become the focal point of his visit. Such a moment would carry powerful symbolic weight, politically and personally, particularly over Easter, the most important celebration in the Catholic calendar, said a source familiar with his thinking. It could also signal a thaw in relations between the Vatican and Washington after months of tension over issues such as moral leadership and migration, with the Pope having previously said that mass deportations of people fleeing poverty or persecution damaged \"the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families\". \"Pope Francis and JD Vance are today's most prominent Catholics, one at the head of the Church and the Catholic hierarchy, the other a layman who is now vice-president of the United States,\" said Father Roberto Regoli, professor of history of the Church at the Pontifical Gregorian University. \"A meeting between the leaders of two global powers of this calibre would have immense symbolic significance.\" The White House and the vice-president's office did not respond to questions from the BBC about Vance's trip, and the Vatican has not confirmed any formal or informal meeting with Vance. Pope Francis has been in poor health following a five-week hospital stay for double pneumonia. Since returning to the Vatican a month ago, he has cancelled most of his official appointments. However, as his condition improves, Pope Francis has begun making surprise appearances - last week, he briefly met King Charles III and Queen Camilla during their official visit to Italy. \"A photo with Pope Francis would be a major win for JD Vance, and it would also reflect Pope Francis's inclusive approach - his willingness to welcome and meet anyone, even those with differing visions or values,\" said David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, the Jesuit university of New York. But if there is no encounter, he adds, there will inevitably be speculation about a snub or the Pope's health. While a potential meeting with the Pope is uncertain, another encounter has been firmly locked in for weeks - a formal handshake with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. A Catholic herself and standard-bearer of Europe's populist right, she is politically aligned with the US administration and shares their belief in taking a tough stance on migration. She is expected to receive the vice-president for a bilateral meeting during his visit, upon her return from Washington DC where she met Donald Trump on Thursday. The meeting could offer a further glimpse of the ideological alliances that Vance hopes to nurture in Europe, as Meloni has emerged as the natural mediator between the US and the EU, especially on thorny issues such as tariffs and trade. Vance and Meloni will later be joined by Italy's two deputy prime ministers, the League's Matteo Salvini and Forza Italia's Antonio Tajani, according to Italian officials. Vance's visit is the first to Europe since he delivered an ideological broadside against European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in February. He accused them of abandoning free speech, caving in to political correctness and losing touch with their citizens on issues like migration and national identity. That friction with the leaders on the continent also extends to the Vatican, where relations with the Trump administration have been strained by hardline immigration policies which have faced pushback from Catholic leaders and Pope Francis. Cuts to refugee programmes, the prospect of large-scale deportation plans, arrests in places of worship and efforts to curb birthright citizenship have been condemned by the US bishops' conference as being contrary to the common good. Pope Francis himself urged a more compassionate response to migration, drawing on Gospel teachings and the parable of the Good Samaritan. In a letter to US bishops in February, he expressed concern over the administration's policies and implicitly challenged Vance's attempts to use Catholic doctrine to justify the administration's immigration crackdown, saying that \"Christians know very well that it is only by affirming the infinite dignity of all that our own identity as persons and as communities reaches its maturity\". \"A meeting between Pope Francis and JD Vance would certainly underscore the stark contrast between their visions of Catholicism,\" said Gibson. \"Yet a meeting would serve both men - for Vance, a photo with the Pope could soften perceptions that he's an opponent of the Church; for Francis, it would demonstrate his welcoming approach, and, importantly, posing for a photo with JD Vance could mark [another] significant step in his return to public-facing duties.\" Others also see a benefit for Vance in associating with the moral authority of the papacy, if he does get a meeting or photograph with the man who leads the planet's 1.2 billion Catholics. He will have time with a highly ranked Vatican official, its secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. And he is expected to participate in ceremonies around Easter Sunday. The vice-president came to the faith relatively late in life. Raised in a largely non-practising, evangelical household, Vance spent part of his adolescence drawn to a Pentecostal church, only to later abandon organised religion altogether. It was not until August 2019, at the age of 35, that he formally converted to Catholicism at a Dominican priory in Cincinnati. Ohio. The decision, he has since explained, stemmed from a search for a moral and philosophical framework capable of making sense of the societal breakdowns he chronicled in his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy. In a 2020 essay for the Catholic magazine The Lamp, Vance wrote candidly about his spiritual turn, describing his need for a worldview that could account for both personal responsibility and structural injustice. Sen Van Hollen posted photos meeting with Kilmar Ábrego García, whom the Trump administration has refused to return to the US. The charges will start in 180 days and rise in the coming years. The move would be a step towards a final deal derailed by a row at the White House in February. A hearing set to decide the fate of the convicted killers was delayed after bickering in court. The 20-year-old alleged gunman began shooting at around lunchtime near the student union building.",

    "title": "Migrant tents removed from Guantanamo bay, satellite images show",
    "article_text": "The US has dismantled large parts of a camp built to house migrants at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show. President Donald Trump ordered the existing facility in Cuba be expanded to hold 30,000 migrants shortly after taking office in January.  However, only a small number were ever actually held at the base. The Pentagon spent around $38m (£28.7m) on deportation and detention operations at Guantanamo Bay in the first month of operations this year alone, a Department of Defense official said. But new images now show that around two-thirds of the roughly 260 tents installed as part of the operation had been removed as of 16 April. When asked about the removal of the tents, a US defence official said: \"This force adjustment represents a deliberate and efficient use of resources - not a reduction in readiness.\" The camp began construction just a day after President Trump announced the plan, with tents going up between 30 January and 12 February. Visible construction continued until 8 March, with scattered temporary structures appearing on satellite imagery. The construction marked a significant expansion to the Guantanamo Migrant Operations Center - a facility long used to hold some migrants and distinct from the high-security military prison used to house detainees suspected by the US of terrorism offences. The photos below show a mix of around 260 green and white military tents in an area to the south-west of the overall Guantanamo Bay base on 1 April. But by 10 April many had been removed. Subsequent lower resolution images show that as of 16 April a total of around 175 tents appeared to have been taken down. It's unclear how many migrants remain at the facility. Stephen Miller - the White House deputy chief of staff - insisted in an interview with Fox News last week that the base remained open and that \"a large number of foreign terrorist aliens\" were still there. The White House failed to reply to a request for comment on whether removal of the tents represented a reversal of Trump's plans to expand the detention facility. Despite Trump's pledge to send 30,000 migrants to the base, a US defence official indicated that the deployment to the island was to support a population of 2,500 detainees. BBC Verify's analysis of likely tent capacity estimated it at less than 3,000 people, based on US military sleeping guidelines. Trump said in January that the expansion would largely be used to hold undocumented migrants deemed to be dangerous criminals or national security risks. \"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back,\" he said of migrants. \"So we're going to send them to Guantanamo... it's a tough place to get out.\" But since its inception two and a half months ago, around 400 migrants have reportedly been sent there, with more than half since returned to facilities in the US. Others have been deported, such as 177 people who were sent to Venezuela via Honduras on 20 February. On 28 March, a group of five Democrat senators visited the base. In a statement, they said they were \"outraged by the scale and wastefulness of the Trump Administration's misuse of our military\", and described the camp as \"seemingly designed to undermine due process and evade legal scrutiny\". The delegation of senators said the cost to fly immigrants out of the US and detain them at Guantanamo Bay came to \"tens of millions of dollars a month\" and called it \"an insult to American taxpayers\". Additional reporting by Joshua Cheetham. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Sen Van Hollen posted photos meeting with Kilmar Ábrego García, whom the Trump administration has refused to return to the US. The charges will start in 180 days and rise in the coming years. The move would be a step towards a final deal derailed by a row at the White House in February. The US president separately said he is confident of making \"a very good deal\" with China. A hearing set to decide the fate of the convicted killers was delayed after bickering in court.",

    "title": "Travellers warned to expect Tenerife hotel protests",
    "article_text": "Holidaymakers heading to Tenerife in the Canary Islands are warned to prepare for disruption as hotel workers take part in strikes at the start of the Easter bank holiday weekend. Organisers say workers on the island are striking on Thursday and Friday in a row over pay and conditions. The industrial action was due to be across the Canary Islands but an agreement was reached on Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. Unions say around 80,000 hotel workers on Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro will still take action. The UKForeign Office warned travellersto expect disruption over the Easter weekend and to check their tour operator's advice and follow the advice of authorities. By law, strikers have to provide a \"minimum service\" but the Comisiones Obreras union, which called the strike, says hotel cleaning, food and entertainment do not fall into this category. It says suggestions that minimum service should include things such as reception and concierge or cleaning, restaurants and cooking, infringe upon the workers' right to strike. \"The imposition of minimum services constitutes an illegitimate, disproportionate, and legally unsustainable restriction on the fundamental right to strike,\" the union said in a press release. For many holidaymakers the noise of protests is disruptive and there are noticeably fewer people by the poolside. Fernando Cambon Solino is among those protesting. He moved to Tenerife for work. \"Everybody knows the Canary Islands,\" he said. \"You come here and you enjoy the sun, the beaches, the view. But it's not the same for the people who are working here.\" Rodrigo Padilla is a journalist in Tenerife and was at a protest supporting his mother who works as a waitress. He said the issue was with both pay and conditions. \"My mother leaves the house at 6am and it takes three or four hours to get to work and the same after her shift.\" The industrial action comes after a series of protests last year in the Canary Islands and Spanish mainland over mass tourism. Locals say tourism has pushed up housing costs beyond a sustainable level for people to live on the islands. They stress they are not against the tourism industry, which makes up 35% of the Canaries' economy, but there was a need for a more sustainable model that factored in environmental impacts such as water shortages and which puts less pressure on costs and housing. Police suspect the range was used by a weapons trafficking ring to test assault rifles and other arms. Citizens from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia would all have their claims fast-tracked. The Spanish architect was a devout Catholic and is best known for Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica. The couple is suspected of selling exotic cats online, including protected species such as white tigers. Stephen Howd, from Farnham, died in Tenerife in April 2023 after jumping from rocks into the sea.",

    "title": "Flintoff 'didn't leave house for six months' after Top Gear crash",
    "article_text": "Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff has said he did not leave the house for six months after his Top Gear crash, which left him with both physical and mental scars. The cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries in a crash while filming the BBC motoring programme in 2022. Speaking about the incident on ITV's The Jonathan Ross Show, Flintoff said he had struggled with \"crippling anxiety\" in the wake of the crash and has suffered from flashbacks and nightmares. The interview, to be broadcast on Saturday, comes ahead of a Disney+ documentary which promises an \"intimate and unprecedented look\" at Flintoff's sporting career and his return to the public eye after the crash. \"Afterwards, obviously there's the physical scars that I've got. But then the mental side of it,\" he told Jonathan Ross. \"I didn't leave the house for probably six or eight months. The only times I was leaving the house was for medical appointments and surgeries,\" he said. The former England all-rounder also revealed he had to have \"about five or six goes at leaving the room\" and \"have a chat with myself in the mirror\" to help overcome his anxiety before returning to the world of cricket as a coach. \"I'd not shown myself without a face mask to anyone. It was like starting again.\" In a trailer released on Thursday for the 90-minute Disney+ documentary, Flintoff describes his \"vivid\" memories of the crash and says he can remember \"everything about it\". A still image from shortly after the incident is shown, depicting staff and crew attending a crashed vehicle at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey. Flintoff said filming the upcoming documentary was \"quite strange\" at first. \"Since the accident, had the flashbacks, the nightmares and things… you're talking about it, you're talking about it quite a lot,\" he said. \"I enjoy watching the cricket bits, wish there was more of them in it. The hardest part is seeing people talk about you.\" He added: \"I retired so long ago, it almost seems like a different life. Like watching from the outside.\" Flintoff's family, Gavin & Stacey creator James Corden, and comedian Jack Whitehall also appear in the trailer for the documentary, which is streaming from 25 April. One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team. \"I think, with everything that's happened over the past few years, that's the one place I feel most comfortable,\" he told Jonathan Ross. \"That time when I probably needed it most, cricket embraced me again,\" he said. They 47-year-old returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India a year after the Top Gear crash. The acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month. In 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff. The Jonathan Ross Show airs on Saturday at 22:20 BST on ITV1, ITVX, STV and STV Player. The former cricket star will host a Christmas special of the ITV game show which first aired in 1981. Umar Mahmood, 18, had featured in Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams BBC series following young cricketers. Chris Harris says he told the BBC of his concerns three months before Freddie Flintoff was injured. Ian Stringer claims he was sacked by the BBC after blowing the whistle on an alleged flouting of Covid rules. The former cricket star will return with a second series of his cricket documentary Field of Dreams.",

    "title": "Review into body armour for prison staff after Abedi attack",
    "article_text": "The Prison Service will conduct a snap review into whether protective body armour should be made available to front-line staff, the justice secretary has said. Shabana Mahmood's announcement comes after Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi threw hot oil at prison officers and stabbed them with makeshift weapons at HMP Frankland on Saturday. In a statement, Mahmood also said that alongside an independent Ministry of Justice review into the attack, she would now be auditing the implementation of previous review recommendations into extremism in UK prisons. On Wednesday the Prison Officers' Association (POA) union called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to strengthen security for its members. The union's general secretary Steve Gillan said he was writing to the prime minister about the issue, which would include the supply of stab-proof vests for staff. A prison officer at HMP Frankland, in County Durham, also called for stab vests to be made available, warning staff could die unless security measures are urgently changed across all UK prisons. Speaking to the BBC on condition of anonymity, the prison officer said: \"I think stab vests would help us feel safer and I don't get why they won't give us those. \"There needs to be an urgent change in security measures or someone is going to die.\" It is thought that the Prison Service's snap review into protective body armour will present its findings in the next few months, and will consult unions. Since the attack, all prisoners in the separation unit where Abedi was held at HMP Frankland have been moved. Abedi himself has beenmoved to London's high-security Belmarsh prison, while the other six prisoners have been moved to HMP Woodhill, a source told the BBC. Access to kitchens in the UK's separation centres - used to house a small number of inmates deemed to be the most dangerous and extremist - was suspended by the government following the incident. \"But it is clear there are further questions to answer, and more that must be done,\" Mahmood said. Mahmood said she knew \"full well the dangers of the warped ideology of Islamist extremists\" and added: \"I will not tolerate it within our prisons.\" She said she would also audit the carrying out of 230 recommendations from 19 reviews looking at extremism in prisons over the last nine years. \"Wherever I find there is opportunity to strengthen our defences and better protect our staff and the public, I will do so,\" Mahmood said. Abedi planned and prepared the Manchester Arena attack in 2017 along with his brother, the suicide bomber Salman Abedi. He was jailed for life with a minimum 55 years in prison after being convicted of murdering 22 people. He was moved to a separation centre in Frankland after carrying out an earlier attack on prison officers in Belmarsh prison in 2020, for which three years and 10 months were added to his sentence. Four prison officers were injured during the incident on Saturday. One prison officer remains in hospital with serious injuries. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there must be accountability for how the attack could happen. An inmate was arrested on suspicion of murdering John Mansfield at HMP Whitemoor on Sunday. HMP Guys Marsh has rising levels of violence and a \"poor culture\", inspectors find. Police who were called to Long Lartin prison recovered a drone from the back of a car, Families of five of Hashem Abedi's victims tell the government he should not be allowed any privileges in prison, in a letter seen by the BBC.",

    "article_text": "Manchester United have now won as many matches in the Europa League under Ruben Amorim (six in eight games) as they have in 21 Premier League matches under him (W6 D5 L10). There are few more famous comeback wins in Manchester United's history than their 1999 Champions League triumph. That night at the Nou Camp, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r struck in injury time to overturn Bayern Munich's early 1-0 lead and win European club football's most coveted prize. While Thursday's night'sdramatic and unexpected comeback victoryagainst Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals is not of the same magnitude as that famous night 26 years ago, it motivated Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim to experience such moments himself. \"I was watching again the 1999 documentary to have some inspiration for these moments,\" Amorim revealed to TNT Sports after the 5-4 win against 10-man Lyon, during which United scored three goals in the final six minutes of extra time to seal a 7-6 aggregate win. \"It was a great night - 4-2 with one more player you think it's over, but here it is never over. I felt here everything is possible.\" United are 14th in the Premier League but despite the disappointing season they are just three games away from a European trophy and with it direct access to the Champions League next season. 'Three games from glory, Man Utd begin to show never-say-die DNA' Man Utd score three in thrilling extra time to reach Europa League semis 'More than a miracle' - how Man Utd won in remarkable extra time Harry Maguire scored in the 121st minute to send Manchester United through It had looked like United would make comfortable progress after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot in a commanding first-half display had them in control. But they proceeded to throw away the two-goal advantage as Corentin Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico struck to level the tie and take the game to extra time. Even though Lyon had Tolisso sent off in the final minute of normal time, Rayan Cherki put the French side ahead before Alexandre Lacazette's penalty looked to have sent them through, prompting some United fans to leave and beat the traffic. But then came the incredible fightback as Bruno Fernandes' penalty and Kobbie Mainoo's cool finish levelled matters, before Old Trafford erupted when Harry Maguire headed in the winner with seconds remaining. \"The sounds of the stadium was the best ever,\" Amorim added. \"Some people collect shirts, scarves, but I want to keep that sound, it's the best sound in the world. \"I feel for the people who had to leave at 4-2 because of the traffic, they will be gutted. \"We know we are underperforming and deserve all the critics, but we have time to make something special of this season.\" Maguire agreed with his manager that the Old Trafford atmosphere was something that helped the players stage one of the most memorable comebacks. \"To go down 4-2 in extra time to 10 men is not good enough, we opened ourselves too much,\" he said. \"But we dug in and showed great spirit, that's what this stadium does.\" Maguire's goal was the first 120th-minute winning goal scored in Europa League history and the first in a major European tie since Atletico Madrid beat Liverpool at Anfield in March 2020 This was only the second 5-4 win in United's history, along with their 5-4 victory over Arsenal in the top flight in February 1958. This is the first game in major European football history to see five goals scored after extra time. Fernandes has scored 14 penalty goals in major European competitions (three for Sporting, 11 for United) - only Robert Lewandowski (20), Cristiano Ronaldo (20) and Lionel Messi (18) have scored more.

    "title": "'You're going to have to put up with me for a bit longer'",
    "article_text": "Tottenham's win in Frankfurt ended a three match away losing run in the knockout rounds of major European competition \"You're going to have to put up with me for a little bit longer.\" On Wednesday, Ange Postecoglouadmitted to having \"no idea\"if he would still be in a job following the Europa League quarter-final  second leg trip to Eintracht Frankfurt. But, following Thursday's1-0 victory in Germany, Tottenham are through to a semi-final against Norway's Bodo/Glimt and have a first trophy in 17 years in their sights. \"Our fans have been through a tough time. Hopefully this gives them something to look forward to,\" said Postecoglou, whose  Spurs side are 15th in the Premier League. \"I'm the same coach that I was yesterday. The players have never lost belief. People like to mock and diminish my achievements but I'll leave that there. \"I don't care, it doesn't bother me, it doesn't affect what I do. For me, it's always about the dressing room. Do the players believe? Do the staff believe? \"That's much more important than what others may make of me. \"So, unfortunately for a lot of you, you're going to have to put up with me for a little bit longer.\" Despite being on the way to equalling their lowest Premier League finish, set in 1994, Postecoglou said he never lost faith in his players and feels his players have kept faith in him. \"They've been so united in believing in what we're trying to achieve here,\" the Australian manager said. \"And that is what gave me heart all along that if we got our own slice of luck in terms of getting some players back [from injury], that I really believed this team could achieve. That is what keeps driving me. \"Not at any stage have I felt they lost any belief in me or what we're doing. That is crucial when you're having a difficult season, but there is also a season of opportunity there.\" Postecoglou, with his back against the wall, lives to fight another day. We will never know whether Tottenham would have relieved him of his duties had they gone out of the Europa League on Thursday - but he was certainly under huge pressure heading into a game that was probably the biggest of his reign so far. Victory buys the Australian some time - you can't see a scenario where Tottenham would sack him before the semi-final. But while it keeps the wolves from the door for now, he isn't out of the woods yet. While Europa League success is a factor, it won't be the only consideration for Spurs when it comes to them deciding whether Postecoglou is head coach next season. Their Premier League form, which has be extremely poor, will be taken into account as will Postecoglou's connection with the supporters, which has been mixed to say the least. With a win in Germany, Postecoglou has given himself a fighting chance, although this result alone is unlikely to be enough to keep his job safe in the longer term.

    "title": "'More than a miracle' - how Man Utd won in remarkable extra time",
    "article_text": "Manchester United scored three goals in seven minutes to turn the tie around There were 109 minutes on the clock at Old Trafford when Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette effectively ended Manchester United's season. Thousands of fans headed for the exits with United 4-2 down on the night, 6-4 on aggregate, 11 minutes left. Game over. \"United need more than a miracle,\" Rio Ferdinand said on TNT Sports commentary. Then the miracle unfolded. With 11 minutes left, it looked more likely that Lyon would score again than United would produce a comeback But as the famous song goes, Man Utd will never die. Bruno Fernandes, perhaps the only United player to have done himself justice this season, pulled one back from the penalty spot after Casemiro was kicked during a frantic scrabble. Six minutes remaining. Bruno Fernandes converted his penalty before grabbing the ball and rushing back to the centre circle for the restart In the 120th minute, substitute Kobbie Mainoo cut inside his man and bent a stunning, curling strike into the bottom far corner. It's been a difficult campaign for the young England midfielder after shooting to stardom last season, but this was a moment befitting of his quality. All square on the night and on aggregate. Penalties looming, six weeks after suffering shootout elimination in the FA Cup. Mainoo's second goal in all competitions this season will be long remembered Not today said Harry Maguire, the ultimate scapegoat figure of United's steady decline who continues to step up in big moments. Less than a minute after Mainoo struck, Maguire was wheeling away in delerious celebration after heading in the winner. Bedlam. \"I've never seen anything like that as a spectator. It was an amazing thing. We saw so many fans leaving when it was 4-2 and you thought that was over,\" former United defender Rio Ferdinand said on TNT Sports. \"I said on commentary it would take more than a miracle to get back into it and now I'm actually a believer because that was outrageous.\" Maguire rose to score on 120+1 minutes, just a minute after Mainoo Maguire's winning goal caused chaos at Old Trafford Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson was similarly gobsmacked on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"The scenes inside Old Trafford are something else,\" he said. \"I have seen nothing like it. Bedlam. The stewards are on the pitch, fans are on the pitch and staff are on the pitch. Andre Onana is doing laps of celebrations. Old Trafford has not seen scenes like this for many a year. \"I don't think I have ever seen a game like that. They looked dead and buried. I have not seen that character from them all season. \"Superlatives, you run out of them.\" Never before have five goals been scored during a period of extra time in a European knockout fixture. United's comeback was as ludicrous as it was improbable, but when the Theatre of Dreams is concerned, strange things have been known to happen. \"You've seen special things happen at this club. I think back to the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Liverpool [in 1999]. It reminded me slightly, I know that's only 2-1 and this was 5-4,\" said former United midfielder Paul Scholes on TNT Sports. \"I always feel like when you get one here you've got a chance.\" Perhaps United defender Leny Yoro summed it up best. \"Honestly, I don't understand what's happened. It was crazy! The fans helped us to do it. When you hear the fans, even at 4-2 you know we can do it,\" he told TNT Sports. \"We needed to believe and if you don't believe you cannot win. This is what the fans deserve - they give everything at every game.\" United are 14th in the Premier League and will finish the season with their lowest-ever Premier League points tally. But now they have something to play for. Get past Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals next month, and they will contest the final at Bilbao's San Mames. Win that and they will play in the Champions League next season. Fans won't be thinking about that though - they'll be reliving the scenes at Old Trafford on Thursday for years to come.

    "title": "Dobey beats Bunting for Rotterdam triumph",
    "article_text": "Dobey's previous Premier League nightly win was in Belfast more than two years ago Chris Dobey won his first Premier League night of 2025 with a 6-2 win over Stephen Bunting on an evening of shocks in Rotterdam. The all-English final was one few would have predicted, featuring the bottom two going into night 11. Dobey was in his first final since a 6-1 opening-night loss to Luke Humphries, having overcome Nathan Aspinall 6-2 in the semi-finals. The Northumberland-born player, 34, surged into a 5-1 lead against Bunting and sealed an impressive success with an average of 101.84 for his second career Premier League nightly win. Dobey, sixth in the table, is now only three points off the four play-off places, while just five points separate third-placed Aspinall and Rob Cross in seventh. \"I believe I can still get into the top four. I've got a good chance next week if I keep this performance,\" he said. \"I'm a fighter, I've come through big matches where I've been cruising and ended up losing to get back among the elite. I'm here to win, I'll be here until the end.\" Bunting won two deciders to reach the final as he defeated Dutchman Michael van Gerwen and world champion Luke Littler. In breezy conditions at the Ahoy Arena, Premier League champion Littler edged Rob Cross 6-5 in the quarter-finals, despite his opponent's 110 average. The 18-year-old â leading the league and seeking a record fifth nightly win of the year - opted for heavier darts, up three grams to 26g, in a bid to keep his arrows on track. And he looked set for another last-leg win after fighting back from 5-2 down against Bunting, but missed double nine on a 138 checkout. All the updates from night 11 in Rotterdam Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Aspinall wins Premier League night in Manchester Price was not happy after his quarter-final loss Several players mentioned a breeze on stage in Rotterdam and Gerwyn Price was not happy after his 6-3 defeat by Aspinall in the last eight. Aspinall warned he had a shoulder injury beforehand, but there was no sign of discomfort as he saw off his Welsh opponent. Price said afterwards on Instagram: \"This week was pointless and we move on to next week. The darts were blowing everywhere. \"Hopefully we will stop coming here and look for alternative venues. If you think it's the same for both players you are as daft as you look.\" Cross was on a five-match losing run against Littler, but looked to be on course to seal the decider before his opponent nailed a 145 finish. The 2018 world champion outscored Littler on the averages by 110.15 to 108.56, but the teenager prevailed again. Home hero Van Gerwen went down 6-5 to Bunting to disappoint the Dutch fans. The seven-time Premier League champion remains outside the play-off places, having only progressed to a solitary nightly final across the opening 10 weeks. Dobey produced arguably his best performance of the campaign so far as he stunned an out-of-sorts Humphries with a 6-3 success, where he led 6-0 on 180s. Final Chris Dobey 6-2 Stephen Bunting Semi-finals Chris Dobey 6-2 Nathan Aspinall Stephen Bunting 6-5 Luke Littler Quarter-finals Chris Dobey 6-3 Luke Humphries Gerwyn Price 3-6 Nathan Aspinall Stephen Bunting 6-5 Michael van Gerwen Luke Littler 6-5 Rob Cross Premier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night. Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "title": "Flintoff 'didn't leave house for six months' after crash",
    "article_text": "Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff has said he did not leave the house for six months after his Top Gear crash, which left him with both physical and mental scars. The cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries in a crash while filming the BBC motoring programme in 2022. Speaking about the incident on ITV's The Jonathan Ross Show, Flintoff said he had struggled with \"crippling anxiety\" in the wake of the crash and has suffered from flashbacks and nightmares. The interview, to be broadcast on Saturday, comes ahead of a Disney+ documentary which promises an \"intimate and unprecedented look\" at Flintoff's sporting career and his return to the public eye after the crash. \"Afterwards, obviously there's the physical scars that I've got. But then the mental side of it,\" he told Jonathan Ross. \"I didn't leave the house for probably six or eight months. The only times I was leaving the house was for medical appointments and surgeries,\" he said. The former England all-rounder also revealed he had to have \"about five or six goes at leaving the room\" and \"have a chat with myself in the mirror\" to help overcome his anxiety before returning to the world of cricket as a coach. \"I'd not shown myself without a face mask to anyone. It was like starting again.\" In a trailer released on Thursday for the 90-minute Disney+ documentary, Flintoff describes his \"vivid\" memories of the crash and says he can remember \"everything about it\". A still image from shortly after the incident is shown, depicting staff and crew attending a crashed vehicle at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey. Flintoff said filming the upcoming documentary was \"quite strange\" at first. \"Since the accident, had the flashbacks, the nightmares and things… you're talking about it, you're talking about it quite a lot,\" he said. \"I enjoy watching the cricket bits, wish there was more of them in it. The hardest part is seeing people talk about you.\" He added: \"I retired so long ago, it almost seems like a different life. Like watching from the outside.\" Flintoff's family, Gavin & Stacey creator James Corden, and comedian Jack Whitehall also appear in the trailer for the documentary, which is streaming from 25 April. One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team. \"I think, with everything that's happened over the past few years, that's the one place I feel most comfortable,\" he told Jonathan Ross. \"That time when I probably needed it most, cricket embraced me again,\" he said. They 47-year-old returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India a year after the Top Gear crash. The acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month. In 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff. The Jonathan Ross Show airs on Saturday at 22:20 BST on ITV1, ITVX, STV and STV Player. The former cricket star will host a Christmas special of the ITV game show which first aired in 1981. Umar Mahmood, 18, had featured in Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams BBC series following young cricketers. Chris Harris says he told the BBC of his concerns three months before Freddie Flintoff was injured. Ian Stringer claims he was sacked by the BBC after blowing the whistle on an alleged flouting of Covid rules. The former cricket star will return with a second series of his cricket documentary Field of Dreams.",

    "title": "ICJ hears Sudan case accusing UAE of ‘complicity in genocide’",
    "article_text": "The international court of justice will rule in the next few weeks on whether theUnited Arab Emiratescan be plausibly found “complicit in the commission of genocide” by arming the Rapid Support Forces militia in Sudan’s civil war. The case was brought bySudan, whose acting justice minister, Muawia Osman, told the world court in The Hague last week that the country’s “ongoing genocide would not be possible without the complicity of the UAE, including the shipment of arms to the RSF”. Sudan wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war. Responding for the UAE, Reem Ketait, a top foreign ministry official, told the court: “The idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth. This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.” Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”, she said. The case could turn on a “reservation” that the UAE entered when it signed up to the genocide convention in 2005, to the effect that it would not allow a dispute concerning its compliance with the convention to be settled by the ICJ. The UAE says the reservation precludes the ICJ from even forming a preliminary view as to whether the UAE is complicit in acts of genocide. It would be a severe blow to the UAE, which places great store by its international reputation, if the ICJ did anything but strike the claim from the list. But at a minimum the case’s existence may serve to put further pressure on all the external partners accused of backing the warring factions to think more carefully about the support they provide. Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between the military and the RSF broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both sides have been accused of abuses in the course of the war. The UK and other western countries have limited power to stop the fighting. More influence rests with regional powers such as Egypt, which has longstanding ties to the Sudanese army, and the UAE, which has long been accused of arming the RSF – allegations it denies. On Tuesday a British-led attempt to establish a contact group to facilitate a ceasefire fell apartwhen Arab states refused to sign a joint communiqueafter a conference in London. Analysts say UAE’s interest in Sudan stems from overlapping desires to gain political influence there at the expense of Saudi Arabia, exploit its natural resources, and prevent the spread of political Islam, which UAE sees as a threat to its security. As with many claims for measures to prevent a plausible genocide, the case, which relates specifically to the RSF’s treatment of the Masalit people in Darfur, is being heard at speed. The Sudanese government only filed its application on 5 March. Prof Eirik Bjorge, a law professor representing Sudan, told the court: “There can be no doubt that the Masalit people is currently being subjected to genocide, and that there is serious evidence that the UAE is failing to prevent this and is complicit.” Bjorge quoted a panel of UN experts who in January 2024 assessed as “credible” allegations that cargo planes coming from the UAE to an airport in eastern Chad were transporting weapons to the RSF. He also referenced Sudanese intelligence assessments that a field hospital built by the UAE next to the airport in September 2024 was “the primary supply and support hub for the enemy [RSF]” and that Chadian flights transporting military aid were continuing as of March of this year. Sudan’s lawyers pointed out in court that the Biden administration had announced in January that seven RSF-owned companies in the UAE had been targeted for sanctions, at the same time as the US declared that RSF rebels had committed genocide. The UAE told the ICJ that none of the seven entities held an active business licence in the UAE, “nor are they currently operating in the UAE”. Sudan also cited research by Yale Humanitarian Research Lab that identified and located four heavy artillery pieces consistent with a type of Chinese-produced 155mm howitzer artillery gun, which it considered were engaged in the 12-day bombardment ofZamzam campin December last year. The Yale lab said the UAE was “the only country” known to have bought this type of howitzer. The UAE’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Ameirah AlHefeiti, told the court the UAE had not provided arms to either of the warring parties. Ketait said the UAE regarded the war as an entirely avoidable factional struggle and accused the Sudanese government of avoiding all UAE-backed efforts at mediation. Alison Macdonald KC, for the UAE, said the evidence produced of UAE supply of arms was thin, recycled or entirely self-serving. She added that the next UN panel of experts report, due to be published soon, would provide “absolutely no support for the applicant’s claims” – an assertion that is likely to turn on whether the panel of experts was able to establish the content of cargo shipped from the UAE to Chad.",

    "title": "Move over, Med diet – plantains and cassava can be as healthy as tomatoes and olive oil, say researchers",
    "article_text": "Plantains, cassava and fermented banana drink should be added to global healthy eating guidelines alongside the olive oil, tomatoes and red wine of the Mediterranean diet, say researchers who found the traditional diet of people living in Tanzania’s Kilimanjaro region had a positive impact on the body’s immune system. Traditional foods enjoyed in rural villages also had a positive impact on markers of inflammation, the researchers found ina study published this monthin the journal Nature Medicine. Dr Quirijn de Mast, one of the paper’s authors, said they were now in a race against time to record and study the potential benefits of African heritage diets before they disappear as people move to cities and adopt western-style eating habits. “Time is ticking because you see that these heritage diets are being replaced more and more by western diets,” he said. “We will lose so much interesting information [from which] we can learn – and not only for Africa.” In previous research, the team had established that people following the traditional way of life in rural areas had a different immune-system profile to urban dwellers, with more anti-inflammatory proteins. Chronic inflammation is a key driver of many non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including rheumatoidarthritis and Alzheimer’s disease. The new study set out to establish whether diet played a role. For a fortnight, 77 young men in their 20s and 30s were switched from heritage to western-style diets, or the reverse – with blood samples taken at the start and end, and again four weeks later. Meals on the heritage dietmenuincluded green plantain mixed with kidney beans, boiled chicken served with green vegetables and brown rice and beans. On the western-style menu, they included pizza, fried chicken and french fries and spaghetti served with beef stew. Those newly adopting a western-style diet saw inflammatory markers in their blood increase and tests suggested their immune systems did not respond as well to infections. They also gained weight. By contrast, switching from a western diet to a heritage diet had a largely anti-inflammatory effect, and blood markers linked to metabolic problems fell. In a third arm of the trial, participants following a western-style diet were asked to drink the local fermented banana beverage, known asmbege, for one week. That group also saw improvements in markers of inflammation. For Dr Godfrey Temba, the first author of the paper and a lecturer at KCMC University in Moshi, Tanzania, the findings were not a surprise. “When we are in most of the villages, talking to elderly people [of] 80 or 90 years, they are very healthy. They don’t have any health complications [and] they tell you about consuming this type of diet and this beverage since they were 25.” However, the diet and its benefits have not been explored and documented – unlike the traditional diets of the Mediterranean and Nordic countries, which arepromoted by the World Health Organizationfor their beneficial effects. Temba said: “We think this is the right time … so that [African heritage diets] can be also included in the global guidelines of diets, because they really have a health benefit – but because it’s not studied extensively, it’s not easy to convince [people] that they are healthy, because you don’t have enough data.” The diet’s components, such as flavonoids and other polyphenols, and its impact on the gut microbiome were likely to play a part in the observed effects, De Mast said. The study was conducted only in men for logistical reasons, but the researchers said they would expect similar findings in women, and for benefits to be maintained over time if people continued the diets. Many African countries are facing rising rates of NCDs such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. De Mast, who holds positions at KCMC University and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said research priorities in Africa had historically been determined by countries in the global north with a focus on infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. “Research on [things like] immunology has been neglected. I hope it will change now, with the rapid rise in NCDs, because that will be a major challenge for health systems across Africa.” Nutritional guidelines also tended to “translate what we know from the north to Africa”, he said. “I think you should have, really, region-specific recommendations based on scientific data.” The team is now testing what impact adopting a heritage diet can have on Tanzanians living with obesity, including whether it can boost their response to vaccines, and plan to compare different regional heritage diets. “There’s so much diversity in dietary patterns across Africa – or [even just] in Tanzania,” said De Mast. “Godfrey is in Kilimanjaro region, but 30km down the road there is the Maasai tribe and their diet is entirely different. It’s mainly animal protein based – still, traditionally, cardiovascular disease was almost absent. “So I think this is just the beginning of research looking at these heritage diets.”",

    "article_text": "A US man has been shot dead after hijacking a small passenger plane and injuring two passengers in the Caribbean nation ofBelize. Fourteen passengers were onboard the aircraft when the hijacker, identified as Akinyela Sawa Taylor, took control of the flight at knifepoint. Two passengers were injured, including one who was stabbed in the back. Taylor ordered the pilot to take him out of the country, but was then shot in the chest by another passenger, Belize’s commissioner of police, Chester Williams, told local journalists. After circling erratically over the coastline near Belize City, with depleting fuel, the passengers’ ordeal ended when the plane landed safely at Philip Goldson international airport. Taylor was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and one of the injured passengers was in a critical condition after being stabbed in the back. Details of the incident remained sparse, but Williams said passengers narrowly escaped a more serious tragedy as the aircraft ran out of fuel as it landed. The plane was en route from Corozal to San Pedro when the hijacking took place. After being contacted by passengers onboard, police were deployed to various airports, unsure of where the plane would land. A rescue helicopter was also tracking the aircraft. “We were hoping that we don’t have to move from a search-and-rescue operation to a search-and-recovery operation. The helicopter was to follow the plane to see where it would land. So if they had decided to crash-land the plane in the sea, or on one of the islands, we would have been there quickly to respond and provide assistance to those passengers who might not be able to survive,” he told reporters. The hijacker’s motives are unclear, but Williams said Taylor had previously been refused entry into Belize, and it was not clear how he was able to get through its borders. Williams said there would be a review of security procedures for domestic flights. A spokesperson for the US embassy told reporters that it was working with Belize to investigate the incident. “We share that commitment with them to make sure that Belize is safe, the airlines are safe, the tourists coming here are safe, borders are safe and secure,” he said.",

    "article_text": "AMassachusettsfamily is demanding answers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), complaining its agents smashed a car window with a large hammer and detained a man whom they say had applied for asylum. A lawyer for the family also claims agents were not looking for the man in the car, Juan Francisco Mendez, when they grabbed him on Monday in New Bedford while he was driving to a dental appointment. He is now believed to have been taken into Ice detention. The lawyer, Ondine Galvez-Sniffin, told the Associated Press in an interview that the agents claimed they were looking for another man with a different name before they dragged Mendez and his wife out of the car. The incident, recorded on video by Mendez’s wife, Marilu Domingo Ortiz, shows Ice agents using a long-handled hammer to smash the car window to apparently seize Mendez. The family believes he is being held at a facility in Dover, New Hampshire. “When I arrived on the scene, my client’s wife was sobbing. She was crying. She was shaking,” Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that Mendez yelled “help me” in Spanish as he was driven away in handcuffs. “I walked over to the car and I see the busted window, the glass all over the back seat, and I was shocked,” the lawyer added. “I’ve been doing immigration work for 27 years and this was the first time that I saw such violent, drastic measures being taken.” A spokesperson for Ice did not return repeated requests for comment. Another lawyer for Mendez, Ryan Sullivan, said a federal judge in New Hampshire ruled on Wednesday that the government must give his attorneys 72 hours notice before moving him anywhere. Sullivan believes that is enough time to determine next steps in his case. Ortiz and her nine-year-old son have already been given legal protection under an asylum status, over fears of facing persecution if they returned to their nativeGuatemala. Mendez was in the process of applying for what is called derivative asylum, where you can be granted asylum if a family member already has it. The woman said she was scared when Ice broke into their car and never expected someone from her family would be detained like this. “We came here to do honest work. To fight for our family,” Ortiz said through an interpreter. “What they did, or what they’re doing right now, no, it’s not fair. We don’t deserve that treatment.” Ortiz said she was worried about the toll the detention was taking, especially on her son. “He has already stopped eating because of what we’re going through,” she said. “I just hope that they release my husband so he can come back with us and that my son can be with him as well.” New Bedford’s mayor, Jon Mitchell, in a post on X, said the incident “raises questions that require clear answers”, including why local police weren’t alerted beforehand. He also questioned whether Ice agents are targeting criminals as the Trump administration promised or, rather, “engaging in an indiscriminate round-up of individuals with uncertain immigration status”. Galvez-Sniffin said Mendez had been in the country for four years and worked in the seafood industry in New Bedford, that he had no criminal record was applying for asylum. He was fingerprinted in December, she said, adding that nothing turned up in terms of a criminal record. “There really was no reason to treat him the way that he and his wife were treated.” Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that agents refused to look at the paperwork showing that he had applied for asylum.",

    "article_text": "Cory Booker plans to travel toEl Salvador, a source familiar with the New Jersey senator’s itinerary said, as Democrats seek to pressure theTrump administrationto return a wrongly deported Maryland resident. Booker’s trip to the Central American country would come after the Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen traveled there this week to meet with his constituentKilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian national deported last month in what the Trump administration acknowledged was an “administrative error”. Despite a supreme court ruling saying his administration must “facilitate” Ábrego García’s return, Trump has refused to take steps to do so, and El Salvador’s government on Wednesdaydenied Van Hollen a meetingwith the deportee. Ábrego García’s case has become a rallying cry for Democrats, who argue it is a sign ofDonald Trump’s reckless approach to immigration enforcement and willingness to defy court orders. An immigration judge in 2019 had given Ábrego García protection from deportation, finding that he may face retaliation if he returns to El Salvador. Booker wrote on X earlier this week: “The Supreme Court was clear: theTrump administrationmust act to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García to the United States. There is no room for debate – yet Trump is refusing, in defiance of a lawful court order. “Every member of Congress should be standing up for the Constitution and demanding that the administration act to return Mr. Ábrego García to the U.S. and to his family.” Trump administration officials have countered by accusing Democrats of caring more about undocumented immigrants than US citizens. On Monday, the Republican congressman Riley Moore toured El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), where US authorities say Ábrego García is being held, and gave a thumbs up in front of a cell packed with inmates. Several other Democratic lawmakers have signaled they would like to visit El Salvador and Cecot, including Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic caucus, and Robert Garcia, Yassamin Ansari and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, all members of the investigative House oversight committee.

    "title": "Kilmar Ábrego García’s wife rejects Trump officials’ depictions of him as ‘violent’",
    "article_text": "The wife ofKilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man unlawfully deported to a mega-prison inEl Salvador, has strongly criticized theTrump administration’s attempt to smear his character, saying a temporary restraining order against him was “out of caution” and that “he is a loving partner and father” who is being denied justice. Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she “acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar” when she got the civil protective order in 2021, according to a statement emailed tothe Baltimore Sun. Vasquez Sura said she decided not to follow through with the civil court process because “things did not escalate” with her husband. “We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect,” she wrote. “That is not a justification for ICE’s action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation.” TheTrump administrationhas refused to attempt to return Ábrego García to the US after he was mistakenly placed on a deportation flight to El Salvador last month, despite legal rulings ordering his return. The Trump administration claims that Ábrego García is a member of MS-13, a gang the administration has listed as a foreign terrorist organization. Ábrego García, through his attorneys, has denied any affiliation. He has no criminal record in either the US orEl Salvador. A federal judge in Maryland ordered the return of Ábrego García to the US. The supreme court upheld the ruling last week. But Stephen Miller, Trump’s immigration adviser, has claimed that the supreme court actually ruled the other way, interpreting the ruling as saying the administration did not have to try to bring him back. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, claimed on Monday that he has no power to return Ábrego García to the US. El Salvador has been paid $6m to accept deportations from the US to its mega-prison, theTerrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), which is notorious for its reportedhuman rights abuses. The Trump administration released documents on Wednesday that purported to support its claim that Ábrego García was a member of MS-13 – specifically a police report from Maryland in 2019 in which Prince George’s county police described approaching Ábrego García and three other people at a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville. The report said Ábrego García was wearing “a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents” on the bills, claiming that this was “indicative of the Hispanic gang culture”. Police handed Ábrego García over to immigration authorities, but an immigration judge then barred him from being sent to El Salvador,reportedly sayingÁbrego García had proved a “well-founded fear of future persecution” from local gangs there, allowing him to the stay in the US and receive a work permit. Earlier this year, however, Ábrego García was apprehended in an Ikea parking lot and on 15 March he was deported to El Salvador, where he is currently being held at the mega-prison.

The Department of Homeland Securitypostedimages of court documents from the 2021 restraining order, saying: “Kilmar Abrego Garcia had a history of violence and was not the upstanding ‘Maryland Man’ the media has portrayed him as.” The documents include allegations that Ábrego García “punched and scratched”, as well as “ripped off [the] shirt” of Vasquez Sura, and “grabbed and bruised” her. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said in a statement: “We hear far too much in the mainstream media about sob stories of gang members and criminal illegals and not enough about their victims.” Separately, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “You would think we deported a candidate for Father of the Year.” The US attorney general,Pam Bondi, said Wednesday: “America is safer because he is gone. Maryland is safer because he is gone. And that woman that he is married to and that child he had with her? They are safer tonight because he is out of our country and sitting in El Salvador where he belongs.” Vasquez Sura strongly disputed those claims. She said in her statement: “Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.”",

    "title": "Uyghur rights group calls on hotel chains not to ‘sanitise’ China abuses in Xinjiang",
    "article_text": "Almost 200 international hotels are operating or planning to open inXinjiang, despite calls from human rights groups for global corporations not to help “sanitise” the Chinese government’s human rights abuses in the region, a report has said. The report by the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) identified 115 operational hotels which the organisation said “benefit from a presence in the Uyghur region”. At least another 74 were in various stages of construction or planning, the report said. The UHRP said some of the hotels also had exposure or links of concern to forced labour and labour transfer programmes. The explosion in hotel numbers coincides with the Chinese government’s efforts to push Xinjiang as a tourism destination after years of criticism and sanctions over its crackdown on the local Muslim population. In 2024 Xinjiang recorded about 300 million visitors, according to state media, includingalmost 5 million foreign tourists– 50% more than in 2023. Several world governments and legal groups have declared the government’s actions against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to be a genocide, although this has not been settled in any international court. The UN says that China’s policies in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch has said the policies – which include mass internment and re-education, forced labour, and criminalisation of acts of religious expression – amount to crimes against humanity. China’s government denies all accusations of abuse and mistreatment in Xinjiang. Human rights groups have argued that the presence of foreign enterprises in Xinjiang lends legitimacy to the Chinese government’s crackdown, and called on firms to leave. In November, the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen sold its Xinjiang factory after years of pressure. But as Beijing promotes Xinjiang as holiday destination for domestic and international tourists, the spotlight has turned to foreign tourism businesses. In 2023 the Guardian reported on a number oftour operators advertising holiday packages to Xinjiang. Now, hotel companies appear to be increasing their business there. Well known brands, including France’s Accor, Hilton, the British IHG Group, Marriott and Wyndham are among hundreds of existing or developing hotels across the region. The sites listed include luxurious upmarket hotels in city locations as well as ski resort areas, where the Chinese government has heavily invested in winter tourism. The report said three companies – Hilton, IHG, and Wyndham – all had hotels, and potentially paid fees or taxes – in areas administered by China’s state-owned paramilitary entity, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). Sanctions have been passed on the XPCC by several governments, including the US, UK and EU, over “serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities”. Peter Irwin, associate director for research and advocacy at UHRP, said: “This kind of hotel expansion, from international chains in particular, falls squarely within the Chinese government’s own strategy to try and normalise the public’s understanding of what’s going on in the Uyghur region. “The government can point to these major companies entrenching themselves in the region as evidence that everything is normal, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.” One recently opened hotel, by a Hilton franchisee, was built on the site of a mosque in Khotan that was demolished amid a government campaign in which more than 10,000 religious sites were destroyed. “Building a hotel on the site of a demolished mosque is particularly egregious, given that the Chinese government has undertaken a broad campaign to tear down mosques across the Uyghur Region since 2017,” the report said. It said the hotel was not visible on English-language travel booking sites but China’s CTrip showed reviews dating back to about mid-2024. Tuesday’s report assessed government records, corporate records and media articles, to determine whether hotels had other links of concern, including ownership structures with particular Chinese companies and involvement in state programmes identified by human rights researchers. In another case study, the report identified links between Accor’s Grand Mercure Urumqi Hualing hotel anda training and employment programme. A state mediareportfrom one symposium said a human resources director from the hotel had visited and signed letters of intent with many students. The symposium was targeted at young people and “surplus rural labour” workers from ethnic minorities, as part of the government’s poverty alleviation and “social stability” goals. The government says its Xinjiang employment schemes are part of “poverty alleviation” efforts but has been accused of forced labour and labour transfer programmes that breach human rights. The report also said Accor’s strategic partner in China, H World Group Limited, had used a recruitment and training programme, Xinjiang Aid, which a US congressional investigation found contributed to the risk of human trafficking. In 2020 four US agencieswarnedthe programme may make use of internment camp labour or workers from “abusive labour programmes”. “These hotels continue to operate and expand business in a region in which Uyghur families have been torn apart by internment, imprisonment, forced labor programmes, and enforced disappearances,” said Dr Henryk Szadziewski, co-author of the report and director of research at the UHRP. The report called for the hotel chains to initiate “immediate reviews” of their operations, given they had all made pledges to adopt international human rights standards. It urged them to freeze expansion plans, halt operations and sever business ties. “They should publicly disclose their decision to exit, conduct heightened human rights due diligence, and engage with Uyghur rights organisations for remediation,” the report said. The Guardian contacted Accor, Hilton, IHG, Marriott, and Wyndham for comment. A spokeswoman for Accor said the company and its partners “adhere to our group [corporate social responsibility] Charter, which includes standards for how employees are treated. We are dedicated to ensuring that our operations align with these standards.” The spokeswoman said other elements put to them, including the claims about employment programs, were “not accurate”, but did not elaborate. The other companies have not responded. Timothy Grose a professor of China studies with expertise in ethnic policy at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, said investing in the region’s tourism was not a bad thing in principle. “In fact, the investments could bring great benefits to local economies,” he said. “However, if recent history repeats itself, the construction of new hotels, which may attract thousands of tourists, will unlikely translate into improvements in the lives of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other minoritised groups.” “Perhaps most immediately, shiny hotels and droves of tourists attempt to paint the picture that human rights abuses certainly cannot be occurring in such a ‘happy’ and ‘thriving’ place. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to have achieved some degree of success.”",

    "title": "Nvidia’s CEO makes surprise visit to Beijing after US restricts chip sales to China",
    "article_text": "The chief executive of the American chip maker Nvidia visited Beijing on Thursday, days after the USissued fresh restrictionson sales of the only AI chip it was still allowed to sell to China. Jensen Huang’s surprise visit was on the invitation of a trade organisation, according to a social media account affiliated with state media. The official broadcasterChinaCentral Television said Huang met Ren Hongbin, the head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, where he said he hopes “to continue to cooperate with China”. China Daily, the ruling Communist party’s official English-language outlet, published a photo of Huang in the capital, saying the trip came “three months after pledging to continue cooperation with #China during his last visit”. It added the hashtag #OpportunityChina, which it has previously used in posts promoting US-China exports. The visit caps a tumultuous week forNvidia. The US restrictions, announced on Tuesday, apply to shipments of its H20 datacentre GPUs, a lower-powered version of other Nvidia chips, which was designed specifically to comply with Biden-era restrictions on sales to China. The US government, which is battling China in the race for AI supremacy, told Nvidia the new rules were designed to address the risk that its products might be “used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China”. The company has said the new controlswill cost it $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in earnings. Shares of the company slumped about 7% on Wednesday. US restrictions on tech supplies to China, as well as extensive tariffs on foreign imports, have put enormous pressure on the tech industry, and Nvidia’s stock is among many in the sector to have fallen steeply in recent weeks. Trump has threatened separate tariffs on the global semiconductor industry, in an effort to bring manufacturing bases on to US soil. The fresh Nvidia chip restrictions came a day after the semiconductor company saidit would build up to $500bn worth of AI infrastructurein the US over the next four years. Nvidia designs its chips but outsources its production to contractors such asTaiwanSemiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC has also pledged massive investment projects in the US, which Trump said would exempt it from the tariffs. The White House said in a statement that Nvidia’s decision was “the Trump effect in action”. The Financial Timesreportedthat Huang also met the DeepSeek founder, Liang Wenfeng, in Beijing, to discuss new chip designs for the AI company that would not trigger the new US bans. In January the shock emergence of DeepSeek, an AI chatbot seemingly much more advanced than existing rivals but developed for far less investment, sent the tech industry into a tailspin, and a global sell-off of shares. The US House of Representatives’ China committee has written to Nvidia asking it to explain whetherDeepSeekobtained export-controlled chips to power its artificial intelligence app and, if so, how. It has said the app poses a “profound threat” to national security. Huang has said publicly that Nvidia will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump but has promised that nothing will stop the global advance of AI. “We’ll continue to do that and we’ll be able to do that just fine,” the Taiwan-born entrepreneur told reporters last year. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Huang’s arrival in Beijing caused a stir on Chinese and Taiwanese social media. He’s acelebrity figure in Taiwan; on recent visits large crowds of fans greeted him and there was breathless reporting of his itinerary. Trump’s tariffs have sparked chaos in global markets and among governments, including US allies. After announcing a range of tariffs against different countries, which he accused of “ripping off” the US by having a trade surplus, Trump later drew them all back to 10% (except China, which he kept at 145%) for a 90-day pause. He claimed governments were begging to negotiate with the US to rewrite trade agreements. On Thursday he posted on social media that there had been “big progress” in talks with Japan the previous day. Japan had not expected the US president to get involved in Wednesday’s talks, viewing them as a preliminary, fact-finding mission, a sign that Trump wants to keep tight control over negotiations with dozens of countries expected over the coming days and weeks. Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, warned that the talks “won’t be easy”, but he said the president had “expressed his desire to give the negotiations … the highest priority”.

    "title": "Putin’s play for an Indonesian airbase was always likely to fail – but Russia has wider ambitions",
    "article_text": "Adefence industry reportclaiming that Russia requested a permanent base for its warplanes in Indonesia’s remote Papua region, right on Australia’s northern doorstep, sent Canberra into a tailspin. But in Indonesia, it was thefrenzy whipped up in Australia’s tight election campaignthat came as the real surprise. Foreign policy and defence experts are highly sceptical about the prospect that Jakarta would ever acquiesce to such a Russian request, and besides, it is hardly new. Moscow has sought permanent basing rights for its planes at Indonesia’s Biak airfield in Papua for almost half a century – and not once has it won approval. No foreign power has a military base in Indonesia, or permanent access to any of its domestic bases. Indonesia has enshrined in its constitution a commitment to a “free and independent” foreign policy, which is premised on non-alignment. “The probability [of accepting a Russian request] is low or nearly zero,” said Rahman Yaacob, a defence expert at Australia’s Lowy Institute. “The main reason is because of Indonesia’s domestic foreign policy, it’s basically non-aligned.” Gatra Priyandita, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), agreed, saying: “It goes against the principle of basically providing no military bases to any overseas external powers.” But the prospect is tantalising. Indonesia is a vast archipelago that stretches across South-east Asia. The Papua region is an entry point into the Pacific, and the Biak airbase is just 1,300km from Darwin in northern Australia, where the US has a military base. Russia has continued this week with economic overtures. Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subianto welcomed Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Denis Manturov, to Jakarta to discuss free trade and mark 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. Matthew Sussex, a visiting fellow at the Australia National University, said President Vladimir Putin has aspirations for Russia to become a “Euro-Pacific power”. “From the Russian perspective, they would have a strategic toehold in South-east Asia, which would allow it to conduct intelligence gathering, mainly against the United States in terms of Guam,” he said. “But also extending down towards increasingly important US bases in the Northern Territory and then potentially out west into the Indian Ocean.” Biak is also close to the Philippines, a close US ally in the region. Another possible reason for Russia’s interest in Biak is that it is close to the equator, which lends itself to space operations. Indonesia has plans to build a satellite launch site there, and Russia has been trying to negotiate with Indonesia to be involved, said Lowy’s Yaacob. Its airfield is quite rudimentary, so experts say it could make more sense as a site to launch low-Earth orbit satellites and high-altitude, long endurance drones. “But the negotiation has been slow. I understand Indonesia is trying to say no, but this is their way of saying no, to drag the negotiation on,” he said, referring to Indonesia’s cultural tendency to avoid direct rejection. It’s also a matter of timing. As Donald Trump’s administration throws the post-war world order into question, the time is ripe for Russia to grow closer to its Indonesian partners and South-east Asia as a whole. Indonesia and Russia held their first joint naval drills last year, while President Prabowo Subianto visited Moscow last October. This February, Sergei Shoigu, secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, visited Jakarta to discuss deepening defence ties. Indonesia also recently joined the Brics grouping, of which Russia is a founding member. Russian-Indonesian trade has grown by 80% in the past five years,the Russian government reports, reaching $4.3bn in 2024. But the world’s fourth-most populous nation and South-east Asia’s largest economy, is a far cry from becoming the next client state, for Russia, or any other nation At best, some say Russia might weasel out a concession, as it did in 2017, when it was granted access to Biak for about five days. (It had at the time also sought permanent access but that request was denied). But under pressure domestically, due to an ailing economy and controversial new military law, it would be an inopportune time for Prabowo to pull such an extraordinary move. On the unlikely chance Prabowo granted Russia its request, it would be an unprecedented divergence. Still, Russia’s opportunistic move raises questions about why exactly Putin is pitching for Biak now. “I think it was an attempt to say, ‘Well, ‘let’s see how far Jakarta will go,’” said Sussex, adding that with the US in retreat: “When there’s a vacuum, it gets filled.” Indonesia, of course, is not the only place into which Russia is seeking inroads. Between 2004 and 2023 Russia was the largest arms supplier in terms of value in South-east Asia,with 25% of a $42bn market, although that share has since dropped. But as Russia runs a wartime economy, it may be looking for new markets if the war in Ukraine ends. “Those [weapons] factories will not be easily switched over to making washing machines,” Sussex said, “so they will be looking to sell arms around the world, and obviously these Asian clients are cashed up and in a region where there’s a lot of tension, so willing buyers.” In war-torn Myanmar, Russia is a key ally and arms supplier. This year, Myanmar’s junta leader travelled to Moscow to deliver a gift of six elephants, which coincided with the delivery of six Russian fighter jets to Myanmar. The two countries also signed an agreement on developing a small-scale nuclear power plant in Myanmar. Russia has successfully locked in other countries to such long-standing partnerships, but it has struggled to replicate that success in South-east Asia. “This is a known play from Russia,” said Sam Cranny-Evans, editor of the UK-based Calibre Defence news and consultancy. “Its power station in Turkey will be operated and owned by Russia for at least a decade, and Rosatom has signed multiple agreements with African nations for similar projects, building close relations and dependencies as it does.” Even if Russia’s bid for Biak comes to nothing, Putin has put the idea in the minds of the US’s traditional regional allies, whose sense of security has already been disrupted. “Putin is often regarded as a master strategist,” said the ANU’s Sussex, “I think his skills are more in tactics, in being opportunistic, and making it look like strategy.”",

    "title": "Australian Labor party sent team to UK to learn from Keir Starmer’s successful election campaign",
    "article_text": "Labor gathered intelligence from Keir Starmer’s UK Labour and senior US Democrats on the political power of podcasts as it sought an edge on rivals in the emerging campaign battlefront. The party head office used the overseas lessons to help design a “new media” strategy for the Australian election, which included hiring the firm behind satirical newspaper theBetoota Advocateto provide advice on which podcasts the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, should appear. Podcasts have become a feature of political campaigns globally, with campaigners viewing the format as a vehicle to reach younger voters who are not consuming traditional media. The latestGuardian-Essential pollshowed 42% of 18- to 34-year-olds receive their news via podcasts and social media – compared with just 6% for over-55s. Guardian Australia can reveal the AustralianLabor partydispatched operatives to the UK to learn how Starmer’s team tapped into podcasts and digital creators as part of Labour’s successful 2024 general election campaign. The officials were run through how UK Labour engaged a third-party firm to map out the online environment, identify leads and build relationships with digital creators. Officials also received briefings from senior Democrats after the 2024 US presidential campaign, where podcasts played a prominent role. Donald Trump’s three-hour interview with Joe Rogan – which has attracted more than 57m views onYouTube– was considered pivotal to his success in appealing to young male voters. Democrat strategists briefed their Australian counterparts on their version of events of theKamala Harris-Joe Rogan interviewthat controversially never eventuated. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Armed with insights from overseas, Labor’s team – led by the national secretary, Paul Erickson – devised its own “new media” strategy to reach disengaged voters. That included hiring Diamantina Media, the company behind the popular digital media brand the Betoota Advocate. Labor confirmed Diamantina’s role was limited to providing advice on which podcasts Albanese should consider appearing on. The prime minister has conducted 12 podcast interviews this year, including nine with non-traditional media brands or journalists. These includedAbbie Chatfield’s It’s a Lot, Ozzy Man, The Grade Cricketer’s new podcast The Circus, Big Small Talk, The Squiz, Mamamia with Kate Langbroek, Straight Talk with Mark Bouris and the Daily Aus. Two of the podcasts are part of the Diamantina network: The Circus and Betoota Talks. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The Betoota Talks interview was conducted before Labor started working with Diamantina, the party said. The Liberal frontbenchers Jane Hume, Angus Taylor and Sussan Ley have appeared on recent episodes of Betoota Talks, as has the outspoken backbencher Bridget Archer, teal candidate Nicolette Boele and Greens housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also turned to podcasts, appearing on Straight Talk with Mark Bouris andDiving Deep with Sam Frickeramong others. Labor’s wider new media strategy has involved working with social media influencers to amplify coverage of major announcements. About adozen content creatorswere last month invited to Canberra to join the federal budget lockup with press gallery journalists and interview Albanese and senior ministers Jim Chalmers, Katy Gallagher and Tanya Plibersek. The select influencers – many of whom have more than 100,000 followers – posted clips of the interviews and other budget-day content, offering a different perspective on the annual political event. The Labor party organisation covered flights, hotels and other travel expenses for some of the creators, several told Guardian Australia at the time. However, the ALP did not pay for the content or opinion. A no-paid content rule has been applied across the party’s new media strategy, reflecting UK Labour’s approach. The teal independent Allegra Spender attracted criticism from the Coalition afteradmitting to payingan agency to commission social content with influencers. The mental health-focused content creator Milly Rose Bannister has posted several videos “made in collaboration” with Spender, including one in which she shadowed the Wentworth MP for a day in parliament.",

    "title": "Peter Dutton insists he ‘believes in climate change’ after refusing to say if impacts of global heating worsening",
    "article_text": "The opposition leader,Peter Dutton, has insisted he “believes in climate change” a day after refusing to state if the impacts of global heating were worsening. Climate scientists, environmentalists, Labor and the Greens lined up on Thursday to condemn the opposition leader for comments he made during Wednesday night’selection leaders’ debate, which prompted renewed scepticism of the Coalition’s commitment to climate action. Asked during the debate if the impacts of climate change – including in his home state of Queensland – were worsening, Dutton said: “I’ll let scientists pass that judgment. “I don’t know because I’m not a scientist and I can’t tell you whether the temperature has risen in [outback Queensland town] Thargomindah because of climate change or the water levels are up.” Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, seized on Dutton’s comments during the debate and again at a press conference on Thursday morning, posing the question: “Does he [Dutton] believe in gravity?” “What else is there that is a scientific fact that he needs assurance of, or a science degree, to understand?” Albanese said to reporters at a Brisbane childcare centre. Leading climate and environment groups were alarmed at Dutton’s comments, which the Australian Conservation Foundation said had echoes of the “old climate deniers’ line – ‘I’m not a climate scientist’.” Climate scientist David Karoly, an emeritus professor at the University of Melbourne and councillor at the Climate Council, offered to brief Dutton on the science “at any time he would like to listen”. The 2024state of the climate reportby Australia’s science agency, CSIRO, and the Bureau of Meteorology highlighted that changes to Australia’s weather and climate were happening at an increased pace and the past decade had seen record-breaking extremes and natural disasters, exacerbated by human-caused climate change. Karoly said the report specifically pointed out that increases in short-term rainfall and extreme rainfall were increasing in frequency and magnitude due to human caused climate change. “Mr Dutton just needs to read what government organisations are reporting and listen to the scientists. Scientists have been talking about this for a long time,” he said. Asked on Thursday about his comments the previous night, Dutton said: “I believe in climate change and that’s a reality. “It’s why we’ve adopted our position in relation to net zero by 2050,” he told a press conference in Maitland, in the New South Wales Hunter Valley region. Dutton was not pressed specifically on whether he accepted that climate change was making severe weather events worse. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The former Coalition government’s perceived inaction on climate change was considered a major factor in its 2022 federal election defeat, helping to inspire theteal independentswho captured six heartland Liberal seats. Guardian Australia approached several Liberals in contests with teals in 2025 for a response to Dutton’s comment. In a statement, Ro Knox’s campaign team in the Sydney seat of Wentworth said she “backs the science on climate change and strong action to get to net zero”. “She supports the mixed portfolio approach of renewables, nuclear and gas to meet targets, stay globally competitive and maintain Australian living standards.” The Coalition’s 2022 loss did not prompt a major rethink in its approach to climate policy, with Dutton’s opposition voting againstLabor’s legislated emissions targetsand thenrefusing to set a 2030 or 2035 goalof its own ahead of the 2025 election. The Coalition is committed to net zero by 2050 and claims nuclear power providesthe only viable path to achieve that goal. However, the government’s Climate Change Authority has found Dutton’s nuclear plans – which would require extending the life of ageing coal-fired power stations – wouldmake it “virtually impossible” to meet the target. Fractures remain within theCoalitionover climate action, with some MPs either sceptical or outright opposed to net zero targets. The Guardian this week unearthed a video in whichCoalition MP Colin Boycedescribed blackouts as a “big political opportunity” to turn people against renewables. In a separate video, Boyce confirmed he was an active member of the Saltbush Club, a group formed to push climate science denial.",

    "title": "Turnbull says negative gearing ‘examined by every government’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today – many thanks for being with us. Here are all the main takeaways from day 21 on the campaign trail: Peter Duttonclarified his stance on climate change after saying “I’m not a scientist” when asked if we are seeing the impacts of climate change during last night’s debate. He told reporters today: “I believe in climate change and that is a reality”. Anthony Albanesesaid he had been “stunned” by the opposition leader’s comments, adding: “I don’t know what it takes to give a wake-up call to the Coalition.” The treasurer,Jim Chalmers, said negative gearing changes were “not something that we are proposing” – and that the government gets “advice from the Treasury on issues that are in the public domain”. This comes after Albanese said during last night’s debate the governmenthad not commissioned modelling on negative gearing. Dutton, however,repeated his claimthat Labor wants to make changes to negative gearing – something it hasruled out. Former MPMalcolm Turnbullalso weighed in and saidnegative gearing is examined by every government. Jacinta Nampijinpa Pricehasdoubled downon her “make Australia great again”comment from last weekendin an opinion piece for the Australian. Bridget McKenzie, who’s yesterday walked backcomments she madeto the ABC on Russia and China, misidentified which Chinese leader called the PM a “handsome boy”on breakfast television this morning. The Coalition announced a $260m plan to establish 12 new technical colleges to get students from years 10 to 12 learning trades, as itattacked fee-free Tafe. Dutton said he wants toend bracket creep by indexing personal income rates– calling this an “aspiration” rather than a firm promise. Australia’s unemployment rateremained at a low 4.1%in March. Thanks for following along today, and enjoy your long weekend. 1.7 million people watched last night’s leaders’ debate The second leaders’ debate held on the ABC last night was watched by 1.7 million people across live TV and streaming on iview, according to ABC figures. The Insiders: Debate Analysis Special which followed last night’s event had a national TV audience of 748,000. The debate, which was also available live in Auslan on ABC iview, was also listened to on ABC Local Radio and ABC News Radio, and across the day the ABC News website and app had 2.2 million users. There were 167,000 live streams on the ABC News YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok accounts. ABC managing directorHugh Markssaid: The ABC was honoured to host such a significant national conversation and to be able to put the questions and concerns of Australians directly to our leaders. We can see that people tuned in to the debate on TV, radio or online wherever they were in the country. Paterson asked about Turnbull’s tweet on negative gearing James Patersonwas also asked aboutMalcolm Turnbull’stweet earlier today, saying that “negative gearing is examined by every government”. The opposition has been asking questions about whether Labor investigated negative gearing – did this also happen when there was a Coalition government? Paterson responded: Well, I’m not asking for the prime minister not to consider negative gearing. If that’s what he wants to do he’s welcome to do that. What I’m asking is the prime minister be honest about it, and clearly he wasn’t honest about it in the debate last night. He said his government did not seek any advice from Treasury on this issue. His own treasurer standing next to him today had to admit in fact they did seek advice on this. When a smooth talker likeJim Chalmerscan’t find a way to extricate the prime minister from his lie, I think that speaks volumes. Paterson argued that the PM had “lied about tax before,” pointing to changes to the stage-three tax cuts. But does he support the idea that governments ask for different advice, just like the Turnbull government did? Paterson replied: Yes, governments seek advice. When they do so, they should be honest about it, and the prime minister hasn’t been. Paterson asked if Coalition should be held to this same standard? Continuing from our last post:James Patersonwas asked if the Coalition should be held to this same standard – withPeter Duttonmaking comments over the Indonesian president andBridget McKenziemaking claims about China and Russia. Paterson turned the focus back on Labor and said briefings on these matters would be helpful: I would be very grateful if the government would abide by the caretaker conventions and provide the briefings so the opposition has an equal picture about what is going on here. He was pressed on the question again – should there be this same obligation on the Coalition – and said: Of course there’s an obligation on all of us to get the facts rightand to be informed of the fact, none more so than the prime minister. Paterson continued, arguing that politicians are thrown questions during an election and need to respond to breaking news, often with “incomplete pictures”. Occasionally people misspeak, it’s not unknown in government or in opposition.But one thing that would be helpful – and I think in the national interest – is to make sure we have access to those briefings so we have an equal opportunity to be informed about things being developed. Paterson defends Coalition commentary when asked if it should be more ‘cautious’ The Coalition’s campaign spokesperson,James Paterson, is also up on ABC Afternoon Briefing where he was asked if the Coalition needs to be more cautious with its commentary going forward, and not “jumping too quickly.” Paterson replied that it is “important that leaders in government get the details right.” I was concerned when the prime minister first said the Chinese government gave us adequate notice of the live-firing exercise in the Tasman Sea. That turned out not to be true. I was also concerned when he claimed he heard from the ADF around the same time he heard from the Virgin Australia pilot those exercises were being conducted. That subsequently turned out not to be true. And I was concerned when he said the Chinese research vessel was being tracked in the Australian waters by the Australian Defence Force, when it was in fact being tracked by the Australian Border Force. Scamps weighs in on negative gearing debate Asked if there needs to be reform to negative gearing in the next parliament,Sophie Scampssaid there was “broad agreement this country does need tax reform”. There’s a lot of issues that our tax reform needs to face. We need to do it holistically and do it all at once, not just picking off bits here and there … I think that debate around housing, people are genuinely concerned about where their children are going to live. I had a conversation with a dad this morning, he’s got four children in their 20s, they’re all still at home, and he doesn’t think they’ll be able to move out any time soon, or live on the Northern Beaches. It’s breaking up families and networks. We’re going to have a society where we don’t have the key workers that we need living in our suburbs. Teal independent reacts to Dutton’s comments on climate change The independent MP for Mackellar,Sophie Scamps, is up on ABC Afternoon Briefing to weigh in onPeter Dutton’s comments regarding climate change. She described his comments at last night’s debate as “concerning” and said he seemed to give an “evasive slippery answer”. In case you missed the debate: Dutton was asked if we are seeing the impacts of climate change, and answered that he is “not a scientist”. He clarified the comments at a press conference today and said “I believe in climate change and that is a reality”. On his comments last night, Scamps said: I think he was asked very specifically about climate change and how he would act on it. Instead he tried to fudge it and say he didn’t know what the weather was like in a particular place at a particular time.There is a very clear consensus globally about trends – not about weather – about global trends on climate.There is this consensus around global warming over our land, in our oceans, increased frequency and ferocity of extreme weather events. That’s irrefutable.To not come out and claim that was a bit slippery. Here is what Dutton said at last night’s debate: One expert has weighed in on the major parties housing policies, saying the discussion around cost has “largely overlooked” the need to improve the quality of existing housing. Dr Trivess More, an associate professor of the school of property, construction and project management at RMIT, said more support is needed in this election for retrofitting – AKA making a house more sustainable. He said this funding needs to “go beyond just funding solar panels and residential battery storage for households”. This is important given the majority of existing housing will still be here when we need to achieve our 2050 decarbonisation goals. Dr More said programs already exist to deliver this type of retrofit – through government support programs and tools like the residential scorecard. The problem is that not everyone can easily access this support and often renters and low-income households are overlooked or do not have the upfront resources to participate. Therecent announcement by the Victorian government to fund ceiling insulation retrofitis a good development, but we need more support from all levels of government to support an equitable retrofit revolution. Sex discrimination commissioner reacts to UK ruling on definition of woman Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner,Dr Anna Cody, has issued a statement of support for the transgender community after the UK supreme court ruled that trans women are not included as “women” under the UK’s Equality Act. Cody said that trans and gender diverse people “should be safe, respected and legally recognised”. The laws in the UK are not the laws of Australia.Our laws should reflect inclusion, respect and the right of all people to live with dignity. Trans and gender diverse people are a vital part of our community, and this moment reminds us that we must continue to advocate for the full enjoyment of human rights for all in our communities here in Australia, not retreat from it. Beachgoers urged to take care in the water over long weekend Moving away from the election campaign for a moment: Beachgoers in NSW are being urged to take care this long weekend, with warm conditions and hazardous surf forecast. Warm conditions are forecast across the state and a hazardous surf warning is also in place statewide. This Easter long weekend also coincides with the middle of school holidays, the minister for emergency services,Jihad Dib, noted in a statement. There are more than 20,000 volunteer lifesavers and lifeguards across the state, and I want to thank them for their contribution this holiday weekend and right across the summer. Volunteer lifesaver flags will come down across NSW on Sunday 27 April, at the end of the Anzac Day long weekend.",

    "article_text": "The independent MPZoe Danielhas said her campaign team had nothing to do with a phone survey the Coalition has criticised as “push polling”, a criticism rejected by the company responsible for launching it on behalf of Climate 200. Nine Newspapers has published the audio of a robocall authorised by the polling company uComms, which provides a favourable overview ofDaniel’s record in parliamentbefore asking how a person would vote on 3 May. “Your independent member Zoe Daniel has advocated for long-term economic reform, protecting the environment for future generations and for there to be more compassion and integrity in politics,” the robocall states. “Knowing this about Zoe Daniel, if a federal election were held today, who would receive your first preference vote?” The survey then lists all candidates in the Goldstein electorate, with Daniel named first. The audio then asks for a person’s age and education level before asking whether someone would be less or more likely to vote from the Liberal party “if it distanced itself from the National party and the extreme agenda of its MPs … who oppose taking action on climate change and want to roll back abortion rights”. Push polling is a negative campaigning technique that uses loaded questions in an attempt to sway the respondent’s position. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The Coaliton’s campaign spokesperson, James Paterson, said voters in several teal seats are receiving “more calls from aggressive push pollers than they are from their own family”. “When a campaign relied on push polling, it tells you something about their priorities,” Paterson said. “They are not interested in listening to voters – they are trying to steer and manipulate them.” Daniel said “this is not a poll that we commissioned, paid for, or put into the field”. “Climate 200 has made it clear to us that this poll meets Australian Electoral Commission guidelines,” Daniel said. “They are adamant that it does not constitute push polling, despite claims to the contrary. “As previously stated, I do not support push polling for myself or anyone else.” A spokesperson for the polling company uComms told Nine the survey was conducted “in accordance with guidelines set down by the Australian Polling Council”. “Under the APC guidelines, demographic and voter intention questions must be asked first to avoid bias,” said Logan Leatch, the chief executive of the polling firm’s parent company. “UComms is dedicated to providing accurate results.” Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Climate 200 declined to comment. Earlier this month, independent MPs criticised a “blatant push poll”that targeted voters in two teal-held seats, with one labelling it an “affront to democracy”. The “electoral poll” conducted by “Intelligent Dialogue” asked respondents in Daniel’s seat of Goldstein to select which candidate would receive their vote if an election was held today. If respondents chose someone other than Daniel, the survey concluded. But if they selected the teal MP, they were asked two additional questions. The first read: “[Zoe Daniel/Allegra Spender] is a teal MP who receives significant funding from Simon Holmes à Court, a billionaire investor. Some people are concerned that it makes her and other teals less independent. Do you agree or disagree?” At the time, Daniel described the survey as “dirty tactics” which were designed to sow discord in voters’ minds. “I think it’s unethical, and I think it’s an affront to democracy, and I think it’s insulting to voters,” she said.",

    "title": "Australia to woo US’s ‘smartest minds’ disfranchised by Trump research cuts",
    "article_text": "The “smartest minds” in the United States will be beckoned to Australia with a new talent program aiming to capitalise on academics disfranchised by the Trump administration’s research cuts. The Australian Academy of Science announced the global talent attraction program on Thursday, warning the nation needed to “act swiftly” to capitalise on the opportunity. The academy’s president, Prof Chennupati Jagadish AC, said in a statement that Australia had an “urgent and unparalleled opportunity to attract the smartest minds leaving the United States”. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “There is no time to waste as other countries havealready recognised the opportunityand are mobilising to attract talent to their shores,” he said. Researchers, faculty and leadership at US universities and colleges have been grappling with the effects of the Trump administration’sfunding freezes, cuts and executive orders. Donald Trump’s federal congressional budgetproposes billions of dollarsin federal funding cuts across higher education, includingcapping all “indirect funding” from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)– the world’s largest funder of scientific research – at 15%. Immediately in the crosshairs is Harvard University. Trump this week said that the Ivy League institution should no longer receive federal funds after it rejecteda series of the adminstration’s demands, which the university’s president described as “an attempt to control the Harvard community”. Efforts to slash government spending have also left thousands of employees at major scientific institutions, includingNasa,theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, bracing for layoffs. In response,several European universities, such asAix-Marseille Universityin France andFree University Brussels, have set up initiatives toprovide a havento “the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference”. The Australian program is inviting contributions from funders, which Jagadish said would go towards leading a “national, coordinated effort” to promote the destination to leading US scientists and returning Australians through a “competitive relocation package”. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Jagadish said the program would be “institution- and discipline-agnostic”. “This allows the academy to prioritise excellence and focus on areas of national need when attracting talent to our shores,” he said. “Australians have repeatedly witnessed the multiplier effect of embedding smart minds within the Australian R&D [research and development] system. “These individuals seed capability, create jobs, attract further investment, mentor young scientists, stimulate collaboration, contribute to the national economy and shape our future.” Danielle Cave, the head of executive, strategy and research at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, also pointed to the “enormous opportunity” of the Trump administration’s research crackdown. Writing in Nine newspaperslast month, she said if the federal government acted quickly, the changes could represent a “once-in-a-century brain gain opportunity”. “We should attract some of our best and brightest back home from places such as Silicon Valley while also offering fast-track visas to top US-based scientists and researchers who are newly out of a job or low on the funding,” she wrote. “As public funding into universities declines and US universitiesreducePhDadmissions, top Chinese universities arealreadyproactively recruiting overseas students, allowing undergraduates to skip traditional pathways to fill up PhD programs in areas such as mathematics, engineering, computer science and environmental science. “Minister for home affairs Tony Burke should work with parliamentary colleagues and his department to quickly explore options to expand and fast-track visas.”Australia has not been immune to the impact of Trump’s policy changes. At least seven universities have had research programs temporarily suspended, and a dozen universities were sent aquestionnaire from the Trump administrationasking to confirm whether they aligned with US government interests.",

    "title": "Macron hosts ‘excellent’ ceasefire talks with top US, European and Ukrainian officials",
    "article_text": "Senior US, European and Ukrainian diplomats will meet again in London next week, the Élysée Palace has said, after what a French official described as an “excellent” day of talks in Paris aimed at reviving stalled ceasefire efforts. “We have started a positive process in which Europeans are a part,” the spokesperson said after the meetings attended by top British, French, German and Ukrainian officials as well as the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. The French official said: “The Americans are ready to discuss security guarantees, but the exact content of those guarantees will depend on negotiations allowingUkraineto achieve a solid and durable peace starting with a complete ceasefire as soon as possible.” France’s president,Emmanuel Macron, hosted the talks as Washington and Europe seek common ground on how to end the fighting three years after Russia invaded its neighbour, with Trump’s pledge to swiftly end the war so far unfulfilled. “Everyone wants to get peace. A robust and sustainable peace. The question is about phasing,” Macron said as the talks got under way. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, who also attended, said afterwards the talks were “very productive” but gave no details. A previously unannounced team of Ukrainian officials including Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and the country’s foreign and defence ministers flew in to meet the US and European delegations. Yermak said: “We exchanged views on the next steps … including the implementation of a full ceasefire, the involvement of a multinational military contingent and development of an effective security architecture for Ukraine.” In Kyiv, Zelenskyy was critical of Witkoff’s message, saying he believed the US envoy had “taken on the strategy of the Russian side”. He added: “I think it is very dangerous, because he is – consciously or unconsciously, I don’t know – spreading Russian narratives.” Rubio wrote on social media that the American delegation in Paris was looking to “secure real, practical solutions to end the Russia-Ukraine war”. He spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday, a spokesperson for the US state department said. “President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” the spokesperson said. “The encouraging reception in Paris to the US framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement.” Earlier on Thursday, Zelenskyy said pressure must be put on Moscow to call a halt to the fighting. “Russia uses every day and night to kill,” he said. “We must put pressure on the killers … to end this war and guarantee a lasting peace.” The Élysée spokesperson said the object of the meetings was “to allow Ukraine to better understand the US proposals”, adding that the fact that Rubio, Witkoff and Kellogg attended “shows they recognise the important role of the Europeans”. Macron spoke to Zelenskyy by phone before the talks, the French president’s office said. He later greeted Witkoff and Rubio before a joint lunch. Before that, his foreign policy adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, and his British and German counterparts met Yermak. Trump has indicated frustration with both Moscow and Kyiv, but European leaders’ concern has mounted as the US president heaps pressure and criticism on Zelenskyy while repeatedly making diplomatic overtures to Vladimir Putin. Moscow said the Paris meeting was a chance for Witkoff to inform European officials of the peace talks’ current status, although the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia so far saw only “a focus on continuing the war” from the Europeans. Russia’s top economic negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, said “certain countries” were trying to derail Moscow’s talks with the US. Macron’s office said the Paris meetings hoped to “review progress on peace talks aimed at ending the Russian aggression in Ukraine”. Kyiv and its EU allies say Moscow is to blame for rejectingTrump’s proposal of a ceasefirelast month. They hope to persuade the US to take a tougher line, particularly after aRussian attack on the city of Sumyon Sunday that killed at least 35 civilians. France, Britain and Germany were taken aback when Trump opened discussions on improving ties directly with Russia, but have sought a coordinated European response on protecting Ukraine during the conflict and in any ceasefire. Britain and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have proposed that a mainly European “reassurance” force should be deployed in Ukraine if a ceasefire starts. However, many European leaders say such a force would need US support. A French diplomatic source had said earlier that Rubio and Jean-Noël Barrot, France’s foreign minister, would discuss “the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and the Iranian nuclear file”. The trip is Rubio’s third to Europe since taking office. Witkoff plans to fly on to Rome after the Paris talks for a second round of discussions on Saturday with the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, about Iran’s nuclear programme. The two met for 45 minutes in Oman on Saturday. Both sides described those talks as positive while acknowledging that any deal was distant. Trump said on Monday he believed Iran was intentionally delaying a nuclear deal and that he was willing to bomb its nuclear facilities if one was not reached. On Tuesday he held a meeting with national security advisers at the White House focused on Iran’s nuclear programme, according to sources familiar with the matter. The US president has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February after ditching a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers during his first term and reimposing crippling sanctions. Separately, in Washington, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, discussed efforts toward a “durable peace” in Ukraine with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, the Pentagon said. Hegseth called it an “excellent” meeting. “We discussed the imperative need for Europeans to meet a 5% defence spending commitment to restore deterrence with ready, lethal, conventional forces,” Hegseth said. Lecornu called the discussions “productive”. Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "Four dead after cable car crash in southern Italy",
    "article_text": "Four people have died and one is seriously injured after a cable car crashed to the ground near Naples in southern Italy on Thursday. A cable broke on the link taking tourists from the town of Castellammare di Stabia, on the Gulf of Naples, to Monte Faito, about three kilometres(1.8 miles) away. “Four lifeless bodies were found, while a fifth injured person was rescued and taken to hospital,” the fire department said in a Telegram post, adding that this was a final toll. Vincenzo De Luca, the head of the Campania region around Naples, told Rai that rescue operations were hampered by fog and high winds. More than 50 firefighters took part in rescue efforts. One cabin carrying 16 passengers was close to Castellammare and they were put down on firm ground. A second cabin was above a precipice on Mount Faito and fog delayed the rescue effort, reports said. The cable car had just reopened for the summer season and prosecutors said they had launched an investigation into the accident. “The cable car reopened 10 days ago with all the required safety conditions,” said Umberto de Gregorio, the head of the cable car company. “What happened today is an unimaginable, unforeseeable tragedy.” The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni expressed “sincere condolences” to the families of the victims, her office said. The cable car has been operating since 1952 and a similar accident in 1960 also left four dead. In 202114 people died when a cable car linking Lake Maggiore with a nearby mountain plunged to the groundin northern Italy. In 1998, a US fighter jet flying at a low level on a training flight cut a steel cable, killing 20 people in a cable car in the Dolomites.",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. For the latest on the Trump-Meloni meeting, read our full report: Going back toTrump’scomments before his lunch withMeloni, he also appeared – for the first time – to endorse the idea of a trade deal with the EU, saying: There will be a trade deal, 100%. … Of course there will be a trade deal, very much. They want to make one very much, and we are going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. But it’ll be a fair deal. Upon Meloni’s arrival, Trump was also asked how confident he was about getting a deal with the EU, and he said he “very confident,”according to a WH video. We should hear again from them soon, this time from the Oval Office. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, for today. Italian prime ministerGiorgia Melonimet with US presidentDonald Trumpin the White House for talks about trade, Ukraine and a range of bilateral issues, during which she gotlots of praise from Trump and invited him for a visit to Rome(18:05,19:47,20:32). In his most positive comments on trade talks with the EU so far,Trump said “there will be a trade deal, 100%,”but stressed it would be “a fair deal” (19:24), and that there’s no rush (18:21). On Ukraine, Trump sent mixed signals, saying he “wants the death, the killing to stop,” and thathe was “not happy with anybody involved,”putting extra pressure on Zelenskyy by saying he’s“not a big fan”(20:14). The US suggested the minerals deal with Ukraine is close to being signed, suggesting it could happen next Thursday (19:55,20:20). Elsewhere, US state secretaryMarco Rubioand White House envoySteve Witkofftook part in extensive talks with British, French, German, and Ukrainian officials, hosted by French presidentEmmanuel Macronin Paris (12:01,12:56,13:51,17:05,20:56,21:07). Rubio debriefed his Russian counterpartSergei Lavrovafter talks, telling him that Trump and the US “want this war to end,” and “peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement” (21:25). Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyaccussed White House envoy Witkoff for “spreading Russian narratives,” as he warned about Russia’s increasingly closer cooperation with China (19:05) and potential mobilisation of further troops (17:58). And that’s all from me,Jakub Krupa,for today. If you haveany tips, comments or suggestions,email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at@jakubkrupa.bsky.socialand on X at@jakubkrupa. US state secretaryMarco Rubiospoke with his Russian counterpartSergei Lavrovto “convey … the same message the US team communicated to the Ukrainian delegation and our European allies in Paris,” the US Department of State spokesperson said. “President Trump and the United Stateswant this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace. The encouraging reception in Paris to the US framework shows thatpeace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement,” the statement added. Ukrainian foreign ministerAndrii Sybihaalso offered his take on today’s talks,saying on social mediathat he “noted the progress in peace efforts and underscored the importance of American leadership and involvement.” “Ukraine is committed to peace efforts andwants the war to end as soon as possible,” he stressed. “I reiterated that Ukraine unconditionally accepted a full interim ceasefire on March 11th in Jeddah. Itneeds to be done as soon as possible,” he added. French presidentEmmanuel Macronseems to be a reader of this blog, as he called today a “diplomatic mobilisation” (I said “blitz” in the opening post at9:45, but let’s not allow these minor differences divide us unnecessarily). In a summaryjust posted on social media, he thanked all delegations for taking part in talks, and said“clearly, we all share the same desire for peace.” “From the beginning, we have supported the President’s @realDonaldTrump proposal toend the war inUkraineas quickly as possible,” he said. “We engaged in a positive and constructive discussion on how to achieve both a ceasefire and a comprehensive and lasting peace,” he added. Macron also said that he not only spoke with Zelenskyy before the talks (13:51), but also once again this evening “to coordinate” on next actions. “Discussions will continue next week in London,” he said. Elsewhere, we heard more about today’s meetings at theÉlysée Palacein Paris. French officials praised“excellent” talks with allies, saying they had launched “a positive process” as Kyiv’s allies seek to rekindle stalled ceasefire efforts, AFP reported. Another meetingof envoys from the United States, France, Britain, Germany andUkraineisto take place next week in London, they said. I thought it was a fascinating and telling moment when Meloni interrupted the interpreter, when she struggled with the Italian prime minister’s response to a particularly sensitive question about Zelenskyy andUkraine. Meloni clearly didn’t want to risk any inaccuracies or nervousness creeping in there, and quickly pivoted to highlight Italy’s new commitment to spending 2% of its GDP on defense – a move that shows her alignment with Trump’s demands. Throughout the public portion of the meeting, she stuck closely to the script: praising Trump and drawing attention to the challenges shared by both administrations. It was an impressive display of message discipline from the Italian PM, and she and her aides will be pleased with how it played out. That concludes the press conference. Responding to a question on the minerals deal and if Zelenskyy will come to the White House to sign it, Trump defers to treasury secretaryScott Bessent,who says the sides are still working details out, but it would be signed next week. “It’s substantially what we agreed on previously with the president,” he says, saying “I think it’s an 80 page agreement and that’s what will be signed.” Meloni just got asked in Italian about what she makes of Trump holding Zelenskyy responsible for the war inUkraine. She offered a lengthy answer, also in Italian. “That was so beautiful.What … what did she say?,” Trump laughed. The interpreter then explained the question in English, and you could feel the tension in the room rising. But as the interpreter nervously tries to relay the exchange, Meloni quickly jumps in and deflects to Italian defence spending, saying she will raise it to 2% as per Nato targets. When she ends,Trump says that he doesn’t hold Zelenskyy responsible, “but I am not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,”as he talks about the scale of destruction in Ukraine. “So I’m not happy with him, and I’m not happy with anybody involved,” he says. He ends:“I’m not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn’t say he’s done the greatest job. I’m not a big fan.” Another Italian reporter asks about Trump’s words describingEuropeas a “parasite.” Meloni questions if he ever said that, and Trump denies it happened. In another question on “making Europe great again,” he says: I hope that Europe is going to be great again.Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it’s having to do with immigration. And I’m not a big fan of Europe and what they’ve done with immigration at all, and I think they’re going to get smart, becauseEurope is being very badly hurt by what they’ve done with immigration. He praises Meloni for her immigration policy, and insists: “Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. I want Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration.” There’slots of domestic US questionsbeing raised, which must be slightly awkward for Meloni as she listens to Trump talking aboutegg prices, alleged migrants from Congo, and who is fake news. If you care about these issues in detail, you can follow our US blog here: ButI’m not giving up just yetand am still hoping they’ll eventually get back to talking about issues to do with Italy andEuropeat some point – and not about “why Jimmy Carter died a happy man”. On minerals deal, Trump says “we havea minerals deal, which I guess is goingto be signed on Thursday, next Thursday, soon.” He declines to respond to Zelenskyy’s comment on China, saying “I have no comment on that, I have no idea; that’s his statement, not mine.” Asked about the UK-French plans for a reassurance force – called by reporter “a peace mission” – inUkraine,Trump says “peace missions are always good with me, I’m OK with peace missions.” OnUkraine, Meloni says “we have been defending the freedom ofUkrainetogether,” and adds “we can build just and lasting peace.” Trumpadds saying “we are doing well,” and insists “we want to get it done” to save lives. “We’ll see what we can do. And I think we’re getting close, but we’ll let you know very soon,” he says. Asked about Putin’s response, he says “we’re going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually.” “We want the death, the killing to stop,” he says. Melonisays Trump has accepted her invitation for an official trip to Rome “in the near future,” as she say it could also be an opportunity to meet with other European leaders. “The goal for me is to make the West great again,” she says. TrumpandMeloniare now in the Oval Office. He opens by saying Meloni “is doing a fantastic job” and “has takenEuropeby storm,” and adds she “has become a friend.” Meloni says they have lots to talk about, including on tackling irregular migration and synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, among others, but also on trade, economy, and energy, hinting at plans to increase LNG imports. I will bring you the key lines from their chat here. Going back toTrump’scomments before his lunch withMeloni, he also appeared – for the first time – to endorse the idea of a trade deal with the EU, saying: There will be a trade deal, 100%. … Of course there will be a trade deal, very much. They want to make one very much, and we are going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. But it’ll be a fair deal. Upon Meloni’s arrival, Trump was also asked how confident he was about getting a deal with the EU, and he said he “very confident,”according to a WH video. We should hear again from them soon, this time from the Oval Office. Here are the quotes from Zelenskyy’s that I flagged earlier (17:58), via AFP and Reuters. On signing a memorandum on the US-Ukraine minerals deal: “This is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions.” On buying US Patriot systems: “Ukraine is ready to purchase at least 10 systems. I told President Trump about this minimum during our phone conversation. He told me that America would work on it. So far, I have no other information.” On Witkoff: “I believe that Mr Witkoff has taken on the strategy of the Russian side. I think it is very dangerous, because he is consciously or unconsciously, I don’t know, spreading Russian narratives.” On China: “We have finally received information that China is supplying weapons to the Russian Federation. … We believe that Chinese representatives are engaged in the production of some weapons on Russian territory.”",

    "title": "Meloni says Trump to visit Rome after Washington talks over tariffs",
    "article_text": "Giorgia Meloni said Donald Trump had accepted her invitation for an official trip to Rome, as the pair met in Washington in an attempt by the Italian prime minister to bridge the gap between the EU and US amid trade tariff tensions. Meloni said Trump’s trip could happen “in the near future” and could present an opportunity for him to meet other European leaders. “The goal for me is to make the west great again,” Meloni said. Trump opened the summit in the Oval Office on Thursday by saying Meloni was “doing a fantastic job” and had “takenEuropeby storm”, adding that she “has become a friend”. Trump and Meloni had earlier both expressed optimism about resolving the EU-US trade conflict. The EU faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars, and broader tariffs on almost all other goods, under Trump’s policy to hit countries he says impose high barriers to US imports. “I am sure we can make a deal and I am here to help with that,” Meloni said before the summit. Trump said that broadly speaking he expected he would make an announcement about trade deals but he was in no rush. “We’re going to have very little problem making a deal with Europe or anybody else, because we have something that everybody wants,” Trump said. Before leaving for Washington, Meloni discussed the summit with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and his successor, Friedrich Merz, also discussed the meeting with Meloni, according to reports in the German edition ofPolitico. Scholz failed to get a meeting with Trump and Merz’s request is reportedly pending. Meloni had previously described Trump’s tariffs on EU goods as “wrong” but she appears to be taking a more cautious approach as she manages a delicate balancing act between her political ideals,which are more in tune with Trump’s,and Italy’s role within the EU. The meeting provoked trepidation among some of Italy’s European allies as well as Meloni’s domestic opposition amid fears their closeness risks jeopardising the bloc’s unified approach to the tariffs and other issues. Enrico Borghi, a politician with the centrist Italia Viva party, told a TV talkshow: “The advice from the opposition is that the prime minister returns home with reopened negotiations between the US and EU that will guarantee a framework of relative tranquility to our economic and productive system, which has been weakened by what is a real trade war.” Italy is the third-largest exporter to the US from the EU. Meloni’s office denied she would seek special tariff exemptions on Italian products. Italy has strong economic ties with the US that go beyond exports, including foreign direct investments. The summit was expected to address Trump’s demand that Nato partners increase military spending to 2% of GDP. Italy is at 1.49%, among the lowest in Europe. It was Meloni’s third visit to the White House, with the two previous occasions taking place during Joe Biden’s administration. She will return to Rome in time to meet on Friday Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, whose blistering attack on Europe at the Munich Security Conference in February she has defended. Vance will also meet Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, during his Easter weekend visit.",

    "title": "ECB cuts rates for third time this year as Europe braces for Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "The cost of borrowing has fallen across the 20-member euro area for the third time this year after theEuropean Central Bankcut its main interest rate to 2.25% in response to slowing growth and Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Frankfurt-based bank cut its benchmark deposit rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, in line with economist expectations, to tackle a slowdown in the bloc and the impact from the border taxes imposed earlier this month on all EU imports into the US. The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said US tariffs on EU goods, which had increased from an average of 3% to 13%, were already harming the outlook for the European economy. “The major escalation in global trade tensions and the associated uncertainty will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports,” she said, adding that they may “drag down investment and consumption”. Lagarde, who has overseen seven cuts, from a high of 4% last year, said it was unclear where interest rates would settle – a level known as the neutral rate – while uncertainty continued to dominate policymaking. She told told journalists that the concept of neutral rate only worked in a shock-free world, adding: “Anybody in this room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, I would suggest [they] have their head examined.” In a statement after announcing the cut, the ECB’s governing council said the outlook for growth had deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions. “Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response … may further weigh on the economic outlook for the euro area,” it said. In the meantime, all the main indicators of inflation were falling, allowing for a reduction in interest rates. The central bank said services inflation, which has proved stubbornly high in recent years, had eased markedly over recent months while wage growth was moderating, and where it remained high, companies were absorbing the extra costs in reduced profits. Trump has imposed an extra 10% tariff on EU goods to the US, with the threat of a further 10% suspended until July. Industry-specific tariffs of 25% already apply on steel, aluminium and cars into the US, and more are threatened on pharmaceuticals and electronics imports. Mark Wall, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, said the emphasis on a shock from the tariffs “implied an openness to further monetary easing”, assuming the trade shock persisted, and was “borne out in the data”. Most City economists expect a further rate cut in June. Wall said the reductions would continue this year until they reached 1.5%, such was the probable hit to European economic growth from US tariffs. Financial markets expect central banks in all major economies to cut interest rates this year as tariffs hit global trade and slow growth. Investors expect the Bank of England to cut the cost of borrowing by a quarter point when policymakers next meet in May and twice more in 2025. Before the ECB decision, Trumpcontrasted Lagarde’s record with that of the US Federal Reserve,which kept rates on hold at its last meeting in March. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, was “always too late and wrong” and that his “termination cannot come fast enough”. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Powell had said on Wednesday that US tariffs on about 60 countries would increase domestic prices and reduce hiring. Speaking at the Economic Club of Chicago, he said it was unclear what the overall impact would be on the economy and whether the bank would need to raise interest rates to tame inflation or cut rates to increase growth, sparkinga large share sell-off on US markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it expects much slower global growth – but not a global recession – because of the trade tensions. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said that the latest world economic outlook forecasts will include “notable markdowns, but not recession”. In a speech before the organisation’s spring meetings next week in Washington, she said economic “resilience is being tested again – by the reboot of the global trading system”. She added: “Trade tensions are like a pot that was bubbling for a long time and is now boiling over. To a large extent, what we see is the result of an erosion of trust – trust in the international system, and trust between countries.” Data released by the EU agency Eurostat showed that inflation in the eurozone rose 2.2% in March, compared with 2.3% in February. A measure of core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as petrol and food, dropped from 2.6% to 2.4% in the same period. The ECB said most measures of underlying inflation suggested that inflation would “settle at around the 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis”.",

    "article_text": "Gisèle Pelicot, who survived nearly a decade of rapes by dozens of men, will sue Paris Match magazine for invasion of privacy, her lawyers said on Thursday. In its latest edition, Paris Match published seven pictures of Pelicot accompanied by a man described as her companion walking in the streets in her new home town. Pelicot received international acclaim for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial last year of her ex-husband and other defendants. “It’s not us who should feel shame, but them,” she said of the perpetrators. Dominique Pelicot, her former husband, drugged her for nearly a decade so he and dozens of strangers he recruited online could rape her. Dominique Pelicot, who admitted the charges, kept hundreds of videos of the attacks on his computer in a file entitled “abuse”. A French courtsentenced him to 20 years in prison in December. “Every time the intimacy of our client’s personal life is violated, we will react and seek a court decision,” the lawyer Antoine Camus said on Thursday. Camus said it was “shocking” and “disappointing” that Paris Match would secretly take pictures of Pelicot, “whose ordeal was the subject of 3,000 pictures and videos”. He accused the magazine of “having learned nothing from the four-month trial”.Contacted by Agence France-Presse, Paris Match had no comment. Pelicot was included in Time magazine’s list published on Wednesday of the world’s most influential people in 2025.",

    "title": "Wave of Israeli airstrikes kill at least 40 across Gaza, says civil defence agency",
    "article_text": "A wave of Israeli airstrikes on encampments for displaced Palestinians has killed at least 40 people across Gaza, as Hamas officials said consultations on response to Israel truce offer “almost complete”. Civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said two Israeli missiles hit several tents in the al-Mawasi area of the southern city of Khan Younis, resulting in at least 16 deaths, most of them women and children, and 23 others were wounded. Two additional strikes on other encampments of displaced people killed eight and wounded several more, Bassal said. Seven were killed in a strike on tents in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, while another attack near the al-Mawasi area killed a father and his child who were living in a tent, he said. “We were sitting peacefully in the tent, under God’s protection, when we suddenly saw something red glowing – and then the tent exploded, and the surrounding tents caught fire,” Israa Abu al-Rus told AFP. “This is supposed to be a safe area in al-Mawasi,” Abu al-Rus said. “We fled the tent towards the sea and saw the tents burning.” Separately, civil defence reported two more attacks on displaced people in Jabalia – one that killed at least seven members of the Asaliya family, and another that killed six people at a school being used as a shelter – as well as Israeli shelling in Gaza City that killed two. The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strikes, claiming that the army had targeted what it said was a Hamas “command and control” centre in Jabalia. Hamas accused Israel of attempting to starve the population of Gaza. “This is a public admission of committing a war crime, including the use of starvation as a weapon and the denial of basic necessities such as food, medicine, water, and fuel to innocent civilians for the seventh consecutive week,” the Palestinian militant group said in a statement. The Islamist group’s accusation follows Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s statement on Wednesday that Israel wouldkeep blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, as it vowed to force Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages from the 7 October attacks. ‘‘Israel’s policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza, and blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population,” Katz said. “No one is currently planning to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and there are no preparations to enable such aid.” Aid supplies including food, fuel, water and medicine have been blocked by Israel from entering Gaza since 2 March, more than two weeks before thecollapse of the ceasefirebetween Israel and the Palestinian militant group with a return to air and ground attacks on the territory. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said on Wednesday thatGazawas becoming a “mass grave for Palestinians”. The UN humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said almost all of Gaza’s more than 2 million people now rely for food on the only 1m prepared meals produced daily by charity kitchens supported by aid groups.Other food distribution programmes have shut down for lack of supplies, and the UN and other aid organisations have been sending their remaining stocks to the charity kitchens.The only other way to get food in Gaza is from markets. But most cannot afford to buy there because of spiralling prices and widespread shortages, meaning humanitarian aid is the primary food source for 80% of the population, the World Food Program said in its monthly report for April on Gaza’s markets.“The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023,” OCHA said. Meanwhile, two Hamas officials told AFP Thursday that the group’s discussions on an Israeli truce proposal were nearly complete, with a response expected soon. “These talks are almost complete, and the group will send its response to the mediators once they finish. It’s expected the talks will wrap up soon – possibly even today,” an official said, with another member of the group confirming his account. Hamas said Israel had proposed a new 45-day ceasefire through mediators that would include the release of dozens of hostages. The proposal also called for Hamas to disarm to secure a complete end to the war, a demand the group rejects. However, a ceasefire agreement still looks distant, as divisions persist between the two sides. Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks. Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon. Israel’s renewed assault has so far killed at least 1,691 people in Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory reported, bringing the overall toll since the war erupted to 51,065, most of them civilians. Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, also mostly civilians. AFP, AP and Reuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "Queen Elizabeth II’s solicitor managed offshore wealth for Assad’s uncle",
    "article_text": "Queen Elizabeth II’s private solicitor spent eight years helping to manage the offshore wealth of the uncle of the recently deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, an investigation has established. Rifaat al-Assad became known as the “butcher of Hama” after allegations he played a key role in a massacre of thousands of Syrians at the city of Hama in 1982. In 2024, Switzerland formally charged him with war crimes. Concerns about Rifaat’s activities, including his record as the head of a feared Syrian paramilitary force known as the Defense Brigades, have been publicly raised in Europe and the US by the media, human rights groups and government officials since the 1980s. He left Syria for Europe in 1984 after a failed coup against his brother. Inquiries by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have established that Mark Bridges, also known as the third Baron Bridges, served as a trustee on at least five trusts holding assets in France and Spain on behalf of Rifaat al-Assad or his relatives between 1999 and 2008. During the same period, Bridges also held one of the most prestigious legal positions in Britain: private legal adviser to the British monarch. He was Queen Elizabeth’s solicitor from 2002 to 2019. The findings raise questions about whether it was appropriate for the monarch’s personal lawyer to take the ethical and reputational risk of working for an individual accused of human rights atrocities, in view of potential embarrassment to the queen had the connection been discovered while she was still alive. There is no suggestion of any regulatory wrongdoing by Bridges, who was knighted for his services to the queen in 2019. His firm, Farrer & Co, said the trusts were established on the advice of another leading law firm, that Bridges’s work for Rifaat al-Assad was in complete compliance with regulatory requirements in effect at the time and that Bridges had been presented with evidence contradicting the allegations made against him. The property empire amassed by Rifaat al-Assad after his arrival in Europe spanned the most luxurious postcodes of Paris, London and the Costa del Sol. His acquisitions, which he claimed were part-funded by cheques worth millions of dollars from the king of Saudi Arabia, included Witanhurst in London’s Highgate – the second-largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace – and a seven-storey mansion near Paris’s Arc de Triomphe. Assad held his property empire through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership. One trust was registered in the Bahamas, whilesome of the purchases used shell companies in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, before transfer to Spanish and later Maltese companies. In 2014, prosecutors in France began investigating whether Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth had in fact been obtained through corruption. Bridges had ceased acting as a trustee for Rifaat in 2008, his lawyers said, but continued to provide “limited and ad-hoc” legal advice until 2015 “in circumstances whereby the regulatory requirements imposed on the firm were met”. Two of the trusts that Bridges had managed were said to own the Spanish portion of Rifaat al-Assad’s real estate empire, including a deluxe villa with swathes of land near Marbella. In 2019, Spanish prosecutors alleged that these same trusts controlled shell companies holding more than 500 properties in Spain worth €695m (£595m). According to the Spanish prosecutors, the offshore setup was designed to “hide the true ownership of the huge amount of real estate properties” and enabled the “laundering [of] dirty money from abroad”, referring to funds allegedly stolen from the Syrian state. In 2020, aFrench court convicted Rifaat al-Assadof tax fraud and laundering embezzled public money – primarily about $200m (£151m) stolen from Syrian state funds and $100m in fraudulent loan agreements from Libya. Assad was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. He fled to Syria in 2021 while his conviction was under appeal. Though not the only trustee serving Assad, Bridges was by far the most eminent. In addition to his services to the queen, he led the private client team at Farrer, an elite law firm with a reputation forged through serving British royals and aristocrats as far back as 1769. There is no evidence Bridges knew or suspected that Rifaat al-Assad’s money was stolen. Assad claimed his wealth came from benefactors, including the Saudi royal family, and in 2018 the Gibraltar supreme court concluded that it had been reasonable for Rifaat’s trustees to believe this story. The question of Rifaat al-Assad’s status as an alleged war criminal, however, is more complicated. In February 1982, armed militias affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood staged an uprising against the Assad regime in the town of Hama, in western Syria. To suppress the uprising, Syria’s then president, Hafez al-Assad, Rifaat’s brother, dispatched the Syrian army and a paramilitary group called the Defense Brigades. An Amnesty International report published in 1983 found that while “it is difficult to establish for certain what happened”, allegations against Syrian regime forces included “collective execution of 70 people outside the municipal hospital” and “cyanide gas containers … alleged to have been brought into the city, connected by rubber pipes to the entrances of buildings believed to house insurgents, and turned on, killing all the buildings’ occupants”. It is estimated that 10,000 to 40,000 people may have been unlawfully tortured and executed. As head of the paramilitaries, Rifaat al-Assad was believed to have taken a leading role in the carnage. In a 1989 book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, the journalist Thomas Friedman described how, after initial skirmishes, “Rifaat’s tactic shifted from trying to ferret out nests of Muslim Brotherhood men to simply bringing whole neighbourhoods down on their heads and burying the Brotherhood and anyone else in the way.” Allegations of atrocities against Rifaat al-Assad were widely known by the point Bridges began working as a trustee for his offshore wealth in 1999. In 2013, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Rifaat al-Assad’s role in suppressing the Hama uprising. In 2021 it issued an international arrest warrant for Assad, and in 2024 he was formally charged with war crimes. Assad has always denied these charges. His whereabouts is unknown Farrer said Assad’s trustees, including Bridges, “were provided with credible information, when they were appointed and at different junctures thereafter, which fundamentally contradicted the claims being made in the media about Mr al-Assad”. The firm added that it and Bridges were restricted by a duty of client confidentiality from revealing what this evidence was, or commenting on whether it was appropriate for the queen’s solicitor to also have represented Assad. However, it did share 11 French defamation judgments, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s, that found in Assad’s favour. The majority related to allegations made in various news outlets that Rifaat al-Assad’s wealth was sourced from organised crime. In the case of the two judgments that substantially addressed allegations of human rights abuses, the courts found that the journalists had failed to reflect certain nuances of Amnesty International’s report by glossing over uncertainties about whether the Assad regime directly ordered the atrocity. Public attitudes towards British lawyers acting for foreign politicians with questionable reputations have hardened in recent years. This month, a taskforce of senior lawyers and civil society experts said law firms must request more “credible explanations” from their clients as to the source of their wealth, and that it was unsustainable to disregard reputational risks to the legal profession. “Whether the same decision [to act for Assad] would be made today, in the light of further information now available and, arguably, the more stringent demands of the regulatory environment, is a point on which one might speculate,” Farrer said in its response.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump has said he is expecting to travel to to the UK in September for his second state visit. King Charles is preparing to host the US president and first lady as the UK government tries to bolster transatlantic ties after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on trading partners. The venue is expected to be Windsor Castle, with Keir Starmer and the US president understood to have discussed the visit during a phone call. Trump on Thursday appeared to suggest Buckingham Palace was “setting a date for September”. He told reporters in the Oval Office: “I was invited by the king and the country – great country. “They’re going to do a second, as you know, a second fest … that’s what it is: a fest, and it’s beautiful, and it’s the first time it’s ever happened to one person. “And the reason is we have two separate terms, and it’s an honour … I’m a friend of Charles, I have great respect for King Charles and the family, William, we have really just a great respect for the family. “And I think they’re setting a date for September.” Starmer has prioritised striking a trade deal with Washington, opting not to retaliate over Trump’s decision toimpose 10% tariffs on goods exported to the US, and 25% tariffs on UK car and steel exports, instead offering concessions on areas including digital taxes and agriculture. The US vice-president, JD Vance, said on Tuesday he believed a mutually beneficial US-UK trade deal was within reach. In February, the king extended a personal invitation for the Trumpsto stay at either Dumfries House or Balmoral, both in Scotland. Starmer used his trip to the White House to present the US president with the invitation letter from the monarch. Traditionally second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.",

    "title": "Eyesight rules for UK motorists ‘ineffective and unsafe’, inquest finds",
    "article_text": "An inquest into the deaths of four people killed by drivers with failing eyesight in northernEnglandhas found enforcement of visual legal standards for motorists is “ineffective and unsafe”. The HM senior coroner for Lancashire, Dr James Adeley, has sent a report to the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, calling for action to be taken to prevent future deaths. Adeley labelled the licensing system for drivers as the “laxest in Europe” as he said the UK was one of only three countries to rely on self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive. He said it was concerning that the UK was the only European country to issue licences without any visual checks for a continuous period up to the age of 70. The coroner made the remarks on Thursday at the inquests in Preston of Marie Cunningham, 79, Grace Foulds, 85, Peter Westwell, 80, and Anne Ferguson, 75. Cunningham and Foulds, who were friends, were hit by Glyn Jones, 68, in his Audi A3 as they crossed the road in Southport, Merseyside, on 30 November 2021. Jones was aware for some years before the collision that his sight was insufficient to meet the minimum requirement to drive a car but failed to declare it to the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). When he was jailed for seven years and four months, his sentencing hearing was told he could not see his steering wheel clearly. Westwell was hit by Neil Pemberton, 81, as he crossed the road in Langho, near Blackburn, on 17 March 2022. Pemberton, who was jailed for 32 months, had a long history of eye disease and was informed on several occasions by different clinicians that he should not drive, the inquest heard. He also repeatedly failed to declare his sight deficit on licence applications to the DVLA. Ferguson died when she was struck by a van driven by Vernon Law, 72, in Whitworth, Rochdale, on 11 July 2023. A month before the incident, Law was told he had cataracts in both eyes but he lied to an optometrist that he did not drive. Law, who was jailed for four years, knew he had problems with his eyes for years before the collision and also failed to declare his sight issues on licence applications to the DVLA, the inquest at County Hall heard. Adeley said: “The four fatalities shared the same feature that the driver’s sight was well below the standard required to drive a car. “The current system for ‘ensuring’ drivers meet the visual legal standards is ineffective, unsafe and unfit to meet the needs of society as evidenced by the deaths of Marie Cunningham, Grace Foulds, Anne Ferguson and Peter Westwell where the DVLA continued to provide licences to drivers who had failed to meet the legal sight requirements.” The Department forTransportsaid it would consider the coroner’s report once received. A spokesperson added: “The NHS recommends adults should have their eyes tested every two years and drivers are legally required to inform the DVLA if they have a condition which affects their eyesight. “We are committed to improving road safety and continue to explore ways to achieve this.”",

    "title": "NHS warned it must change guidance on single-sex spaces after court ruling",
    "article_text": "NHS bosses are scrambling to overhaul guidelines for single-sex spaces in thousands of hospitals and GP surgeries after the equality watchdog warned they would be pursued if they fail to do so. The British Transport Police became thefirst to change policieson Thursday amid the fallout from thesupreme court rulingon the legal definition of a woman, piling pressure on the health service and other organisations to revamp their guidance. Current NHS guidance in England says trans people should be accommodated based on how they dress, their names and their pronouns. Under Wednesday’s ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act 2010, this would be scrapped. Senior NHS legal officials and estates and facilities managers are racing to draw up proposals for how hospitals, community care centres and GP practices should reflect the ruling, sources told the Guardian. The ruling poses a challenge for the NHS, which has an estate spanning 25m square metres in England alone, with infrastructure repair bills of more than £14bn. The issue is further complicated by the fact that health policy and spending is devolved in Wales and Scotland. Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday: “They [the NHS] have to change it. They now have clarity. “There is no confusion as of yesterday, at 10.30 in the morning, and they can start to implement the new legal reasoning and produce their exceptions forthwith, but they have to change it. We will be having conversations with them to update that guidance.” Asked if the EHRC would pursue the matter if the NHS did not do so, she replied: “Yes, we will.” An NHS England spokesperson said: “The NHS is currently reviewing guidance on same-sex accommodation and, as part of this process, will consider and take into account all relevant legislation and [Wednesday’s] ruling.” Meanwhile, the BTP, which patrols the railways in Great Britain, announced that male officers would conduct intimate searches of trans women “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”, while trans men would be searched by female officers. Under the force’s previous policy, officers had been told that anyone in custody with a gender recognition certificate would be searched by an officer matching a detainee’s acquired gender. The update comes during a legal battle between gender-critical campaigners and the force over its guidance that allowed transgender officers to strip-search women, so long as the officer held a gender recognition certificate. The rapid change of approach came after Lady Falkner said the EHRC would be issuing updated and legally binding codes of practice on single-sex spaces and services in the wake of the “enormously consequential” court ruling. “We are going to have a new statutory code of practice [meaning] it will be interpreted by courts as the law of the land. We’re hoping we’re going to have that by the summer,” she told Today. She said the judgment meant only biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women’s toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women’s wards in hospitals. Even so, the commission “will not tolerate” discrimination or harassment of trans people, which remains unlawful under the Equality Act, and would support trans women taking out equal pay claims under sex discrimination laws. Falkner said the ruling was “a victory for common sense” but “only if you recognise that trans people exist, they have rights and their rights must be respected. Then it becomes a victory for common sense.” The UK government has avoided making any substantial comment on the ruling, but a strong indication of Labour’s approach came from Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, who swung the party behind the supreme court and the EHRC’s stance. Previously a supporter of self-identification for trans people, Sarwar said there was now a need for an “urgent” update of Scotland’s policies on single-sex spaces. Scottish ministers are expected to update Holyrood next week on their response to the ruling. “I’ve always said that we should protect single-sex spaces on the basis of all biological sex,” he said during a visit in Falkirk. “There’s a clear ruling now from the supreme court.” The bulk of the reaction from Westminster politicians continued to come from the Conservatives. Speaking during a local elections campaign visit to Cambridgeshire, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said the court decision was a vindication of their views. She said she would support changes to the Equality Act and Gender Recognition Act to cement the court’s view. “These laws were written 20 years ago plus when the world was different. A lot of people are trying to change what the law means,” she said. In contrast, there was little sign of how ministers will help institutions navigate the new framework. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, on a visit to Scunthorpe, dodged some questions on the issue, saying only that more advice would come in “due course”. Among the issues that will need to be tackled is provision of toilet facilities for transgender people, given the EHRC said the ruling means they will not be able to use single-sex toilets. A directive introduced by Badenoch when she was equalities minister last year requires new public buildings such as offices and shopping centres to prioritise single-sex toilets, and to provide universal toilets only “where space allows”. That regulation remains in force, meaning public buildings could become increasingly inaccessible for transgender users.",

    "title": "UK government accused of ‘delay and drift’ over adult social care talks",
    "article_text": "The government has been accused of “delay and drift” after it emerged crucial cross-party talks aimed at building political consensus for large-scale changes to adult social care have failed to get off the ground. The Liberal Democrats said not a single all-party meeting on the issue had taken place in the four months since the governmentannounced ambitious plansto build a national care service to fix the UK’s growing social care crisis. Wes Streeting said in January that older people could be left without help and the NHS overwhelmed unless a national consensus could be reached on how to fix a system widely regarded as failing. The health secretary appointed Louise Casey to chair a commission on social care witha brief to build agreementbetween the main parties on how the changes could be taken forward. Streeting said past attempts at reform had stumbled because of “bad politics”. Talks were scheduled to open on 26 February but were postponed after ministers said that not all parties could make the meeting. The Lib Dems offered to “clear our diaries” to reschedule but said a new date has not yet been proposed. Helen Morgan, the Lib Dems’ health and social care spokesperson, said: “If it’s taking almost two months and counting to schedule a single meeting, I have serious concerns about the focus at the top of government needed to successfully undertake and implement this review. “Ministers’ handling of these cross-party talks smells of a government that has put rescuing social care in the ‘too difficult’ pile. “Their failure to grasp the nettle means that a review that could have been completed within a year is instead taking three, with ministers risking even longer delays because of their failure to get these talks off the ground. “For years under the Conservatives, [social care] was shamefully neglected, with patients bearing the brunt. Now, theLabourgovernment is taking an approach of kicking the can down the road rather than facing up to the challenges of fixing this broken system.” Lady Casey, who was due to join the social care commission this month, was appointed by ministers in mid-January to carry out athree-month report into child sexual abuse grooming gangs. The government has insisted this would not affect her work on the social care commission. It is understood Casey has promised to convene meetings once her work on the grooming gangs report is complete. A government official said the original date and time for the planned meeting had not worked for all invited parties. A spokesperson for the Department ofHealthand Social Care said: “This government is committed to building national, cross-party consensus to create a fair and affordable adult social care system for all. “This is why the prime minister has asked Baroness Louise Casey to lead an independent commission into adult social care as part of our critical first steps towards building a national care service.” Reform of adult social care has been on and off the policy agenda for more than two decades, with attempts by governments of all stripes to overhaul the system repeatedly derailed by political timidity and lack of cross-party consensus. Social care expertscriticised the governmentin January for putting a three-year timescale on changes that they argued could be put in place with a year. They said the issue was not about how to change social care but agreeing what should be done. Care providers have urged rapid reform of adult social care, saying the sector facesserious financial problemsas a result of the introduction of national insurance and minimum wage rises this month, which have added £2.8bn to their costs. Many have said they face “tough decisions” as a result of rising unfunded costs, including handing back unviable care contracts to councils andevicting residents, reducing care quality, laying off staff, reducing their hours or freezing pay.",

    "title": "Trump Media urges regulators to investigate hedge fund’s vast bet against stock",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s fledgling media firm has urged market regulators to investigate “suspicious activity” after a London-based hedge fund disclosed a vast bet against its stock. Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the US president’s Truth Social platform, raised questions over trading by Qube Research & Technologies. Earlier this week, Qube revealed a significant short position in Trump Media via filings with Germany’s federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger. It disclosed a position of almost 6m shares, according to Trump Media. Short-selling is a way of betting against a public company. An investor borrows a stock, and then sells it on; should the stock fall, the investor then buys it back and pockets the difference. In a memo to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump Media – which trades under the ticker “DJT”, using Trump’s initials – said the total short interest in the company was 10.7m as of 31 March, according to Nasdaq, where its shares are listed, and had only risen to about 11m as of Wednesday. These factors “especially when combined with the history of suspicious trading surrounding DJT stock … could be indications of the illegal naked short selling of DJT shares”, Trump Media claimed. Qube did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in Trump Media rallied by about 7% in New York on Thursday. They have fallen by more than a third this year.

    "title": "Spurs contractors judged felled Enfield oak to be ‘fine specimen’",
    "article_text": "An ancient London oak controversially felled earlier this month was assessed to be a “fine specimen” last year by tree experts working forTottenham Hotspuras part of the football club’s plans to redevelop parkland next to the site. Mitchells & Butlers Retail (MBR), which owns the Toby Carvery in Whitewebbs Park, Enfield, apologised on Thursday for the “upset” caused by the felling of the tree. The company’s financial links with Spurs have raised questions about how much the club knew about the decision to fell the tree. Spurs and MBR are majority-owned by the investment company Enic. In itslatest annual accounts, MBR disclosed that it had entered into an option arrangement with Spurs to buy the lease on one of its retail sites, believed to be the Toby Carvery in Enfield. Spurs have submitted a planning application to build a women’s football training academy on 17 hectares of adjacent land in Whitewebbs Park. It also submitted plans to build an access road from the training ground to the Toby Carvery. The plan for an access road has since been replaced with a scheme for a footpath across the site where the oak, which was up to 500 years old, stood. As part of the planning process, Spurs commissioned the Tree and Woodland Company to produce an arboreal impact assessment on the veteran woodland in the park. In a report submitted to Enfield council last July, the company assessed that the now felled oak was a “fine specimen” that was expected to live for at least another 50 years. It recommended conservation measures for the tree as a high priority. MBR claimed its contractors felled the tree on 3 April for safety reasons after assessing it was dead and diseased. In a letter to Enfield residents on Thursday, its chief executive, Phil Urban, said: “I can only apologise for all the upset that it has caused.” It said: “We are obliged to act on all health and safety issues where expert advice warns us of a direct risk to life or serious injury. We will complete a thorough review and ensure that, in future, exceptional situations are treated differently from the more regular health and safety issues that arise on a day-to-day basis.” Enfield council hasthreatened the company with legal actionand imposed a tree preservation order on the whole Toby Carvery site. The Woodlands Trust, which objected to the training facility plans because of the impact on ancient trees in the area, said Spurs and MBR had more questions to answer. Adam Cormack, the trust’s head of campaigning, said: “There is some uncertainty about whether the ancient Whitewebbs oak that was felled is or is not part of development plans for Tottenham Hotspur FC’s new training facility and we’d like to seek clarification from the club on this.” Cormack welcomed Toby Carvery’s apology but said it did not go far enough. He said: “Toby Carvery must now be fully transparent with their paperwork and work with local authorities as they investigate. Did they know about the Spurs tree survey, which called the oak a ‘fine specimen’ and makes recommendations for its conservation? Did they consider any alternatives to felling, and if not, why not?” Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Russell Miller, an expert on ancient trees who visited the oak before it was felled and has inspected it since, said: “I refute the claim that the tree was dying and dangerous. I have looked at the structural integrity of the tree and I saw it in December. There was no logic to touching that tree other than wanting an ancient tree out of the way because of some financial interest.” Police closed their investigation on Tuesday after deciding it was a civil matter. MBR decline to comment. A Spurs spokesperson said: “The tree and the decision to fell it has no connection to the club as the tree sits outside of our lease demise for our proposed women’s and girls’ training centre and academy.” The club confirmed it had an option to lease Toby Carvery’s land within Whitewebbs Park but stressed this was just an option. It also claimed it was “ridiculous” to suggest the tree was felled to make the land easier to develop.",

The indictment returned by a grand jury in Manhattan federal court also charges Mangione with two counts of stalking and a firearms count. It was not immediately clear when the 26-year-old Mangione will be arraigned. A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for his lawyers. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, also faces separate state murder charges. He’s accused of shooting Thompson, 50, in the back outside a Manhattan hotel on 4 December as the executive arrived for UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference. US attorney general,Pam Bondi, announced this month that she had directed federal prosecutors in Manhattan to seek the death penalty, following through on Donald Trump’s campaign promise to vigorously pursue capital punishment. It’s the first death penalty case sought by the justice department since the president returned to office in January with a vow to resume federal executions after they were halted under the previous administration. The killing and ensuing five-day manhunt leading to Mangione’s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings.

    "title": "Two killed and six injured in Florida university shooting, officials say",
    "article_text": "Two people were killed in a mass shooting at theFloridaState University (FSU) campus in Tallahassee on Thursday, and six others were injured, police said. The 20-year-old suspect is believed to be a student and the son of a sheriff’s deputy who had access to one of her weapons, a handgun, which was found at the scene, Sheriff Walt McNeil said at a news conference. Law enforcement officials confirmed that none of the victims were students or police officers. Officials named the suspect as Phoenix Ikner, a student at FSU and the son of a Leon county sheriff’s deputy. The police said he had been involved with training programs at the police force. Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the shooting, which began around lunchtime just outside the student union, sending students and frightened parents hiding for cover in a bowling alley and a freight elevator inside the building. The suspect “had been in the Leon county sheriff’s office family, engaged in a number of training programs that we have”, McNeil said. “So, it’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons. This event is tragic in more ways than you people in the audience could ever imagine, from a law enforcement perspective.” The suspect’s mother has been with the sheriff’s office for more than 18 years, McNeil said. The officials confirmed that the suspect was currently being treated at a hospital. Ambulances, fire trucks and patrol vehicles from multiple law enforcement agencies had raced toward the campus that sits just west of Florida’s state capital after the university issued a shooter alert at midday, saying police were responding near the student union. “Our prayers are with our FSU family and state law enforcement is actively responding,” the state’s governor,Ron DeSantis, wrote on X. The gunfire was reported at the student union building on the FSU campus and students and faculty were advised to shelter in place as police responded. More than 42,000 students attend classes at the main campus. Videosposted on social mediashow students being evacuated from the scene. By midafternoon the Florida State University campus had been secured, according to the Tallahassee police department. Multiple law enforcement agencies remained on site for the ongoing investigation. The student union and the surrounding area were still considered an active crime scene. Earlier, hundreds of students streamed away from the direction of the student union. Students were glued to their phones, some visibly emotional, while others hugged each other. Dozens gathered near the music school waiting for news. The Tallahassee Memorial hospital confirmed it was treating six patients wounded in the shooting, one in critical condition. Ryan Cedergren, a 21-year-old communications student, said he and about 30 others hid in the bowling alley in the lower level of the student union after seeing students running from a nearby bar. “In that moment, it was survival,” he said. Donald Trump opened his Oval Officemeetingat the White House with the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, with comments on the shooting, saying he had been fully briefed. “It’s a horrible thing. It’s horrible that things like this take place,” the US president said. Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old daughter Jaime Guttenberg, who was murdered in the 2018 Parkland high school shooting, said ina post on X: “America is broken.” “As a father, all I ever wanted after the Parkland shooting was to help our children be safe,” he said. “Sadly, because of the many people who refuse to do the right things about reducing gun violence, I am not surprised by what happened today.” Guttenberg also said that many of his daughter’s friends who survived the Parkland shooting are current students at FSU. University police escorted the students out of the union after about 15 minutes of hiding. A junior student, Joshua Sirmans, 20, was in the university’s main library when he said alarms began going off warning of a shooter. Law enforcement officers escorted him and other students out of the library with their hands over their heads, he said. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said in a social media post that the justice department was in touch with FBI agents on the scene. Students and faculty were instructed to seek shelter and await further instructions. “Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures,” the alert said. The Leon county school district, where Tallahassee is located,posted on X: “All LCS schools are back to normal operating procedures. Lockout has been lifted district wide.” The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting",

    "article_text": "TheFoodand Drug Administration (FDA) is suspending a quality-control program for its food-testing laboratories as a result of staff cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to an internal email seen by Reuters. The proficiency testing program of the FDA’s Food Emergency Response Network is designed to ensure consistency and accuracy across the agency’s network of about 170 labs that testfoodfor pathogens and contaminants to prevent food-borne illness. The firing and departure of as many as 20,000 HHS employees has upended publichealthresearch and disrupted the agency’s work on areas likebird fluand drug reviews.Donald Trumphopes to slash as much as $40bn from HHS. “Unfortunately, significant reductions in force, including a key quality assurance officer, an analytical chemist, and two microbiologists at FDA’s Human Food Program Moffett Center have an immediate and significant impact on the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Proficiency Testing (PT) Program,” says the email sent on Tuesday from FERN’s National Program Office and seen by Reuters. The program will be suspended at least through 30 September and means the agency will be unable to do planned quality-control work around lab testing for the parasite cyclospora in spinach or the pesticide glyphosate in barley, among other tests, the email says. “These PTs and Exercises are critical to demonstrating the competency and readiness of our laboratory network to detect and respond to food safety and food defense events,” the email says. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A former FDA officialtoldCBS News: “There’s so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn’t make sense.” The outlet further reported that the FDA is devising plans that would halt most of its routine food safety inspection work, citing multiple federal health officials. According to the officials who spoke to the network under anonymity, the plans may need congressional action to fully fund, adding that some higher-risk routine food inspections would probably remain at the FDA. Food safety laboratories rely on these types of tests to meet standards for accreditation, said a source familiar with the situation, who was not aware of other ready alternatives to the FDA to provide such testing. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion The FDA in early April suspended an effort to improve its testing for bird flu in milk, cheese and pet food as a result of staff cuts. In February, HHS announced plans to fire 5,200 probationary employees across various agencies including the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same month, Jim Jones, the head of food division at the FDA, quit in protest against the staff cuts. At the time, Jonessaid: “I was looking forward to working to pursue the department’s agenda of improving the health of Americans by reducing diet-related chronic disease and risks from chemicals in food.” He went on to add that the cuts would make it “fruitless” to continue in his role under theTrump administration, which he said has “disdain for the very people” needed to ensure food safety.",

    "article_text": "The head of the US Department of Transportation (DOT) has announced that theTrump administrationwould be taking over the reconstruction of Penn Station in New York, removing it from the care of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Alongside the transportation department, Amtrak – which is federally funded – will now helm the project. Penn Station sees more than600,000 commutersevery day and is the busiest transit hub in the western hemisphere. The MTA has for years attempted to execute its plan to renovate the station in an effort to increase train service in and out of New York and instead found itself mired in controversy owing in part to competing priorities of its various stakeholders. Some of those include the MTA, Amtrak, NJ Transit and Madison Square Garden (the venue which sits atop Penn Station). The DOT claimed in astatementthat this move “will save taxpayers approximately $120m” and that Trump is “also championing a public-private partnership model for Penn Station, harnessing private sector innovation and capital to minimize financial risk to taxpayers”. The statement did not clarify how, exactly, this will save taxpayers money or what the administration’s plans for the renovations include. Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said in a statement: “New York City deserves a Penn Station that reflects America’s greatness and is safe and clean. “The MTA’s history of inefficiency, waste and mismanagement also meant that a new approach is needed. By putting taxpayers first, we’re ensuring every dollar is spent wisely to create a transit hub all Americans can take pride in.” Amtrak’s takeover of the project comes barely a month after its CEO Stephen Gardner stepped down from his position “to ensure that Amtrak continues to enjoy the full faith and confidence of this administration”, according toABC7. Gardner’s resignation took place in the immediate aftermath of remarks from Trump’s billionaire ally Elon Musk, who said at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media & Telecom conference in March that it was “kind of embarrassing” how other countries have “way better passenger rail than we do” and that “Amtrak is a sad situation”. Musk added that he thought Amtrak should be privatized.",

    "article_text": "Harry Maguire scored in the dying seconds of extra time to help Manchester United snatch a place in the Europa League semifinals with a sensational7-6 aggregate victoryover Olympique Lyonnais in their quarterfinal. A thrilling second leg tie was taken into extra time after United threw away a two-goal lead on the night to be pegged back to 2-2 after 90 minutes, with goals from Rayan Cherki and Alexandre Lacazette putting Lyon on the verge of the semifinals at a stunned Old Trafford on Thursday. However, United made their numerical advantage, given to them after Corentin Tolisso’s late red card in normal time, count. Maguire sent Old Trafford into delirium with his 121st-minute header, which sealed a 5-4 victory in the second leg. It was the hosts who took an early lead, Manuel Ugarte slotting home 10 minutes in after a fine team move, before Diogo Dalot added a second just before the break to double the hosts’ lead. As the minutes ticked on, however, the nerves crept in, and two goals in six second-half minutes from Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico drew the match and left the tie level in a sensational fashion. Tolisso’s late sending off swung the momentum back in United’s favour, but Cherki’s fine strike and Lacazzette’s calmly taken penalty seemingly settled the exhilarating contest. Fernandes’s spot kick straight down the other end gave the home supporters hope of another dramatic finale, with Maguire having the final say, with United heading through to face Athletic Bilbao in the last four. Tottenham also put its domestic problems to one side by sealing a place in the last four. Dominic Solanke’s first-half penalty secured a 1-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt and a 2-1 aggregate victory. The win keeps alive the Spurs’ hopes of salvaging a desperate campaign that has left them languishing in 15th place in the Premier League. The deep run in the second-tier competition has provided rare moments of optimism – and triumph would not only deliver a first trophy since 2008, but qualification for next year’s Champions League. Athletic Bilbao also advanced to the semifinals after a 2-0 win over the Rangers following a 0-0 draw in the first leg. Lazio vs Bodo/Glimt also went to extra time. Lazio won 2-0 on the night and levelled the tie at 2-2 on aggregate. Spurs needed the assistance of VAR when awarded a penalty for a foul by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kaua Santos on James Maddison. Solanke fired down the middle for the decisive goal in the 43rd minute. Oihan Sancet and Nico Williams were on target for Bilbao against the Rangers at San Mames.",

    "article_text": "The 20-year-old son of a sheriff’s deputy opened fire at Florida State University with his mother’s former service weapon, killing two people and wounding at least six others, investigators said. The attack on Friday occurred at approximately 11:50am Eastern Time (15:50 GMT) outside of the Tallahassee school’s student union. The university swiftly issued an active shooter alert, with Florida State’s alert system announcing that law enforcement had “neutralised the threat” soon after. Florida State University Police Chief Jason Trumbower said that the two people killed, who were not immediately identified, were not students at the school. Five other people were being treated at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, where the attacker was also being treated after being taken into custody, he said. Speaking from the Oval Office, United States President Donald Trump said that he had been “fully briefed.” “It’s a horrible thing. It’s horrible that things like this take place,” Trump said. He quickly pivoted to voicing support forgun ownership, saying, “These things are terrible, but the gun doesn’t do the shooting. The people do.” Leon County Sheriff Walter McNeil later identified the suspect as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the son of a sheriff’s deputy within his own department. He said Ikner used his mother’s former service weapon in the attack, adding the attacker had been a longstanding member of the sheriff’s office’s youth advisory council and engaged in a number of training programmes with the office. “We will make sure that we do everything we can to prosecute and make sure that we send a message to folks that this will never be tolerated here in Leon County, and I dare say across the state and across this nation,” McNeil said. Police said Ikner is believed to be a student at the university, but a motive for the attack was not immediately known. Ikner invoked his right to silence upon being arrested, authorities said. School shootings arerelatively commonwithin the US, and Thursday’s shooting was not the first attack at the university. In 2014, three people were shot just outside and inside the entrance of Strozier Library in the middle of the university campus. Officers who arrived within two minutes of the first call shot and killed the gunman, a 31-year-old man.",

    "article_text": "Ukraine and the United States have signed a memorandum as an initial step towards the clinching of an agreement on developingmineralsin the country, Kyiv’s first deputy prime minister and economy minister said. “We are happy to announce the signing, with our American partners, of a Memorandum of Intent, which paves the way for an Economic Partnership Agreement and the establishment of the Investment Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine,” Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on the social media platform X. Kyiv and Washington had discussed signing a deal on extracting Ukraine’s strategic minerals in February, but a clash between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy temporarily derailed work on theagreement. Trump says he wants the deal, designed to give the US royalty payments on profits from Ukrainian mining of resources and rare minerals, as compensation for aid given to Ukraine by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Svyrydenko did not publish details of the memorandum, but said work continued towards securing a final agreement. “We hope that the Fund will become an effective tool for attracting investments in the reconstruction of our country, modernisation of infrastructure, support for business, and the creation of new economic opportunities,” she said. “There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries.” The Ukrainian delegation travelled to Washington at the end of last week for negotiations after the Trump administration offered a new, more expansive deal. The initial framework agreement that was agreed to has never been signed. “We have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday,” Trump told reporters at the White House earlier. Zelenskyy had also said earlier that the two countries could sign a memorandum of intent online. “This is a memorandum of intent. And we have positive, constructive intentions,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv. He added that the offer to sign the memorandum before the comprehensive deal, which would require ratification in the Ukrainian parliament, had come from the US side. US officials say boosting American business interests in Ukraine will help deter Russia fromfuture aggressionin the event of a ceasefire. Kyiv is pushing for concrete military and security guarantees as part of any deal to halt the three-year war.",

    "title": "Macron hails Paris talks with top US officials on ending Ukraine war",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has hosted senior United States officials in Paris for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, as Kyiv’s allies in Europe seek to play a larger role in stalled efforts to end the conflict amid tensions with Washington. Speaking after he hosted US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday, Macron said the talks represented “a very important occasion for convergence”. “Everyone wants to get peace – a robust and sustainable peace. The question is about phasing,” the French leader said. US President Donald Trump’s administration has been pushing to end the Russia-Ukraine war, with Trump himself holdingbilateral discussionswith his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But so far, Trump’s efforts have not borne fruit, and the US president has expressed frustration with both Moscow and Kyiv. Ukraine agreed to a Trump proposal last month for a ceasefire, but Russia rejected the idea. The sides have agreed only to curbs onattacks against energy targetsand at sea, which both accuse each other of violating. Meanwhile, the US’s overtures towards Russia over the past several weeks have raised concern among some European leaders, who urged Trump to ensure that Ukraine has a seat at the negotiating table in any negotiations. Reporting from Paris on Thursday, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra noted that the Macron-hosted talks marked a “strong indication that the Americans are trying to team up with the Europeans” to try to reach a ceasefire agreement. Ahelbarra said there has been “a great deal of frustration and scepticism” among European leaders after the Trump administration indicated it planned todisengage from Europeand did not expect European countries to play a critical role in efforts to end the war. “[Europe] would like to have a key role in the ceasefire talks because they say that they are the ones who can guarantee that the Ukrainians’ voice can be heard,” he added. Macron spoke to Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, by phone on Thursday in advance of the talks with Rubio and Witkoff, the French president’s office said. Before that, Macron’s foreign policy adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, and his British and German counterparts met Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, who said they discussed the potential ceasefire and security guarantees. “We exchanged views on the next steps toward achieving a just and lasting peace, including the implementation of a full ceasefire, the involvement of a multinational military contingent, and the development of an effective security architecture for Ukraine,” Yermak said on social media. The flurry of diplomacy comes as Russia has continued to attack Ukraine, with Ukrainian authorities saying drone strikes and shelling killed at least 12 people on Thursday. ARussian attackthat killed at least 35 people in the northeastern city of Sumy on Sunday also drew widespread condemnation this week and renewed calls to end the war. Zelenskyy had earlier on Thursday urged the leaders meeting in Paris to lean on Russia to agree to a ceasefire. “Russia uses every day and every night to kill. We must put pressure on the killers,” he said on Telegram. Zelenskyy also accused Witkoff, the US envoy, of “spreading Russian narratives” after he suggested a peace deal with Russia hinged on the status of Ukraine’s occupied territories. “I believe that Mr Witkoff has taken on the strategy of the Russian side,” Zelenskyy told reporters. “I think it is very dangerous, because he is consciously or unconsciously, I don’t know, spreading Russian narratives.” Witkoff said this week that Putin was open to “permanent peace” after heheld talks with the Russian presidentin Saint Petersburg, their third meeting since Trump returned to the White House in January. In a statement following Thursday’s talks, the US State Department said Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “The Secretary conveyed to his Russian counterpart the same message the US team communicated to the Ukrainian delegation and our European allies in Paris: President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” it said. Russia’s foreign ministry confirmed the officials spoke by phone and said that Lavrov stressed Moscow’s willingness to continue dialogue with Washington “to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.”",

The English language debate on Thursday will round out the only two debates before theApril 28 vote, which comes after Carney called for a snap election in March, in advance of the officially scheduled October 20 vote. In a last-minute move, the Leaders’ Debates Commission dropped the Green Party, and its co-leader Jonathan Pedneault, from both debates, saying the party was not running enough candidates to meet the qualifying criteria. The debate was also moved up two hours to avoid conflicting with a Montreal Canadiens playoff-qualifying match. The majority of Canada’s about 10 million French speakers live in the province of Quebec, where the team is based. Here were the top takeaways from Wednesday’s debate: In just under three months in office, US President Donald Trump has undertaken one of the most significant shifts in US relations with Canada in history. His actions have included imposingwide-ranging tariffson the northern neighbour and, in an unprecedented threat of annexation, repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st” state. On Wednesday, Carney, whose Liberal party has seen surging support in the face of Trump’s threats, sought to centre the US president, saying the election is about “who will face up to Trump”. “In a crisis, you have to have a plan,” said Carney, who spent the night pushing his economic bonafides, which included leading the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England Poilievre, who in the past has been likened to a Canadian “mini Trump”, pledged to negotiate a deal that would bring down tariffs, while saying he would protect Canadian sovereignty. “We will never be an American state,” he said. Bloc Quebecois leader Blanchet, meanwhile, accused Carney of failing to protect Quebec in his early response to Trump. “So far, all we have seen is efforts being deployed to protect the Ontario economy, which is the way Canada defines itself,” he said. For Poilievre, who for months had a commanding polling lead over the Liberals, sought to drive home one unifying theme: That Canadians want change after nine and a half years of a Liberal government, led mostly by Justin Trudeau. Poilievre said Carney was repeating the same promises Trudeau had made during his time in power and accused his party of driving up housing prices and weakening the economy by blocking natural resource development. Carney shot back that he was leading the Bank of England from 2013 to 2019, as he sought to distance himself from the Liberals’ policies during that period. “You are just like Justin Trudeau … we need change and you, Mr Carney, are not change,” Poilievre told Carney. “Mr Poilievre is not Mr Trudeau and neither am I,” Carney shot back. Poilievre also took particular aim at the Liberals’ immigration policies. Trudeau had boosted visas to work in Canada to address labour shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic, but cut those caps dramatically last year as critics seized on the country’s rapid population growth. The Conservative candidate said liberals allowed immigration to “spiral out of control”. Carney also sought to differentiate himself from the Liberals’ past policies, saying the “system isn’t working, especially after the pandemic”. He said he supported keeping the lowered caps in place for the time being. Poilievre added he would block those seeking safety from violence-wracked Haiti, while Carney said he supported temporary caps on asylum seekers. “We have to be human, but we have to be realistic. Canada can’t accept everyone,” he said. Meanwhile, the New Democratic Party’s Singh said that in light of Trump’s crackdown on refugees and asylum seekers, Canada should end its “Safe Third Party” agreement with the US. The agreement allows Canada to turn back asylum seekers who enter from the US. “We’re talking about a dangerous situation, and we should respond with compassion,” Singh said. The economic uncertainty spurred by Trump’s tariffs has also brought renewed focus on Canada’s energy policy. Hailing from the country’s oil capital, Alberta, Poilievre has long pushed for deregulation and boosting oil production. On Wednesday, he promised to surge oil production through more oil pipelines. Carney also signalled a willingness to boost oil production through pipelines, but said approval would be needed from both Quebec and Indigenous groups, as is required under law. “This is Canada. That’s how Canada works,” Carney said. Still, upon being pressed, he said the environment remained a Liberal priority. Bloc Quebecois leader Blanchet accused both the Liberal and Conservative leaders of ignoring the ravages of climate change. “The denial of the reality of climate change since the beginning of this campaign and the change of heart of Mr Carney, who decided to be more conservative than Mr Poilievre, is very harmful for our environment,” Blanchet said. Carney, the only candidate on stage lacking a strong grasp of the French language, generally managed to hold his own throughout the debate and avoid any major faux pas. Still, the issue of language rights and preservation featured prominently, including discussion of Bill 96, a sweeping 2022 reform to Quebec’s law that limited the use of English in some government services and courts. The law has been challenged by non-French-speaking groups in the province, and remains a delicate subject for candidates seeking to win support in Quebec. Poilievre said he “will continue to support laws and policies that allow Quebec and the federal government to protect the French language all across Canada”. Carney was more circumspect, saying, “The question is, do we have rights and freedoms here in Canada? Are we equal?” “We need to consider the right balance.” Carney also pledged that the Liberal government would seek to bolster the declining French-speaking population in Canada by increasing the rate of francophone immigrants to provinces outside of Quebec from 10 to 12 percent.",

    "title": "Saudi defence minister visits Tehran before Iran-US talks",
    "article_text": "Saudi Arabia’s Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman has met several Iranian officials before asecond round of talksbetween Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear programme. The visit comes amid growing fears of a potential conflict in the region if diplomatic efforts fail to resolve soaring tensions between the United States and Iran, with President Donald Trump repeatedly threatening to bomb Iran if it does not reach an agreement with the US over its nuclear-related activities. Prince Khalid said he conveyed a message from Saudi Arabia’s King Salman to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during Thursday’s meeting in Tehran. “We discussed our bilateral relations and topics of mutual interest,” he wrote on X. “Our belief is that the relationship between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia is beneficial for both countries,” Iranian state media cited Khamenei as saying in the meeting on Thursday. Prince Khalid also met President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iran’s armed forces chief of staff, Mohammad Bagheri. “Ties between the Saudi and Iranian armed forces have been improving since the Beijing agreement,” Bagheri said after the meeting, according to Iranian state media. Saudi Arabia has welcomedIran’s nuclear talkswith the US, saying it supported efforts to resolve regional and international disputes. Hamidreza Gholamzadeh, a political analyst, said the purpose of the Saudi defence minister’s was likely to express concern about a potential attack on Iran. “Saudis want to share their concern and reassure Iran that they would not like … attacks against Iran and they want better relations with Iran,” he told Al Jazeera. Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed in a 2023 deal brokered by China to re-establish relations after years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf region and helped fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria. The Saudi defence minister’s trip coincided with a visit to Iran by the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, who warned that the US and Iran were running out of time to reach a deal. Iranian and US delegations areset to gatherin Rome on Saturday for a second round of Omani-mediated negotiations, a week after the longtime foes held their highest-level talks since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord during his first term in 2018. Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has revived his so-called “maximum pressure” policy, imposing punishing economic sanctions against Iran and threatening military action if Tehran does not agree to a deal. “We are in a very crucial stage of these important negotiations. We know we don’t have much time, this is why I am here … to facilitate this process,” Grossi said on Thursday. “We are working hard and we want to succeed,” he told a joint news conference with Iran’s atomic energy agency chief Mohammad Eslami, acknowledging that the effort to secure a deal was “not an easy process”. Asked about US President Donald Trump’s threats to attack Iran, Grossi urged people to “concentrate on our objective.” “Once we get to our objective, all of these things will evaporate because there will be no reason for concern,” he said. In March,Trump senta letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused. Khamenei has cautioned that while the talks with the United States had started well, they could yet prove fruitless. “The negotiations may or may not yield results,” he said on Tuesday. Western governments have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran has consistently denied. Since the nuclear deal’s collapse in 2018, Iran has abandoned all limits on its programme, and enriches uranium to up to 60 percent purity, near weapons-grade levels of 90 percent. Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced inspectors. But despite the tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked.",

    "article_text": "A United States judge has ruled that Alphabet’s Google illegally dominated two markets for online advertising technology, dealing another blow to the tech titan in an antitrust case brought by the US government. On Thursday, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, ruledthat Google unlawfully monopolised marketsfor publisher ad servers and the market for ad exchanges, which sit between buyers and sellers. Antitrust enforcers failed to show the company had a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, she wrote. The ruling could allow prosecutors to argue for a breakup of Google’s advertising products. The US Department of Justice has said that Google should have to sell off at least its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company’s publisher ad server and its ad exchange. Google will now face the possibility of two differentUS courts ordering it to sell assets or change its business practices. A judge in Washington will hold a trial next week on the DOJ’s request to make Google sell itsChrome browser and take other measuresto end its dominance in online search. Google has previously explored selling off its ad exchange to appease European antitrust regulators. Brinkema oversaw a three-week trial last year on claims brought by the DOJ and a coalition of states. Google used classic monopoly-building tactics of eliminating competitors through acquisitions, locking customers into using its products, and controlling how transactions occurred in the online ad market, prosecutors said at the trial. Google argued the case focused on the past, when the company was still working on making its tools able to connect to competitors’ products. Prosecutors also ignored competition from technology companies, including Amazon.com and Comcast, as digital advertisement spending shifted to apps and streaming video, Google’s lawyer said. The move comes asMeta, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp’sparent company, also face allegations of monopolistic competition.",

    "title": "Haiti in ‘free fall’ as violence escalates, rights group warns",
    "article_text": "The security situation in Haiti is in “free fall”, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned, asarmed groupscontinue to unleash deadly violence in the capital and other areas across the Caribbean nation. In a statement on Thursday, HRW said criminal gangs have escalated their attacks in Port-au-Prince since late last year, and only 10 percent of the city remains under government control. “Haiti’s security situation is in a free fall and Haitians are suffering horrific abuses,” said Nathalye Cotrino, the rights group’s senior Americas researcher. The country has reeled from years of violence as powerful armed groups, often with ties to the country’s political and business leaders, have vied for influence and control of territory. But the situation worsened dramatically after theJuly 2021 assassinationof Haitian President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum. In 2024, the gangs launched attacks on prisons and other state institutions across Port-au-Prince, fuelling a renewed political crisis. The campaign of violence led to the resignation of Haiti’sunelected prime minister, the creation of a transitional presidential council, and the deployment of a United Nations-backed, multinational police mission. ThatKenya-led police force– formally known as the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) – has failed to take control back from the gangs, however. Observers say the mission has been underfunded and ill-equipped. Recently, so-called “self-defence” groups have formed in response to the armed gangs, leading to more deadly violence. Protests have also broken out in Port-au-Prince against the country’s transitional presidential council, which has been unable to restore security. On April 7, the authorities declared a new, one-month state of emergency amid the violence. “Declaring emergencies without equipping police with necessary resources, like effective armored vehicles, will not solve the insecurity crisis,” the National Human Rights Defense Network, a leading Haitian rights group, said ina recent report. “The absence of state response has turned the police into firefighters—constantly reacting without strategic direction—while towns fall one after another,” the group said. According to UN figures, at least 1,518 people were killed and another 572 were injured between January 1 and March 27 in gang attacks, security force operations, and acts of violence committed by the “self-defence” groups and others. Speaking to HRW, an aid worker in Haiti said people “no longer have a safe place” to go. “Women … seeking help have not only lost loved ones, but have also been raped, displaced and left on the streets, starving and struggling to survive. We don’t know how much longer they can endure such suffering,” the aid worker said. “All [victims] ask is for the violence to stop. With no support from the police or government, they feel abandoned. They ask, ‘Why is no one helping us? Why do Haitian lives not matter if we are human too?’” The UN also saysmore than 1 million Haitians have been displaced by the violence, while half of the country – some 5.5 million people – face acute food insecurity. In early April, Save the Children reported that more than 40,000 children were among those displaced in the first three months of 2025. “Children in Haiti are trapped in a nightmare,” the group’s Haiti country director, Chantal Sylvie Imbeault, said in astatement. “They are living in deadly areas controlled by armed groups, being robbed of a normal childhood, and at constant risk of recruitment—while humanitarian aid struggles to reach them,” she said. “As displacement continues to soar, shelters are becoming completely overcrowded, leaving children vulnerable to disease,exploitation, and sexual violence.”",

    "title": "Trans women aren’t legally women: What the UK Supreme Court ruling means",
    "article_text": "The United Kingdom’s Supreme Court hasruledthat the terms “woman” and “sex” refer to a “biological woman and biological sex” under UK equality laws, bringing a long-running court battle between feminist groups and the government of Scotland to an end. Wednesday’s ruling is expected to have far-reaching consequences for policies on whether and how spaces and services reserved for women should be extended to include “trans women” – those born male who have transitioned socially or medically or who identify as women – such as changing rooms, domestic violence shelters and medical services. Although the case originally began in Scotland, the court’s interpretation of the law will be effective across the UK, including in England and Wales. Reactions towards the ruling have been mixed: Feminist advocacy groups involved in the legal case have voiced satisfaction, while trans groups and some members of the Scottish government expressed disappointment andfearabout future discrimination. Here’s what we know about the Supreme Court’s ruling and how the case started: The legal dispute began in March 2018 when the Scottish Parliament passed an act stating that 50 percent of non-executive members of the boards of Scottish public bodies must be women. The act, which is known asHolyrood’s Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018,was supposed to ensure better representation for women in public bodies. A sticking point in the policy, however, was the definition of “woman”. The act itself said that “women” included transgender women who held gender recognition certificates (GRCs) –  that is, trans women who have legally transitioned and are certified by the government as having changed their gender. A feminist group, For Women Scotland (FWS), challenged the new law and launched a petition against it in 2018. The group argued that the Scottish parliament had wrongfully defined “woman” and that the law had failed to use legal definitions as set out in the UK Equality Act of 2010. That Act prohibits discrimination based on age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership (in cases of employment), pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. However, the UK Equality Act 2010 does allow for separate or single-sex services to be provided when this is reasonably necessary, such as for reasons of privacy, decency or preventing trauma. A Scottish court dismissed the first case brought by FWS in 2022, concluding that the Scottish legislation did not necessarily redefine “woman” by including transgender women. The judge ruled that women were “not limited to biological or birth sex”. FWS launched an unsuccessful appeal in 2023. The case was then heard at the Scottish Court of Session several times as the group sought to clarify how to correctly interpret the term “woman” as enshrined in the Equality Act. In March 2024, the advocacy group, backed by other feminist organisations and lesbian groups, appealed to the Supreme Court. The group was also supported by Harry Potter author and women’s rights campaigner JK Rowling, who reportedly donated 70,000 pounds ($92,000) to a crowdfunding campaign by FWS. On Wednesday, five judges ruled unanimously that the term “woman” in the existing UK Equality Act should be interpreted as only people born biologically female, and that trans women, even those with GRCs, should be excluded from that definition. The ruling further clarified, therefore, thattrans womencan be excluded from certain single-sex spaces and groups designated for women, such as changing rooms, homeless and domestic violence shelters, swimming areas and medical or counselling services. “Interpreting ‘sex’ as certificated sex would cut across the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ … and, thus, the protected characteristic of sex, in an incoherent way,” Justice Patrick Hodge said while summarising the case. “It would create heterogeneous groupings.” The court added that the ruling was not a “triumph” of one side over the other, and emphasised that transgender people are still protected from discrimination under UK law. However, some protections, the judges clarified, should only apply to biological females and not transgender women. Until now, trans women with GRCs could be counted as women for the purpose of all-women shortlists for political parties or to fill quotas for women on boards or within organisations. This will no longer be the case. In the 20 years since the Gender Recognition Act was passed in the UK, nearly 8,500 GRCs have been issued. The Gender Recognition Panel received 1,397 applications for GRCs in 2023-2024 – a record number. Of those, 1,088 were granted. This was triple the number of applications in 2020-2021, after which the application fee dropped from 140 to 5 pounds ($180 to $7). The ruling provides some clarification on an issue that has provedpolarisingnot only in the UK but also in the United States. Debates have raged in both countries, as well as in other Western nations, on whether certain women’s rights, services or spaces should be extended to trans women. US President Donald Trump is facing legal challenges for signing orders to define sex as only male or female. Trump has also tried tobantransgender people from entering the military andblock trans peoplefrom participating in sports teams that do not align with their biological sex. It’s unclear how the ruling could affect sport in the UK, but trans women may now be restricted, if not excluded, from women’s categories. There’s no nationwide rule on how different sport organisations should include transgender people. Presently, the English Football Association allows trans women to compete in the women category if their testosterone levels are below five nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months. Women typically have 2.5 nanomoles per litre. On the other hand, British Cycling bans trans women from women’s competitions altogether. Rules regarding how domestic violence centres run may also be reassessed. In 2021, RISE, a shelter for women in Brighton, lost 5 million pounds ($6.2m) in local government funding after an assessment found that it did not provide services to trans women. The organisation said it was forced to close its refuge services for women, but was able to continue providing services like therapy. Groups like FWS argue that biological sex cannot be changed and that the rights of transgender people should not come at the expense of women. Allowing trans women to be included in the definition of women would reduce protection for people born female, they argue. Previously, FWS director Triba Budge argued that the Scottish Act at the root of the legal case could be interpreted to mean that public boards could legally consist of “50 percent men and 50 percent men with certificates” – referring to trans women holding GRCs – therefore excluding biological women altogether. On the other hand, trans rights groups say they require the same protections as women. The ruling on Wednesday excludes transgender people from sex discrimination protections and conflicts with human rights laws, they argue. The Supreme Court’s decision would also undermine protections for trans people covered in the UK’s 2004 Gender Recognition Act, opponents said. The law allows trans people to obtain a GRC and update the sex recorded on their birth certificate accordingly, but trans groups say that recognition could now be undermined. Some believe the ruling will lead to more attacks on trans people. Rights and hate monitoring groups note that the average trans person is more likely than others to face discrimination and physical, sexual, or verbal harassment. Stop Hate UK, which monitors attacks on minority groups in the country, reports that the UK police recorded 2,630 hate crimes against transgender people in 2021. The group said that was a 16 percent increase from the previous year and that it was likely an undercount, as most trans people do not feel safe enough to report attacks. FWS and other feminist groups that joined the organisation in the final Supreme Court case celebrated outside the court on Wednesday after the ruling was pronounced. Supporters chanted “Women’s rights are human rights” and popped bottles of wine in celebration. “Everyone knows what sex is and you can’t change it,” Susan Smith, who co-directs FWS, told The Associated Press news agency. “It’s common sense, basic common sense, and the fact that we have been down a rabbit hole where people have tried to deny science and to deny reality, and hopefully this will now see us back to reality.” “We are delighted,” Sex Matters, another group involved in the court case, said in a statement on Wednesday. “The court has given us the right answer: The protected characteristic of sex – male and female – refers to reality, not to paperwork,” the statement read. On the other hand, trans advocacy groups voiced disappointment. “We are really shocked by today’s Supreme Court decision, which reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates,” Scottish Trans said in a statement. The group also accused the court of hearing only from organisations on one side of the debate, and not from trans people. “We think their judgement reflects the fact that trans people’s voices were missing,” the statement read. Maggie Chapman, a legislator of Scotland’s Green Party which has been at the forefront of championing trans rights, said the ruling was “deeply concerning” for human rights and “a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society”. “Trans people have been cynically targeted and demonised by politicians and large parts of the media for far too long. This has contributed to attacks on longstanding rights and attempts to erase their existence altogether,” Chapman added. Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it would accept the ruling. The Scottish Government accepts today’s Supreme Court judgement. The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster. We will now engage on the implications of the ruling. Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions. — John Swinney (@JohnSwinney)April 16, 2025 In a statement posted on X, Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney said the law provided clarity and would be followed. “We will now engage on the implications of the ruling. Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions,” Swinney said. The UK government said the law would clarify issues of service provision in hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs, although in what ways exactly is not yet clear. “Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,” a spokesperson said. It is expected that government institutions across the UK will begin to make changes in line with the ruling. One example of the ruling’s potential effect is the case of a Scottish health organisation which is being sued by a nurse it suspended over her objection to a trans woman using a female changing room. The organisation, NHS Fife, said it had noted the judgement. “We will now take time to carefully consider the judgement and its implications,” a spokesperson said. British Transport Police has already updated a controversial search policy from September 2024 that allowed transgender detainees with a GRC to be searched by officers of their acquired gender. That has now changed, spokesperson Daisy Collingwood told Al Jazeera. “We have advised our officers that any same-sex searches in custody are to be undertaken in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee,” Collingwood said. “We are in the process of reviewing the implications of the ruling and will consider any necessary updates to our policies and practices in line with the law and national guidance.” Meanwhile, legal experts say the ruling showed equality legislation might need to be urgently updated to ensure trans people are protected.",

    "title": "Trump says Fed Chair Powell’s exit ‘can’t come soon enough’",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has hinted at firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell amid the president’s frustration that the central bank will not aggressively cut interest rates. On Thursday, Trump said that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough”. Powell’s term does not expire until May 2026. The president does not have the authority to remove Powell from the central bank. Trump’s attacks on Powell come after the Fed chair’s speech at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday. Powell said the Fed would base its decisions solely on what is best for all Americans. “That’s the only thing we’re ever going to do,” Powell said. “We’re never going to be influenced by any political pressure. People can say whatever they want. That’s fine, that’s not a problem. But we will do what we do strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors. “Our independence is a matter of law,” Powell continued. “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms.” The Republican president’s broadside comes a day after Powell signalled that the Fed would keep its key interest rate unchanged, while it seeks “greater clarity” on the effect of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation and tariffs. Powell also reiterated that Trump’s tariffswould likely raise inflation and slow the economy, which could make it harder for the Fed to cut rates anytime soon. The Fed chair suggested that the central bank would focus on fighting inflation in the wake of the tariffs, even if the duties did weaken the economy. Powell’s comments contributed to a drop in stock prices on Wednesday. Pushing back on Powell, Trump in a social media post said, “Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS.” On the contrary, oil prices have risen 2 percent in the last two weeks. Grocery prices have actually increased under Trump, according to the most recent consumer price index report in April, and egg prices hit record highs last month, as per the same report. Last week, the president falsely claimed the US brought in $2bn a day thanks to tariffs – it was$200m a day. Referring to the European Central Bank (ECB), Trump added that Powell “should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” The ECB on Thursday lowered its key interest rate from 2.5 percent to 2.25 percent. Powell was initially nominated by Trump in 2017 and was appointed to another four-year term by former President Joe Biden in 2022. At a November news conference, Powell indicated he would not step down if Trump asked him to resign, pointing out thatremoval or demotionof top Fed officials was “not permitted under the law”. Later on Thursday, the president doubled down on his remarks. Trump said that Powell would vacate his position as Fed chair if he asked him to. Powell has explicitly said that he would serve out the remainder of his term. The president has also reportedly been talking for months with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh about his interest in removing Powell from the top post and replacing him potentially with Warsh, the Wall Street Journal reported, adding that Warsh advised Trump against such a move. Trump’s comments come against the backdrop of a legal case at the Supreme Court that could determine whether presidents can fire the heads of independent agencies such as the Fed. The case stems from Trump’s firings of officials from two independent agencies. The Supreme Court last week let the firings stand while it considers the case. It could issue a broader ruling later this year that would enable the president to fire Fed officials, including the chair. Powell said the Fed is watching the case closely, adding it might not apply to the Fed. Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued that allowing the president to fire the two officials would not erode the Fed’s independence. “It is difficult to overstate the consequences at this stressed moment of a Court ruling that found that President Trump … does have the authority to dismiss the heads of independent agencies and did not establish a clear carve-out for the Fed,” Krishna Guha, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote on Thursday. “If you liked the tariff debacle in markets, you’d love the loss-of-Fed-independence trade.” Powell started Trump’s second term in a relatively secure spotwith a low unemployment rate and inflation progressing closer to the Fed’s 2 percent target, conditions that could have spared the US central banker from the president’s vitriol. But Trump’s aggressive and haphazard tariffs have raised the threat of a recession with both higher inflationary pressures and slower growth, a tough spot for Powell, whose mandate is to stabilise prices and maximise employment. With the economy weakening because of Trump’s choices, the president appears to be looking to pin the blame on Powell. Trump has unleashed a rash of tariffs that have put the US economy and the Fed in an increasingly perilous spot. On April 2, the president rolled out aggressive tariff hikes based on US trade deficits with other nations, causing a financial market backlash that almost immediately led him to announce a 90-day pause in which most countries would be charged a baseline 10 percent tariff while negotiations go forward. But Trumpincreased his tariff hikes on China to a rate of 145 percentin addition to his existing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, autos and steel and aluminium. Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs have raised their odds that a recession could start. Consumers are increasingly pessimistic in surveys about their job prospects and fearful that inflation will shoot up as the cost of the import taxes gets passed along to them. The risk of stagflation – stagnant growth and high inflation – would make it harder for the Fed to respond with the same playbook as recent downturns. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that the increased inflationary pressures from the tariffs would be equal to the loss of $4,900 in an average US household.",

    "title": "Russia’s Putin, Qatar’s emir discuss Syria and Gaza at Moscow talks",
    "article_text": "Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Syria’s new leader is keen to build ties with Moscow. At talks in the Russian capital on Thursday, Al Thani assured the Russian leader that interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa was seeking to build relations with Russia, after the removal of former President Bashar al-Assad, who was a close ally of Moscow. “As for Syria, a few days ago President al-Sharaa was in Qatar, and we spoke with him about the historical and strategic relationship between Syria and Russia,” Al Thani told Putin. The talks come as Putin attempts to retain Russia’s use of two military bases in Syria to maintain its influence in the region after al-Assad fled the country in December asopposition fightersled byAhmed al-Sharaaclosed in on the capital. Putin said Syria’s situation, rocked by sectarian violence in recent weeks, was of serious importance. “We would like to do everything to ensure that Syria, firstly, remains a sovereign, independent and territorially integral state, and we would like to discuss with you the possibility of providing assistance to the Syrian people, including humanitarian assistance,” the Kremlin leader told the emir. The two men also discussed thesituation in Gaza, where Qatar played a key role in brokering a January ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas for a three-phase ceasefire. Israel restarted its offensive in the besieged enclave in March, and talks to try to restore the ceasefire have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough. “We reached an agreement regarding Gaza a few months back, but Israel has not adhered to the agreement,” Al Thani said. “Qatar, in its role as a mediator, will strive to bridge differing perspectives in an effort to reach an agreement to end the suffering of the Palestinian people.” Putin told the emir, “We know that Qatar is making very serious efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Unfortunately, the initiatives put forward, including by you, have not been implemented. Peaceful people continue to die in Palestine, which is an absolute tragedy of today.” Interfax quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying there was no substantive discussion of the war in Ukraine, but Putin expressed thanks for Qatar’s involvement in arranging thereturn of childrenfrom both countries who were separated from their parents during the war.",

    "title": "Could Trump invoke Insurrection Act – and what powers would that give him?",
    "article_text": "Social media posts have warned for more than a month that President Donald Trump would declare martial law on April 20, which typically means suspending civil law while the military takes control of civilian functions such as courts. But many of the posts appeared to conflate martial law with the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was mentioned in a recentexecutive order. “I just learned about this executive order (section 6-b) which says Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 on April 20th which will (amount) to declaring martial law,” a Reddit user posted on March 19. “That’s the end of the USA.” The narrative spread beyond Reddit to Facebook posts and videos shared on TikTok, X and Threads. Trump’sJanuary 20executive order declared a national emergency at the US southern border and required the defence and homeland security secretaries to submit a report on border conditions within 90 days. The report should include “any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807”, the executive order said. April 20 is the 90-day deadline. Invoking the Insurrection Act would allow Trump to direct federal military personnel to enforce federal law at the US southern border. But legal experts told PolitiFact it would not amount to martial law. They said they do not see a clear path for Trump to lawfully implement martial law in the way it’s commonly understood. Trump, on his part, has not publicly discussed martial law. In a statement to PolitiFact, the Defense Department said the agency is working with the Homeland Security Department to develop the requested report on the southern border conditions. PolitiFact contacted the Homeland Security Department and the White House and received no response. Invoking the Insurrection Act temporarily suspends another US law that forbids federal troops from conducting civilian law enforcement. A president can invoke the law after determining that “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” against the federal government make it “impracticable to enforce” US law “by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings”. In those cases, the Insurrection Act would allow the president to direct federal troops “as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion”. The Insurrection Act is broadly written and does not define terms such as “insurrection” or “rebellion”. In 1827, the US Supreme Court ruled that the authority to decide whether a situation represents an acceptable reason to invoke the Insurrection Act “belongs exclusively to the President”. Chris Edelson, an American University assistant professor of government, said the law provides a “limited authority for the president to use the military to respond to genuine emergencies – a breakdown in regular operational law when things are really falling apart”. The act was invoked when southern governors refused to integrate schools and during the1992 Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the roadside beating of a Black man,Rodney King. Experts expressed doubt that the situation at the US southern border constitutes a breakdown or obstruction of federal law that would necessitate the use of the Insurrection Act the way the law was intended. Tung Yin, a Lewis and Clark Law School professor, said it’s hard to see how immigrants coming into the country illegally were obstructing state or federal laws. Obstruction is “more like an invading army or maybe such severe riots that the government has lost control”, he said. Martial law, on the other hand, typically refers to imposing military law on civilians. Edelson said the Insurrection Act “does not allow the president to completely replace regular authorities with military authority”. Chris Mirasola, University of Houston Law Center assistant professor, said military law is more stringent and has fewer protections for people than civilian law. US constitutional protections would not disappear if the Insurrection Act were invoked, Mirasola said. Yin said that when a president uses the Insurrection Act to call on the military to enforce civilian law, “that might seem like ‘martial law’ to a layperson. But it’s not a military government, which might be what people generally think of.” In a 1946 ruling, the US Supreme Court wrote that the term martial law “carries no precise meaning” and said it wasn’t defined in the Constitution or an act of Congress. Edelson said because of this, “At the federal level, it’s not clear that presidents can declare martial law at all.” Mirasola said some other countries’ constitutions include provisions that outline when a president can declare martial law, but the US Constitution lacks such detail. Still, martial law has been declared before. The US imposed martial law in Hawaii for three years after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. President Abraham Lincoln also declared martial law in certain parts of the US during the Civil War. President Andrew Johnson restored civilian law. At that time, the Supreme Court “more or less found that martial law could only be declared in an active war zone”, Mirasola said, citing an 1866 Supreme Court ruling that held that martial law cannot be imposed unless civilian courts aren’t open and functioning. For that reason, Mirasola said he could see no legal or constitutional basis for Trump to declare martial law to control the southern border, which “is not an area of active hostilities, notwithstanding how the administration continues to talk about the actions of cartels”. “The circumstances within which presidents have invoked martial law and that the Supreme Court has understood martial law are incredibly narrow,” he said. “It would require an active hostility on US territory that prevents civilian legal proceedings from occurring.” Experts said Trump’s suggestions about using military powers could be one reason for the martial law speculation: In October, Trump said “radical left lunatics” in the US “should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military”. In June 2020, during nationwide protests following the death ofGeorge Floyd, Trump said if governors didn’t deploy the National Guard to sufficiently “dominate the streets”, he would order the US military to “quickly solve the problem for them”. Then there is his willingness to challenge constitutional precedent. He is trying to end birthright citizenship by executive order; the move wasblockedby multiple federal judges, including one who described the order as “blatantly unconstitutional”. In mid-March, Trump said the US is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and invoked theAlien Enemies Actof 1798, an obscure law that was used to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy nations without due process during wartime. The Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s order that temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the law. It did not rule whether Trump’s use of the law was constitutional. Edelson mentioned the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and the fact that Trumppardonedabout 1,500 people charged with crimes that day. *Caryn Baird contributed to this report.*",

    "title": "Russia’s Supreme Court suspends ban on Afghanistan’s Taliban",
    "article_text": "Russia’s Supreme Court has suspended its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than 20 years as “a terrorist organisation”. The latest move is aimed at normalising ties with the de facto rulers of Afghanistan. Thursday’s ruling – prompted by a request from the prosecutor general – is effective immediately, Judge Oleg Nefedov announced, according to Russia’s Tass news agency. The move in favour of the group thatseized powerin Afghanistan in 2021 follows years of gradual rapprochement with Moscow, despite a turbulent history dating back to the Afghan Civil War of the 1990s. More recently, shared security interests – including the fight againstISIL (ISIS)’s regional affiliate, ISKP– have drawn Russia and the Taliban closer. Last year, President Vladimir Putin described the Taliban as an “ally” in counterterrorism efforts, while his envoy to Kabul announced plans to delist the group. Moscow, which has hosted Taliban officials for several forums in recent years, is also looking to use Afghanistan as a transit hub for gas exports to Southeast Asia. “Moscow will continue its course on developing political, trade and economic ties with Kabul,” Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in October last year. Other Asian countries have also improved ties with the Taliban in recent years, though no state has moved to fully recognise it. In 2023, Kazakhstan took the group, which hasbanned girls’ educationand restricted women’s movement, off its list of “terrorist organisations”. Kyrgyzstan followed suit last year. China, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Iran are among nations withembassies in Kabul, with Beijing becoming the first in 2023 to appoint an ambassador after the Taliban’s takeover.",

    "title": "Two years into Sudan’s war, where is its civil society?",
    "article_text": "When Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took over most of the country’s capital Khartoum in the early days of the war, the youth-led civil society initiative Hadhreen kept its food kitchens – a vital lifeline for those in need – open. It was risky. Countless examples of RSF violence against civilians and looting have been recorded since Sudan’s war started in April 2023. Hadhreen didn’t escape that violence. A spokesperson described to Al Jazeera an episode in August 2024 when the RSF looted supplies from a kitchen and arrested the supervisor. The supervisor’s fate was unknown until after the RSF wasdriven out of Khartoumby the Sudanese army on March 27. “We discovered that the detained supervisor – whose only ‘offence’ was providing meals to helpless citizens through the kitchen – was martyred in the detention centres of the Rapid Support Forces,” Hadhreen told Al Jazeera. The army’s recapture of Khartoum last month appeared for some to be a turning point in the devastating two-year war that has torn Sudan apart since it erupted on April 15, 2023. But it is not just the RSF that has attacked civil society activists on the ground. Earlier this year, a number of workers in Emergency Response Rooms (ERR), grassroots networks that have led the humanitarian response since the war erupted, told Al Jazeera some of theircolleagues had been killed by the armyor army-aligned groups in Khartoum North. At the time, Al Jazeera sought comment from army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah but received no response. So, civil society actors inside and outside Sudan are watching sceptically, unsure of their role in a post-war Sudan, or if they will be sidelined as they have been for two years. With social and political polarisation making neutrality impossible and conditions on the ground worsening for activists, many of them told Al Jazeera civil society is being strangled in Sudan. The recent history of Sudanese youth-led resistance committees started in 2010 when they actively worked on political awareness, voter registration and nation-building. They took centre stage during the 2018/2019 revolution that overthrew Omar al-Bashir and truly came to the fore in October 2021 when two generals, the army’s Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF’s Mohamed Hamdan ‘Hemedti’ Dagalo, orchestrated a coup against the civilian transitional government. The resistance committees organised protests, highlighted abuses by the state security apparatus and coordinated resistance and advocacy efforts with both local governments and international actors. When war erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF in Khartoum on April 15, 2023, these committees became the ERRs, taking on the core response to civilians’ needs, filling the vacuum left by the state. It was “a deliberate decision to focus on addressing the basic survival and humanitarian needs of people” that led to forming these ERRs, Nada Wanni, an independent Sudanese researcher and consultant, told Al Jazeera. As of October 2024, a United Nations Dispatch communication said there were at least 700 ERRs in Sudan, providing food, health services, childcare, or whatever their communities needed. But while the number of ERRs was rising, “the operational space for civil society has significantly shrunk,” the Hadhreen spokesperson told Al Jazeera, adding that: “The SAF and the RSF have imposed significant obstacles on our operations.” On the ground, the danger to activists trying to support people is real and immediate. “Since they assumed their new role, these actors and groups consciously chose not to engage in certain political discourse or certain political actions,” Wanni says. “Should they do that, they’ll immediately be labelled as affiliated to one side of the war or the other. They’ll likely be targeted, harassed or arrested and unable to do their humanitarian work.” Activists have to “negotiate” with one or both sides so they can carry out their humanitarian work – “negotiation” that is usually deemed as collaboration by one side or the other. The Hadhreen spokesperson says the organisation’s volunteers have been “interrogated, detained, and faced severe threats … kidnappings, looting and killings”. In October 2023, a civilian political bloc came into being – Taqaddum, headed by former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and comprising political parties and civic society, as well as armed factions. At first, it was seen as “neutral” and the best alternative to the two warring armies, but that unravelled as Taqaddum found itself accused of being pro-RSF and that the political parties within it were not inclusive of all of civil society. Then, in February of this year, a political tremor shook Sudan as the RSFsaid that it was going to form a parallel government, claiming there would be civilian-led governance in areas it controls in Sudan. It took part of Taqaddum with it, the breakaway group naming itself Taasis (Foundation). Its members having taken positions in the parallel government, which wasofficially declared on Tuesday. The rest of Taqaddum has formed Somoud (Resilience), its members rejecting the establishment of a parallel government. Analysts have told Al Jazeera that this split could work to the benefit of Sumoud since it could distance itself from the RSF and better connect with Sudanese civilians. As the political class outside Sudan seems to have taken sides, civil society activists on the ground who wish to remain neutral face a heavy personal cost. While civilian and political activist Mohamed Elhadi believes that a fundamental step towards a better future is a genuine civilian response that rejects both warring factions, he worries that that is not possible in the current atmosphere. “Both sides have weaponised war rhetoric… The government labelled antiwar voices as [RSF] supporters, while RSF supporters argue that advocating for peace aligns with maintaining Sudan’s inherited colonial-era state and its historical privileges. “The … polarisation … [has] made it easy to discredit any independent civil efforts advocating for peace, with calls to end the conflict often dismissed as being aligned with foreign interests,” Elhadi adds. “In Sudan, you cannot say anything, neither about the government nor about the [RSF]; you can never speak your mind,” says 28-year-old Abdurahman, who volunteers to teach English to displaced Sudanese people in Cairo. “If you talk about what you are seeing over there, you will be arrested, or maybe they kill you and nobody will know about it,” Abdurahman sighs as he remembers neighbours, friends, and even his brother-in-law, taken by the RSF. This war, says Elhadi, is seen by civil society actors “as a deliberate attempt by anti-civilian forces to obstruct Sudan’s democratic transition”, one that, even as the capital is liberated, looks further and further away. Despite their vital role in organising on the ground, Sudanese civil society groups have found themselves sidelined in negotiations on Sudan’s future, hemmed into a more “humanitarian” role rather than being at the table when peace and post-war political processes are discussed. Besides, whenever conversations do take place, logistical hindrances and military restrictions to free movement result in those present predominantly being people who fled the country and who may not be able to accurately communicate the pressing needs of those still in Sudan, which are constantly evolving. However, analysts argue that any negotiations on Sudan must include civil society because it has the capacity for grassroots organising that a political class, which has been largely outside Sudan for two years, will not have. But civil society is not a homogeneous entity that can step up to a negotiating table, and as such it too bears some responsibility for making sure it is heard, development and civil society consultant Abdel-Rahman El Mahdi argues. He believes that civil society lost public trust over the past 20 years as fragmentation and a lack of resources lessened the “potential for civil society to play a meaningful role in … future transitional processes”. Part of the problem may lie, however, with international actors who have been approaching the Sudan file in search of “quick results” and easy interlocutors, El Mahdi continues. As such, he argues, “international actors need to shift their focus from short-term interventions to a long-term strategy for supporting civil society in Sudan.” But “the only way civil society forces can have a say in any future negotiations,” Wanni argues, “is if they make sure it happens. No one is going to invite them.”",

    "article_text": "A court order is supposed to block firings except after a “particularized assessment.“ A court order is supposed to block firings except after a “particularized assessment.“ byLauren Feiner The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is sending out mass layoff notices that appear to be in defiance of a court order blocking further layoffs following DOGE-induced cuts. “I regret to inform you that you are affected by a reduction in force (RIF) action,” says a notice reviewed byThe Vergethat was sent by CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought to an agency employee. “This RIF action is necessary to restructure the Bureau’s operation to better reflect the agency’s priorities and mission.” Access to CFPB systems will be cut off after Friday, and employees will be placed on administrative leave until their official end date, the notice says. Fox Businessreports thataround 1,500 workers will receive RIF notices across core functions, based on an unnamed source. On Thursday night, CFPB Chief Legal Officer Mark Paoletta sent a notice of the agency’s supervision and enforcement priorities that said the CFPB would “shift resources away from enforcement and supervision that can be done by the States” and rescinded previous enforcement and supervision priority documents,The Wall Street Journalreported. In March,a federal judge orderedthe Trump administrationnot to“terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause related to the individual employee’s performance or conduct; and defendants shall not issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee.” An appealscourt orderthis month partially stayed that portion of the injunction, but only to the extent it would keep the CFPB from issuing a RIF that the agency determined “after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants’ statutory duties.” The union that brought the original complaint to stop the agency from being guttedfiled a motionlate Thursday asking the court to require the government to explain how the mass terminations don’t violate its preliminary injunction. “The plaintiffs have been told that entire offices, including statutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person,” the filing says. “It is unfathomable that cutting the Bureau’s staff by 90 percent in just 24 hours, with no notice to people to prepare for that elimination, would not ‘interfere with the performance’ of its statutory duties, to say nothing of the implausibility of the defendants having made a ‘particularized assessment’ of each employee’s role in the three-and-a-half business days since the court of appeals imposed that requirement.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee who helped establish the agency, called the agency’s “dismantling” of the agency “yet another assault on consumers and our democracy by this lawless Administration, and we will fight back with everything we’ve got.” Updated March 17th:Added filing from CFPB worker union and statement from Sen.

    "article_text": "You’d be surprised how cheap you can get a robot with added tricks like mopping. You’d be surprised how cheap you can get a robot with added tricks like mopping. bySheena VasaniandQuentyn Kennemer If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. We’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s aself-driving caror a robot that can clean on your behalf. Most of us probably won’t be able to afford thehelpful sentient humanoidsbeing developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now. Today’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that canpick up dirty laundryandpurify the airin your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger. But if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate ofVerge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more. Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra— our pick for the best robot vacuum overall —is available fromBest Buy,Roborock, andAmazon(for Prime members)for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date.The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too. The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. That said, it’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home. With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop. It features Roborock’s best obstacle detection, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice. TheRoborock S8 Pro Ultra, which is almost identical to the aforementioned S8 MaxV, is currently matching its all-time low of $899.99 ($700 off) atRoborock’s online storefront. The main difference is that the Ultra lacks an RGB camera, meaning it isn’t as good at avoiding obstacles, but that might be a positive if you prioritize privacy. It’s also limited to 8,000Pa of suction power and lacks a built-in voice assistant, as well as support for Matter. The Roborock S8 Pro Ultra is similar to our favorite robot vacuum on the market, the S8 MaxV. It cleans carpets and mops well, but lacks a camera, a built-in voice assistant, and Matter support. TheRoborock S8 Plusis another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available for $549.99 ($450 off) — its second-best price to date — fromRoborockandAmazon, if you’re a Prime member. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space. Roborock’s hybrid S8 robot vacuum and mop features 6,000Pa of suction and sonic mopping, which means its flat mop pad vibrates to scrub floors. It has dual rubber roller brushes that do a great job on carpet, and it can lift its mop to avoid carpet. It also has an auto-empty dock option. The big-wheeledRoborock Q5 Prois down to$179.99 ($250 off) atAmazonthanks to an on-page coupon, which is $40 more than its lowest price to date.Not only is it one of the most affordable robovacs you can buy, but thanks to its dual rubber roller brushes and 5,500Pa of suction power, the entry-level Roborock model remains one of the best we’ve found at dealing with unwanted pet hair. The lidar-mapping Q5 Pro features voice controls, digital keep-out zones, and mopping pads with an onboard reservoir, but no self-cleaning functions. This particular SKU doesn’t include a self-emptying base, but the 770ml dust bin is one of the largest you’ll find, so you can go a few weeks without touching it.That said, Roborock sells a version with a self-emptying dock, which is available right now for $479.99 ($220 off) directly fromRoborockandWalmart. It’s not fancy, but the Q5 Pro has a huge bin and big wheels to get up on higher-pile carpets easily. It has a small removable mopping reservoir for when there are dirty paws on the floors, but its main job is to suck up dirt and pet hair, and it does very well at both. TheDreame X40 Ultrais another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for$949.99 ($550 off) — $50 shy of its all-time low — fromDreameandAmazon(if you’re a Prime member).You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank. The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly. With a unique ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach. TheDream L20 Ultrais available foran all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) atAmazonand directly fromDreamewhen you use promo code EOL20U.The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection. The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. The L20 Ultra is a great all-around bot that can remove its mop pads to vacuum carpet and do the splits with its mops to better clean your baseboards. It has 7,000Pa suction, a bigger base station, and fewer advanced cleaning features than the newer X30 and X40 Ultra models, but it’s still an excellent robot vacuum. TheSwitchBot S10is on salefor $413.99 ($786 off), which is $23 shy of its all-time low price, when you check out atAmazon.The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention. The S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the fewrobovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums). The S10 is a great mopping robot with a battery-powered water refill dock that makes it the most hands-free robovac we’ve tested. A separate auto-empty dock takes care of the dust. It’s big and loud and lacks some features found on high-end robots, but it does a great job of keeping your floors clean. TheSwitchBot K10 Plusis also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly fromSwitchBotwith promo code LMTM120. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying. The smallest robot vac on the block, the K10 Plus, doesn’t compare to the other bots here in terms of performance, but if you have a small space where other vacs can’t get to, it’s better than nothing. It’s also very quiet, making it ideal for small spaces like home offices and bedrooms or a very small studio apartment. The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities. TheEufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available atAmazonfor Prime members for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of the all-time low we last saw during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. You can also grab itdirectly from Eufyfor the same price when you use promo codeWS24T2351121at checkout. The X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping. Mind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill docktoofrequently. The Eufy 11S Max is a super slim, repairable bump-and-roll bot with a large 600ml bin and three cleaning levels. Its biggest selling point, however, is that it lacks Wi-Fi, meaning you don’t have to fiddle with an app. If you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale atEufy’s online storefrontthrough April 20th for just $159.99 ($90 off) thanks to coupon code WS24T2126111. The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s a quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic. TheYeedi Cubeis currently down to an all-time low of $259.99 ($230 off) atAmazonfor Prime members. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more. With 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300. One of the first robots that can vacuum, mop, self-empty, self-wash, and self-dry with hot air for under $1,000, the Yeedi Cube is an older model that currently retails for under $500. It’s a good vacuum and mop for hands-free cleaning on a budget. The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop mops very well — doing a swingy, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” However, you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops, as it only self-empties in vacuum mode and can only avoid larger objects. TheShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for an all-time low of $399.99 ($300 off) atAmazon,Best Buy, anddirectly from Shark. Before theEufy X10 Pro Omnitook its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually. A truly basic budget bot, the Shark has good suction power, a big bin, and a roller brush made of bristle and plastic that doesn’t get tangled up easily. There’s no mapping, keep out zones, or obstacle detection, but the bot does offer big wheels that easily roll over obstacles and high transitions between rooms. It’s easy to buy replacement parts, too, making this one that can go for years. TheShark Ionis an a solid bump-and-roll bot that’s currently on sale for $149.99 ($80 off) atAmazon, which is one of its better prices to date. It does a good job of picking up dirt and debris, and with a 120-minute runtime, it won’t run out of juice as quickly as other models in its price range. Its hybrid roller brush, which combines bristle and plastic, also helps reduce unwanted tangling, which happens more frequently with standard bristle brushes. While the Ion doesn’t come with advanced features like mapping, it’s another good option if you’re looking for a no-frills robovac that’ll get the job done on a shoestring budget. A budget robot vacuum and mop with high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, and smart navigation, it also features an auto-empty dock for just $80 more. The Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot with room mapping features but no virtual keep-out zones. A superior mopping bot with a superior price tag, the Narwal is smart enough to know when it needs to go back and mop more. Its vacuuming is good, and its unique onboard compression bin means no loud auto-emptying. Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

    "article_text": "﻿The update also includes more EV trip routing controls. ﻿The update also includes more EV trip routing controls. byUmar Shakir Tesla’s vehicles may bein a sales slump, but that’s not stopping the company from regularly introducing fresh features for owners. Tesla’s spring software update includes several useful new functions in its EVs, including adaptive high beams on compatible cars and better trip planning. Theupdatewill allow some Tesla owners to use high beams without blinding other drivers and cyclists on the road by enabling the beamforming capabilities of equipped matrix headlights. The company first started installing the hardware across its vehicles in 2022, but are just now enabling it. Tesla had also enabled the features in Europe last year, and the newly refreshed Model Y will ship with the new smart headlights. Many automakers like Audi have already been using adaptive headlights for about a decade in Europe, but the technology only became legal in the USin 2022. Other US automakers, including Ford and its F-150 Lightning, have the necessary hardware but aren’t yet enabling all the features of adaptive lightsby default. Another very useful feature in the spring release includes “Alternative Trip Plans,” which lets Tesla owners select different EV navigation routes based on whether they want to get there faster, have the fewest stops, or want to visit highly rated restaurants, shops, and restrooms. It adds to an already comprehensive EV navigation experience that other automakers have yet to catch up to, although Tesla still does not include third party chargers in automatic routing. Additionally, you can now set navigation to avoid highways. Tesla is also giving its Sentry secure video and Dashcam features the ability to record clips from the B-Pillar side cameras, increasing their capture abilities from six of the vehicle’s cameras instead of four. An updated Dashcam viewer on the infotainment screen includes a new grid view to make it easier to review recordings. These new dashcam features, however, only work on Tesla models with AMD-powered infotainment screens, so anyone with Intel-powered ones won’t get the new functionality. Other notable features in the update include sideview camera feeds on the instrument cluster for Model S and X, location based trunk height memory so your tailgate doesn’t hit your low-ceiling garage, always-on USB-C and wireless charging, and, for those who refuse to pay Tesla for premium connectivity, the ability to automatically connect to your hotspot when you start to drive.

    "title": "The best Android phones",
    "article_text": "Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half!Imagine. On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.) As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has becomeso routine that it’s mostly painless. A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates. The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life. Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well. Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices. If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone. 8 Verge Score Updated design feels more secure in handFast fingerprint sensorSeven years of software and OS updates No telephoto cameraAI features are inconsistentWhat is a photo?

But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get. The Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The camera is as reliable as ever, and if you’re into AI photo editing tricks,boy does this phone have ‘em. There’s a new Screenshots app that acts as a place to store all of the information that would otherwise be lost at sea in your camera roll, and it uses AI to parse information out and make it searchable. Kinda handy. Even without AI, this is an excellent phone. It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it. Its potential for long-term value and the quality of the hardware make it an easy recommendation for anyone who just wants a nice Android phone that works. 8 Verge Score Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier ExpensiveBulkyAI is (still) hit or miss Screen:6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:5,000mAh /Charging:45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) /Weather resistance:IP68 There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy. The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents. All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was. 8 Verge Score The last reasonably sized Android phoneSeven years of OS upgradesVery good camera Samsung software is as cluttered as usualAI is still a mixed bag Screen:6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteCameras:50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfieBattery:4000mAh /Charging:25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)/Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25. That’s theregularS25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS. The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bitmuch, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with. 8 Verge Score Excellent battery lifeSix years of security updatesStrong IP rating for dust and water resistance Big phone is bigNot as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer Screen:6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED /Processor:Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie /Battery:6,000mAh /Charging:80W wired, 50W wireless /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 and IP69 There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience. The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility. 8 Verge Score Excellent outer screen formatInner screen is lovely to useSeven years of OS updates ExpensiveMain camera isn’t as good as slab phonesLong-term durability?

Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen. The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach. That said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding. There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation. Update, April 17th:Removed the Google Pixel 8A in the also-consider section and replaced it with the Pixel 9A. Updated other recommendations with current pricing and availability.

    "article_text": "The streaming service won’t report subscriber numbers starting this quarter — but its revenue signals more growth. The streaming service won’t report subscriber numbers starting this quarter — but its revenue signals more growth. byEmma Roth Netflix said in itsfirst quarter earnings reporton Thursday that revenue reached $10.5 billion in the months since it raised prices. That’s a 13 percent increase over the same time last year. The streaming service’s net income also grew to $2.9 billion, and the company says it expects more growth in the coming months when it sees “the full quarter benefit from recent price changes and continued growth in membership and advertising revenue.” Netflixraised the prices across most of its plansin January, with its premium plan hitting $24.99 per month. It also increased the price of its Extra Member option —its solution to password sharing— to $8.99 per month. Though Netflix already rolled out the increase in the US, UK, and Argentina, the streamer now plans to do the same in France. This is the first quarter that Netflix didn’t reveal how many subscribers it gained or lost. It decided toonly report “major subscriber milestones”last year, as other streams of revenue continue to grow, like advertising, continue to grow. Netflix last reportedhaving 300 million global subscribersin January. During an earnings call on Thursday, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company expects to “roughly double” advertising revenue in 2025. The company launched its own advertising technology platform earlier this month. There are some changes coming to Netflix, too, as Peters confirmed that itshomepage redesign for its TV appwill roll out “later this year.” He also hinted at adding an “interactive” search feature using “generative technologies,” which sounds a lot likethe AI featureBloombergreported onlast week. Netflix hascemented itself as the top streaming optionwith its library of hit original content and has become a necessity for fansof WWE’sMonday Night Raw.

Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Razer isselling laptops on its siteagain after arecent and sudden halt. In what seemed like a response toongoing tariff tumult, the US Razer site had quietly pulled its Blade laptops from direct sales, including its newBlade 16with Nvidia’s 50-series GPUs. Things seemed normal inother regions like Canada. But even after a week of paused sales andReddit postsdiscussing Blade 16 preorders getting held up in US Customs, however, Razer never responded toThe Verge’sinquiries about what’s going on.

Before the sales pause, there were still 2024 Blade 16 models available, as well as preorders for the Blade 18. Now, those are nowhere to be seen for US customers.

And even more curious: the 5090 config is limited to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of storage for $4,899.99, but the review spec that Razersent us for testingwith 32GB / 1TB for $4,499.99 isn’t available. What’s also still unavailable is any pricing on the newRazer Adjustable Laptop Stand. But on the Canadian Razer site, you can find that standwith a $99.99 price, as well as thereview spec of the 5090 Blade 16andpreorders for the Blade 18. We’ve reached out to Razer to try and get clarification about what’s going on.

    "article_text": "Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are already falling in price, as is the new M4 Mac Mini. bySheena Vasani,Quentyn Kennemer, andAntonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points.It discontinued the M1 MacBook Airto make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of thelatest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models. Although Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases.Apple’s refurbished storeprovides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. TheM1 MacBook Airwas considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while theredesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air(which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in ourguide to the best laptops. The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart hascommitted to keeping it aroundfor the foreseeable future and is currentlydiscounting it to $649($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold). The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads. It does have some slight downsides, though, includingslower storage in the base 256GB configurationand a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of thebest laptops. TheM2-powered MacBook Airfrom 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors atBest Buystarting at $749 ($200 off), which matches its all-time low price. If you don’t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD atBest Buyfor $799 ($300 off). It’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model. The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging. The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for theM3 MacBook Airto exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM andnow considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration. Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD on sale atB&H Photoin select colors starting at $999 ($100 off). You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors atAmazon. Given the $100 price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage. As for the 15-inch MacBook Air M3, there are currently no deals. The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will. Along with anupdated Mac Studio, Apple recently announced a newMacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving their first discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $949 ($50 off) atAmazonand $999 atB&H Photo. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 10-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,165 ($35 off) atAmazon. Powered by the new M4 chip, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam. Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter. During its“Scary Fast” eventin 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up withM4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts. The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The14-inch M3 MacBook Prohas the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds). The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup. We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock, but if you don’t need the extra overhead for multitasking,Best Buyis selling it with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199 ($200 off). The model with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is also on sale for $1,199 ($200 off) atBest Buy, while the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is going for $1,499 ($200 off) atBest Buy. Apple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited bythe review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199. But rest assured, versions that normal people are more likely to buy receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,699 ($300 off) atB&H Photo, which is a nice deal but nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen previously. As for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting atBest Buyfor $1,999 ($400 off), which is its best price to date.Best Buyis also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,399 ($400 off). The 14-inch MacBook Pro from 2023 comes in a space black color and is configurable with either an M3 Pro or M3 Max chip. It looks a lot like the previous M2 generation, but spec-wise, the M3 Pro models start with a 12-core CPU, 18GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. The 16-inch MacBook Pro remains Apple’s largest laptop for creators and power users. The 2023 model includes a spec bump to the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, with a claimed battery life of up to 22 hours, and is configurable with up to 128GB of RAM. Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base14-inch M4 MacBook Prois the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option. Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at $1,449 ($151 off) atAmazon. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,829 ($171 off) atAmazon. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,289 ($211 off) atAmazon. The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam. The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera. There’s a new Mac Mini in town, asM4-based models arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value. Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. TheM4 Mac Ministarts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival theMac StudioandMac Prowhen it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep. In addition to the odd decision to place thepower button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100. Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini atAmazonwith an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $557 ($43 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $743 ($56 off) atAmazon. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale atAmazonstarting at $1,299 ($100 off). The latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model. Each configuration now starts with 16GB of RAM and includes five total Thunderbolt ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm jack.

    "article_text": "The ruling says the Social Media Parental Notification Act is unconstitutional. The ruling says the Social Media Parental Notification Act is unconstitutional. byEmma Roth A federal judgehas struck down an Ohio lawthat would’ve required children under 16 to get parental consent to use social media platforms. Ina decision on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Algenon Marbley ruled that the law is unconstitutional, saying it violates the First Amendment. Signed in 2023, Ohio’s Social Media Parental Notification Act was set to come into force on January 15th, 2024. However, the Big Tech-backed interest group NetChoice challenged the law and won atemporary restraining orderblocking it. This new decision permanently prevents the law from taking effect. “This case resides at the intersection of two unquestionable rights: the rights of children to ‘a significant measure of’ freedom of speech and expression under the First Amendment, and the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children free from unnecessary governmental intrusion,” Judge Marbley writes. Last month, NetChoice succeeded in permanently blockingArkansas’s age verification lawand won a preliminary injunction toprevent California’s landmark online child safetylaw from going into effect. NetChoicealso recently suedto block Maryland’s Kids Code law over concerns it violates free speech. “The decision confirms that the First Amendment protects both websites’ right to disseminate content and Americans’ right to engage with protected speech online, and policymakers must respect constitutional rights when legislating,” NetChoice director of litigation Chris Marchese said in the group’s announcement.

    "title": "Just look at Huawei’s trifold phone",
    "article_text": "24 hours with the world’s first trifold phone. byDominic Preston After 24 hours with Huawei’s Mate XT — a.k.a. the world’s first trifold smartphone — I have this to say for it: the novelty hasn’t worn off. I’ve tried the Mate XT twice before, first shortly after it launchedlast September, and then again in February after it wasreleased outside of China. But now Huawei is ready to actually let me review its one-of-a-kind hardware, which at today’s exchange rates would set you back just under $4,000. I’ll be spending the next week with my SIM card in the Mate XT, as I get used to life with triple the usual space and none of the usual Google Mobile Services support, but one day in, I figured I’d share my first — or is it third? — impressions and a bunch of pictures. There are really three ways to use the XT: as a regular-ish phone with a 6.4-inch display, in a square shape that resemblesother foldablesand measures 7.9 inches, or fully opened into what’s essentially a 10.2-inch tablet. It feels a little unnatural to open at first. Since each segment folds in a different direction, it took me a few hours to get used to where I push and where I pull, and I spent most of that adjustment period worrying I was about to snap something. Once you have it figured out though, the process is pretty satisfying, even if opening the phone is absolutely a two-handed job. The three segments attach magnetically when closed, and they at leastfeelsturdy, even if I wouldn’t trust this thing to survive being sat on. You’ll also have to live with part of the display being permanently exposed on the phone’s right edge, and the front screen doubling as the phone’s back when it’s halfway open. Scratches — and fingerprint smudges — are an inevitability. Unsurprisingly, it’s thicker than your average phone, and heavier, but it’s more comfortable than you’d think. It’s also thinner and lighter than your average 10-inch tablet, so it’s all a matter of perspective. It’s hard to tell from looking, but Huawei has tapered the body: at its thinnest it’s actually slimmer than evenOppo’s Find N5, but the third of the phone with a USB-C port is a hair thicker. Let’s get the software question out of the way: no, this doesn’t have any official support for Google Mobile Services, which means no Play Store and no Google apps — at least not out of the box. Sideloading all things Google is easier than ever, which is to say it takes an hour and is a bit of a headache, but if you can get through that then you’ve essentially got a regular Android experience. With the help of open source tools like Aurora Store and microG, I got every Android and Google app I tried up and running, with the sole (and understandable) exception of Google Wallet. I’ll miss NFC payments, but everything else works. Will they work forever? I don’t know. Will they update properly? I also have no idea. Does sideloading every single app introduce a whole new set of exciting security vulnerabilities into my life? Almost certainly! I also don’t know how long even Huawei will let this sort of setup work. My Mate XT is running on HarmonyOS 4.2, which still has a little Android at its heart. But the company is slowly moving towardsHarmonyOS Next, which isn’t compatible with Android apps at all, so the Mate XT’s next iteration — or simply its next software update — might kill off Android support for good. Just like on an Android tablet, some apps make better use of the full display than others. It’s just about the perfect size for streaming, but Instagram has no idea what to do with all the extra space. Multitasking is a bit basic, too. Three screens should mean three apps, right? Wrong. The split-screen mode only supports two at a time, and if you want a third, it’ll have to be an awkward “Floating Window” getting in the way of something else. 24 hours in, I can confirm that the Mate XT feels like an engineering marvel. Whether it’s a phone anyone should drop four grand on is what I’ll spend the next week figuring out.

    "title": "CDC scraps plan to help Texas schools curb measles over layoffs, employee says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:58 PM EDT/ CBS News The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year'srecord outbreakof the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said. CDC officialshad initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas — onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus – to other kinds of facilities like schools as well. \"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News. Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH,which was largely eliminatedby Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'sfirst wave of layoffsearlier this month. Two experts from NIOSH — Neu and an industrial hygienist — were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said. The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work. In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on. \"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said. While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks. \"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said. Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts. \"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said. Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems. A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination. He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare forEbola casesduring the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said. The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, likecancer clustersorfungal outbreaks. Impact on theCDC's measles responsealso goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go. An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.

    "title": "Spaulding Rehab nurse running marathon to support brain injury patients",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:54 PM EDT/ CBS Boston A nurse inspired to work at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital after they treated her father's brain injuries will be running for the hospital this Monday in the Boston Marathon. When Walter Rehak arrived at Spaulding in the back of an ambulance, he had recovered from the worst of his physical injuries. Rehak had survived a rollover crash in Peabody in January 2020. A medical helicopter lifted him from the highway to the hospital where he spent 10 days in a coma. Rehak broke his neck and his nose. He had a nasty gash on his forehead. He also had a Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of the impact. His daughter Sarah Rehak remembers one of the first hopeful signs as he emerged from the coma. \"His eyes were still shut and he said, 'Hi, my girl.' And I was like…I lost it. Because I was like, OK, you know that that's what you still call me, you can speak, you remember,\" said Sarah. In that moment, Sarah knew that her dad remembered their nicknames. He knew who she was. Once he was transferred to Spaulding (part of Mass General Brigham), there were many more hopeful signs. Sarah, who was working as a health care administrator at Boston Children's Hospital at the time, watched his interaction with his doctors, nurses, and therapists. The care he received and the progress he made was striking. \"Spaulding did give me hope that he would be OK,\" said Sarah. \"Everyone was so friendly with him, he had his therapist that he loved and all his friends that are the employees. And just the change that they made day-to-day, I was like, I want to do this.\" It also lit a passion for patient care that inspired a career change. Because of her father's experience and recovery, Sarah left her job as a health care administrator at Boston Children's Hospital, went back to school full-time, and graduated with a nursing degree from the MGH Institute of Health Professions in 2023. She applied for a position at Spaulding even before graduation. The team with an open position was, incredibly, on the hospital's brain injury floor. Sarah began caring for patients where her father relearned the life skills to go home. Rehak remembers how therapists prepared him for life after rehab. \"They said I needed speech therapy. I realize now it was brain therapy. They made me put together a schedule for a delivery from Jordan's Furniture. They made me figure out how to take the T from here to there. So, as much as that was myspeechtherapy, it was really making me think. If you're a Traumatic Brain Injury patient, you've gotta learn how to think,\" said Rehak. These days, he thinks about how fortunate he is to have recovered so well. Now two years on the job, Sarah knows she is where she is meant to be. \"I just feel so at home,\" she said, smiling. \"All the nurses. All the therapists. We work so well together. We are all so connected…I really enjoy coming to work every day. I love my patients, I just want to be the person that can give them a little light, a little optimism.\" Sharing her family's story often puts patients at ease in a frightening time. \"I think it helps them because I've truly been through it. I know how scared they are,\" said Sarah. Nursing Director Mariana Parga, RN points to Sarah's sunny demeanor as another superpower. \"She's always happy. And she has this great story to tell of her dad's success which helps them feel that they can also succeed here. So I think that's truly special,\" said Parga. Pointing out her dad's old room, 720, Sarah laughs that she and her family used to consider the room the \"penthouse\" because of its corner position and its view of the Tobin Bridge. Her dad used to watch the traffic on the bridge so that his visitors knew when to make the drive to Spaulding. \"Depending on the situation, I'll share my story with the patient who's in that room,\" said Sarah. One of Sarah's patients is 20-year-old Theo Visco, who came to Spaulding after a skiing accident and has since been released. \"When I first got here, I couldn't even move my right side at all,\" said Visco. \"And now I'm basically walking.\" He said the consistent support is key. \"It just means a lot to actually have that one-on-one connection with someone.\" On Marathon Monday, Sarah will cross a bridge of her own, from \"casual runner\" to marathoner. When Spaulding put out the call for Boston Marathon bib number applications, Sarah applied. When she got word that she had been accepted, she was overwhelmed with emotion. \"I started crying happy tears and ran into my boss' office. We were just jumping up and down!\"  Her next thought? \"I've gotta start training!\" As one of 70 runners on Spaulding'sRace for Rehabteam, she is also fundraising for the hospital. To date, the team has raised $700,000 on its way to a $950,000 goal. Sarah's dad will be at Mile 16 on the Wellesley-Newton border to cheer her on. His journey to wellness now complete, Sarah said she will dedicate her marathon to the patients at Spaulding who are working to regain their strength right now. \"I think me and my family see it as kind of a legacy thing from a standpoint of this is where I got well, started my journey to wellness,\" said Rehak. \"And I think she sees the good that's done here.\" \"They've all gone through traumatic health scares and injuries. And I just want to be the person who can give them a little light, a little optimism that the hardest parts are, hopefully, now over and they're starting their recovery.\" Award-winning journalist Lisa Hughes anchors WBZ-TV News weekdays at 5, 6 and 11 p.m. with co-anchor David Wade. © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:31 PM EDT/ CBS Miami Two people were killed and six others were injured after an armed student stormedFlorida State University's campus in Tallahassee on Thursday, authorities confirmed. The gunman, believed to be a 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, was shot by police on campus, taken into custody, and transported to the hospital as well, police said. Here's everything we know so far. According to FSU, police responded to the active shooter call from the area of the campus student union around 12:01 p.m. \"Police are on scene or on the way,\" the alert said. \"Continue to seek shelter and await further instructions. Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures.\" According to police, the gunman began to fire on the main campus around 11:50 a.m., shooting at multiple individuals and killing two people, who were not students, police said. Across campus, police escorted students and staff to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center, which was established as a student reunification point. Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence E. Revell said FSU campus police was on scene and engaged with the gunman \"almost immediately.\" \"[A] very seamless response to this tragedy,\" he said. FSU's alert system continued, advising everyone on campus tocontinue sheltering in placeas police investigated. The FSU campus had been secured by authorities around 3:15 p.m., Tallahassee Police confirmed. Revell said Tallahassee Police will be the lead agency to investigate the FSU shooting and the shooting between the officer and gunman. In a Thursday press conference, officials said there were a total of nine victims: two people were killed, while six people and the gunman were hospitalized. In their initial update, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said they were in \"close coordination\" with first responders and public safety officials. \"Out of respect for patient privacy and to ensure accurate information, we will provide updates as soon as they are available,\" TMH said. In a later update, TMH told CBS News Miami that they had received six patients —  one in critical condition and the others listed in serious condition. The hospital said all patients were in fair condition as of around 4:30 p.m. Revell confirmed that the gunman was also sent to the hospital for treatment of his injuries. Not only was Ikner, the suspected gunman and a current student at FSU, but he is also the son of a Leon County Sheriff's deputy, officials confirmed. According to Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil, the 20-year-old man is the son of one of his deputies, saying his mother has been with the force for 18 years and that he was involved in the sheriff's office programs. The shooter also used his mother's former service weapon —   now a personal handgun —   which was found at the scene. \"Not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons,\" McNeil said. According to Revell, the shooter also had a shotgun with him during the shooting but could not confirm whether it was used. At this time, McNeil said his agency will investigate further into the circumstances of how the shooter obtained his deputy's gun and whether there will be any suspensions or terminations made. Revell added that there is no reason at this time to believe he hadn't acted alone and that there are no current threats to the community. Multiple agencies have responded to the scene, including campus police and other Tallahassee area agencies, including the Leon County Sheriff's Office. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissaidstate law enforcement was responding to the shooting. Additionally, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI's Jacksonville and Tallahassee offices are on the scene to assist. The FBI said in Thursday's press conference that the agency has established a digital tipline to help law enforcement with the investigation. If anyone has any information, they can submit their tips tofbi.gov/fsushooting. The FBI also said it is ensuring that all resources needed are brought to the community. Revell said he and the other law enforcement officers who responded to the scene will try to remain open and transparent in collaboration with the State Attorney's Office to get to the bottom of the \"very horrific incident.\" FSU shared onsocial mediathat all classes and university events, including athletic events, scheduled for Thursday have been canceled. \"Individuals not already on the main campus at this time should avoid coming to the Tallahassee main campus,\" FSU said. At Thursday afternoon's press conference, FSU President Richard McCullough added that all classes will be canceled Friday and all university and campus events are canceled through Sunday. He added that the safety and well-being of FSU students and staff are his top priority, and that the school will offer on-site counseling to everyone affected and employee assistance programs for staff working at the time. \"This is a deeply emotional time, but we're all here to support each other,\" McCullough said. \"... we'll get through this together.\" McCullough also said that the school is fully cooperating with the investigation and FSU campus police advised that family members can go to the Tucker Center to pick up their relatives, and loved ones should call each other immediately. Ava Arenado, an FSU student who was in class when the university alert went out,described a terrifying scene. \"One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class,\" Arenadotold CBS News Miami. \"My teacher immediately started barricading the door… and then another student said she'd rather go home, so we all just kind of ran to our cars.\" FSU student Blake Leonard told CBS News Miami he heard a total of about 30 shots fired. Leonard said he was about 400 feet from the student union when he heard gunfire and started running. \"I heard about 12 shots go off. In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:21 PM EDT/ CBS News The 26-year-old suspect in theNew York City shooting deathof UnitedHealthcare CEOBrian Thompsonhas been indicted on federal charges. Luigi Mangione was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on one count of murder with a firearm, another firearms offense and two counts of stalking. If convicted as charged, he would be eligible for the death penalty. \"Mangione traveled across state lines via an interstate bus line for the purpose of stalking and killing Brian Thompson,\" the indictment reads. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondihad instructed federal prosecutorsto seek the death penalty against Mangione, who is already facing state murder charges in the case. Mangione's attorneys, who have filed motions asking for the death penalty option to be removed, declined comment on the indictment when reached by CBS News. The 50-year-old Thompson was fatally shot outside a Manhattan hotel on Dec. 4, 2024. Following an extensive nationwide manhunt, Mangionewas apprehendedat a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Dec. 9. Mangione has pleaded not guiltyto the 11 chargesbrought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and four charges he faces in Pennsylvania. Authoritieshave allegedthat Mangione meticulously planned the slaying of Thompson, who was killed outside a hotel where he was slated to attend an investor meeting that day. Ahead of the shooting, Mangione, who is froma prominent Maryland family, came to New York City in late November, where he stayed in a hostel under a fake New Jersey identification card. After the shooting, authorities say Mangione fled into Central Park on a bike and then took a cab to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in upper Manhattan. The words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and possibly \"depose\"were found written in Sharpieon shell casings at the scene of killing. But as they search for a motive, investigators have said that Mangione was never a UnitedHealthcare customer. A3D-printed ghost gunwith a suppressor, believed to be the murder weapon, was found on his person when he was arrested in Pennsylvania, the NYPD said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:07 PM EDT/ AP An immigration judge on Wednesday denied bond for Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey who was detained last month after her visa was revoked, her lawyers said. Öztürk, 30, is in custody at a federal detention facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was eventually transferred after beingdetained last month by immigration authoritiesoutside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. Her attorneys — who allege she was detained after co-writing an op-ed in the campus newspaper — argue her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and are seeking to have her either released on bail or transferred to Vermont from Louisiana. Öztürk's attorney Marty Rosenbluth said in a statement Thursday her detention is a \"complete violation of due process and the rule of law.\" Lawyers for Öztürk had asked an immigration judge that she be released on bond as her immigration case proceeds. That judge denied her request Wednesday, the same day Öztürk had a hearing, her attorneys said in a statement released Thursday morning. Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Öztürk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa. The memo says her visa was revoked following an assessment that she had been involved in associations \"'that may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization' including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.\" Öztürk's lawyers said the immigration judge denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\" CBS News has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment. Immigration officialstook Öztürk into custodyon March 25 when she was returning from an iftar dinner. After being taken to New Hampshire and then Vermont, she was put on a plane the next day and moved to an ICE detention center in Basile, Louisiana. Öztürk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university's response to student activists demanding that Tufts \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\" disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel. Öztürk is one of several people with ties to American universities whose visas were revoked or have been stopped from entering the U.S. after they were accused of participating in demonstrations or publicly expressed support for Palestinians. A Louisiana immigration judge has ruled that the U.S.can deportColumbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil. Öztürk's lawyers arechallenging the legal authorityfor ICE's detention. They also have asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Vermont, where her detention case was transferred after lawyers first petitioned for her release in Massachusetts, to take jurisdiction of it and release her. Sessions, who held ahearingMonday, has not ruled yet. He had asked Öztürk's lawyers if there was any evidence suggesting that she was a member of the organization that was later \"temporarily banned,\" according to the State Department memo. Her lawyers said there wasn't. © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "FDA making plans to end its routine food safety inspections, sources say",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 7:05 PM EDT/ CBS News TheFood and Drug Administrationis drawing up plans that would end most of its routine food safety inspections work, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News, and effectively outsource this oversight to state and local authorities. The plans have not been finalized and might need congressional action to fully fund, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, denied that the FDA was making plans to do this. Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with43 statesand Puerto Rico. \"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News. Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Officereportsaid earlier this year. The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce.Some kinds of meatare regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities. It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware. In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processorlast yearlinked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations. Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year. The official likened the plans to the FDA'sGrade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated. Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, theyhave argued. \"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement. Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government. He also pointed to how the FDAregulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves. \"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said. Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products. In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections. Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected toresult in cutbacksto the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makaryhas also greenlightedplans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers. \"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News. Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources. \"So far, this Administration has acted with reckless disregard for how its policies will affect the detection and prevention of foodborne illness, and any plans to replace federal food inspectors with some other workforce deserves suspicion,\" he said.

    "title": "Court says Trump administration's claims in case of deported man are \"shocking\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 6:50 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —A federal appeals court said Thursday that the Trump administration's assertions in the case of a Maryland man who it admittedwas mistakenly deported to El Salvadorshould be \"shocking\" to all Americans and made an appeal to the executive branch to vindicate the importance of the rule of law. The briefunanimous opinionauthored by Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause adistrict judge's orderthat required it to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old who lives in Maryland, from Salvadoran custody, and explain the steps it has taken to return him to the U.S. \"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Wilkinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote. \"Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\" Wilkinson was joined in his opinion by Judges Robert King, nominated by President Bill Clinton, and Stephanie Thacker, appointed by President Barack Obama. The judge acknowledged that the executive branch has \"enormous\" powers to prosecute and deport noncitizens, but warned that the administration's actions so far could put U.S. citizens at risk. \"If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?\" Wilkinson wrote. \"And what assurance shall there be that the executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?\" In his opinion, Wilkinson wrote of the tensions that can exist between the executive and judicial branches, but said that these differences require an effort at \"mutual respect.\" He lamented that \"too often today\" the executive branch has not afforded the courts that respect, andcited calls for judges to be impeachedfor decisions the government disagrees with, as well as pressure to disregard judicial orders. \"It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,\" he wrote. \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\" Abrego Garcia's casehas exploded simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration, which has been undertaking asweeping crackdownon illegal immigration. The Salvadoran national came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. Administration officials claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant and his attire — a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie — at the time of his arrest. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said he is not a gang member and has never been charged with or convicted of any crime in the U.S. or El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was released from immigration custody in October 2019 and granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, which is a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador. He was living with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their children in Maryland until he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and sent toEl Salvador, where he and more than 200 others have been confined at the Terrorism Confinement Center, a notorious prison known as CECOT. Immigration officials in the Trump administration haveacknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removalto El Salvador last month was an \"administrative error\" because of the withholding of removal, but efforts to have him brought back to the U.S. have sparked a fierce legal battle. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinisordered the Trump administrationearlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, and the caselanded before the Supreme Court. The high court then ruled last week that Xinisproperly required the governmentto \"facilitate\" his release from custody in El Salvador, but said she should clarify the scope of her decision as to effectuating Abrego Garcia's return. The district judge issued an amended decision thatordered the administrationto facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody as soon as possible. She also required the government to give her information about his whereabouts, as well as what steps it was taking to bring him back to the U.S. The Trump administration has so far rebuffed her requests for that information, but has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia isalive and detained at CECOT. Justice Department lawyers have said they will remove \"any domestic barriers\" to his return, but they have argued the U.S. does not have the power to force the Salvadoran government to release him. In his decision, Wilkinson said the court will not \"micromanage\" Xinis' attempt to implement the Supreme Court's decision, which he acknowledged requires lower courts to give consideration to the deference owed to the executive branch when conducting foreign affairs. \"The Supreme Court's decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing,\" he wrote. In addition to ordering the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Xinis earlier this week said that she willallow expedited discoveryto determine what the Trump administration has done to return him to the U.S. Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

But the gun doesn't do the shooting, the people do.\" \"As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on for a long time,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment.

The alleged gunman — identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner — was taken into custody after being shot by police, according to law enforcement. Mr. Trump hasgenerally opposednew gun control measures. He signed an executive order in early February ordering Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into rolling back several Biden-era gun regulations, including stricter rules forfirearms dealers.

A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesdaysuggestedthat Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlierreportedby CNN. The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS. Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Mondayrejected his administration'sdemands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard. The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at othertop universitiesas it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs. But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said. \"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\" Here's what to know about the issue. Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status,accordingto the IRS. Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universitiessays. Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations. That's because Congress in 1998 passed alawthat forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said. In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, likeneglecting to filean annual information return for more than three consecutive years. One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships. That case ended up at the Supreme Court, whichruledin 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education. The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in. \"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said. He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\" The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts. As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said. \"Harvard isn't going to lose this — they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\" Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries. By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions. \"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\" Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities. In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal. \"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\" The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 17, 2025 / 6:19 PM EDT/ CBS News Honda Motor this week said it is moving production of its Civic Hybrid hatchback from Japan to the U.S. The announcement comes amid a barrage of tariffs by the Trump administration, including a 25% levy on imports fromCanada and Mexicoand25% auto tariffs. \"We are currently dual-sourcing the Civic Hatchback Hybrid from our Indiana Auto Plant and Japan, but beginning later this year it will be produced only in Indiana,\" said Chris Abbruzzese, a spokesperson for American Honda Motor Co., confirmed with CBS MoneyWatch. The reason behind the shift in production was not disclosed. However, another spokesperson for the auto giant said it was not down to a single issue, but instead based on \"the company's policy since its foundation that we produce cars where the demand is,\" AFP reported. Honda's hybrid hatchback is a semi-electric version of the Honda Civic, a top U.S. seller among small cars,accordingto the Detroit Free Press. More than two-thirds of Honda and Acura models sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically,accordingto Autoweek.com. The industry trade outlet reports that the company has denied rumors of any plans to also shift production of its Honda Civic Hybrid sedan, which is manufactured in Canada, to the U.S. Anne Marie D.

    "title": "What we know about Phoenix Ikner, the Florida State University shooting suspect",
    "article_text": "Officials have identified the son of a sheriff’s deputy as a suspect in theFlorida State University shooting that killed two peopleand wounded several others Thursday. Phoenix Ikner, 20, accessed one of his mother's weapons — a handgun — that officials said was used in the shooting and matched one of the firearms at the scene, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Officials said that Ikner’s mother had purchased her former service weapons and that it was her personal property at the time of the shooting. Follow here for live coverage. Police said the gunman also had a shotgun but have not yet confirmed whether it was used. A motive has not been identified. Ikner is believed to be a student at FSU. It was not a surprise that Ikner had access to weapon, McNeil said, as he was a member of the sheriff’s office’s citizen advisory or Youth Advisory Council.The Leon County Sheriff’s Officedescribed the council as a way to \"provide an open line of communication between the youth of Leon County and local law enforcement\"in a news releasethat announced its the 2021-22 class. The gunman opened fire near the student union around 11:50 a.m., FSU Police Chief Jason Trumbower said. He shot multiple people before FSU police were able to engage, neutralize and apprehend him. The shooter is hospitalized with unspecified injuries, police said. Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell said in a statement Thursday night that Ikner had serious but non-life-threatening injuries. “This event is tragic in more ways than you people in the audience could ever fathom from a law enforcement perspective,” McNeil said. “But I will tell you this, we will make sure that we do everything we can to prosecute and make sure that we send a message to folks that this will never be tolerated here in Leon County and, I dare say, across this state and across this nation.” A student whowitnessed the gunman approach campus and begin opening firesaid the shooter pulled up to campus in an orange Hummer and got out holding a rifle and shooting in her direction. “I think he was shooting and he missed. So he goes back into his car and grabs a pistol, then he turns and shoots the lady in front of him. That’s when I just started running,\" McKenzie Heeter, a junior at FSU, told NBC News. Heeter described the shooter as a “normal college dude.” Reid Seybold, a senior at FSU who was around the corner from the shooting when it unfolded, said he knew Ikner from a political discussion group at Tallahassee State College, where he spent the first two years of his education before he transferred to FSU. Seybold, the group's president, said Ikner was asked not to return to the group because of views that Seybold said aligned with white supremacy. “He espoused so much white supremacist rhetoric and far-right rhetoric, as well,” Seybold said. Since then, Seybold said, he has seen Ikner only a couple of times in passing. The current president of the same club, Riley Pusins, said that at meetings, the suspect advocated for President Donald Trump’s agenda and often promoted white supremacist values, even though the club was nonpartisan and was about debate and political discourse. Pusins said many people in the club had labeled the suspect, who attended regularly as recently as last semester, a fascist. After the meetings, Pusins said, the suspect often made more “inappropriate” comments. He would “go up to the line” in the meeting and then cross the line in comments made after the fact, Pusins said. Seybold said he was working on a group project when he heard about the shooting. He said he immediately locked down in the classroom where he was working as he heard gunfire nearby. “I was texting everybody I loved, letting know that I loved them. I was getting ready to die, which was harrowing,” Seybold said. “I don’t know why he would have done something like this,” Seybold said. “I don’t know where it would have come from, but I’d sure like to find out.”",

    "title": "'Shoots in my direction': FSU student describes seeing gunman open fire in deadly campus shooting",
    "article_text": "A junior at Florida State watched a gunman pull up to campus and begin opening fire near the student union in what ended up being a deadly shooting at the Tallahassee university Thursday afternoon. At least two people were killed and five people were taken to local hospitals with gunshot wounds, FSU Police Chief Jason Trumbower said at a Thursday-afternoon news conference. The two people killed were not students, Trumbower said, and the gunman was also taken to the hospital. A spokesperson for Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare earlier told NBC News the hospital was treating patients injured in the shooting. The gunman began shooting in the area of the student union at around 11:50 a.m., Trumbower said, adding that he shot multiple people before FSU police were able to engage, neutralize and apprehend him. Walt McNeil, the Leon County sheriff, identified the suspect as Phoenix Ikner, 20, the son of a Leon County sheriff’s deputy. He said Ikner was able to access one of her weapons, which matched one of the weapons found at the scene. Ikner is believed to be a student at FSU. His motive remains unclear. Police said the weapon used was a handgun and that the shooter had a shotgun with him, but they have not yet confirmed that he shot anyone with the shotgun. McKenzie Heeter, a junior at FSU, described seeing the gunman Thursday afternoon as she was outside the student union. “I was leaving the union with my food. There’s a road next to it and I was walking and this guy pulls up in an orange Hummer, and he gets out with a rifle and shoots in my direction. There were a couple other kids near me,” Heeter said. “I think he was shooting and he missed. So he goes back into his car and grabs a pistol, then he turns and shoots the lady in front of him. That’s when I just started running.” Heeter said she heard about 15 rounds fired for about 20 to 30 seconds. She said she then called the police at 11:57 a.m. to report the shooting. She described the shooter as a “normal college dude” who was wearing an orange T-shirt and khaki shorts. She described him as white with light hair. At first, Heeter said she thought he brought out a BB gun, but when she heard him fire she knew it was real. “When he turned back around with the pistol, I saw him shoot the lady like right in front of him. She was probably like 5 feet in front of him with the pistol,” Heeter said. She said the woman was in purple scrubs and didn’t appear to be a student or faculty. “It was just me and like three other people that noticed at first, but we were walking in the opposite direction away from the union, so we started running. I just told everybody that I could see, stay away from campus,” she recalled. “I ran back to my apartment as fast as I could.” The campus was initially locked down, with FSU sending out an alert urging students to take cover and to lock doors. Students have since been allowed to return to their residence halls but have been asked to continue to avoid the student union.",

    "title": "Appeals court rejects Trump request in Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, citing due process concerns",
    "article_text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected a bid by the Trump administration to block an order directing it tofacilitate the returnof a mistakenly deported man, saying it was trying to claim “a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process.” The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the case ofKilmar Abrego Garciaamid accusations that the administration has been giving short shrift to deportees’ due process rights, and after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have complained those protections are hampering their efforts at mass deportations. Follow live politics coverage here The administration is challenging a judge’s order that it “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia, who the Justice Department has acknowledged should not have beensent to a prisonin his native El Salvador because of an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring such action. It’s part of a larger running battle between the Trump administration and the courts. The administration has stretched existing law with new executive orders and novel legal theories, and a number of federal courts have acted to rein it in — with Trump and allies then firing back in the court of public opinion, accusing the judges of overstepping their authority. “The relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature,” U.S. Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote inThursday’s unanimous decisionby a three-judge panel. The government “claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” The administration downplayed the lack of due process in its filing to the appeals court. It contended that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim he denies, and is legally eligible to be deported to El Salvador since Trump has designated the gang a foreign terrorist organization. The administration did not go through formal procedures, which would involve filing a motion to reopen Abrego Garcia’s deportation case, immigration law experts told NBC News. “There would be a process. ICE would need to move to reopen his removal case, provide due process, have a hearing,” said Rebekah Niblock, an immigration lawyer at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network. There would also be litigation over his alleged membership in MS-13. “That is an issue that a judge would have to rule on and would be litigated heavily,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. An immigration judge determined Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang in 2019, but the evidence that judge relied was recently questioned by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland presiding over the mistaken deportation case. Xinis noted that Abrego Garcia has no criminal convictions in the U.S. or El Salvador, and said the evidence meant to support allegations of gang affiliation “consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13’s ‘Western’ clique in New York — a place he has never lived.” Wilkinson, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, pointed to that dispute in his ruling. “The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order,” he wrote. In posts on social media this week, Trump and Vance have complained that courts giving due process protections to deportees are slowing the administration’s efforts to ramp up deportations. On Truth Social, Trump criticized court proceedings around immigration, saying it would take “many years of long and tedious trials to fly each and every one of them back home. Where is the JUSTICE here???” Trump was referring to an order Monday froma federal judge in Massachusetts blocking the administration’s plan to bring anearly end to a programallowing hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua to temporarily live and work in the U.S. legally. The judge said the participants had been accepted into the program on a case-by-case basis, and therefore any revocations should be done on a case-by-case basis as well. “Based on the Court System, that would take approximately 100 years,” Trump complained. In aseries of X postson Tuesday, Vance suggested the scale of the issue outweighed due process concerns. “Here’s a useful test: ask the people weeping over the lack of due process what precisely they propose for dealing with Biden’s millions and millions of illegals. And with reasonable resource and administrative judge constraints, does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year?” he wrote in one post. Legal experts say that immigrants who try to enter the U.S. illegally or who have lived in the country without legal status are already at a legal disadvantage and have limited due process rights. That applies especially to those who are detained at or close to the border, where they can be quickly ejected. While long-term U.S. residents could assert due process rights, that doesn’t mean they will, as often they do not have legal assistance. That situation has gotten worse as the Trump administration has cut resources for groups that represent refugees, Niblock noted. “There’s not much help out there,” she said. Concerns over due process have been an issue in other court cases against the administration. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday found probable cause to holdthe administrationin contempt for disregarding an order halting deportation flights to El Salvador last month. Judge James Boasberg had issued the order after lawyers for immigrants the administration accuses of being in the Tren de Aragua gang said their clients, who denied they’re members, were being deported without notice or the opportunity to challenge the administration’s allegations against them under the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court later vacated the order on jurisdictional grounds, but held that “AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.” In acourt filingThursday, attorneys for the detainees said the administration was not giving detainees a “reasonable” amount of time, and had said at a hearing in Texas last week “that it was not ruling out the possibility that AEA removals would resume with only 24 hours’ notice.” Boasberg said the government could purge his contempt by taking custody of the people it deported despite his order and giving them hearings so they can challenge the allegations against them. The “Government would not need to release any of those individuals, nor would it need to transport them back to the homeland” for that process,he wrote. The Justice Department is appealing his ruling. The administration’s appeal in the Abrego Garcia case is challenging Xinis’ ruling directing federal officials to try to secure his return, and her order for them to turn over more information on what steps have been taken to get him back — language that predominantly mirrored a Supreme Court ruling last week that largely upheld her prior order. Wilkinson said the administration should comply with Xinis’ order. “While we fully respect the Executive’s robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court’s recent decision,” he wrote. “We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time,” Wilkinson added. The administration also asked Xinis to pause her ruling while it appeals. She rejected that request Thursday.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — TheSupreme Courtsaid Thursday it will hear oral arguments next month on whether the Trump administration can take steps to enforce its contentious proposal toend automatic birthright citizenshipwhile litigation continues. The court in abrief orderdeferred action on an emergency request made by the Trump administration to narrow the scope of nationwide injunctions imposed by judges. The policy for now remains blocked nationwide. Follow live politics coverage here The court, when it hears arguments on May 15, will consider whether judges exceeded their authority in issuing nationwide injunctions. The Trump emergency application does not address the legal merits of the plan, but only whether judges had the authority to put it on hold across the entire country. President Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have been harshly critical of judges who have blocked aspects of his agenda, although it is not a new phenomenon for courts to impose nationwide injunctions. It has long beenwidely accepted, including by legal scholars on the left and right, that the Constitution's 14th Amendment confers automatic citizenship to almost anyone born in the United States. “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment says. Based on historical practice, the only exception is people who are the children of diplomats. Trump wants to adopt a completely new meaning of the language that would confer citizenship only on those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Speaking at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Trump expressed his view that the 14th Amendment was directed only at former slaves, \"and if you look at it that way we will win.\" It's a view the majority of legal experts, as well as those who have challenged the proposal, disagree with. \"President Trump’s attempt to terminate birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional, which is why every court to date has rejected his administration’s filings,\" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday. Trump's executive order, issued on his first day in office in January, was immediately challenged, and every court that has ruled on the proposal so far has blocked it. At issue at the Supreme Court were cases filed in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In court papers acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that judges did not have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions and that the states that sued did not have legal standing. The Trump plan has the backing of 21 other states.",

    "article_text": "Fans of YouTuber MrBeast who signed up for an \"unforgettable\" Las Vegas experience got what they asked for ... just not in the way they expected. Some outraged fans said the Las Vegas event advertised as an \"immersive\" experience fell far short of their expectations, and complained that they had to wait hours in their hotel rooms and only received a \"mystery bag\" that contained clearance items from his online store. The three-day event at Resorts World Las Vegas was billed to be an \"immersive\" and \"unforgettable\" experience, according toKLAS-TV of Las Vegas, which reported tickets cost about $1,000. It included a limited-time hotel package featuring a three-night stay, an exclusive mystery bag with MrBeast merchandise with a potential $10,000 gift voucher for one fan, and an \"on-site MrBeast-themed activation,\"NBC affiliate KSNV of Las Vegas reported. The event from April 13-15 was in partnership with the popular YouTuber. Following complaints, it appears that Resorts Worldremoved the event from its website. Guests told KLAS that the chaos started the moment they checked in to the hotel. They were instructed to wait in their rooms for a surprise gift, the news station reported. \"I was told to wait in my room for two days for a package to come, so I legit spent two days in my room for a package to come, and it was a box of chocolates,\" Theresa Metta said. Metta said that fans were promised a mystery bag, but when she received hers, it contained clearance items from the online MrBeast store. \"It had kids shorts, an extra small shirt, a hat and a medium shirt,\" she told the news station. \"If you go to MrBeast.store to their merchandise right now, all this stuff is on clearance for $9. We were told we’d get exclusive merch. Obviously, that’s not the case.\" Travel vloggers Abed Nader and Chris Sawyer from Random Recess posted aYouTube videoabout their experience. \"I was telling Chris that I'm ready to leave,\" Nader said at one point in the video. \"I'm not gonna spend another dollar here at Resorts World, not in the casino. I don't know, the lack of information.\" MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has not put out a formal statement about the event. In response to a fan's complaint on X, he said: \"Hey!

Can’t wait to meet you all and my team is reaching out to everyone.\" Random Recess posted on X earlier this week that MrBeast's team reached out to them and said that Resorts World sent an email saying guests would be fully refunded.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemon Wednesday announced the cancellation of two DHS grants to the school, declaring it \"unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars.\" Noem also said she sent a letter to Harvard demanding \"detailed records\" on foreign student visa holders’ \"illegal and violent activities\" by April 30. If Harvard does not meet that deadline, it’ll immediately lose its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, she warned. The release alleged Harvard’s foreign visa holders participated in riots and spewed antisemitic hate targeting Jewish students following the Hamas incursion against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. \"If Harvard cannot verify it is in full compliance with its reporting requirements, the university will lose the privilege of enrolling foreign students,\" a DHS news release said. The two canceled grants were: an $800,303 grant for Implementation Science for Targeted Violence Prevention, which Noem said \"branded conservatives as far-right dissidents in a shockingly skewed study,\" and a $1.9 million Blue Campaign Program Evaluation and Violence Advisement grant that Noem alleged \"funded Harvard’s public health propaganda.\" \"Harvard bending the knee to antisemitism — driven by its spineless leadership — fuels a cesspool of extremist riots and threatens our national security,\" Noem said in a statement. \"With anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology poisoning its campus and classrooms, Harvard’s position as a top institution of higher learning is a distant memory. America demands more from universities entrusted with taxpayer dollars.\" It's the latest punch by the Trump administration against the nation's most prestigious university. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that it would freeze more than $2 billion in grants to Harvard afterthe institution refused to accept demands that included auditing the viewpoints of its student body. Trump has also called for Harvard to lose itstax-exempt status. On Monday, Harvard University’s lawyerssent a letterrejecting a list of demands from the Trump administration. In a statementposted online, Harvard President Alan Garber referred to the demands as “an attempt to control the Harvard community” and vowed to fight back. A Harvard spokesperson told NBC News on Thursday that the school will “not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” while complying with the law.",

    "title": "Aaron Rodgers remains undecided on NFL future: 'I'm open to anything'",
    "article_text": "Future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers said he remains undecided on his future in the NFL. “I’m open to anything and attached to nothing,” he said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\"Thursday. “Retirement could still be a possibility.” Rodgers, considered one of the greatest signal-callers in league history, played his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, leading the franchise to a Super Bowl victory in 2011. He was named the NFL's most valuable player four times and was a 10-time Pro Bowler. He joined the Jets in 2023 and had an up-and-down experience in New York. He missed almost the entire first season after tearing his Achilles just four plays in. In 2024 he posted his worst completion percentage since 2019, his fewest yards per attempt since 2015, and his lowest passer rating as a full-time starter. The Jets fired head coach Robert Saleh after a 2-3 start to the season and finished the remainder of the year 3-9. Rodgers, 41, was officially released on March 12 and became a free agent. While most NFL teams either have an established quarterback for next season or added one in the offseason, Rodgers still has multiple suitors including the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings. Rodgers said his intention was not to “hold anybody hostage.” “I have off-the-field stuff going on that requires my attention,” he told McAfee. “I have personal commitments that I’ve made not knowing what my future was going to look like after last year that are important to me. And I have a couple people in my inner, inner circle that are battling some difficult stuff. So I have a lot of things that are taking my attention — and have, beginning in January — away from football.” Rodgers also shot down reports that he hasn’t made a choice based on his salary demands. \"There’s been a lot of people assuming they have information about me that’s just not true. I’ve been upfront with these teams from the start about where I was at, starting with the money thing,” he said. \"I told every one of the teams I talked to that it ain’t about the money.\" Rodgers said he’s open to a one-year deal at $10 million. He confirmed traveling to Pittsburgh this offseason to meet with Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. The franchise could be an ideal landing spot for Rodgers, as the only quarterbacks on the roster, Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson, are largely unproven over the course of an entire NFL season. \"(Tomlin is) more than I even thought from afar as far as the type of person he is,” Rodgers said. “I have a lot of respect for what he’s accomplished in the league.” Rodgers also said he spoke with Brian Daboll, calling the Giants head coach “a beautiful football mind.” New York did, however,sign veteran quarterback Russell Wilsonthis offseason to a one-year deal. As for an updated timeline, Rodgers said he doesn’t have one. He’s going to continue conversations with teams and then make a decision. Next week’s NFL Draft isn’t going to expedite the process. “I was honest from the jump of where I was at mentally and some of the constraints I have in my life right now that warrant my attention,” he said. “Retirement could still be a possibility, but right now my focus has been and will continue to be my personal life. That’s what I’ve told the coaches.\"",

    "article_text": "A federal grand jury Thursday indictedLuigi Mangioneon four charges in the December ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in New York City. Mangione, 26, also faces state murder charges and other counts in the Dec. 4 killing of CEO Brian Thompson in midtown Manhattan. The federal indictment returned Thursday charges Mangione with two counts of stalking, one count of murder through use of a firearm and a firearms offense for an allegation that he used a silencer. Mangione is accused of shooting Thompson from behind as Thompson walked on a sidewalk to an investors conference. UnitedHealthcare is thecountry’s largest private health insurance company, and officials have said Mangione targeted Thompson. The words “deny,” “depose” and “delay” were written on two spent shell casings and a bullet found at the scene, officials said. The shootingsparked a massive manhunt, and Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Dec. 9. Mangioneis charged in New Yorkon state counts of first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism, as well as two counts of second-degree murder. He is also charged with weapons counts and a count of using a forged instrument. Mangione haspleaded not guiltyin the state case. Attorney General Pam Bondidirected federal prosecutors this month to seek the death penaltyin the federal case. Mangione's attorneys have filed a motionseeking to preclude the death penalty, arguing in part that Bondi is seeking it as “a political stunt.” They cited Bondi's announcement about seeking the death penalty,in which she said, \"I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” Mangione had been charged in a criminal complaint. The case was then presented to a grand jury, which returned an indictment.",

    "title": "How Trump has paved the way for new GOP policy fights: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Jonathan Allen explores how the major policy fights in Washington are happening within the Republican Party. Plus, after we noted yesterday that outspoken progressives are seeing aninflux of campaign cash, Natasha Korecki and Bridget Bowman dive further into how the anti-Trump 2.0 resistance is starting to find its footing. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner As they stare into the abyss of rising national debt, Republicans are starting to talk about the possibility of raising taxes on the wealthy. Yes, you read that right, andNBC News’ Sahil Kapur and Peter Nicholashave the reporting to back it up. Since the days of George H.W. Bush’s breaking his “read my lips” promise, Republicans have run for the hills any time a tax hike is mentioned. Now, that option is part of a sprawling, animated and consequential set of policy fights between the ascendent populist wing of the GOP and the grasping-for-relevance old guard conservatives. What happened? President Donald Trump. His eagerness to take both sides on certain issues — sometimes in a single sentence — allows him to maintain the dominant voice on public policy and makes it harder for his adversaries to pin him down. In his second term, fellow Republicans are starting to adjust. As long as they support him in the end, they are freer to take positions against one another — and party orthodoxy — before he makes a final call. It’s not just on domestic taxes. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs may be a threat to the economy and his long-term political success. But in the interim, they have upset traditional Washington partisan paradigms and blocked out coverage of other issues. While progressives Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hold rallies across the country, bringing tens of thousands of people to rallies that accuse Trump of selling out the working class to line the pockets of the wealthiest people in the country, the MAGA wing of the GOP is rhetorically — and in some cases on a policy level — arguing for a stick-it-to-the-rich agenda. The dynamic is still nascent, but it’s somewhat reminiscent of the mid-20th century era of Democratic dominance in Congress — when a party that was on both sides of civil rights, both sides of foreign policy and both sides of the distribution of benefits held all the power and had all the energy in policymaking. The cart, of course, should not be put before the horse. There are plenty of reasons to think that the GOP won’t actually increase the tax burden on the wealthiest. After all, Trump is in the process of gutting the IRS, which already under-collects hundreds of billions of dollars in owed taxes, mostly from the rich. But for now, at least, the Trump model of triangulating against himself — and of fellow Republicans’ following suit — is making it even harder for the Democratic minority to lock on a target and define its own agenda. In the red state of Montana on Wednesday,a crowd swelledfor two political stars of the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who vowed to “fight oligarchy” in President Donald Trump’s administration. That night, Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., had her largest-ever town hall crowd, with many people wanting to know how Democrats were pushing back. And hours later, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., traveled to El Salvador to bring attention to a case at the center of the party’s arguments that Trump’s immigration policies have gone beyond existing law and court orders. Those events of the last 24 hours point to a similar phenomenon: In ways big and small, the second-term resistance to Trump is growing stronger and bolder. The pushback is from not just politicians but also some of the powerful institutions that have come under attack by the administration. They includeHarvard University, theMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyandPrinceton, all of which refused to yield toa list of Trump demandsthat would overhaul hiring, disciplinary and other practices in the face of billions of dollars in federal funding freezes. While it is far from a full-fledged revolt, more of those being targeted by Trump’s policies are putting up a fight now, compared with the universities, law firms andeven Democratic politicianswho bent his way in the first weeks and months of his term. Yet amid the bursts of resistance is a steady flow of appeasement by some of the country’s most powerful institutions,such as major law firmsthat have struck deals with the White House — including five more last week — to collectively provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal work. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party regroups from 2024 and refocuses on next year’s midterm elections. But that could get complicated, as some of that anxiety is aimed at Democratic leaders. Read more from Natasha and Bridget → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "American citizen under ICE hold in Florida after driving from Georgia",
    "article_text": "A U.S.-born American citizen was being detained at the request of immigration authorities Thursday despite an advocate showing his U.S. birth certificate in court and a county judge finding no reason for him to be considered an “illegal alien” who illegally entered Florida. Juan Carlos Gomez-Lopez, 20, was arrested Thursday evening by Florida Highway Patrol and charged under a state immigration law that has been temporarily blocked since early this month. Details of Gomez-Lopez’s arrest and detentionwere first reported bytheFlorida Phoenix news site. After inspecting his birth certificate, Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans said during the hearing that “this is indeed an authentic document,” but that she did not have jurisdiction beyond finding no probable cause for the charge. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s role is to enforce immigration laws that generally apply to noncitizens. American citizens are protected under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution from unreasonable search and seizure, arrest and detention. Nonetheless, he remains detained locally at ICE’s request, said Thomas Kennedy, a spokesperson at the Florida Immigrant Coalition who attended Thursday’s hearing. “Everything tracks for him being sent to an ICE detention center,” he told NBC News in a phone interview. NBC News has reached out to state and federal authorities for comment. Gomez-Lopez was in a vehicle with other passengers and was traveling to work from Georgia when they were stopped after entering Florida. A sweeping immigration law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023makes it a state crimefor an undocumented immigrant over age 18 to enter the state illegally. Gomez-Lopez was born in Georgia but lived much of his life in Mexico. His first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, the Florida Phoenix reported. His mother burst into tears when she saw her son virtually at his hearing, the news site reported. “I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there,” she told the Florida Phoenix. Kennedy compared the situation to Franz Kafka’s novel “The Trial” in which man must defend himself against a charge but has no information about it. “It’s like this bureaucratic, dystopian nightmare of poorly written laws,” Kennedy said. “We are living in a time when this man could get sent to El Salvador because, what, is he going to be treated like a stateless person?” Kennedy was referring to the hundreds of immigrants who have been sent by the Trump administration to an El Salvador megaprison after they were accused of being gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act. Families, attorneys and some U.S. legislators have not been able to have any contact with them. On Thursday night, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.,confirmed he had a meeting in El Salvador with Kilmar Abrego García,a man who had been living in Maryland for several years and who the Trump administration said it mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March. Van Hollen traveled there after Abrego García had not been transported back to the U.S. despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the Trump administration to “facilitate” his return.",

    "title": "Drake claims Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance was 'orchestrated to assassinate' his character",
    "article_text": "Drake is expanding his legal battle with Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” claiming the rival rapper’s Grammys success and Super Bowl performance further damaged his reputation. Both Drake and Lamar are signed to UMG, under different divisions. (UMG has no relationship to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.) They engaged in a prolific diss track battle last year, with Lamarcoming out on topinthe charts. Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, originally sued UMG in January, alleging that it defamed him by spreading a “false and malicious narrative” when it promoted Lamar’s diss track. The song’s lyrics describe Drake as a “certified pedophile” and a “predator” who needs to be “placed on neighborhood watch.” UMGfiled a motion to dismiss the lawsuit last month,arguing the claims are “no more than Drake’s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle” with Lamar. In the amended complaint, filed Wednesday in federal court in New York City, Drake’s lawyers claim that the Super Bowl and the Grammys were “prestigious and high-exposure events” that “introduced new listeners” to the allegedly defamatory song. “Not only did streams of the Recording increase significantly following these two mega-cultural events, but threats against Drake and his family did as well,” according to the amended lawsuit. Lamartook home five Grammy awards in Februaryand went on to headline the halftime show a week later. He omitted the word “pedophile” during his performance,which averaged 133.5 million viewers, according to The Associated Press. Drake’s complaint says the lawsuit is “not about” Lamar but rather that it is aimed at “the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.” Representatives for Lamar, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Drake’s lawyers argue that by continuing to promote “Not Like Us,” UMG \"intentionally sought to turn Drake into a pariah, a target for harassment, or worse.” The complaint alleges several instances of assailants’ attempting to threaten Drake at his home last May in the days after the song was released, including one case of a gunman shooting and wounding his security guard. “Even though UMG enriched itself and its shareholders by exploiting Drake’s music for years, and knew that the salacious allegations against Drake were false, UMG chose corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists,” the complaint says, adding that the label “continued to fan the flames even after learning of the incitement to violence on May 7 and 8, along with the unrelenting vitriol towards Drake that has followed.” Drake’s attorneys claim that UMG leveraged its connections to platform Lamar’s diss track at one of the biggest cultural events of the year. “It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist,” the complaint says. The lawsuit also accuses UMG of conferring benefits and leveraging business relationships “to secure Grammy nominations (and eventually wins)” for “Not Like Us.” In a statement responding to the latest claims in the lawsuit, a spokesperson for UMG called it “frivolous and reckless.” “Drake, unquestionably one of the world’s most accomplished artists and with whom we’ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,” the statement said. “It is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue,” it added. “They are reputationally and financially costly to Drake and have no chance of success.” A federal judge this month denied UMG’s request to delay discovery in the case, thus allowing both parties to request sensitive documents that may be used as evidence. “With discovery now moving forward, Drake will expose the evidence of UMG’s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions,” Drake’s attorney Michael Gottlieb said in a statement. In response to the ruling, a spokesperson for UMG said: “Drake will personally be subject to discovery as well. As the old saying goes, ‘be careful what you wish for.’”",

    "title": "Democrats draw on renewed energy in the fight against Trump",
    "article_text": "In the red state of Montana on Wednesday,a crowd swelledfor two political stars of the left who vowed to “fight oligarchy” in President Donald Trump’s administration. That night, in a Midwestern swing district, a congresswoman saw her largest ever town hall crowd, with many wanting to know how Democrats were pushing back. And hours later, a Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to bring attention to a case at the center of the party’s arguments that Trump’s immigration policies have gone beyond existing law and court orders.

Yetamid the bursts of resistance is a steady flow of appeasement by some of the country’s most powerful institutions,such as major law firmsthat have struck deals with the White House — including five more last week — to collectively provide hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal work. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party regroups from 2024 and refocuses on next year’s midterm elections. But that could get complicated, as some of that angst is aimed at Democratic leaders. The shift comes as Democratic leaders have gotten a “massive earful” from their base over the last couple of months from those upset with a lack of resistance to the administration’s actions, said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of Indivisible, an organizing force on the left. “What we’re starting to see from some corners of higher education, of business, et cetera, is people recognizing that there’s not a path, short of complete and utter subjugation, that will satisfy this administration,” Greenberg said. “So you might as well find some ground you’re comfortable on and fight.” Rep. Nikki Budzinski, a Democrat in a district covering parts of central and southern Illinois, said her constituents, including the roughly 400 people who poured into a Wednesday-evening town hall, are also fearful of fluctuating tariffs and what’s ahead with Medicaid, Social Security and disability rights. In January, Budzinski said, “I heard from a lot of Democrats, ‘The news is just too hard to pay attention to, and I can’t turn it on.’ I think what I hear now is that people are paying attention, and they’re trying to figure out what best ways they can be involved.” “The uncertainty is really kind of the killer. Your tariff’s on one day, tariff’s off another. A Social Security office closed. Does that mean that there’s not going to be one in the county?” Budzinski added. Earlier this month, Americans flooded the streets of cities across the country as part ofhundreds of “Hands Off” protestsagainst the administration. Even former President Joe Biden, who has remained quiet in the face of repeated needlingby Trump,held his first post-presidentialpublic appearance Monday, warning of the administration’s approach to Social Security. Greenberg described a post-election disconnect betweenthe Democratic Party’s rank and file and its “elites,” who she said spent months second-guessing or sulking while law firms and universities yielded to Trump’s earlydemands. From her standpoint, the burst of energy was immediate after Trump’s election — and it’s steadily rising. “The upsurge in regular people organizing came in the vacuum of a lack of elite leadership from both the political class and from the kinds of institutions that you think of as upholding norms around liberal democracy,” she said. “Over the last couple of months, the breadth and the scope and the ferocity of the assault [from the Trump administration] has demonstrated to at least some of the folks in the elite circles that they actually have to push back.” Democrats see the rising energy to push back on Trump as a positive sign for the party heading into next year’s midterm elections, where they would need to net three seats to flip the House and four seats to flip the Senate. Small-dollar donations are ticking up, saidChris Korge, the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising chair. The most recently monthly campaign finance filings show the party pulling in more small dollars in January and February this year ($10.7 million) than during the same period in 2017 ($8 million) — just after Trump took office for his first term. “Democrats are starting to get a head of steam,”Korge said. “Donors, large donors are becoming less depressed about the past election and more enthused about where we go from here and what our prospects are.” Korge said Trump has not come through with the economic panacea he promised but instead has wrought “total chaos” on the markets, emboldening Democrats to feel they can win back the message on the economy after struggling on economic issues in the 2024 campaign. The party, having alreadypushed back billionaireElon Musk in a battle over a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat earlier this month, is eagerly looking forward to upcoming gubernatorial campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey this year, before the 2026 midterms. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene of Washington pointed torecent special elections, in which Democrats have improved on the party’s performance in November, as evidence that Democrats have the momentum. “We’ve seen in just a few months that the public has already turned on Republicans and their record of broken promises,” DelBene said. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., who is co-chairing the DCCC’s recruitment effort, told reporters at an event last week with the think tank Third Way that the committee has seen a “flood of enthusiasm” from potential candidates, including military veterans, former federal workers and small-business owners. Republicans say Democrats are overconfident. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP’s campaign arm focused on House races, recently said in a statement, “Voters aren’t buying it, and they know Democrats are too extreme, too unpopular, and totally out of touch.” At the very least, Democrats figure to head into 2026 with a growing bench of candidates. The organization Run for Something, which launched after Trump’s first election in 2016 and recruits candidates for state and local office, announced Wednesday that nearly 40,000 people had expressed interest in running for office since the November election. The group saw “major spikes” in interest after Trump’s inauguration, as the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency sought to slash the size of the federal government, and after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., voted to advance a GOP-led government funding measure. Schumer’s vote, which drew the ire of his fellow Democrats, underscored one potential complication of the burgeoning energy to take on Trump: Those feelings could also be directed at Democrats’ own leaders. Democratic voters have been itching for their party to fight Trump. AnNBC News pollconducted in March found nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters said they want Democrats in Congress to stick to their positions even if it leads to gridlock, and just one-third wanted their leaders to compromise with Trump — a complete reversal from Trump’s first term. David Hogg, a DNC vice chair, warned that energy will inevitably lead to primary challenges against sitting Democratic lawmakers, and some younger Democrats havealready launched campaigns against longtime incumbents. Hogg said he is looking to channel that angst by supporting challengers in deep-blue seats — instead of competitive districts that could decide the majority — as part of a new effort from his PAC, Leaders We Deserve. “With the approval rating we have right now, this is coming. It is going to happen,” Hogg said, referring to the Democratic Party’s low favorability ratings in recent polling. “The question is: Is it going to be productive or is it going to be total chaos that is very destructive? And I’m trying to make sure that this is done productively. And that we’re showing our base, too, that there is an effort to change and things are not staying the same, even if that does piss off some people in D.C.” Hogg said his group will target lawmakers who are “asleep at the wheel” and not sufficiently fighting Trump. He laid out examples of lawmakers who are successfully taking on Trump, in his view, noting New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Fighting the Oligarchy” rallies; Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen’strip to El Salvadorthis week to investigate what the Trump administration said in court was a mistaken deportation; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s record-breaking Senate speech; and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy’s online videos. But Hogg also plans to support Democratic nominees in competitive districts, and hepushed back on critics who say his effort would divert resources from those races, pointing to themillions of dollars that flowed to Ocasio-Cortez’s and Sanders’ campaignsas proof that the party’s base will support candidates who push back on Trump. “The things that Democrats are struggling with are not fundraising,” Hogg said. Asked if she was concerned about the efforts to challenge incumbents in primaries, DelBene said, “Democrats are united on taking back the majority in the House of Representatives, and that’s the top focus of the DCCC. And what I would tell anyone who wants to be helpful, to donate, is to focus on the races where we can take back the majority.”",

    "title": "The CPFB starts to lay off staff as the agency plans a shift in its focus",
    "article_text": "Laurel Wamsley Some employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were fired in the wake of a court ruling that cleared the way for layoffs. Here, CFPB union members and supporters rally outside CFPB's headquarters last month in Washington, D.C.Alex Wong/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption Employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have begun receiving layoff notices, the latest attempt by the Trump Administration to shrink the bureau and reduce the scope of its work. \"This RIF action is necessary to restructure the Bureau's operations to better reflect the agency's priorities and mission,\" read one of the notices seen by NPR, referring to reduction-in-force actions. ———————————————————————————————————————————————— Laurel Wamsley is covering what's happening at CFPB. If you have a tip, you can contact her securely on Signal at laurel.96. ———————————————————————————————————————————————— Staff members began receiving the reduction-in-force notices on Thursday afternoon. It was not immediately clear how many of the agency's employees were receiving the notices. The reduction in force notices come after arecent court rulingby a federal appeals panel cleared the way for the layoffs. The three-judge panel said the bureau's leaders can send a reduction in force notice to employees they have determined to be unnecessary to carry out CFPB's statutory duties. The panel otherwise left intact a separate federal judge's injunction that prevents the agency from being dismantled — including that its data cannot be deleted or destroyed, and that employees must be given workspace or the tools to work remotely. The CFPB did not respond to NPR's questions about whether the layoffs had begun. The layoffs come after the agency's chief legal counsel sent a memo to CFPB employees on Wednesday evening that sets a new direction for the bureau. In the memo, which was viewed by NPR, chief legal officer Mark Paoletta said that the Bureau would lean on states to carry out more enforcement and supervision activities, arguing that doing so would allow the agency to \"to focus on tangible harms to consumers.\" Paoletta also said the bureau would shift its focus back to banks and depository institutions such as credit unions and commercial banks. He added the bureau would \"deprioritize\" a number of areas it has regulated in recent years, including medical debt, peer-to-peer platforms, and digital payments. The last item is notable as Elon Musk, who has tweeted \"CFPB RIP\", is building a digital payments platform –- a platform that would ostensibly be under CFPB's oversight. In February, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team entered the bureau's Washington headquarters andtook control of key systems. The CFPB, which was founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has become a target of the Trump administration as well as some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, who say it overreaches in its regulation. Consumer organizations criticized the bureau's reorientation as described in Paoletta's memo, saying it marked a significant retrenchment in its mission. \"The CFPB cannot simply shirk the consumer protection responsibilities Congress gave it and expect states to enforce federal law,\" said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.

It's part of a largerTrump administration pushto shrink not only the number of federal employees, but also theoffice spaceswhere they work. In announcing the plan, the agency said its 1968 building in Washington, D.C., currently faces over $500 million in deferred \"maintenance and modernization.\" It said current staff occupy only half the space and that relocating will \"reduce the burden on the American taxpayer.\" Have information you want to share about ongoing changes at HUD? NPR's Jennifer Ludden can be contacted through encrypted communications on Signal at jenniferludden.20. HUD Secretary Scott Turner has also called the massive, curvedBrutaliststructure \"the ugliest building in D.C.\" \"HUD's focus is on creating a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability, and purpose,\" Turner said in a statement. \"We're committed to rightsizing government operations … to deliver results for the American people.\" The agency did not say how much it's asking for the building. DOGE, the cost-cutting team overseen by billionaire Elon Musk, has targeted cutting HUD staff by half, according to an internal document seen by NPR. HUD headquarters, formally called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is now up for sale, although that could be complicated by its listing in theNational Register of Historic Places. The agency said a timeline and final location are not yet set, but that \"the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area remains a top priority.\" HUD headquarters is near a busy metro stop in downtown D.C. But this week, President Trump gave federal agenciesmore flexibility to locateoutside of city centers. He revoked two previous orders, by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, that had encouraged agencies to locate in business districts and historic properties. Trump's order said those past measures \"prevented agencies from relocating to lower-cost facilities,\" and that agencies \"must be where the people are.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump's Forest Service cuts have people in tinder dry New Mexico on edge",
    "article_text": "Kirk Siegler The Hermits Peak fire approaches Highway 434 at Christmas Tree Canyon in New Mexico in 2022Andy Lyon/Inciwebhide caption MCGAFFEY, N.M. - In the American West, where the federal government owns more than half the land, much of everyday life is tethered to the federal agencies that manage it. In the remote Zuni Mountains of northwestern New Mexico, Brian Leddy owns an historic cabin on land he leases from the U.S. Forest Service. There should still be snow and mud under the tall pines. Instead it's alarmingly dry. \"I think the fire season is on everyone's mind right now,\" Leddy says. \"I've had a heck of a time getting insurance on this place. I lost it and haven't been able to get it back this year. So it's a real concern for us.\" Adding to the anxiety, Leddy says, is a more man-made problem: the funding cuts to federal lands agencies by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, and namely the elimination of hundreds of Forest Service jobs, with reports that thousands more could follow. Brian Leddy says the wildfire threat and the uncertainty around staffing at the U.S. Forest Service is heightening anxieties in the high country of northwest New Mexico.Brian Leddy says the wildfire threat and the uncertainty around staffing at the U.S. Forest Service is heightening anxieties in the high country of northwest New MexicoKirk Siegler/NPRhide caption \"What's going to happen if a fire starts, who's going to respond to that? Right now it doesn't feel like there's a lot of confidence that the federal government is going to be able to act and respond accordingly,\" Leddy says. Leddy, who also heads a nonprofit that promotes the local outdoor recreation economy on public lands, says it appears the administration is trying to hobble federal lands agencies. For its part, Trump lands officials insist wildland firefighting positions continue to be exempt from the federal hiring freeze. The Forest Service declined an interview request but in an email said its operational readiness is \"not impacted.\" Forest workers say morale is low and everything is on pause But that's not the whole story. An untold number of probationary employees fired in February alone also carry \"red cards\" meaning, when there's a fire, they leave their regular jobs to help out. One of them in New Mexico is Kayla, whose full name NPR isn't using because she fears retaliation. A self described proud New Mexico native, she says working for the Forest Service was a dream job, especially after growing up in a local ranching culture that depends on the land. \"It was like a slap to the face, it's just shocking to me that our position could be taken away that easily without thorough investigation on exactly what we do and how we perform,\" she told NPR. Kayla has been rehired, for now, following a recent court ruling. But she says morale is down and the work that actually helps protect the land and wildlife from fires - the lesser publicized things like watershed and floodplain restoration and brush clearing - isn't getting done. \"It's a ticking time bomb. I feel like we were doing everything in our power to help prevent the catastrophic fires,\" she says. \"With the loss of so many positions, it's scary, it's just really scary.\" In interviews, several federal workers described a similar demoralizing environment to NPR, but most didn't want to go on the record. When the administration froze all federal funding for review last winter, they said, slash piles in forests went unburned and are now sitting there like matchbooks. Wildfire prevention grants with any connection to \"climate change\" or \"diversity\" - this isheavily Hispanic New Mexico- were scrapped, and elite firefighting teams are half their normal staffing or worse. Locals say the U.S. government doesn't have their backs at a perilous time Meanwhile, President Trump has alsoorderedthe Forest Service to boost logging by 25% as a strategy to address the fire crisis. But in New Mexico and across the West, NGOs that the agency contracts out to do forest health and wildfire mitigation such as thinning have seen some of their federal funding frozen or cut, meaning critical on the ground projects are on hold or stalled indefinitely because there's no money to pay workers. \"If you have turmoil in your nine to five work environment, you're not going to be able to show up at the incidents, at the prescribed burns, to run all the timber sales or fuels management projects,\" says Eytan Krasilovsky of the Forest Stewards Guild in Santa Fe. \"You know, that system needs to function.\" And with wildfires already burning in the Southwest, people feel like the system is not functioning. In Taos County, New Mexico, where the U.S. government owns and manages half the land, Commissioner AnJanette Brush says locals count on fully staffed federal lands agenciesKirk Siegler/NPRhide caption In Taos County, north of Santa Fe, County Commissioner AnJanette Brush says residents were already on edge after the deadly Los Angeles wildfires in January, and an extraordinarily dry winter locally. \"That's when we as elected officials really started to very much hear the panic,\" she says. \"People are very worried.\" About half of Taos County is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Local officials say they can't get answers on staffing levels at either of the agencies. \"There's nothing really super efficient about going through the process of firing, rehiring, firing, going to court,\" Brush says. Brush says her wildfire weary constituents deserve to know that the federal government has their backs and right now it doesn't feel like it. \"These folks are not you know, some faceless freeloaders, they are our family, our friends, our neighbors,\" she adds. \"They are good people who believe in the mission of protecting this place and we need them out there working hard for us.\" Some rural westerners support trimming federal land agencies But just like everywhere else in the rural West, even in Democratic-leaning New Mexico, there arelong standing tensionsagainst federal land agencies. A century ago, the Hispanos living on ancient land grants from the Spanish in northern New Mexico resisted the then-new Forest Service' restrictions on grazing, irrigation and other land uses. More recently, in 2022, the agency lit prescribed burns that got out of control and turned into the largest wildfire in New Mexico history. The fallout from the Hermit's Peak Calf Canyon fire persists today as scores of survivors say the federal government still hasn't made them whole. And complaints about red tape delaying or scuttling projects on public land tend to cross political lines. Back in the Zuni Mountains, Bill Siebersma has worked with the Cibola National Forest for the better part of the last two decades building and expanding mountain bike trails which have helped draw tourists to the isolated region. \"Over the years it's gotten more bureaucratized, maybe you'd say,\" Siebersma says. Siebersma, who's father, a pastor, first brought his family to the area fifty years ago, also has a popular bipartisan bumper sticker on his jeep: Public Lands Owner. He generally supports the administration and DOGE because he thinks there is fraud to be rooted out and plenty of fat to trim. \"You know the further you go up the ladder the more bureaucrats there are and people who sit in an office and push paper,\" Siebersma says. \"I don't know what they do.\" More immediately though, New Mexicans are waiting to see how true the Forest Service's promises are that it's ready for what could be a long fire season. This is the latest report in an occasional NPR National Desk series examining how President Trump's early actions are playing out across America. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "How tariffs could impact the availability of baby products",
    "article_text": "By Mary Louise Kelly , Brianna Scott , Courtney Dorning Munchkin CEO Steve Dunn says tariffs will impact the availability of baby products.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption If you have – or have had – small children, chances are, you're familiar with Munchkin products. The company manufactures everything from sippy cups to bath toys, breast pumps to baby gates. Munchkin founder and CEO Steve Dunn recently wrote an open letter to President Trump and members of Congress about the harm new tariffs are doing to his business. \"These tariffs are having devastating real-life consequences,\" he wrote. \"These new tariffs are forcing us to halt orders, cut jobs and may soon prevent us from delivering essential baby products to parents nationwide.\" He went on to say that \"due to the complete absence of necessary tooling and manufacturing expertise, automation, and skilled labor,\" Munchkin has been unable to bring production to the U.S. Dunn spoke withAll Things Consideredhost Mary Louise Kelly about why he wrote the letter, and the impact the tariffs on goods from China could have on his company. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly:Briefly outline for me why tariffs pose such a threat to your company. Steve Dunn:Well, when the initial tariffs were implemented, most of the companies within the juvenile industry tried to absorb them. Now that the tariffs have increased to 145 percent, our industry and a lot of small businesses have just stopped ordering. And consumers – parents – will not find important juvenile products on the shelves. Kelly:I'm just trying to get a picture in my head of what you're talking about. You're talking about products like strollers, products like baby gates, and you're saying you cannot keep making them if the current situation persists. Dunn:Mary Louise, our whole industry has stopped ordering products from China due to the 145 percent tariffs. These are tariffs that just can't be passed on to two parents. You know, our birth rates are at the lowest levels in the last 40 years and making it more difficult and more expensive to be parents is going to even [exacerbate] that issue now. Kelly:Stay with that point for a second, because in this open letter you write, and I'm quoting, \"if action is not taken soon, the damage will be irreversible, not only for our company, our employees, but countless businesses, workers and families across America.\" What is the damage you see being done to American families? Dunn:The products they rely on – Munchkin operates in about 12 different categories of things from bottle brushes to bottles to a new product we launched that helps moms meet their breastfeeding goals. These products will not be on the shelves because our industry and millions of small businesses have simply stopped ordering. We will run out of inventory in the next 60 days, 90s days. And if we don't place orders now, any order we place now will take 45 days to get here. So we're at a critical path where Munchkin owns thousands of tools in China. I can't even move my tools to the U.S. So moving and trying to relocate businesses like the juvenile industry or the maternal health industry into the U.S. would take years and years. It would take government-supported programs to create manufacturing zones. Just to manufacture our sippy cups would take 100 molding machines in the U.S. – if we could find them. Kelly:If President Trump were on the line with us now, he might be arguing, \"hey, tariffs are going to bring manufacturing back to the United States. This is good for America. This is good for American workers.\" What do you say to that? Dunn:I would say I wholeheartedly support the intent of onshoring strategic industries like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and aerospace. But with respect to the juvenile industry and products that parents need everyday, we don't have $100 billion sitting in the bank. We have no ability and there is not this manufacturing base that is suddenly going to appear in the U.S. that can mold thousands and thousands of low-margin products. We don't have the automation. We don't have the skilled labor. So our industry is going to have layoffs. Our company has had a hiring freeze. We're not innovating. We can't find countries that don't have tariffs right now that make these products affordable for America, for the American public. Kelly:Are you in conversation with other small, medium- sized business owners about a path forward? Dunn:Yes, we're part of the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association. I've talked with their general counsel. They're also petitioning the administration to look at an exemption or a carve-out for the juvenile industry due to the importance of supporting parents. In talking with other CEO leaders, everyone that I've talked to has stopped 100 percent of their orders coming in from China. That 145 percent on products will just be too expensive, and the consumers will not be able to pay for them. This story was adapted for the web by Mallory Yu. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. By Eleanor Beardsley , Joanna Kakissis French President Emmanuel Macron (left) shakes hands with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio next to special envoy Steve Witkoff (center) and France's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, before a meeting at the Élysée presidential palace in Paris on Thursday.Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption PARIS and KYIV — French President Emmanuel Macron hosted top diplomats from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ukraine on Thursday to discuss efforts toward a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and try to salvage a fraying alliance between Europe and the Trump administration. \"Everyone wants to get peace. A robust and sustainable peace,\" Macron said while meeting the U.S. delegation at Élysée Palace. \"The question is about phasing.\" The U.S. delegation included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg. \"Very productive meetings at Elysee Palace on efforts to end the Ukraine-Russia war,\" Kelloggwrote on the social media platform X,along with a photograph of himself with Ukraine's representatives. The State Department said Rubio later spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and said the administration has \"now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace.\" Witkoff has had multiple meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, includinglast week in St. Petersburg, Russia. Ukraine has been pushing the U.S. to take a tougher stance on Russia, whose full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022 and continues to claim lives. Speaking to journalists in Kyiv Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Witkoff \"has adopted Russia's strategy.\" Ukrainians have criticized Witkoff for statementsmade to Fox Newsthat a potential peace deal could center on the status of five Ukrainian territories. The Kremlin illegally annexed the southern region of Crimea in 2014 and, since its full-scale invasion, has partially occupied the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. \"It's very dangerous because he's consciously or unconsciously spreading Russian narratives,\" Zelenskyy said. \"And he does not have the mandate to discuss Ukrainian territories, because our territory belongs to our people.\" Asked about President Trump's statement calling Russia's deadly Palm Sunday strike on the northeastern of Sumy \"a mistake,\" Zelenskyy declined to criticize Trump and pointed out that Rubio had condemned the strike. Ukraine's president did add that European leaders were far more forceful in their condemnation, slamming Russia for a strike that killed 35 civilians and injured 100. \"I think the [Trump] administration's soft response reflects the continuation of their current policy,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I believe they think that this kind of diplomacy, this format, will help bring the war to an end.\" Trump has long said that he wants to end the war quickly. He says he is frustrated with both Kyiv and Moscow, even as his administration appears to have embraced Moscow's account of the war. Macron called Zelenskyy before and after Thursday's meetings. More meetings are planned in London next week. Eleanor Beardsley reported from Paris and Joanna Kakissis from Kyiv. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Ximena Bustillo Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, speaks to the media before she enters federal court on April 15, 2025 in Greenbelt, Md.Tasos Katopodis/Getty Imageshide caption A federal court on Thursday denied the Trump administration's effort to appealan order mandatingthat government officials be deposed about the accidental deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. \"It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all,\" a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitwrote. \"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador due to an administrative error and is being held at a notorious mega-prison, according to the Trump administration. His lawyers have sued the government to return him to the United States. The Fourth Circuit ruling against the Trump administration came just one day after the government filed an appeal of a lower court order, a remarkably short time for a court to reach a ruling. It comes as Abrego Garcia's case has become another test of how far the White House is seeking to push the bounds of law through its immigration policy. The government's unwillingness to bring Abrego Garcia back \"should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,\" the judges wrote. The U.S. government has accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump administration has since designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Abrego Garcia's lawyers dispute that he is a member of the gang, and say he doesn't have a criminal record. Maryland Judge Paula Xinis had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release and return, an order unanimously upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. At a hearing earlier this week, Judge Xinis said that the Justice Department lawyers, which are representing the government, have provided little information of value about their efforts to bring him back. She ordered the government to go through expedited discovery, during which Abrego Garcia's lawyers can question officials and request documentation about what they are doing — or not — to bring Abrego Garcia back. The White House has argued that it's up to El Salvador to decide to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The Trump administration on Wednesday appealed Xinis's order of expedited discovery. In the appeal, the DOJ argued that the Maryland court is inserting \"itself into the foreign policy of the United States and has tried to dictate it from the bench,\" and said the depositions of government officials are \"untenable.\" But the appellate court slapped down that notion, calling the relief the DOJ requested \"extraordinary and premature.\" They said that if the government conceded that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported, \"Why then should it not make what was wrong, right?\" \"It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,\" the judges wrote. \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\" The DOJ could appeal the Fourth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court. In response to a request for comment on the appellate order, the Justice Department shared prior coverage of Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi on Wednesdaytold reportersthat it's up to El Salvador to bring Abrego Garcia back, and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not have the power to return him. \"He is not coming back to our country,\" Bondi said. Meanwhile, agency officials at the Homeland Security and State departments must abide by Xinis's order, which requires them to be questioned under oath about the steps taken and challenges faced in order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. Xinis said this would clarify what, if anything, has been done and if the government is acting in good faith. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Brain drain at Census Bureau has employees warning about the country's statistics",
    "article_text": "Hansi Lo Wang Staff departures and survey cuts at the U.S. Census Bureau, headquartered in Suitland, Md., are raising questions about whether the federal agency can continue producing reliable statistics for the country.Michael Zamora/NPRhide caption As federal agencies brace for the Trump administration'snext round of slashing the U.S. government, recent staff departures are already raising concerns about whether the Census Bureau can continue producing reliable statistics for the country. Like most other agencies, the bureau is under pressure from Trump officials to further shrink their workforce while keeping in place ahiring freeze. According to emails shared with NPR, agency staffers are facing a Thursday deadline for applications for early retirement and voluntary separation offers that may be followed by mass firings. But current and former employees warn that the bureau — which for years has been dealing with therestrictions of short-term fundingand staffing challenges — is under unique strain. The federal government's largest statistical agency is well into preparations for the 2030 national head count of U.S. residents, which is set to be used to determine how federal funding is allocated to local communities and how presidents, members of Congress and other levels of government are elected. The bureau also carries out the surveys that produce the monthly jobs report and other key data sets. Outside the bureau, census advocates are concerned that reports of the DOGE team of Elon Musk, President Trump's billionaire adviser,accessing sensitive data at other federal agencies, as well as a newagreement that gives immigration authoritiesaccess to tax information about some immigrants without legal status, could discourage more households from sharing their personal information for the bureau's surveys. \"I think the public needs to question whether the agency is going to be able to produce the information that it needs to on time with the same quality that we've grown accustomed to,\" says Amy O'Hara, a former bureau official who is now the executive director of the Federal Statistical Research Data Center at Georgetown University. Since the start of the second Trump administration, at least five division or office chiefs — including two who were part of 2030 census preparations — have left the bureau, which lists 43 chief positions on its public staff roster. Otherexecutive-level turnoveramong career civil servants is creating vacancies on the bureau'sData Stewardship Executive Policy Committee, a key internal decision-making body focused on protecting the confidentiality of the information collected from survey participants. Those committee vacancies are \"going to be to everyone's detriment in terms of the functioning of the agency and just getting work done,\" O'Hara says. Recent departures at lower ranks of the bureau are even more troubling, O'Hara adds, because \"if you have all of these different layers out the door, you're going to have a great decrease in productivity, which is, I guess, the opposite of what this [downsizing by the Trump administration] is intended to do.\" The bureau's public information office has not responded to NPR's requests for comment. According to emails shared with NPR, the early retirement and voluntary separation offers are supposed to \"avoid or lessen\" the impact of mass layoffs. Current employees are also grappling with the Trump administration attempting to end the bureau's telework and remote-work agreements for unionized workers, according to other emails obtained by NPR. These moves by Trump officials come as the bureau continues to face long-standing staffing challenges at its regional offices around the country. Areport last monthby the agency's internal watchdog, the Commerce Department inspector general's office, found the bureau has not been recruiting and retaining enough interviewers in recent years for three key surveys, including the Current Population Survey that produces the monthly job report, and lacks a plan for building up a field representative staff. \"It's a challenge being efficient because it feels like we're spending time in our meetings just discussing, 'What can we do to keep things afloat?' \" says a current employee at the bureau who NPR has agreed not to name because they fear retaliation at work. \"That's valuable time that could be spent on doing the real work that supports America's data.\" Many employees fear the ongoing brain drain at the bureau would be hard to reverse even if Trump lifts the hiring freeze and allows the bureau to find permanent replacements for departed staffers. \"Expertise doesn't grow on trees,\" the bureau employee says. \"These people who have been here for a long time understand nuances. They know how to assess risks. They know how to address problems before they happen.\" It's also not clear if all of the vacancies would be filled with career civil servants as the administration continuespushing to reclassify positionsso that it can put in place more political appointees. Amid staffing disruptions, the bureau has been making unexpected changes to its ongoing surveys and 2030 census planning. This week, less than two months after asking for public comment on its plans, the bureau announced the cancellation ofa 2026 surveythat classifies local governments after it said it determined there are \"reliable\" alternative ways of getting that information. With no public explanation, the bureau alsodelayed the March data collectionfor the Household Trends and Outlook Pulse Survey until May and postponed May's collection until a to-be-determined date. And the agency haspostponed the planned release datesfor 17 reports on 2020 census operational assessments, evaluations and experiments that are supposed to inform preparations for the 2030 count. While not directly related to the bureau's work, the Internal Revenue Service'sdata-sharing agreementwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as reports of DOGE team membersaccessing sensitive data at other federal agencies, could have long-term implications for the 2030 count, some census advocates warn. Underfederal law, the bureau cannot use census responses \"for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is supplied.\" But Jae June Lee, a fellow focused on census data quality at the National Conference on Citizenship, a civic engagement organization, says the bureau \"doesn't operate in a vacuum\" and its survey work is taking place in a climate of mistrust in how the federal government handles data. \"It's going to be hard to ask people to disaggregate agencies in their mind. They're going to perceive the government as a whole,\" Lee says. With participation in surveys long on the decline, the bureau's researchers have been working on ways to rely more on existing administrative records from government programs to help fill in gaps of information. But Lee says they may not ultimately help the bureau overcome growing reluctance in interacting with the U.S. government, especially among immigrants, people of color and other historically undercounted groups. \"The basic idea is that if surveys fail, we can fall back on the data that people already give us. But I think that overlooks something really basic,\" Lee adds. \"People participate in those public programs and services as well, and if people no longer trust those programs and services — whether it's the tax system, Medicaid or Medicare — they're not going to participate in those programs or they're going to provide less accurate information.\" As for the information the bureau already has on hand, a recent contract cut has added another complication. According to emails shared with NPR, the online training systems the bureau has relied on for its mandatorydata stewardship trainingare set to no longer be available to the agency.

    "title": "Resist, eggheads! Universities are not as weak as they have chosen to be.",
    "article_text": "Opinion: It's time for public resistance. The wholesale American cannibalism of one of its own crucial appendages—the world-famous university system—has begun in earnest. The campaign is predictably Trumpian, built on a flagrantly pretextual basis and executed with the sort of vicious but chaotic idiocy that has always been a hallmark of the authoritarian mind. At a moment when the administration is systematically waging war on diversity initiatives of every kind, it has simultaneously discovered that it isreallyconcerned about both \"viewpoint diversity\" and \"antisemitism\" on college campuses—and it is using the two issues as a club to beat on the US university system until it either dies or conforms to MAGA ideology. Reaching this conclusion does not require reading any tea leaves or consulting any oracles; one need only listen to people like Vice President JD Vance, who in 2021 gave a speech called \"The Universities are the Enemy\" to signal that, like every authoritarian revolutionary, he intended to go after the educated. \"If any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country,\" Vancesaid, \"and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.\" Or, as conservative activist Christopher Rufo put it in aNew York Times piece exploring the attack campaign, \"We want to set them back a generation or two.\" The goal is capitulation or destruction. And \"destruction\" is not a hyperbolic term; some Trump aides have, according to the same piece, \"spoken privately of toppling a high-profile university to signal their seriousness.\" Consider, in just a few months, how many battles have been launched: What's next? Project 2025lays it out for us, envisioning the federal government getting heavily involved in accreditation—thus giving the government another way to bully schools—and privatizing many student loans. Right-wing wonks have already begun topush for \"a never-ending compliance review\"of elite schools' admissions practices, one that would see the Harvard admissions office filled with federal monitors scrutinizing every single admissions decision. Trump has also called for\"patriotic education\" in K–12 schools; expect similar demands of universities, though probably under the rubrics of \"viewpoint discrimination\" and \"diversity.\" Universities may tell themselves that they would never comply with such demands, but a school without accreditation and without access to federal funds, international students, and student loan dollars could have trouble surviving for long. Some of the top leaders in academia are ringing the alarm bells. Princeton's president, Christopher Eisgruber, wrote apiece in The Atlanticwarning that the Trump administration has already become \"the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s. Every American should be concerned.\" Lee Bollinger, who served as president of both the University of Michigan and Columbia University, gave afiery interview to the Chronicle of Higher Educationin which he said, \"We’re in the midst of an authoritarian takeover of the US government… We cannot get ourselves to see how this is going to unfold in its most frightening versions. You neutralize the branches of government; you neutralize the media; you neutralize universities, and you’re on your way. We’re beginning to see the effects on universities. It’s very, very frightening.\" But for the most part, even though faculty members have complained andeven sued, administrators have stayed quiet. They are generally willing to fight for their cash in court—but not so much in the court of public opinion. The thinking is apparently that there is little to be gained by antagonizing a ruthless but also chaotic administration that just might flip the money spigot back on as quickly as it was shut off. (See also: tariff policy.) This academic silence also comes after many universities course-corrected following years of administrators weighing in on global and political events outside a school's basic mission. When that practice finally caused problems for institutions, as it did following the Gaza/Israel fighting, numerous schools adopted a posture of \"institutional neutrality\" and stopped offering statements except on core university concerns. This may be wise policy, but unfortunately, schools are clinging to it even though the current moment could not be more central to their mission. To critics, the public silence looks a lot like \"appeasement\"—a word used by our sister publicationThe New Yorkerto describe how \"universities have cut previously unthinkable 'deals' with the Administration which threaten academic freedom.\" As one criticput it recently, \"still there is no sign of organized resistance on the part of universities. There is not even a joint statement in defense of academic freedom or an assertion of universities’ value to society.\" Even Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University,has saidthat universities' current \"infatuation with institutional neutrality is just making cowardice into a policy.\" Appeasing narcissistic strongmen bent on \"dominance\" is a fool's errand, as is entering a purely defensive crouch. Weakness in such moments is only an invitation to the strongman todominate you further. You aren't going to outlast your opponent when the intended goal appears to be not momentary \"wins\" but the weakening of all cultural forces that might resist the strongman. (See also: Trump's brazen attacks on major law firms and the courts.) As anAtlantic articleput it recently, \"Since taking office, the Trump administration has been working to dismantle the global order and the nation’s core institutions, including its cultural ones, to strip them of their power. The future of the nation’s universities is very much at stake. This is not a challenge that can be met with purely defensive tactics.\" The temperamental caution of university administrators means that some can be poor public advocates for their universities in an age of anger and distrust, and they may have trouble finding a clear voice to speak with when they come under thundering public attacks from a government they are more used to thinking of as a funding source. But the moment demands nothing less. This is not a breeze; this is the whirlwind. And it will leave a state-dependent, nationalist university system in its wake unless academia arises, feels its own power, and non-violentlyresists. Finally, on April 14, something happened: Harvard decided to resist in far more public fashion. The Trump administration haddemanded, as a condition of receiving $9 billion in grants over multiple years, that Harvard reduce the power of student and faculty leaders, vet every academic department for undefined \"viewpoint diversity,\" run plagiarism checks on all faculty, share hiring information with the administration, shut down any program related to diversity or inclusion, and audit particular departments for antisemitism, including the Divinity School. (Numerous Jewish groups want nothing to do with the campaign,writing in an open letterthat \"our safety as Jews has always been tied to the rule of law, to the safety of others, to the strength of civil society, and to the protection of rights and liberties for all.\") If you think this sounds a lot like government control, giving the Trump administration the power to dictate hiring and teaching practices, you're not alone; Harvard president Alan Garber rejected the demands in aletter, saying, \"The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.\" The Trump administration immediately responded by cutting billions in Harvard funding, threatening the university's tax-exempt status, and claiming it mightblock international students from attending Harvard. Perhaps Harvard's example will provide cover for other universities to make hard choices. And thesearehard choices. But Columbia and Harvard have already shown that the only way you have a chance at getting the money back is to sell whatever soul your institution has left. Given that, why not fight? If you have to suffer, suffer for your deepest values. \"Resistance\" does not mean a refusal to change, a digging in, a doubling down. No matter what part of the political spectrum you inhabit, universities—like most human institutions—are \"target-rich environments\" for complaints. To see this, one has only to read about recent battles over affirmative action, the Western canon, \"legacy\" admissions, the rise and fall of \"theory\" in the humanities, Gaza/Palestine protests, the \"Varsity Blues\" scandal, critiques of \"meritocracy,\" mandatory faculty \"diversity statements,\" the staggering rise in tuition costs over the last few decades, student deplatforming of invited speakers, or the fact that so many students from elite institutions cannot imagine a higher calling than management consulting. Even top university officialsacknowledge there are problems. Famed Swiss theologian Karl Barth lost his professorship and was forced to leave Germany in 1935 because he would not bend the knee to Adolf Hitler. He knew something about standing up for one's academic and spiritual values—and about the importance of not letting any approach to the world ossify into a reactionary, bureaucratic conservatism that punishes all attempts at change or dissent. The struggle for knowledge, truth, and justice requires forward movement even as the world changes, as ideas and policies are tested, and as cultures develop. Barth's phrase for this was \"Ecclesia semper reformanda est\"—the church must always be reformed—and it applies just as well to the universities where he spent much of his career. As universities today face their own watershed moment of resistance, they must still find ways to remain intellectually curious and open to the world. They must continue to change, always imperfectly but without fear. It is important that their resistance not be partisan. Universities can only benefit from broad-based social support, and the idea that they are fighting \"against conservatives\" or \"for Democrats\" will be deeply unhelpful. (Just as it would be if universities capitulated to government oversight of their faculty hires or gave in to \"patriotic education.\") This is difficult when one is under attack, as the natural reaction is to defend what currently exists. But the assault on the universities is about deeper issues than admissions policies or the role of elite institutions in American life. It is about the rule of law, freedom of speech, scientific research, and the very independence of the university—things that should be able to attract broad social and judicial support if schools do not retreat into ideology. Ars Technica was founded by grad students and began with a \"faculty model\" drawn from universities: find subject matter experts and turn them loose to find interesting stories in their domains of expertise, with minimal oversight and no constant meetings. From Minnesota Bible colleges to the halls of Harvard, from philosophy majors to chemistry PhDs, from undergrads to post-docs, Ars has employed people from a wide range of schools and disciplines. We've been shaped by the university system, and we cover it regularly as a source of scientific research and computer science breakthroughs. While we differ in many ways, we recognize the value of a strong, independent, mission-focused university system that, despite current flaws, remains one of America's storied achievements. And we hope that universities can collectively find the strength to defend themselves, just as we in the media must learn to do. The assault on universities and on the knowledge they produce has been disorienting in its swiftness, animus, and savagery. But universities are not starfish, flopping about helplessly on a beach while a cruel child slices off their arms one by one. They can do far more than hope to survive another day, regrowing missing limbs in some remote future. They have real power, here and now. But they need to move quickly, they need to move in solidarity, and they need to use the resources that they have, collectively, assembled. Because, if they aren't going to use those resources when theirvery mission comes under assault, what was the point of gathering them in the first place? Here are a few of those resources. Cash is not always the most important force in human affairs, but it doesn't hurt to have a pile of it when facing off against a feral US government. When the government threatened Harvard with multiyear cuts of $9 billion, for instance, it was certainly easier for the university to resist while sitting on a staggering$53 billion endowment. In 2024, the National Association of College and University Business Officers reported that higher ed institutions in the US collectivelyhave over $800 billion in endowment money. It's true that many endowment funds are donor-restricted and often invested in non-liquid assets, making them unavailable for immediate use or to bail out university programs whose funding has been cut. But it's also true that $800 billion is alotof money—it'smore than the individual GDP of all but two dozen countries. No trustee of this sort of legacy wants to squander an institution's future by spending money recklessly, but what point is there in having a massive endowment if it requires your school to become some sort of state-approved adjunct? Besides, one might choose not to spend that money now only to find that it is soon requisitioned regardless. People in Trump's orbit have talked for years about placing big new taxes on endowment revenue as a way of bringing universities to heel. Trump himself recently wrote on social media that Harvard \"perhaps\" should \"lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \"Sickness?\" Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\" So spend wisely, but do spend. This is the kind of moment such resources were accumulated to weather. Fifteen million students arecurrently enrolledin higher education across the country. Thetotal US populationis 341 million people. That means students comprise over 4 percent of the total population; when you add in faculty and staff, higher education's total share of the population is even greater. So what? Political science research over the last three decades looked at nonviolent protest movements and found that theyneed only 3.5 percent of the populationto actively participate. Most movements that hit that threshold succeed, even in authoritarian states. Higher ed alone has those kinds of numbers. Students are not a monolith, of course, and many would not participate—nor should universities look at their students merely as potential protesters who might serve university interests. But students have been well-known for a willingness to protest, and one of the odd features of the current moment has been that so many students protested the Gaza/Israel conflict even though so few have protested the current government assault on the very schools where they have chosen to spend their time and money. It is hard to say whether both schools and their students are burned out from recent, bruising protests, or whether the will to resist remains. But if it does, the government assault on higher education could provoke an interesting realignment of forces: students, faculty, and administrators workingtogetherfor once in resistance and protest, upending the normal dynamics of campus movements. And the numbers exist to make a real national difference if higher ed can rally its own full range of resources. Depending onhow you count, the US has around 4,000 colleges and universities. The sheer number and diversity of these institutions is a strength—but only if they can do a better job working together on communications, lobbying, and legal defenses. Schools are being attacked individually, through targeted threats rather than broad laws targeting all higher education. And because schools are in many ways competitors rather than collaborators, it can be difficult to think in terms of sharing resources or speaking with one voice. But joint action will be essential, given that many smaller schools are already under economic pressure and will have a hard time resisting government demands, losing their nonprofit status, or finding their students blocked from the country or cut off from loan money. Plenty oftrade associationsand professional societies exist within the world of higher education, of course, but they are often dedicated to specific tasks and lack the public standing and authority to make powerful public statements. The old stereotype of the out-of-touch, tweed-wearing egghead, spending their life lecturing on the lesser plays of Ben Jonson, is itself out of touch. The modern university is stuffed with lawyers, data scientists, computer scientists, cryptographers, marketing researchers, writers, media professionals, and tech policy mavens. They are a serious asset, though universities sometimes leave faculty members to operate so autonomously that group action is difficult or, at least, institutionally unusual. At a time of crisis, that may need to change. Faculty are an incredible resource because of what they know, of course. Historians and political scientists can offer context and theory for understanding populist movements and authoritarian regimes. Those specializing in dialogue across difference, or in truth and reconciliation movements, or in peace and conflict studies, can offer larger visions for how even deep social conflicts might be transcended. Communications professors can help universities think more carefully about articulating what they do in the public marketplace of ideas. And when you are on the receiving end of vindictive and pretextual legal activity, it doesn’t hurt to have a law school stuffed with top legal minds. But faculty power extends beyond facts. Relationships with students, across many years, are a hallmark of the best faculty members. When generations of those students have spread out into government, law, and business, they make a formidable network. Universities that realize the need to fight back already know this. Ed Martin, the interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia, attacked Georgetown in February and asked if it had “eliminated all DEI from your school and its curriculum?” He ended his“clarification” letterby claiming that “no applicant for our fellows program, our summer internship, or employment in our office who is a student or affiliated with a law school or university that continues to teach and utilize DEI will be considered.” When Georgetown Dean Bill Treanorreplied to Martin, he did not back down, noting Martin's threat to \"deny our students and graduates government employment opportunities until you, as Interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, approve of our curriculum.\" (Martin himself had managed to omit the \"interim\" part of his title.) Such a threat would violate \"the First Amendment’s protection of a university’s freedom to determine its own curriculum and how to deliver it.\" There was no \"negotiating\" here, no attempt to placate a bully. Treanor barely addressed Martin's questions. Instead, he politely but firmly noted that the inquiry itself was illegitimate, even under recent Supreme Court jurisprudent and Trump Department of Education policy. And he tied everything in his response to the university's mission as a Jesuit school committed to \"intellectual, ethical, and spiritual understanding.\" The letter's final paragraph, in which Treanor told Martin that he expected him to back down from his threats, opened with a discussion of Georgetown's faculty. Georgetown Law has one of the preeminent faculties in the country, fostering groundbreaking scholarship, educating students in a wide variety of perspectives, and thriving on the robust exchange of ideas. Georgetown Law faculty have educated world leaders, members of Congress, and Justice Department officials, from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Implicit in these remarks are two reminders: The letter serves as a good reminder: Resist with firmness and rely on your faculty. Incentivize their work, providing the time and resources to write more popular-level distillations of their research or to educate alumni groups about the threats campuses are facing. Get them into the media and onto lecture hall stages. Tap their expertise for internal working groups. Don't give in to the caricatures but present a better vision of how faculty contribute to students, to research, and to society. Universities collectively possess a real estate portfolio of land and buildings—including lecture halls, stages, dining facilities, stadiums, and dormitories—that would make even a developer like Donald Trump salivate. It's an incredible resource that is already well-used but might be put toward purposes that meet the moment even more clearly. Host more talks, not just on narrow specialty topics, but on the kinds of broad-based political debates that a healthy society needs. Make the universities essential places for debate, discussion, and civic organizing. Encourage more campus conferences in summer, with vastly reduced rates for groups that effectively aid civic engagement, depolarization, and dialogue across political differences. Provide the physical infrastructure forfruitfulcross-party political encounters and anti-authoritarian organizing. Use campuses to house regional and national hubs that develop best practices in messaging, legal tactics, local outreach, and community service from students, faculty, and administrators. Universities do these things, of course; many are filled with \"dialogue centers\" and civic engagement offices. But many of these resources exist primarily for students; to survive and thrive, universities will need to rebuild broader social confidence. The other main criticism is that they can be siloed off from the other doings of the university. If \"dialogue\" is taken care of at the \"dialogue center,\" then other departments and administrative units may not need to worry about it. But with something as broad and important as \"resistance,\" the work cannot be confined to particular units. With so many different resources, from university presses to libraries to lecture halls, academia can do a better job at making its campuses useful both to students and to the surrounding community—so long as the universities know their own missions and make sure their actions align with them. During times of external stress, universities need to operate more than ever out of their core, mission-driven values. While educating the whole person, mentally and physically, is a worthy goal, it is not one that requires universities to submit to aTwo Minutes Hatewhile simultaneously providing mass entertainment and betting material for the gambling-industrial complex. When up against a state that seeks \"leverage\" of every kind over the university sector, realize that academia itself controls some of the most popular sports competitions in America. That, too, is leverage, if one knows how to use it. Such leverage could, of course, be Trumpian in its own bluntness—no March Madness tournament, for instance, so long as thousands of researchers are losing their jobs and health care networks are decimated and the government is insisting on ideological control over hiring and department makeup. (That would certainly be interesting—though quite possibly counterproductive.) But universities might use their control of NCAA sporting events to better market themselves and their impact—and to highlight what's really happening to them. Instead, we continue to get the worst kinds of anodyne spots during football and basketball games: frisbee on the quad, inspiring shots of domes and flags, a professor lecturing in front of a chalkboard. Be creative! But do something. Saying and doingnothing—letting the games go on without comment as the boot heel comes down on the whole sector, is a complete abdication of mission and responsibility. The Trump administration seems to believe that it has the only thing people want: grant funding. It seems not even to care if broader science funding in the US simply evaporates, if labs close down, or if the US loses its world-beating research edge. But even if \"science\" is currently expendable, the US government itself relies heavily on university researchers to produce innovations required by the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. Cryptography, cybersecurity tools, the AI that could power battlefield drone swarms—much of it is produced by universities under contract with the feds. And there's no simple, short-term way for the government to replace this system. Even other countries believe that US universities do valuable cyber work for the federal government; Chinajust accused the University of California and Virginia Techof aiding in an alleged cyberattack by the NSA, for instance. That gives the larger universities—the one who often have these contracts—additional leverage. They should find a way to use it. Many of the larger universities run sprawling and sophisticated health networks that serve whole communities and regions; indeed, much of the $9 billion in federal money at issue in the Harvard case was going to Harvard's medical system of labs and hospitals. If it seems unthinkable to you that the US government would treat the health of its own people as collateral damage in a war to become the Thought Police, remember that this is the same administration that has alreadytried to stop funds to the state of Maine—funds used to \"feed children and disabled adults in schools and care settings across the state\"—just because Maine allowed a couple of transgender kids to play on sports teams. What does the one have to do with the other? Nothing—except that the money provides leverage. But health systems are not simply weapons for the Trump administration to use by refusing or delaying contracts, grants, and reimbursements. Health systems can improve people's lives in the most tangible of ways. And that means they ought to be shining examples of community support and backing, providing a perfect opportunity to highlight the many good things that universities do for society. Now, to the extent that these health care systems in the US have suffered from the general flaws of all US health care—lack of universal coverage leading to medical debt and the overuse of emergency rooms by the indigent, huge salaries commanded by doctors, etc.—the Trump war on these systems and on the universities behind them might provide a useful wake-up call from \"business as usual.\" Universities might use this time to double down on mission-driven values, using these incredible facilities even more to extend care, to lower barriers, and to promote truly public and community health. What better chance to show one's city, region, and state the value of a university than massively boosting free and easy access to mental and physical health resources? Science research can be esoteric; saving someone's body or mind is not. This moment calls out for moral clarity and resolve. It asks universities to take their mission in society seriously and to resist being co-opted by government forces. But it asks something of all of us, too. University leaders will make their choices, but to stand strong, they need the assistance of students, faculty, and alumni. In an age of polarization, parts of society have grown skeptical about the value of higher education. Some of these people are your friends, family, and neighbors. Universities must continue to make changes as they seek to build knowledge and justice and community, but those of us no longer within their halls and quads also have a part to play in sharing a more nuanced story about the value of the university system, both to our own lives and to the country. If we don't, our own degrees may be from institutions that have become almost unrecognizable. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Company apologizes after AI support agent invents policy that causes user uproar",
    "article_text": "Frustrated software developer believed AI-generated message came from human support rep. On Monday, a developer using the popular AI-powered code editorCursornoticed something strange: Switching between machines instantly logged them out, breaking a common workflow for programmers who use multiple devices. When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named \"Sam\" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented onHacker NewsandReddit. This marks the latest instance of AIconfabulations(also called \"hallucinations\") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of \"creative gap-filling\" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch. For companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions. The incident began when a Reddit user named BrokenToasterOvennoticedthat while swapping between a desktop, laptop, and a remote dev box, Cursor sessions were unexpectedly terminated. \"Logging into Cursor on one machine immediately invalidates the session on any other machine,\" BrokenToasterOven wrote in a message that waslater deletedby r/cursor moderators. \"This is a significant UX regression.\" Confused and frustrated, the user wrote an email to Cursor support and quickly received a reply from Sam: \"Cursor is designed to work with one device per subscription as a core security feature,\" read the email reply. The response sounded definitive and official, and the user did not suspect that Sam was not human. After the initial Reddit post, users took the post as official confirmation of an actual policy change—one that broke habits essential to many programmers' daily routines. \"Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs,\" wrote one user. Shortly afterward, several users publicly announced their subscription cancellations on Reddit, citing the non-existent policy as their reason. \"I literally just cancelled my sub,\" wrote the original Reddit poster, adding that their workplace was now \"purging it completely.\" Others joined in: \"Yep, I'm canceling as well, this is asinine.\" Soon after, moderators locked the Reddit thread and removed the original post. \"Hey! We have no such policy,\"wrotea Cursor representative in a Reddit reply three hours later. \"You're of course free to use Cursor on multiple machines. Unfortunately, this is an incorrect response from a front-line AI support bot.\" The Cursor debacle recalls asimilar episodefrom February 2024 when Air Canada was ordered to honor a refund policy invented by its own chatbot. In that incident, Jake Moffatt contacted Air Canada's support after his grandmother died, and the airline's AI agent incorrectly told him he could book a regular-priced flight and apply for bereavement rates retroactively. When Air Canada later denied his refund request, the company argued that \"the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions.\" A Canadian tribunal rejected this defense, ruling that companies are responsible for information provided by their AI tools. Rather than disputing responsibility as Air Canada had done, Cursor acknowledged the error and took steps to make amends. Cursor cofounder Michael Truell laterapologized on Hacker Newsfor the confusion about the non-existent policy, explaining that the user had been refunded and the issue resulted from a backend change meant to improve session security that unintentionally created session invalidation problems for some users. \"Any AI responses used for email support are now clearly labeled as such,\" he added. \"We use AI-assisted responses as the first filter for email support.\" Still, the incident raised lingering questions about disclosure among users, since many people who interacted with Sam apparently believed it was human. \"LLMs pretending to be people (you named it Sam!) and not labeled as such is clearly intended to be deceptive,\" one userwrote on Hacker News. While Cursor fixed the technical bug, the episode shows the risks of deploying AI models in customer-facing roles without proper safeguards and transparency. For a company selling AI productivity tools to developers, having its own AI support system invent a policy that alienated its core users represents a particularly awkward self-inflicted wound. \"There is a certain amount of irony that people try really hard to say that hallucinations are not a big problem anymore,\" one userwrote on Hacker News, \"and then a company that would benefit from that narrative gets directly hurt by it.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Kevin Hall claims an aide for Kennedy edited his written responses to a reporter. Kevin Hall, a prominent nutrition expert who led influential studies on ultra-processed foods, has resigned from his long-held position at the National Institutes of Health, alleging censorship of his research by top aides of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a post on LinkedIn, Hall claimed that he \"experienced censorship in the reporting of our research because of agency concerns that it did not appear to fully support preconceived narratives of my agency’s leadership about ultra-processed food addiction.\" In comments to CBS News, Hall said the censorship was over a study he and his colleagues recentlypublished in the journal Cell Metabolism, which showed that ultra-processed foods did not produce the same large dopamine responses in the brain that are seen with use of addictive drugs. The finding suggests that the mechanism leading people to overconsume ultra-processed foods may be more complex than the studied mechanisms in addiction. This appears to slightly conflict with the beliefs of Kennedy Jr., who has claimed thatfood companies use additives to make ultra-processed foods addictive. The study \"just suggests that they may not be addictive by the typical mechanism that many drugs are addictive,\" Hall told CBS. \"But even this bit of daylight between the preconceived narrative and our study was apparently too much,\" he said. Hall claims that because of this, aides for Kennedy blocked him from being directly interviewed by New York Times reporters about the study. Instead, Hall was allowed to provide only written responses to the newspaper. However, Hall claims that Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for Kennedy, then downplayed the study's results to the Times and edited Hall's written responses and sent them to the reporter without Hall's consent. Further, Hall claims he was barred from presenting his research on ultra-processed foods at a conference and was forced to either edit a manuscript he had worked on with outside researchers or remove himself as a co-author. An HHS spokesperson denied to CBS that Hall was censored or that his written responses to the Times were edited. \"Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts,\" a statement from the HHS said. In response, Hall wrote to CBS, \"I wonder how they define censorship?\" Hall said he had reached out to NIH leadership about his concerns in hopes it all was an \"aberration\" but never received a response. \"Without any reassurance there wouldn’t be continued censorship or meddling in our research, I felt compelled to accept early retirement to preserve health insurance for my family,\" he wrote in the LinkedIn post. \"Due to very tight deadlines to make this decision, I don’t yet have plans for my future career.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Mark Zuckerberg played up TikTok rivalry at monopoly trial, but judge may not buy it. TheMeta monopoly trialhas raised a question that Meta hopes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can't effectively answer: How important is it to use social media to connect with friends and family today? Connecting with friends was, of course, Facebook's primary use case as it became the rare social network to hit 1 billion users—not by being acquired by a Big Tech company but based on the strength of its clean interface and the network effects that kept users locked in simply because all the important people in their life chose to be there. According to the FTC, Meta took advantage of Facebook's early popularity, and it has since bought out rivals and otherwise cornered the market on personal social networks. Only Snapchat and MeWe (a privacy-focused Facebook alternative) are competitors to Meta platforms, the FTC argues, and social networks like TikTok or YouTube aren't interchangeable, because those aren't destinations focused on connecting friends and family. For Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, those early days of Facebook bringing old friends back together are apparently over. He took the stand this week to testify that the FTC's market definition ignores the reality that Meta contends with today, where \"the amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,\" CNNreported. \"Even the amount of new friends that people add … I think has been declining,\" Zuckerberg said, although he did not indicate how steep the decline is. \"I don’t know the exact numbers,\" Zuckerberg admitted. Meta's former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, also took the stand andreportedlytestified that while she was at Meta, \"friends and family sharing went way down over time . . . If you have a strategy of targeting friends and family, you'd have serious revenue issues.\" In particular, TikTok's explosive popularity has shifted the dynamics of social media today, Zuckerberg suggested. For many users, \"apps now serve primarily as discovery engines,\" Zuckerberg testified, and social interactions increasingly come from sharing fun creator content in private messages, rather than through engaging with a friend or family member's posts. That's why Meta added Reels, Zuckerberg testified, and, more recently, TikTok Shop-like functionality. To stay relevant, Meta had to make its platforms more like TikTok, investing heavily in its discovery algorithm, and even willing to irk loyal Instagram users by turning their perfectly curated square grids into rectangles, Wirednotedin a piece probing Meta's efforts to lure TikTok users to Instagram. There was seemingly no bridge too far, because Zuckerberg said, \"TikTok is still bigger than either Facebook or Instagram, and I don’t like it when our competitors do better than us.\" And since Meta has no interest in buying TikTok, due to fears of basing business in China, Big Tech on Trial reported, Meta's only choice was to TikTok-ify its apps to avoid a mass exodus afterFacebook users started declining for the first timein 2022. Committing to this future, the next year,Meta doubled the amount of force-fed filler in Instagram feeds. Right now, Meta is positioning TikTok as one of Meta's biggest competitors, with Meta supposedly flagging it a \"top priority\" and \"highly urgent\" competitive threat as early as 2018, Zuckerberg said. Further, Zuckerberg testified that while TikTok's popularity grew, Meta's \"growth slowed down dramatically,\" TechCrunchreported. And perhaps most persuasively, whenTikTok briefly went dark earlierthis year, some TikTokers moved to Instagram, Meta argued, suggesting that some users consider the platforms interchangeable. If Meta can convince the court that the FTC's market definition is wrong and that TikTok is Meta's biggest rival, then Meta's market share drops below monopolist standards, \"undercutting\" the FTC's case, Big Tech on Trialreported. Although Meta paints the picture that TikTok users naturally gravitated to Instagram during the TikTok outage, it's clear that Meta advertised heavily to move them in that direction. There was even a conspiracy theory that Meta had bought TikTok in the hours before TikTok went down, Wired reported, as users noticed Meta banners encouraging them to link their TikTok accounts to Meta platforms. However, even the reported Meta ad blitz seemingly didn't sway that many TikTok users, as Sensor Tower data at the time apparently indicated that \"Instagram and Facebook appeared to receive only a modest increase in daily active users and downloads\" during the TikTok outage, Wired reported. Perhaps a more interesting question that the court may entertain is not where TikTok users go when TikTok is down, but where Instagram or Facebook users turn if they no longer want to use those platforms. If the FTC can argue that people seeking a destination to connect with friends or family wouldn't substitute TikTok for that purpose, their market definition might fly. Kenneth Dintzer, a partner at Crowell & Moring and the former lead attorney in the DOJ's winning Google search monopoly case, told Ars that the chief judge in the case, James Boasberg, made clear at summary judgment that acknowledging Meta's rivalry with TikTok \"doesn't really answer the question about friends and family.\" So even though Zuckerberg was \"pretty persuasive,\" his testimony on TikTok may not move the judge much. However, there was one exchange at the trial where Boasberg asked, \"How much does it matter if friends are on a particular platform, if friends can share outside of it?\" Zuckerberg praised this as a \"good question\" and \"explained that it doesn’t matter much because people can fluidly share across platforms, using each one for its value as a 'discovery engine,'\" Big Tech on Trial reported. Dintzer noted that Zuckerberg seemed to attempt to float a different theory explaining why TikTok was a valid rival—curiously attempting to redefine \"social media\" to overcome the judge's skepticism in considering TikTok a true Meta rival. Zuckerberg's theory, Dintzer said, suggests that \"if I open up something on TikTok or on YouTube, and I send it to a friend, that is social media.\" But that broad definition could be problematic, since it would suggest that all texting and messaging are social media, Dintzer said. \"That didn't seem particularly persuasive,\" Dintzer said. Although that kind of social sharing is \"certainly something that people enjoy,\" it still \"doesn't seem to be quite the same thing as posting something on Facebook for your friends and family.\" Another wrinkle that may scramble Meta's defense is that Meta has publiclydeclaredthat its priority is to bring back \"OG Facebook\" and refresh how friends and family connect on its platforms. Just today, Instagram chief Adam Mosseriannounceda new Instagram feature called \"blend\" that strives to connect friends and family through sharing access to their unique discovery algorithms. Those initiatives seem like a strategy that fully relies on Meta's core use case of connecting friends and family (and network effects that Zuckerberg downplayed) to propel engagement that could spike revenue. However, that goal could invite scrutiny, perhaps signaling to the court that Meta still benefits from the alleged monopoly in personal social networking and will only continue locking in users seeking to connect with friends and family. \"The magic of friends has fallen away,\" Meta's blog said, which, despite seeming at odds, could serve as both a tagline for its new \"Friends\" tab on Facebook and the headline of its defense so far in the monopoly trial.

    "title": "HP agrees to $4M settlement over claims of “falsely advertising” PCs, keyboards",
    "article_text": "HP.com customers from June 2021 to October 2024 are eligible for compensation. HP Inc. has agreed to pay a $4 million settlement to customers after being accused of “false advertising” of computers and peripherals on its website. Earlier this month, Judge P. Casey Pitts for the US District Court of the San Jose Division of the Northern District of California granted preliminary approval [PDF] of a settlement agreement regarding a class-action complaint first filed against HP on October 13, 2021. The complaint accused HP's website of showing \"misleading\" original pricing for various computers, mice, and keyboards that was higher than how the products were recently and typically priced. Per the settlement agreement [PDF], HP will contribute $4 million to a \"non-reversionary common fund, which shall be used to pay the (i) Settlement Class members’ claims; (ii) court-approved Notice and Settlement Administration Costs; (iii) court-approved Settlement Class Representatives’ Service Award; and (iv) court-approved Settlement Class Counsel Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Award. All residual funds will be distributed pro rata to Settlement Class members who submitted valid claims and cashed checks.” The two plaintiffs who filed the initial complaint may also file a motion to receive a settlement class representative service award for up to $5,000 each, which would come out of the $4 million pool. People who purchased a discounted HP desktop, laptop, mouse, or keyboard that was on sale for “more than 75 percent of the time the products were offered for sale” from June 5, 2021, to October 28, 2024, are eligible for compensation. The full list of eligible products is availablehere [PDF]and includes HP Spectre, Chromebook Envy, and Pavilion laptops, HP Envy and Omen desktops, and some mechanical keyboards and wireless mice. Depending on the product, class members can receive $10 to $100 per eligible product purchased. An amended complaint filed on July 15, 2022[PDF]accused HP of breaking the Federal Trade Commission’s laws against deceptive pricing. Among the examples provided was Rodney Carvalho's experience buying an HP All-in-One 24-dp1056qe in September 2021. The complaint reported that HP.com advertised the AIO as being on sale for $899.99 and featured text saying “Save $100 instantly.” The AIO's listing reportedly had a strike-through price suggesting that the computer used to cost $999.99. But, per the complaint, \"in the weeks and months prior to Carvalho’s purchase, HP rarely, if ever, offered his computer for sale at the advertised strike-through price of $999.99.\" The filing claimed that the PC had been going for $899.99 since April 2021. The complaint added: By using misleading strike-through prices to artificially increase the perceived value of HP products, HP harms consumers by inducing them to pay more for its products and make purchases they would not have otherwise made. HP’s strike-through prices also harm competition by giving HP an unfair advantage over other computer manufacturers that do not engage in false reference pricing. Further, the class-action complaint accused HP’s website of “falsely” advertising limited-quantity and limited-time offers. \"For example, on May 28, 2021, HP featured Carvalho’s computer in the 'Weekly Deal' section of its website and advertised there was 'Only 1 Left!'” the complaint reads. \"Yet in the weeks and months that followed, HP continued to sell Carvalho’s computer but removed any representations about the supposed limited quantity HP isn’t admitting to any wrongdoing or liability, per the settlement. However, the use of exaggerated, if not outrightly misleading, reference pricing has become prevalent among online shopping in general and especially among electronics. A $4 million settlement doesn’t devastate a company of HP’s stature. For reference, in its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings report, HP Inc. posted a net revenue of $13.5 billion, up from $13.2 billion in Q1 2024. However, the settlement underscores growing frustration among tech shoppers relying on online portals for their purchases. Similarly to HP, a complaint was filed against Amazon in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington [PDF] in September, accusing the tech firm of listing Fire TVs andFire TV bundles with higher “List Prices”than what the gadgets had recently sold for. Beyond Fire TVs, the Amazon marketplace has a poor reputation for displaying accurate original pricing. Listings often show original pricing that is based on years-old figures. It’s also common to find products listed on Amazon with original pricing that only existed briefly (sometimes solely to claim that the product’s original price was that high) or that is reflective of a completely different product or aproduct that's similar but has different specs. Showing how widespread this problem is, in 2023,Dell was finedAU$10 million (about $6.49 million) for \"making false and misleading representations on its website about discount prices for add-on computer monitors.” Although there are tools, such as Camelcamelcamel, for tracking Amazon's prices, keeping track of direct manufacturer pricing can be more challenging. Ongoing pressure from frustrated customers and litigation could push tech sellers to be more up-front and accurate about their products’ previous pricing.

    "title": "Trump’s FCC chair threatens Comcast, demands changes to NBC news coverage",
    "article_text": "\"Comcast outlets spent days misleading the American public,\" Brendan Carr claims. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr accused Comcast of \"news distortion\" because its subsidiary NBC isn't parroting the Trump administration narrative on the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. \"Comcast knows that federal law requires its licensed operations to serve the public interest. News distortion doesn't cut it,\" Carr wrote in apost on Xyesterday. Carr's use of the phrase \"news distortion\" is significant because he has been invoking the FCC's rarely enforced news distortion policy to pressure licensed broadcasters that he perceives as being biased against President Trump. For a detailed look at Carr's fight against media, read our feature: \"The speech police: Chairman Brendan Carr and the FCC's news distortion policy.\" Carr, who recentlyworea pin depicting Trump's head on his lapel, provided no substantive argument that NBC is guilty of news distortion. Historically, the FCC has enforced the policy in only the most extreme cases where there is evidence of misconduct, such as a bribe, or instructions from management to distort the news. As a1985 rulingfrom the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said, the FCC policy makes \"a crucial distinction between deliberate distortion and mere inaccuracy or difference of opinion.\" In his post yesterday, Carr alleged that \"Comcast outlets spent days misleading the American public—implying that Abrego Garcia was merely a law abiding US citizen, just a regular 'Maryland man.'\" Carr wrote that \"Abrego Garcia came to America illegally from El Salvador, was validated as a member of the violent MS-13 gang—a transnational criminal organization—and was denied bond by an immigration court for failure to show he would not pose a danger to others.\" \"Why does Comcast ignore these facts of obvious public interest?\" Carr asked. Abrego Garcia's lawyer said in alawsuitthat he has no affiliation with MS-13. During a 2019 immigration court proceeding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \"offered a Gang Field Interview Sheet ('GFIS') generated by PGPD [Prince George County Police Department],\" the lawsuit said. \"The GFIS explained that the only reason to believe Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was a gang member was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique.\" The MS-13 Westerns clique is said to operate in New York, \"a state that Plaintiff Abrego Garcia has never lived in,\" the lawsuit said. The Gang Field Interview Sheet wasreportedlyfilled out by an officer who was later suspended andindictedfor providing confidential information to a sex worker. The Supreme Court last weekuphelda key portion of a District Court order on the deportation, saying that the lower court's \"order properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" Carr made his statement on X yesterday while sharing a post by White House Communications Director Steven Cheung, who said it's \"SHAMEFUL that CNN and MSNBC refuses to take Angel Mom Patty Morin as she recounts the terrible tragedy of how an illegal killed her sweet daughter, Rachel.\" Victor Martinez-Hernandez wasconvictedof killing Rachel Morin earlier this week. The White House has attempted tolink this murderto Abrego Garcia's deportation, but they are entirely separate cases. Carr's post yesterday, combined with his recent actions to enforce the news distortion policy, suggest that he is likely to open a proceeding if a formal complaint is lodged against any NBC stations. Carr showed he is willing to investigate news distortion complaints into ordinary editorial decisions when herevivedcomplaints against CBS and ABC that were thrown out under the previous administration. Carr has focused in particular on the CBS complaint, which concerns theediting of a CBS60 Minutesinterviewwith Kamala Harris. The conservative Center for American Rights alleged that CBS distorted the news by airing \"two completely different answers\" to the same question. CBSpublishedunedited video and a transcript that shows it simply aired two different sentences from the same response in different segments, but Carr has kept the proceeding open and seems to be using it as a bargaining chip in the FCC review of CBS-owner Paramount'stransfer of TV broadcast station licensesto Skydance. Carr's handling of the CBS complaint has been condemned by both liberal andconservative advocacy groups—and former Democratic and Republican FCCcommissioners and chairs—who say the FCC's approach is a threat to the constitutional right to free speech. Carr has also sent letters to companies—including Comcast—alleging that their diversity policies are \"invidious forms of discrimination in violation of FCC regulations and civil rights laws.\" Carr last monththreatenedto block mergers pursued by companies that enforce diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. We contacted Comcast and NBC today and will update this article if they provide any response to Carr's news distortion allegation.

    "title": "US Interior secretary orders offshore wind project shut down",
    "article_text": "Stoppage comes the same week a government report finds few problems with permitting. On Thursday, Norwegian company Equinor announced that it wassuspending the constructionof a planned 800 MW-capacity offshore wind farm currently being built in the waters off New York. The reason? An order from US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who alleged thatthe project was rushed through review. The move comes as the US's nascent offshore wind industry is facing uncertainty, with all future leasesplaced on holdby an executive order issued on the day of Trump's inauguration. The hold was ostensibly put in place to allow time to review the permitting process. But Burgum's move comes the same week a report from the Government Accountability Office, done in response to the executive order, found only minor issues with the existing permitting process. The Equnior project, termedEmpire Wind, is a key part of New York's plans to meet its climate goals. Combined with a second phase that's currently in planning, Empire Wind would have a rated capacity of two gigawatts, or over 20 percent of the state's planned offshore wind capacity. The initial construction, combined with the development of shore facilities, already has an estimated value of $2.5 billion, Equinor estimates, and is currently employing roughly 1,500 people. Construction was expected to be complete in 2027, although energy production from a subset of the 54 planned 15 MW turbines could have begun before then. Burgum's order was only made public via a post on X, which says that the hold will last \"until further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis.\" There is no indication of what that information is or how long the review is expected to last. It's notable that this hold comes despite Trump's executive order explicitly stating, \"Nothing in this withdrawal [of future leasing] affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas.\" The order alleged there were \"various alleged legal deficiencies underlying the Federal Government’s leasing and permitting of onshore and offshore wind projects, the consequences of which may lead to grave harm.\" In response to those allegations, the Government Accountability Office began an evaluation of the Department of the Interior's activities in overseeing offshore wind development. The results of that weremade public on Monday. And the report only found minor issues. Its primary recommendations are that Interior improve its consultations with leaders of tribal communities that may be impacted by wind development and boost \"incorporation of Indigenous knowledge.\" The GAO also thinks that Interior should improve its methods of getting input from the fishing industry. The report also acknowledges that there are uncertainties about everything from invasive species to the turbines' effect on navigational radar but says these will vary based on a wind farm's site, size, and other features, and we'll only have a clearer picture once we have built more of them. Notably, it says that wind farm development has had no effect on the local whale population, a popular Republican criticism of offshore wind. Trump's animosity toward wind power has a long history, so it's unlikely that this largely positive report will do much to get the hold on leasing lifted. In reality, however, the long-term uncertainty about offshore wind in the US will probably block new developments until the end of Trump's time in office. Offshore wind companies have budgeted based on tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, and the administration has suggested they may revoke those in future budgets. And the move by Burgum means that, even if a company clears all the leasing and improvement hurdles, the government may shut down a project for seemingly arbitrary reasons.

    "title": "Gemini 2.5 Flash comes to the Gemini app as Google seeks to improve “dynamic thinking”",
    "article_text": "Gemini 2.5 Flash is ready for you to try in the Gemini app, but it's starting as a preview. Google's Gemini AI may have had a slow start, but it has been anything but in 2025. Barely a week goes by that another model doesn't arrive in the Gemini app or developer tools like AI Studio, and there's a major release coming to the app today. Google has announced that its faster, more efficient Gemini 2.5 Flash model is rolling out widely in preview. At the same time, developers can begin building with 2.5 Flash using the company's newly announced API pricing, which Google says is much lower than competing products. The model dropdown in the Gemini app is a bit convoluted, particularly as we see products likeVeo 2andPersonalizationpopping up there. Google has been releasing so many preview models and new ways of using Gemini that it can be hard to know which option to choose for a given task. In fairness, Google is far from the only major AI player with this problem. Tulsee Doshi is Google's director of product management for Gemini, which means she leads the team building these models. We asked Doshi what version of Gemini she finds herself using, and unsurprisingly, she likes the more powerful option. \"Typically right now, I have been using 2.5 Pro,\" says Doshi. \"I use Gemini throughout the day for my work in a few key areas, like creating documents or slides. That's either for internal consumption or actually sharing externally, and I've found 2.5 Pro to be really helpful for the creative writing element.\" Credit:\n\n          \n          Google The new model is smaller thanGemini 2.5 Proand about the same size as 2.0 Flash, but it should perform better. Doshi calls it a \"strong step up from 2.0 Flash.\" Gemini 2.5 Flash won't add to the app confusion at least. This model will be listed as 2.5 Flash (Experimental) in the app and on the website, replacing the 2.0 Thinking (Experimental) option. The fact that the 2.0 thinking model never even made it out of the experimental stage is a testament to how quickly Google's Gemini team is moving these days. Unlike the 2.0 thinking model, the new 2.5 Flash will debut with support for Google's Canvas feature for working on text or code. Deep research support for this model will come later, according to a Google spokesperson. Gemini 2.5 Pro is still there and still in the experimental phase, leaving 2.0 Flash as the only non-experimental chatbot. That model doesn't include reasoning capabilities, though. Like all of Google's models in the 2.5 branch and beyond, Gemini 2.5 hassimulated reasoningbuilt in, which Google calls \"thinking.\" That means the model checks its facts as it goes, resulting in more accurate outputs. However, that also makes models slower and much more expensive. Since not all queries require that level of ongoing analysis, Google has equipped Flash with some tools that can help developers tune it for their use case. You may remember that Google began courting developers with Gemini 2.5 Flashearlier this month. While the model still isn't completely finished, Google has opted to make it fully available in Vertex AI and AI Studio withvariable API pricing. Gemini 2.5 Flash will allow developers to set a token limit for thinking or simply disable thinking altogether. Google has provided pricing per 1 million tokens at $0.15 for input, and output comes in two flavors. Without thinking, outputs are $0.60, but enabling thinking boosts it to $3.50. The thinking budget option will allow developers to fine-tune the model to do what they want for an amount of money they're willing to pay. According to Doshi, you can actually see the reasoning improvements in benchmarks as you add more token budget. Like 2.5 Pro, this model supportsDynamic Thinking, which can automatically adjust the amount of work that goes into generating an output based on the complexity of the input. The new Flash model goes further by allowing developers to control thinking. According to Doshi, Google is launching the model now to guide improvements in these dynamic features. \"Part of the reason we're putting the model out in preview is to get feedback from developers on where the model meets their expectations, where it under-thinks or over-thinks, so that we can continue to iterate on [dynamic thinking],\" says Doshi. Don't expect that kind of precise control for consumer Gemini products right now, though. Doshi notes that the main reason you'd want to toggle thinking or set a budget is to control costs and latency, which matters to developers. However, Google is hoping that what it learns from the preview phase will help it understand what users and developers expect from the model. \"Creating a simpler Gemini app experience for consumers while still offering flexibility is the goal,\" Doshi says. With the rapid cadence of releases, a final release for Gemini 2.5 doesn't seem that far off. Google still doesn't have any specifics to share on that front, but with the new developer options and availability in the Gemini app, Doshi tells us the team hopes to move the 2.5 family to general availability soon.

    "title": "Synology could bring “certified drive” requirements to more NAS devices",
    "article_text": "German press release suggests expansion of the company's \"integrated ecosystem.\" Synology, maker of network-attached storage (NAS) devices, will seemingly remove advanced features from its Plus devices that are not using hard drives provided by, or certified by, Synology itself, starting with its 2025 lineup. Areport on the German site HardwareLuxx(translated by Google) anda press releaseon Synology's German-language website appear to confirm Synology's strategy. The company, which sees \"significant benefits\" to its \"proprietary hard drive solution\" (also per Google's translation), will be \"expanding [its] integrated ecosystem to the Plus series.\" For thosePlus series modelsreleased in 2025, only Synology's own hard drives, and third-party drives certified by Synology, will offer \"the full range of functions and support.\" Synology's release states that it can provide the \"highest levels of security and performance, while also offering significantly more efficient support.\" Ars has contacted Synology's US offices for comment and will update this post with any response. There is some chance that this move could be restricted to Germany or just the EU. Maintaining region-specific firmware is possible, if not efficient. Synology has previously rolled out its certified drive requirements for higher-end machines globally. If you already have Plus-level or higher Synology hardware, this potential incoming change won't impact you, at least until your next upgrade. You can also take existing drives from a Synology setup and move them into a 2025 or newer Plus model and continue having full support. Synology had already implemented this requirement for its XS Plus and rack-mounted models, notionally obliging those owners to use Synology-approved drives. What you might lose from using non-Synology-approved hard drives could include pool creation and support for any issues. De-duplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic HDD firmware updates could also disappear on non-approved drives, Synology's press release suggests. Synology does not manufacture its own hard drives but insteadcertifies and rebrands drives from Toshiba and Seagate, leaving out only Western Digital among the world's largest manufacturers. Synology can update the firmware in its own rebranded drives when attached to NAS devices, whereas upgrading most other drives requires a connection to a PC running dedicated software. While non-certified drives will still work for basic storage purposes under the potential Synology shift, it is fair to assume that most people who are serious enough about their data so as to load it into a redundancy-minded NAS will want to know about drive health. Synology's messaging suggests that using its drives will provide a better, more secure, and more easily supported storage experience. Whether customers believe that adds value, at the cost of a severely limited marketplace for storage, remains to be seen. Synology's firmware, as of this writing, allows for a configuration file edit that can disable checks for certified drives. Whether that work-around survives into the future is unknown. Synology's telegraphed moves toward a contained ecosystem and seemingly vertical integration are certain to rankle some of its biggest fans, who likely enjoy doing their own system building, shopping, and assembly for the perfect amount of storage. \"Pro-sumers,\" homelab enthusiasts, and those with just a lot of stuff to store at home, or in a small business, previously had a good reason to buy one Synology device every so many years, then stick into them whatever drives they happened to have or acquired at their desired prices. Synology's stated needs for efficient support of drive arrays may be more defensible at the enterprise level, but as it gets closer to the home level, it suggests a different kind of optimization.

    "article_text": "It's really difficult to get a clear sign of life on an exoplanet. On Wednesday, news broke that researchers had found the most compelling evidence yet of a \"biosignature\"—a chemical present at levels that are only consistent with life—on a distant exoplanet. It didn't take much time for some less-than-reliable news sources to go from there totalk of a planetthat \"could be 'teeming with life'\" and theobvious follow-up, \"Scientists reveal what aliens could REALLY look like on exoplanet K2-18b.\" Even in the best of circumstances, however, talk of a biosignature is an invitation to scientists to think of alternative chemistries that could explain the results without needing biological activity. And these are not the best of circumstances, as astronomers are pointing to earlier papers that give a range of reasons to be skeptical of the new results; in fact, an astronomer namedChris Gleinemailed me to alert me of potential issues the day before the news broke. To help you understand the controversy, we're going to look at the data that is being presented as evidence of a biosignature and then go through all the reasons that confirming a biosignature is so difficult. The planet under discussion is called K2-18b, and it's what's termed a sub-Neptune. It has a radius of about 2.5 times that of Earth's and is 8.6 times more massive. Its orbit is also within the inner edge of its star's habitable range, meaning it receives enough radiation from its star that water could be liquid on its surface, depending on other factors like its atmosphere's composition. All of this can be determined based on its orbital properties and the amount of light that it blocks out as it passes between Earth and its host star. As the new paper acknowledges, these properties are consistent with a number of different planet types, including a small version of Neptune or a rocky planet with a very thick, hydrogen-rich atmosphere. But the researchers behind the new work favor what's called a hycean planet, a merger of hydrogen and ocean. That's because the initial characterization of its atmosphere suggested that, in addition to copious amounts of hydrogen, it had methane and carbon dioxide present but seemingly lacked ammonia and carbon monoxide. The presence of an ocean can account for those chemical properties. The new paper follows up on a tantalizing hint raised by earlier work: the possible presence of a chemical called dimethyl sulfide. It uses an instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to image K2-18b as it passes in front of its host star. A small portion of the light that reaches Earth does so after having passed through the planet's atmosphere, allowing the chemicals present there to leave a mark on the spectrum of that light. The research team used two different methods of constructing a spectrum from the JWST data, and the results are in good agreement. They then searched for a combination of molecules that could produce a similar spectrum, starting with a list of 20. They found two: dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide (we can't tell the difference between the two, given the existing data). On Earth, the only processes that naturally produce this chemical take place inside cells, and it had previously been suggested to be a biosignature. So, the researchers propose it may be a biosignature here, although they acknowledge that the statistical significance of its signal, currently at three sigma, falls short of declaring a clear discovery. Still, that would qualify it as, in the words of a University of Cambridgepress release, the \"strongest hints yet of biological activity.\" So why are many astronomers unconvinced? To be compelling, a biosignature from an exoplanet has to clear several hurdles that can be broken down into three key questions: At present, none of those questions can be answered with a definitive yes. The first question is whether we're actually looking at a hycean world. As the researchers acknowledge in their paper, the presence of an ocean on K2-18b depends very strongly on its weather: \"A cloud-/haze-free atmosphere would render the surface too hot to be habitable and/or have water in a supercritical state.\" And, as they later acknowledge, the data obtained from the JWST shows no signs of clouds. That doesn't mean they're not there, but it certainly doesn't help the case. And, in fact, a different research group hasalready found evidencethat the planet isn't reflecting enough light back into space to keep from boiling away any oceans it tries to form. That manuscript suggests that K2-18b is more likely to be a magma-ocean or gas-dwarf world. And a modeling paper suggests that most potential hycean worlds would suffer from arunaway greenhouse effectunless they receive significantly less illumination than Earth does. Then there'sa draft paperfrom Glein and his collaborators, which suggests you can get many of the same properties seen in K2-18b from a planet with a deep atmosphere sitting above a magma ocean. Combined, these raise significant questions about whether K2-18b is in fact a hycean world. And they indicate that, if it's not, it's likely to be far too hot to support life. Which brings us to whether the signal of a biosignature—the presence of these key wiggles in the JWST spectrum—is real. While the signal is there at three sigma, that's three sigma above a completely featureless spectrum. For its specific identity as dimethyl sulfide, we only know that it's the best fit out of the 20 chemicals considered in this paper. There are a whole host of other chemicals that could plausibly be produced on a planet like this that weren't included in this analysis. The potential presence of a dimethyl sulfide signal at other wavelengths in earlier work may seem to solidify this identification, but areanalysis of that datafound no evidence of a statistically significant signal. Finally, there's a potential problem that the authors of the new paper acknowledge: the spectral information they used comes from Earth. We only have data on dimethyl sulfide's absorption and emission at room temperature and one atmosphere, which is likely to be very different from the conditions it would see in the upper atmosphere of a mini-Neptune. While this wouldn't alter the existence of spectral lines, the differences could broaden them or accentuate their significance, altering how well they match the JWST data. The last issue is whether, if dimethyl sulfide is really present on K2-18b, it was produced by life as it is here on Earth. The answer appears to be \"possibly not\": A 2024 paper indicates it'spossible to produce the chemicalthrough light-activated reactions. The results suggest that these reactions may max out at lower concentrations of dimethyl sulfide than indicated by the data from K2-18b, but they're certainly a reason for pause and should motivate people to explore whether there are ways to boost the efficiency of the relevant chemical reactions. It should be clear that it's simply not possible to provide a definitive answer to any of the three key questions. So, while this might be, to use Cambridge's phrasing, the \"strongest hints yet,\" that doesn't make them especially strong. And, given the significance of the question they speak to—is there life beyond Earth—maybe the overall strength of the evidence was a far more relevant standard to use here. At least within the body of the press release, the scientists behind the work were appropriately cautious, saying things like \"It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results,\" and “Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings.\" In the end, the potential issues we've laid out above should make it clear that there will be no obvious before-and-after moment of discovery when it comes to finding hints of life over the next few decades. Any hint we get from telescope data will simply be the start of a conversation among astronomers, chemists, atmospheric scientists, and others meant to get definitive answers to all three of the key questions. It will only be after that conversation has settled on \"yes\" to all of them that we'll be able, in retrospect, to realize a discovery was made. Astrophysical Journal Letters, 2025.

    "title": "Chris Krebs, who debunked 2020 election lies, vows full-time fight against Trump",
    "article_text": "Trump administration is \"pulling its levers to punish dissent,\" Krebs said. Chris Krebs, the former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director who was fired by President Trump in 2020 and targeted in a Trump order last week, said he left his job at a security company in order to focus on fighting back against the Trump administration. Trump fired Krebsin November 2020 when the then-CISA chief disputed Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him. Krebs was until this week the chief intelligence and public policy officer for security vendor SentinelOne. Krebs and SentinelOne were both targeted by Trump in anApril 9 presidential memorandumtitled, \"Addressing Risks from Chris Krebs and Government Censorship.\" The Trump order called Krebs \"a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority\" and whose \"misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic.\" The Trump memo also said that \"Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.\" The memo directed US officials \"to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs\" and \"to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" Krebs yesterday posted anemailhe sent to the SentinelOne staff announcing his departure. The email said that after the Trump order, Krebs immediately reached out to SentinelOne CEO Tomer Weingarten. \"I told him what I firmly believe: this is my fight, not the company's, and I offered my resignation,\" Krebs wrote. \"For those who know me, you know I don't shy away from tough fights. But I also know this is one I need to take on fully—outside of SentinelOne. This will require my complete focus and energy. It's a fight for democracy, for freedom of speech, and for the rule of law. I'm prepared to give it everything I've got.\" It appears that Krebs will be focused on litigation against the Trump administration and public relations. He spoke to The Wall Street Journal, whichreportedthat \"Krebs said Wednesday he was resigning from his job at SentinelOne as chief intelligence and public policy officer so he could spend his time on a legal and public-relations battle against Trump without worrying about the firm's business or contracts.\" \"It's about the government pulling its levers to punish dissent, to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships,\" Krebs told the Journal. \"It's the same thing we've seen with the law firms, they've gone after clearances, they've gone after contracts. It's a novel and expansive strategy they are taking on and it should concern everyone.\" We emailed Krebs today to ask for details about his specific plans and will update this article if we get a response. SentinelOne last week posted astatementresponding to the Trump order, saying it \"will actively cooperate in any review of security clearances held by any of our personnel.\" The firm said it has fewer than 10 employees with security clearances, \"and only where required by existing government processes and procedures to secure government systems. Accordingly, we do not expect this to materially impact our business in any way.\" SentinelOne said it would continue to work with the US government to defend against security threats. \"We view the White House as a crucial collaborator on that mission, and we will continue to support a strong America at a time of heightened geopolitical threats,\" the statement said. \"Our team's focus remains on being a force for good in this industry and the world. We will continue to nurture our partnerships in the US government, military, and intelligence community and collaborate in our shared mission to defend US critical infrastructure in cyberspace as we always have.\" SentinelOne updated that post yesterday with copies of the email sent by Krebs and an email from Weingarten to staff. Weingarten's email praised Krebs' work \"in service of democratic institutions and critical infrastructure.\" \"I know he'll take on this next chapter with the same clarity, conviction, and humility that defined his time here, and he carries our full respect with him as his journey continues,\" Weingarten wrote. After Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, Krebs and CISA drew Trump's wrath byactively debunkingclaims of election fraud made by Trump and his supporters. On November 17, 2020, Trump called Krebs' statements inaccurate and insisted that \"there were massive improprieties and fraud,\" including dead people voting and voting machines changing votes from Trump to Biden. \"Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,\" Trump wrote in atweet. In last week's presidential memorandum, Trump ordered the government \"to take all appropriate action to review Krebs' activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA.\" Trump also ordered \"a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA's activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA's conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149.\" The referencedexecutive orderissued in January 2025 claimed the Biden administration \"trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans' speech on online platforms,\" by exerting pressure on social media companies. It ordered the government to \"identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.\" Krebs started working for the Department of Homeland Security in 2017 and became the first director of CISA in November 2018. Last week's Trump memo said that CISA under Krebs' leadership \"suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation\" and \"covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop.\" The forthcoming investigations of Krebs and CISA's activities will result in \"recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149,\" the Trump memo said.

    "title": "Google is gifting a year of Gemini Advanced to every college student in the US",
    "article_text": "Got a .edu email? You can sign up for a free year of Google One AI Premium. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly set a goal for the company to reach 500 million Gemini users before the end of 2025. Rolling out new models may help the company get there, but you know what else helps?Giving awaypremium features for free. Google has announced today that it's giving all US college students free access to Gemini Advanced, and not just for a month or two—the offer is good for a full year of service. With Gemini Advanced, you get access to themore capable Pro models, as well as unlimited use of the Deep Research tool based on it. Subscribers also get a smattering of other AI tools, like the Veo 2 video generator, NotebookLM, and Gemini Live. The offer is for the Google One AI Premium plan, so it includes more than premium AI models, like Gemini features in Google Drive and 2TB of Drive storage. Google has anew landing pagefor the deal, allowing eligible students to sign up for their free Google One AI Premium plan. The offer is valid from now until June 30. Anyone who takes Google up on it will enjoy the free plan through spring 2026. The company hasn't specified an end date, but we would wager it will be June of next year. Google's intention is to give students an entire school year of Gemini Advanced from now through finals next year. At the end of the term, you can bet Google will try to convert students to paying subscribers. As for who qualifies as a \"student\" in this promotion, Google isn't bothering with a particularly narrow definition. As long as you have a valid .edu email address, you can sign up for the offer. That's something that plenty of people who are not actively taking classes still have. You probably won't even be taking undue advantage of Google if you pretend to be a student—the company really, really wants people to use Gemini, and it's willing to lose money in the short term to make that happen. While Google essentially invented the underlying technology that made large language models (LLMs) into the tech obsession they are today, it was slow to take advantage of that. After releasing its seminal 2017 paper on the transformer attention mechanism, the company used the technology in a few internal tools and operational features that users didn't see. It was OpenAI that carved a path to launching the chatbots that have increasingly taken over the Internetwhen ChatGPT hit the scenein 2022. Credit:\n\n          \n          Google Googlestruggled to gain traction with Bardand the early Gemini releases, and the company's massive scale only does so much. Google doesn't release exact Gemini usage numbers, but some third-party analyses suggest it sees between 250 and 275 million users per month. OpenAI, on the other hand, says ChatGPT sees more than 400 millionweeklyusers. Even by the lax standards of self-reported usage metrics, that suggests asignificant leadfor OpenAI. There are millions of people out there who arelearning to use ChatGPTinstead of going to Google, and that's a problem for the search giant. Like it or not, generative AI is becoming deeply integrated into society. There is already strong evidence that policymakers are using these tools to devise their plans, like theTrump administration's reciprocal tariffsthat were recently rolled out and subsequently canceled. In spite of all the problems with this type of AI, people are using and relying on it more. With its tendency tooffer free access to premium AI tools, Google clearly wants people to integrate Gemini into their lives over ChatGPT as they adjust to the AI era. If that means giving away its best AI products to anyone with a .edu email, then apparently that's what Google will do.

    "title": "Google loses ad tech monopoly trial, faces additional breakups",
    "article_text": "Google plans to appeal as DOJ seeks to untether ad products. Theverdictis in, and Google has been found to illegally hold online ad tech monopolies. For over a decade, \"Google has willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets for open-web display advertising,\" tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange together \"to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets,\" the ruling said. At trial, the DOJ argued that Google's ad business expanded to choke out competitors and benefit only Google. They argued that Google \"rigged\" ad auctions, allegedly controlling \"multiple parts\" of services used to place ads all over the Internet, unfairly advantaging itself in various markets. Now, the search giant—which already isfacing down a potential breakup spinning off Chrometo remedy its monopoly in general search—faces threats of additional breakups. While analysts have warnedthat Google's $95 billion ad empire is \"too big\" to sell, the DOJ has argued that untethering Google's ad products is the only way to ensure that Google doesn’t lock the majority of publishers into paying higher fees on the publisher side because they can't afford to drop Google's ad exchange. In her opinion, Judge Leonie Brinkema noted that in the remedies phase of the trial, the US Department of Justice is seeking monetary damages, an injunction blocking Google's anticompetitive behavior, \"the divesture of Google’s publisher ad server and ad exchange products,\" and any other relief necessary to restore competition \"in the open-web display publisher ad server market and the open-web display ad exchange market.\" Ultimately, Brinkema found that Google's anticompetitive acts substantially harmed \"Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.\" For Google, the ruling likely hits hard, despite a couple of notable wins. For one, Brinkema ruled that the DOJ did not prove Google has a monopoly in a third market \"for open-web display advertiser ad networks.\" Additionally, Google will not face sanctions for deleting chat histories that could have influenced her decision in the case. \"Chat deletions occurred when employees discussed substantive topics at issue in this litigation and continued after the federal government began an antitrust investigation into Google’s conduct,\" Brinkema noted. And Google's evasive tactics also included executives marking emails as \"privileged\" that \"clearly did not involve privileged communications,\" the judge said. However, because the DOJ had enough evidence and testimony for Brinkema to find Google liable, the judgeagreed with the outcome in the Google search trialand declined to sanction Google for the \"adverse interference.\" \"As in Google Search, the Court’s decision not to sanction 'should not be understood as condoning Google’s failure to preserve chat evidence,'\" Brinkema said. While the DOJ largely claims the win, Google is apparently not considering this a loss yet. In a statement provided to Ars, Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, confirmed that Google plans to appeal. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,\" Mulholland said. \"The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options, and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable, and effective.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Sony releases new trailer for 28 Years Later",
    "article_text": "\"There are many kinds of death. And some are better than others.\" The critically acclaimed 2002 film28 Days Lateris often credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. Director Danny Boyle is back with more zombie-virus dystopian horror in his new film set in the same fictional world,28 Years Later—not so much a direct sequel but the start of a new planned trilogy. (Some spoilers for28 Days Laterand28 Weeks Laterbelow.) In28 Days Later, a highly contagious \"Rage Virus\" is accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turn into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attack the uninfected—so-called \"fast zombies.\" Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's mouth, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society. A bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens from a coma 28 days later to find London mostly deserted, apart from a handful of survivors fleeing the infected hordes, and joins them in the pursuit of safety. Jim (barely) survives, and we see zombies dying of starvation in the streets during the denouement. The sequel,28 Weeks Later, featured a new cast of characters living on the outskirts of London. With the help of NATO soldiers, Britain has begun rebuilding, taking in refugees and moving them to safe-zone districts. But all it takes is one careless person getting infected and raging out for the virus to spread uncontrollably yet again. So naturally, that's what happens. The survivors eventually flee to France, only for the rage virus to spread there, too. As early as 2007, Boyle had plans for a third film, set 28 months after the original outbreak, but it ended up in development hell. When the film finally got the green light in January 2024, the title had changed to28 Years Later, given how much time had passed. Alex Garland returns as screenwriter and also wrote the two sequels for this new trilogy. Per the official synopsis: It’s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well. Jodie Comer plays Isla, who lives with her husband, Jamie, (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and 12-year-old son, Spike (Alfie Williams), on the aforementioned island. Isla is pregnant, and Jamie scrounges out a living as a scavenger. The cast also includes Ralph Fiennes as Dr. Kelson, one of the survivors of the original outbreak; Jack O'Connell as cult leader Sir Jimmy Crystal; Edvin Ryding as Swedish NATO soldier Erik Sundqvist; Erin Kellyman as Jimmy Ink; and Emma Laird in an as-yet-undisclosed role. Sony released thefirst trailerin December, with footage set to a somber recitation of Rudyard Kipling's 1903 poem \"Boots.\" The powerful trailer quickly went viral, driven in large part by a brief shot of a zombie that bore a striking resemblance to Murphy's Jim from the original film, inciting speculation that Jim had succumbed to the virus in the ensuing years. Boyledispelled that rumorearlier this year; the zombie in question is played by extra Angus Neill. Per Boyle, while Murphy is an executive producer on28 Years Later, he does not appear in the film. However, Murphywas spottedon set last summer during filming of the sequel,28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,which was shot back-to-back with its predecessor. The new trailer retains portions of the \"Boots\" recitation and much of the same footage, presented this time with a bit more narrative context.  It opens ominously with armed soldiers exploring an abandoned building, only to be taken out by zombies. Cut to an aerial shot of an idyllic-looking island, followed by images of just how well fortified the connecting causeway to the mainland is. \"There are so many dead,\" Kelson says. \"Infected and non-infected alike.\" Jamie responds, \"That's why our home is so precious.\" Jamie is warned that his son, Spike, is too young for the dangerous mission they're about to embark upon, since there will be no chance of rescue once they cross the mainland. But the two set out anyway and are quickly attacked by zombies in the wild. We get a few more scenes of soldiers caught in zombie mayhem; an ominous tower of human skulls; and a priest declaring a \"glorious day of judgement\" as zombies crash through stained glass windows. That, and a brief glimpse of Ilsa fleeing with her newborn baby, does not bode well for the islanders' continued peaceful existence. 28 Years Laterhits theaters on June 20, 2025. Nia DaCosta directed28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, slated for release on January 16, 2026. Boyle will direct the third film, which is currently in development.

    "title": "What do you actually do in Mario Kart World’s vast open world?",
    "article_text": "Nintendo also shows off new \"Charge Jump\" race technique, \"reimagined\" classic courses. Earlier this month, Nintendo let Ars Technica and other outlets have access toa small hands-on slice ofMario Kart Worldahead of its planned June 5 launch. Today,a short livestreamed video presentationgave a bit of extra information about how exactly the full version of the free-roaming Nintendo Switch 2 launch game will work in practice. As the name implies,Mario Kart Worldsets itself apart from previous games via a \"vast interconnected world\" that you can roam freely between the actual race courses. That open space between races will feature \"hundreds of P-switches,\" Nintendo said, each of which activates a small mission to \"hone your driving abilities.\" Free-roaming racers will also be able to find hidden medallions and question-mark panels, as well as \"drive-thru\" food items that can be used to unlock new outfits. While cruising around the Mario Kart \"world,\" players will stumble onto new courses \"inspired by their surrounding region,\" as well as \"nostalgic courses for past titles... reimagined and spread throughout the world.\" When playing in Grand Prix mode, the drive between these courses will be integrated into the usual four-course cups themselves; after racing Mario Kart Circuit in the Mushroom cup, for instance, the second race \"will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City,\" Nintendo said. The game's other main race mode, Knockout Tour, slowly whittles 24 racers down to just four via checkpoints spaced throughout the course. These \"extended rallies\" will take racers across the game world, with one track seamlessly flowing into another on a preset path. Players who prefer a more traditional three-lap race on a single course can do so via the game's VS Mode races. The traditional battle mode will also return, with a Balloon Battle mode focused on hitting other players with weapons and a Coin Runners mode focused on getting more money than your opponents. In addition to online races featuring up to 24 racers at once,Mario Kart Worldwill feature local split-screen play for up to four players or up to eight players connected via local wireless on multiple systems (up to two players per system). In the races themselves,Mario Kart Worldplayers will be able to use a new \"Charge Jump\" technique by holding down the drift button while driving straight ahead. This extra-high \"hop\" can be used to dodge various hazards and to activate a small speed boost even on straight sections without jumps. Charge Jumps can also be used to leap onto grindable rails or chain together short wall rides. Nintendo also highlighted a new \"Rewind\" feature that lets racers reverse time for a few seconds and easily return to a position they've just driven past. That could be handy for mastering a difficult jump during free roam mode or for repeated practice on tough shortcuts in races, for instance. Other racers continue to move forward while you're rewinding time, though, so it's probably not a great idea if you're stuck struggling for first place.

Tesla is facing a new scandal that once again sees the electric automaker accused of misleading customers. In the past, it has been caught making \"misleading statements\" about the safety of its electric vehicles, and more recently, an investigation by Reuters found Tesla EVsexaggerated their efficiency. Now,a lawsuit filed in Californiaalleges that the cars are also falsely exaggerating odometer readings to make warranties expire prematurely. The lead plaintiff in the case, Nyree Hinton, bought a used Model Y with less than 37,000 miles (59,546 km) on the odometer. Within six months, it had pushed past the 50,000-mile (80,467 km) mark, at which point the car's bumper-to-bumper warranty expired. (Like virtually all EVs, Tesla powertrains have a separate warranty that lasts much longer.) For this six-month period, Hinton says his Model Y odometer gained 13,228 miles (21,288 km). By comparison, averages of his three previous vehicles showed that with the same commute, he was only driving 6,086 miles (9,794 km) per 6 months. The following year, Hinton's commute got longer, but he claims his car actually recorded 800 fewer miles per month once it was no longer under warranty. During the first six months of ownership, Hinton says the car displayed an average of 2,217 miles (3,568 km) a month; for the 12 months following the expiration of the warranty (and with a longer commute), the Model Y displayed an average of just 1,415 miles (2,277 km) a month. Hinton's lawsuit alleges that Tesla \"employs an odometer system that utilizes predictive algorithms, energy consumption metrics, and driver behavior multipliers that manipulate and misrepresent the actual mileage traveled by Tesla Vehicles\" and that his car \"consistently exhibited accelerated mileage accumulations of varying percentages ranging from 15 percent to 117 percent higher than plaintiff's other vehicles and his driving history.\" There areclaims of similar experiences by Tesla owners on Reddit, and Hinton is bringing the lawsuit on behalf of all Californian Tesla customers. That may well be unsuccessful, though. Inthe exaggerated range casea US district judge found thatindividual owners had to engage in arbitrationwith Tesla and could not form a class.

    "title": "Diablo vs. Darkest Dungeon: RPG devs on balancing punishment and power",
    "article_text": "In interviews, two devs offer contrasting views of what makes an RPG fun. It’s one of the oldest conversations in gaming. Do you play video games because you’re looking for a challenge and want to experience the thrill and satisfaction of overcoming obstacles? Or do you turn to games to feel empowered, for the escapist fantasy of possessing incredible abilities that are often unattainable in real life? Nowhere is this question more relevant than in the role-playing game genre. The core of the genre is developing a character (or stable of characters) over time, watching their power grow and capabilities expand. Satisfying player power fantasies is at the heart of many RPGs, where you can watch your virtual avatar grow from an unknown serf clad in rags to a living god, wielding incredible power to dominate your enemies or redeem a broken world. That said, the thrill of power is only really exciting when leavened with a little friction. Eventually, even being omnipotent gets old. How do you find a healthy medium between a level of difficulty that feels satisfying to overcome while still ensuring players feel rewarded and empowered? How do you maintain a sense of challenge in a world where player characters develop at different rates or grow exponentially more powerful over time? We spoke to designers at two ends of the development spectrum to get a broad perspective on how achieving this balance is possible. On one side is the sprawling triple-A live service gameDiablo IV, which not only needs to supply a satisfying experience over the course of a standard game but also requires constant updates and balancing in an evolving live environment. On the other hand, there’s indie cult-classicDarkest Dungeon II, which has a reputation for being brutally challenging—but it, too, needs to provide some sense of character development. Establishing the difficulty level of a game is a very challenging aspect of design, particularly in games as elaborate and sprawling as most modern RPGs. As players, some of us demand adversity to feel satisfied, while others are content to coast. “I like to think of challenge as a vast ocean,” said Aislyn Hall, systems designer forDiablo IVat Blizzard Entertainment. “Some players are happy to stay the passenger, along for whatever ride is on the itinerary for today. Others would prefer to set sail on their own terms, free from any boundaries that we might tether them to.” Hall recognizes that different players will be attracted to different levels of difficulty, so there’s no simple, one-size-fits-all approach that’s appropriate, especially for a franchise with the reach of Diablo. “When a player goes on their maiden voyage, we’re going to be their captain—give them some guidance and security while they’re in uncharted waters,” Hall said. But she also emphasizes that the aim is to scale difficulty as players progress. Unsurprisingly, the approach to a brutal gothic horror fantasy likeDarkest Dungeon IIis somewhat different. Tyler Sigman, the game’s design director, said one of the team's core philosophies is building a game that’s uncompromising. “We see that as distinct from being challenging for challenge’s sake,” he said. “Our interpretation of ‘uncompromising’ is that the game establishes a set of firm rules and plays within those rules. It’s a dungeon master who rolls their attack dice in the open rather than behind their screen. Dice are fair but uncompromising. So is a poker deck. They can both be alternately loving and cruel but aren’t by design intended to be either.” For theDarkest Dungeon IIteam, the point was to make every step forward feel earned. To that end, they allowed the random elements at the core of the game to be truly random, which in many cases equates to a punishing outcome. “We often get comments asking whether we shape our [random number generation] to purposefully inflict awful things on players. It’s actually the absence of RNG shaping that makes the game feel so brutal,” Sigman said. One of the promises of roleplaying games, going back to their tabletop roots, is escaping reality to a place where we have true agency to shape the world around us. Part of the way games deliver this fantasy is by allowing us to build a character whose power grows over time, though how central that is for developers can vary widely. “It’s absolutely critical that players feel powerful in any game they play,” Hall said. But that sense of power differs from genre to genre. “The medium of gaming is unique in that it provides control, which is a key element in what makes games such compelling experiences. In a nonviolent game about gardening, the way I feel power in my space is by choosing what crops I’d like to grow or where to plant them. In games where you’re slaying demons, power is felt in a vastly different way.” In the latter scenario, you may feel empowered because of the number of tools at your disposal or how easily you’re able to dispatch hordes of hell’s minions, a far cry from the bliss of tending to a well-ordered and productive farm. In either case, however, Hall believes that a sense of power isn’t as meaningful without some level of difficulty. “The way I think about how players can feel powerful is the concept of the immovable object and the unstoppable force. When a seemingly immovable object is put in front of a player yet the player is an unstoppable force, that sense of power emerges.” For the Darkest Dungeon franchise, however, almost the opposite is true. The point isn’t to emphasize a character’s strengths but rather to expose some of their weaknesses. “We knew from the beginning that we didn’t want heroes to feel like gods,” Sigman said. “They should always be vulnerable. ‘Heroes are human’ was an internal mantra from the beginning. This vision could only be achieved if the heroes’ attachment to life remained ever perilous.” Sigman cited another classic fantasy property to illustrate the team’s commitment to its characters’ mortality. “It felt interesting to focus on the inherent weaknesses of the person,” Sigman told us. “Courage, will, consistency—or lack thereof. The Riddle of Steel from Conan the Barbarian: ‘What is steel compared to the hand that wields it?’” In a game the size and scope ofDiablo IV, finding that delicate balance between challenge and a character’s power level is a complex and ongoing problem. At the same time, there’s the question of a player’s skill and comprehension, which also grows over time. To help tune that balance, Hall said the team relies on a tool they call “complexity budget.” “This budget often manifests on the tooltip of an ability, for example—how much text a player is ready and willing to digest based on their current understanding of the game,” she explained. “In the early stages, we have a low complexity budget. An ability needs to be straightforward, simple, and clear as to how it’s benefiting the player.” The ramp gets steeper as players delve further into the game. As they become more familiar with the game's systems, they get more goodies to play with. “That budget grows as the player continues to play,” said Hall. “Abilities and bonuses become more complex and interesting as the player has the capacity to appreciate them.” Balancing the level of challenge happens simultaneously. Hall points out that too much early challenge can be off-putting for players, while laying off in the later stages can make the experience fall flat. We’ve all played games where after finishing every side quest and finding every collectible, you reach a point where you’re so overpowered the rest of the game is trivial (and unsatisfying). With the release ofDiablo IV'sfirst major expansion,Vessel of Hatred, the team had the opportunity to reexamine the existing difficult curve. “We knew that player power was expanding more rapidly than our previous difficulty system could manage,” Hall remembers. “When we were designing the Torment system forVessel of Hatred, we took a step back and audited the power of player builds, then compared that against how many difficulties we thought would be appropriate to progress through.” The Torment system is a fully elective system that adds four new tiers of difficulty to the previously existing four. Players can choose what level of difficulty they want to take on, with rewards commensurate with the challenge. Alongside higher monster damage and hit points and lower survivability stats for players, Hall said the key was how enemies were distributed. “It’s about stratifying the difficulty of enemies out among those tiers, with the weakest foes living in the lowest tier and the strongest at the highest. It’s a fairly straightforward approach that solves a lot of problems in the action RPG space,” Hall told us. Critically, for a live service game, the Torment system also ensures that the game is almost endlessly playable. ForDarkest Dungeon II, the scales are intentionally heavily weighted toward challenge. The idea is to give players a deeply satisfying experience of overcoming a truly savage test. “For the Darkest Dungeon games,” Sigman said, “we err on the side of layering in substantial challenge very early on.” Unlike many games, which tend to ease players into their worlds by providing very little challenge in the early going,Darkest Dungeonensures your characters are vulnerable from the jump. In fact, as Sigman points out, it’s possible for your heroes to get butchered even in the tutorial. “WithDarkest Dungeon,” he warned, “you are in peril constantly.” According to Sigman, many games vacillate between neutral difficulty and allowing players to feel overpowered, often at inflection points like when they pick up new gear or level up. WithDarkest Dungeon II, the goal is to push the needle to the other side of the scale. “We keep the player in the neutral to underpowered bands almost always,“ he said. ”The net effect is that the player can never totally relax or be complacent. It is fundamental to our intent to make every accomplishment inDDfeel hard-earned.” But Sigman clarified that the point isn’t to punish or demoralize players. We’ve also all experienced moments of such intense frustration with a game’s difficulty that we rage-quit, vowing never to return. “We definitely want players to feel a sense of accomplishment and growth,” he said, “while still never letting them totally escape gravity and ascend into the heavens like a god. There’s the concept of power growth within a given run but also meta-progression. Within a run, you experience growth by upgrading skills and also finding equipment. With metagame progression, you experience growth by unlocking new heroes and skills, increasing base stats, and adding more items to the item pool.” Like Hall, Sigman also believes that one of the most important kinds of progression happens in players themselves. “Knowledge is arguably as important as stat increases,” he said.” Knowledge is one of your crucial defenses against the RNG. It’s a little like poker—RNG can still get you, but if you play strategically over a period of time, you’re likely to see much better results than someone who relies only on luck.” Sigman also recognizes that, like theDiablo IVplayer base, not allDarkest Dungeonplayers are looking for the same level of challenge. “The reality is that our large player base is very far from homogenous,” he acknowledged. To try to accommodate that breadth of players, the team includes a number of optional difficulty elements, some designed to make the experience harder, some to give players a helping hand. After building a core game that was meant to be very difficult for most, the team then included optional elements to allow players to further tailor the difficulty to their own play style. There’s the Radiant Flame system, for instance, that provides buffs that grow stronger the more consecutive runs you fail. On the other side, Infernal Flames allow players who find the core experience too easy to attempt punishing themed challenges. Like the Torment system inDiablo IV, it gives you some agency in determining what level of difficulty they experience and the ability to adjust it on the fly if their tastes change. In a nod toward more traditional game design,Darkest Dungeon IIalso added a difficulty system by way of a free update called Kingdoms. This way, you yourself get to make an early decision about how much challenge you want to experience or how much you want to feel like a badass. “When you start the Kingdom, you choose the Radiant, Normal, Stygian, or Bloodmoon ruleset,” Sigman said. “This determines some fundamental rules like whether heroes respawn or suffer permadeath but also some other frameworks like time limits.” The challenge with running a live-service game is that, even if you’ve established a fine-tuned balance that you’re satisfied with, you constantly need to be ready to pivot and evolve. Adding new elements through updates, or in the much more disruptive form of a large expansion, can totally upset the fragile balance between power fantasy and challenge established during a game’s initial development. “The balance can shift frequently,” Hall told us. “A lot of it has to do with the audiences you’re seeking to serve.” It’s a common experience, coming late to a game (or returning to one you love) after an expansion and feeling lost in deep water. There’s also the inverse, however, when you’ve been loyally playing a game for months or years and don’t want to be treated like a newcomer when fresh content comes out. “When we launchedVessel of Hatred, our focus was on the early- to mid-game progression, as we knew many new and returning players would be joining us,” Hall said. Those players need that early- and mid-game experience to be as polished as possible, so it was a big deal for us to nail that. As seasons have passed, we find that a large portion of our audience has naturally shifted to experienced players. These invested players typically care more about the late game being polished and replayable, so our focus shifted to that stage of the game. And the cycle will continue!” For Sigman and the Darkest Dungeon team, it was important to establish an overarching design philosophy that was set in place. That said, the details within that framework may change or evolve significantly during development. “In this age of early access and easily updatable games, balance is a living thing,” Sigman said. “It’s highly iterative throughout the game’s public life. We will update balance based upon community feedback, analytics, evolving metas, and also reflections on our own design philosophies and approaches.” The problem, of course, is that every change to an existing game is a double-edged sword. With each update, you risk breaking the very elements you’re trying to fix. Speaking to that ongoing balancing act, Sigman admits, “It’s not without its challenges. We’ve found that many players eagerly await such updates, but a subset gets really angry when developers change balance elements.” Getting one of your favorite heroes or abilities nerfed can absolutely sink a game or destroy a strategy you’ve relied on for success. The team relies on a number of strictly mathematical tools to help isolate and solve balance problems, but on some level, it’s an artistic and philosophical question. “A good example is how to address ‘exploits’ in a game,” Sigman said. “Some games try to hurriedly stamp out all possible exploits. With a single-player game, I think you have more leeway to let some exploits stand. It’s nice to let players get away with some stuff. If you kick sand over every exploit that appears, you remove some of the fun.” As with so many aspects of game design, perfecting the balance between adversity and empowerment comes down to a simple question. “One amazing piece of wisdom from Sid Meier, my personal favorite designer, is to remember to ask yourself, ‘Who is having the fun here? The designer or the player?’ It should be the player,” Sigman told us. It’s the kind of approach that players love to hear. Even if a decision is made to make a game more difficult, particularly in an existing game, it should be done to make the play experience more enjoyable. If it begins to feel like devs are making balance changes just to scale down players’ power, it can begin to feel like you’re being punished for having fun. The fine balance between power and challenge is a hard one to strike, but what players ultimately want is to have a good time. Sometimes that means feeling like a world-destroying demigod, and sometimes it means squeaking through a bloody boss encounter with a single hit point. Most often, though, you're looking for a happy medium: a worthy challenge overcome through power and skill. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Climate change will make rice toxic, say researchers",
    "article_text": "Warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide will boost arsenic levels in rice. Rice, the world’s most consumed grain, will become increasingly toxic as the atmosphere heats and as carbon dioxide emissions rise, potentially putting billions of people at risk of cancers and other diseases, according tonew researchpublished Wednesday in The Lancet. Eaten every day by billions of people and grown across the globe, rice is arguably the planet’s most important staple crop, with half theworld’s populationrelying on it for the majority of its food needs, especially in developing countries. But the way rice is grown—mostly submerged in paddies—and its highly porous texture mean it can absorb unusually high levels of arsenic, a potent carcinogenic toxin that is especially dangerous for babies. Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist and associate professor at Columbia University, has studied rice for three decades and has more recently focused his research on how climate change reduces nutrient levels across many staple crops,including rice. He teamed up with researchers from China and the US to conduct a first-of-its-kind study, looking at how a range of rice species reacted to increases in temperature and carbon dioxide, both of which are projected to occur as more greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. The new study was published in The Lancet Planetary Health. “Previous work has focused on individual responses—some on CO2and some on temperature, but not both, and not on a wide range of rice genetics,” Ziska said. “We knew that temperature by itself could increase levels, and carbon dioxide by a little bit. But when we put both of them together, then wow, that was really something we were not expecting. You’re looking at a crop staple that’s consumed by a billion people every day, and any effect on toxicity is going to have a pretty damn large effect.” For six years, Ziska and a large team of research colleagues in China and the US grew rice in controlled fields, subjecting it to varying levels of carbon dioxide and temperature. They found that when both increased, in line with projections by climate scientists, the amount of arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice grains also went up. Arsenic is found naturally in some foods, including fish and shellfish, and in waters and soils. Inorganic arsenic is found in industrial materials and gets into water—including water used to submerge rice paddies. Rice is easily inundated with weeds and other crops, but it has one advantage: It grows well in water. So farmers germinate the seeds, and when the seedlings are ready, plant them in wet soil. They then flood their fields, which suppresses weeds, but allows the rice to flourish. Rice readily absorbs the water and everything in it—including arsenic, either naturally occurring or not. Most of the world’s rice is grown this way. The new research demonstrates that climate change will ramp up those levels. “What happens in rice, because of complex biogeochemical processes in the soil, when temperatures and CO2go up, inorganic arsenic also does,” Ziska said. “And it’s this inorganic arsenic that poses the greatest health risk.” Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Research has found that in parts of the world with high consumption of rice, inorganic arsenic increases cancer risk. Ziska and his colleagues took the data from their field trials and then, based on per capita consumption data in seven of the top rice-consuming countries in Asia, projected how disease risk could also increase. They found that in those seven countries—Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Myanmar and India—disease risk rose across the board. “There is a toxicological effect of climate change relative to one of the most consumed staples in the world,” Ziska said, “and the consumption is one of the hallmarks of whether you’re going to be vulnerable to that effect.” Researchers have known that rice can contain high levels of arsenic, and regulators have suggested exposure limits, especially for infants, who are particularly vulnerable and tend to eat a lot of rice. This new research should put extra pressure on regulators to set more stringent thresholds, the authors say. The US Food and Drug Administration has never set limits for arsenic in foods. The researchers also point to the potential of various interventions that could limit exposure to inorganic arsenic from rice, including developing strains of rice that are less absorbent and educating consumers about alternatives to rice. “Rice has always been a food where arsenic is an issue, and climate change is making it worse,” said Keeve Nachman, one of the report’s authors, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a longtime researcher of health risks related to food production and consumption. “This is one more reason to intervene—to control people’s exposure. The No. 1 thing we can do is everything in our power to slow climate change.” This story originally appeared onInside Climate News.

    "title": "Ben Affleck Has a New Batman Complaint: Wearing the Batsuit Sucked",
    "article_text": "The discourse around the end of the Snyderverse inThe Flashhas been brought up again to that era’sBatman,ÂBen Affleck. In a career-spanning video interview withGQ, the actor was asked if the last iteration of the Batsuit he wore as the character was his favorite, and the answer is an new all-timer Affleck-is-tired meme. “I mean, I hated the bat suits,” he said. “The bat suits are horrendous to wear.” It’s a known issue with superhero costumes, which often look like armored athleisure but are seeminglyalways uncomfortable to wear. Affleck continued, “They’re hot for one thing, they don’t breathe. They’re made to look the way they want them to look and there’s no thought put into the human being.” “And so what happens is that you just start sweating. Now, I’m alreadyâI sweat, you know what I mean? I get hot and so in that thing, you would just be pouring water because it’s got the cowl over it. Like there’s one thing to wear the suit, but once you cover your head, I guess that’s where all your heat kind of escapes and you feel it.” Affleck gave credit to the stunt guys who had to spend the most time actually wearing the outfit. “Even the most highly trained, much more fit stunt guys, the parkour guys, the action guys, they could do that for about like 45-50 minutes and then they were like gonna get heat stroke,” he said. “So you had to come out of it and that was really the thing, was that it just made it difficult to make the movie because it was so hot. And it also does not make you feel very heroic because you’re instantly exhausted and really sweaty and kind of trying to hide like the sweat pouring down your face. Like ‘No, we can go again, I’m fine, I’m good’ and the eye black [liner] is running.” While his time in the role was fraught with a lot of discourse and difficulties, Affleck seems glad to be out of the suit at least. “Maybe you know, Christian [Bale] or Rob [Pattinson], guys like that were just better at maybe, you know, dealing with it. But I found it to be the least fun part of it.” Wardrobe gripes aside, Affleck does have appreciation for his DC era, which began with his partnership on the vision of Batman he shared with Zack Snyder onBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justiceand the Snyder cut ofThe Justice League. “Somebody sent me something that showed me the Snyder cut ofThe Justice Leaguewas my highest-rated movie on IMDb, which I found quite interesting,” he said. “I think it’s because one of the things the Snyder cut, so to speak, [it] is actually really the movie that Zack wanted to make. You have a director with a very clear idea of the kind of story they understand and want to tell. And then you’ve got a commercial expectation, for example, like a very valuable like IP property, etc. And so there’s so sometimes they’ll hire this person for their distinctive take and view and then want to impose on that something different.” Snyder was famously shuffled offThe Justice Leaguebefore getting a second crack at it, and Affleck, as aÂ  filmmaker himself, was pleased that it worked out in his collaborator’s favor. “One of the things about directing is typically you want to have it be closest to what that director is interested in and finds appealing. And so that movie is very much what Zack’s vision was. And it’s a rare thing that somebody gets the chance to go back and revisit and try to do what they wanted to do. And given the difficulty of that movie, I was very happy for Zack, [that] he got a chance to do that.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Trump Weaponizes Bureaucratic Review to Stop Offshore Wind Project",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has touted its desire to achieve energy independence for America. It has also made a big deal out of cutting the administrative red tape that it believes slows the development of fledgling industries. So why, one might wonder, would Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgumhalt the developmentof a major offshore wind farm over supposed concerns that the Biden administration “rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis?â That’s a rhetorical question, of course. Seemingly, the reason is that Donald Trump and his cabinet simply don’t want clean energy to succeed and risk the bottom line for their donors in the fossil fuel industry. So Empire Wind, a project that started construction last year off the shore of New York and would have generated carbon-free electricity for 500,000 homes by the time it was completed in 2027, is nowdead in the water. Secretary Burgumsaidthe decision to halt Empire Wind falls in line withTrump’s executive order, signed on his first day in office this term, which called for a halt on all leasing and permitting for new offshore wind projectsâthough, it’s worth pointing out that Empire Wind is not new, has held a federal lease for its efforts since 2017, already went through both state and federal permitting processes. Construction was already underway and the project, which employed 1,500 people, was projected to start generating poweras early as next year. According to amemo obtained by the Free Beacon, Burgum said Empire Wind would be stopped because “approval for the project was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis or consultation among the relevant agencies as relates to the potential effects from the project.” Last week, the very same Interior Departmentannouncedthat it would cancel a Biden-era requirement to conduct a full environmental impact statement review for 3,244 oil and gas leases, calling the process “lengthy” and stating the decision was part of “reducing regulatory barriers for oil and gas companies and expediting domestic energy development.” So the red tape is coming down for oil and gas projects. In a surely unrelated fact, oil and gas firmsdumped more than $75 millioninto the coffers of pro-Trump PACs during the 2024 election cycle. Meanwhile, clean energy seems to be staring down a maze of artificial regulatory hurdles that the Trump administration will use to grind every project, even those already under construction, to a complete halt. That isn’t a total surprise. Trump promised that there would be “no new windmills” during his term, and he’s long taken issue with the technology, which hefalsely claims are endlessly slaughtering birdsand are a visual blight (your mileage may vary on that one). But it is a little surprising that his administration is going so far as to axe projects that are already underway rather than just snuffing out new ones. It appears the administration is at war with clean energy, even though wind in particular is thefastest-growing and lowest-costsource of electricity in the country.

    "title": "Doctor Who‘s Russell T Davies on Why Ncuti Gatwa’s Outfits Always Change",
    "article_text": "In a conversation withPolygon,Doctor WhoÂ showrunnerRussell T Daviesdiscussed opting away from giving theFifteenth Doctoraconsistent outfitâor accessory, like, say, a bowtie or a distinctively striped scarfâlike previous Doctors have worn. With the stylish Ncuti Gatwa now starring as the Doctor, Davies wanted to allow more room for different looks. “I do love opening the door for cosplayers,” Davies shared with Polygon. “In one episode in the first season [the Fifteenth Doctor] set out of the TARDIS in a pair of jeans and a duffle coat. And at the [finale], he was in a pair of Leviâs and a black leather jacket. And that means almost anyone can cosplay.â But given the Time Lord’s travels, not every week involves an outfit built around jeans. TheDoctor Whocostume department definitely had fun with last season’sBridgerton-era riff, “Rogue,” and there’s of course all the sci-fi looks which are embellished by the costumers to fit the themes while still making them suit Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor. All the variety has undoubtedly inspired cosplayers to run wild, which excites Davies. “If itâs your hobby, then thatâs money well spent. […] But thereâs also going to be that casual cosplayer, that kid who fancies being Doctor Who today. And that means now they can put on a pair of jeans and a duffle coat, run out the door or in the middle of the rain, and say, âIâm the Doctor.â And I like that.” Davies continued. “It democratizes it, it means no one has ownership. It means you can put on any costume and say, âIâm the Doctor today,â because thatâs what heâd do.” Doctor Whois now airing weekly on Disney+ and BBC One. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Peter Thiel’s Spy Company Gets Into Bed With ICE as Trump Says He’ll Deport U.S. Citizens",
    "article_text": "Like a specter, Peter Thiel has long haunted the margins of the MAGA movement. As an early Trump backer, the tech billionaire has often been credited with helping to launch the former reality TV star’s political career. Since then, the tech billionaire’s influence can be felt in various parts of the MAGA agenda. Many of Thiel’s friends and associates arespread throughout the current administration, while others can be credited with having playedpivotal rolesin the campaign that swept Trump to victory last fall. Now, Thiel’s powerful defense contractor, Palantir, is also said to be playing an integral role in Trump’s deportation machine, the likes of which may soon (according to Trump) target U.S. citizens. Internal messages and company informationleaked to 404 Mediashow that the creepy data company is actively helping the Trump administration to identify and hunt down people who have been targeted for deportation. The outlet, which received Slack messages and information from internal Palantir wikis, explains the significance of the leaks: The leak shows that Palantirâs work with ICE includes producing leads for law enforcement to find people to deport and keeping track of the logistics of Trumpâs mass deportation effort, and provides concrete insight into the Trump administrationâs wish to leverage data to enforce its immigration agenda. The internal communications also show Palantir leadership preparing for a potential backlash from employees or outsiders, with them writing FAQs that can be sent to friends or family that start to ask about Palantirâs work with ICE. One of the projects that Palantir is working on for the government has been dubbed âEnforcement Prioritization and Targeting.” It is described as an effort to âsupport the development of an accurate picture of actionable leads based on existing law enforcement datasets to allow law enforcement to prioritize enforcement actions.â Palantir has been paid tens of millions of dollars for this program, 404 writes. The company already hasa $95 million contractwith ICE, which gives the government access to Palantir’s Investigative Case Management (ICM) system. The ICM software allows ICE officials “document investigative activities leading up to the prosecution of criminal parties,” the company says. The leaks also apparently show that Palantir has told its employees that it “remains committed” to âprivacy and civil liberty protections,â which seems a little bit like an industrial slaughterhouse claiming it remains committed to animal welfare. An internal wiki describes the company’s attitude towards human rights concerns: âPalantir is cognizant of the risks to privacy and civil liberties involved in these mission sets and how they may be influenced by shifts in priorities,â another section reads. âMany risks will not be within our means to addressâsome are structural and must be fully baked into the equation by virtue of a willingness to engage at all in these efforts. It’s important to note that there will be failures in the removal operations process,â it adds. I guess when your business’s main priority is making money by helping a government ship people off to foreign prisons, some risks to civil liberties just can’t be helped. Gizmodo reached out to Palantir for more information. The Trump administration has ramped up its deportation efforts in recent weeks, targeting a variety of individuals, many of whom are highly unusual, given that theyhave no known criminal recordsand have not been afforded due process. The Supreme Court recentlymade a vague rulingthat stated the Trump administration should “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was recently sent to a prison in El Salvador. The government claims Garcia is a gang member, but hasn’t substantiated those claims with evidence other than a vague 2019 police report that references anonymous allegations against Garcia. Additionally, while the government has claimed that Garcia was deported due to an “administrative error,” the administration has also shown no interest in correcting that error. These kinds of legally questionable deportation operations may soon be directed at other types of people living in the U.S. During arecent press conference, Trump claimed he would like to deport U.S. citizens in very much the same way that Garcia had been deported. âWe always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when theyâre not looking, that are absolute monsters,â Trump told reporters. âIâd like to include them.â It remains a hanging question why the administration is mostly deporting men with no known criminal records if Trump’s primary concern is crime. Similarly, Trump’s counterterrorism czar, Sebastian Gorka, recently suggested that Americans who oppose the administration’s operations are terrorist abettors. “We have people who love America, like the president, like his cabinet, like the directors of his agencies who want to protect Americans,”Gorka told Newsmax. “And then there is the other side, that is on the side of the cartel members, on the side of the illegal aliens, on the side of the terrorists. And you have to ask yourself: are they technically aiding and abetting them? Because aiding and abetting criminals and terrorists is a crime in federal statute.” Remarks made by Trump and his cabinet have drawn an intense backlash from legal scholars, including many conservatives. The consensus seems to be that the administration’s deportation actions are “obviously illegal,” as one scholar put it.Other critics, like historian Timothy Snyder,have notedthat shipping undesirables to specialized “zones” to suffer untold horrors is exactly what the Nazis did during WWII.

    "title": "China Bans ‘Autonomous Driving’ Claims From Car Marketing Following Crash",
    "article_text": "China has banned automakers in the country from marketing their vehicles with grandiose terms such as “smart driving” or “autonomous driving” following afatal crashinvolving a Xiaomi SU7. The car was in driver assistance mode as the vehicle approached a construction zone, but the driver took control only just before the car hit a concrete barrier. Three passengers were killed in the accident. The problem with any assistance system below Level 4âin which a vehicle can operate entirely without human interventionâis that drivers are still required to pay attention to the road and intervene as needed, but complacency sets in. By the time the driver realizes that an accident might occur, it can be too late. It is the primary reason why Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have been criticized for rolling out autonomous driving capabilities with terms like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving.” To protect itself from liability, Tesla now hedges in its language, referring to its most advanced system as “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” and the company monitors drivers to ensure they have their hands on the wheel. The new rules set forth by Chinese authorities also state that automakers can not use car owners as guinea pigs to test new updates to their driver assistance programs. Any new algorithm updates must undergo a battery of tests before they can be delivered to vehicles over the air. Starting in 2026, new battery safety standards will also be implemented in an attempt to curb fires. For all its problems, one nice thing about a single-party dictatorship like China is that it can make policy moves quickly. In the United States, a similar move to ban marketing language would get caught up in lawsuits and regulatory challenges for years. Case in point: Back in 2022, the California DMV accused Tesla offalsely portraying its vehicles as autonomousbased on its marketing language. The company’s vehicles have been at the center of high-profile crashes that involved some level of driver assistance, and critics say Musk’s autonomy claims have led some drivers to overestimate its abilities. But Tesla argued it waswithin its free speech rightsto use the language, and no action was taken. China’s dictatorship is the same reason why the country has been able to out-innovate the United States in electric vehicles as a wholeâthe Communist Party decided they matter, and nobody in the country is going to dissent. Democracy moves much slower, though that is a good thing and by design; occasionally, a little authoritarian muscle has its benefits. Tesla has long claimed that its autonomous software makers drivers safer,Â  but the company has nonetheless faced a slew of regulatory investigations in the United States over the years, with the National Highway Transportation Safety Board most recentlyinitiating a probeinto Tesla’s “Smart Summon” feature that allows vehicles to navigate short distances, such as through a parking lot, without the driver being inside. The agency has been a thorn in Musk’s side forquite some time: Areportin 2022 released by the NHTSA claimed that, in the preceding twelve-month period, Teslas accounted for some 70 percent of the car crashes that involved driver-assist systems. Teslaâs driver-assisted function, Autopilot, has often been criticized, with regulators speculating that it may be playing a role in crashes. Indeed, the NHTSA publishedyet another reportthis past April that claimed Teslaâs Autopilot function had a âcritical safety gapâ that could be linked to hundreds of crashes. Ananalysisconducted by the Washington Post last summer similarly found that Teslaâs Autopilot function had been involved in a total of 17 fatalities and as many as 736 crashes since 2019. The newspaper again cited NHTSA statistics. The NHTSA’s reporting that Teslas are involved in such a large number of fatal crashes is thanks to Biden-era rules that required automakers to inform the agency whenever a car using autonomous software was involved in a crash. Back in December, it wasreportedthat the Trump transition team was considering the possibility of killing the rule. Acolytes of Tesla claim that its Full Self-Driving technology is nearing a point where it will be able to fully operate vehicles on its own. The company says it plans on launching an autonomous cab service in Austin by the end of the year. Musk has missed his stated projections for full autonomy going back to 2016, when he said Tesla vehicles would be able to drive themselves within a year. In 2019, he predicted that over a million robotaxis would be on the road by 2020. It turns out that the last 10% of solving autonomy might have been the hardest part, but other companies, including Waymo, are starting to get there, rolling out fully autonomous services across the U.S. at a rapid pace. In China, automakers like BYD have been rolling out their own self-driving features, suggesting that Tesla does not command the lead it once did.

    "article_text": "Plans forPacific Rim‘s TV show, which some may have forgotten was even in development, are shifting from concept to reality, as the series has officially found a home on Amazon. As reported byVariety, Legendary Television and Amazon MGM have secured a deal to develop the series, written and executive produced by Eric Heisserer, known forShadow and Bone, for Prime Video. The streamer has caught the mecha bug, having gained streaming rights for the fourthNeon Genesis Evangelionanime rebuild film,Thrice Upon a Time, as well as thenewMobile Suit Gundamanime,Gquuuuuux, so the move makes a lot of sense when you think about it from a bird’s eye view.

The forthcoming Prime Video series isn’t the franchise’s first expansion effort. In 2018, John Boyega headlined the sequelPacific Rim: Uprising. Netflix also produced the animePacific Rim: Black, which ran for two seasons. Beyond screen adaptations, the franchise has ventured into merchandising,comics, and novels. However, none have matchedthe impact of the original 2013 film, directed by Guillermo del Toro, which quickly achievedcult classic statusamong diehard fans of kaiju and giant robot action flicks. It also doesn’t hurt that the film grossed $400 million at the global box office. With any luck, when the show premieres, Amazon’sPacific Rimshow will earn its place alongside del Toro’s film as a standout in the franchise, rather than fading into obscurity like some of its predecessors.

    "title": "A Scanning Error Created a Fake Science Term—Now AI Won’t Let It Die",
    "article_text": "AI trawling the internet’s vast repository of journal articles has reproduced an error that’s made its way into dozens of research papersâand now a team of researchers has found the source of the issue. It’s the question on the tip of everyone’s tongues: What the hell is “vegetative electron microscopy”? As it turns out, the term is nonsensical. It sounds technicalâmaybe even credibleâbut itâs complete nonsense. And yet, itâs turning up in scientific papers, AI responses, and even peer-reviewed journals. Soâ¦ how did this phantom phrase become part of our collective knowledge? As painstakinglyreportedby Retraction Watch in February, the term may have been pulled from parallel columns of text in a1959 paperon bacterial cell walls. The AI seemed to have jumped the columns, reading two unrelated lines of text as one contiguous sentence,according to one investigator. The farkakte text is a textbook case of what researchers call a digital fossil: An error that gets preserved in the layers of AI training data and pops up unexpectedly in future outputs. The digital fossils are “nearly impossible to remove from our knowledge repositories,” according to a team of AI researchers who traced the curious case of “vegetative electron microscopy,” as noted inThe Conversation. The fossilization process started with a simple mistake, as the team reported. Back in the 1950s, two papers were published in Bacteriological Reviews that were later scanned and digitized. The layout of the columns as they appeared in those articles confused the digitization software, which mashed up the word âvegetativeâ from one column with âelectronâ from another. The fusion is a so-called “tortured phrase”âone that is hidden to the naked eye, but apparent to software and language models that “read” text. As chronicled by Retraction Watch, nearly 70 years after the biology papers were published, âvegetative electron microscopyâ started popping up in research papers out of Iran. There, aFarsi translation glitchmay have helped reintroduce the term: the words for âvegetativeâ and âscanningâ differ by just a dot in Persian scriptâand scanning electron microscopy is a very real thing. That may be all it took for the false terminology to slip back into the scientific record. But even if the error began with a human translation, AI replicated it across the web, according to the team who described their findings in The Conversation. The researchers prompted AI models with excerpts of the original papers, and indeed, the AI models reliably completed phrases with the BS term, rather than scientifically valid ones. Older models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 and BERT, did not produce the error, giving the researchers an indication of when the contamination of the models’ training data occurred. “We also found the error persists in later models including GPT-4o and Anthropicâs Claude 3.5,” the group wrote in its post. “This suggests the nonsense term may now be permanently embedded in AI knowledge bases.” The group identified the CommonCrawl datasetâa gargantuan repository of scraped internet pagesâas the likely source of the unfortunate term that was ultimately picked up by AI models. But as tricky as it was to find the source of the errors, eliminating them is even harder. CommonCrawl consists of petabytes of data, which makes it tough for researchers outside of the largest tech companies to address issues at scale. That’s besides the fact that leading AI companies arefamously resistantto sharing their training data. But AI companies are only part of the problemâjournal-hungry publishers are another beast. As reported by Retraction Watch, the publishing giant Elseviertried to justifythe sensibility of “vegetative electron microscopy” before ultimatelyissuing a correction. The journal Frontiers had its own debacle last year, when it was forced toretract an articlethat included nonsensical AI-generated images of rat genitals and biological pathways.Â Earlier this year, a team of researchers in Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Reviewhighlightedthe worsening issue of so-called “junk science” on Google Scholar, essentially unscientific bycatch that gets trawled up by the engine. AI has genuine use cases across the sciences, but its unwieldy deployment at scale is rife with the hazards of misinformation, both for researchers and for the scientifically inclined public. Once the erroneous relics of digitization become embedded in the internet’s fossil record, recent research indicates they’re pretty darn difficult to tamp down.

    "title": "Jurassic World Rebirth Isn’t Trying to Hide Its Nostalgia Play",
    "article_text": "Jurassic World Rebirthhasn’t been subtle in its marketing, emphasizing areturn to the rootsof the belovedsummer blockbuster-turned-sprawling franchise. Hell, the movie’s title nods to this concept quite directly. A recently released trailer, doubling as a behind-the-scenes featurette, aims to solidify the film’s mission statement and put butts in theater seats, promising to deliver the same thrills as the original movie did and then some. In the aptly titled “Classic Jurassic” featurette, starsScarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey (Wicked,Final Fantasy XIV), and Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) reinforce that their film is “going back to the basics,” made for fans of the original films. All of the above waxed poetic about howJurassic World Rebirth, in typicalJurassic Parkfashion, will introduce new dinosaurs, harken back to the original, and essentially be a survival story, with a more naturalistic cinematic quality thanks to being shot on film. While their glowing praise is expected for actors starring in a film following a trilogy that grossed$1 billion at the global box office, screenwriterDavid Koeppand directorGareth Edwardsoffered a bit more insight into why they pursued making a new film in the first place. Edwards, for instance, revealed that upon reading the script forJurassic World Rebirth, he saw it as a heartfelt tribute to the original director, Steven Spielbergâa sentiment Keopp shared. In addition to highlighting the film’s comedic moments, Koepp shared his enthusiasm for bringing a notorious underwater sequence from the books to the big screen for the first time. “The sequence with the raft was in the first novel,Jurassic Park,”Keopp said. “One of the first things Steven and I said was, ‘We gotta get that raft sequence in some place.'” Setfive years afterJurassic World Dominion(the one with Chris Pratt and the dinosaur-human hybrid clone girl),Jurassic WorldRebirthsees humanity and dinosaurs sharing the planet as unwitting roommates. As our ecology becomes progressively unwelcoming to our new scaly overlords, the Earth’s prehistoric climate is forcing the surviving vestiges of humanity to live on the outskirts of the world. To give a semblance of balance to a world that opened Pandora’s box decades ago, a task force must harness the DNA of three dinosaurs to create a life-saving drug. Naturally, these three dinosaurs are of the land, sea, and air variety pack, so acquiring their DNA will be a hassle for the film’s heroes, on top of being hunted down by a newbiofreak monster dinosaur. Rebirth features Johansson as Zora Bennett, a top covert ops specialist leading Dr. Henry Loomis (played by Bailey) on said mission to secure his groundbreaking research. Ali plays Duncan Kincaid, Zoraâs trusted ally, while Rupert Friend portrays a pharmaceutical executive named Martin Krebs. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo rounds out the ensemble as Reuben Delgado, a father whose family becomes entangled in the crew’s mess after a devastating shipwreck. “For anyone who loves the originalJurassicfilms, this is the movie for you,” Bailey said. “I know that it will bring back the wonder of seeingJurassic Parkfor the first time.” Hopefully, the newÂJurassic Worldfilm will live up to its lofty promise to evoke the same merriment, awe, and thrills of its predecessor when it hits theaters July 2.

    "title": "Study Finds 96% of Gator Bites Are the Result of Risky Human Behavior",
    "article_text": "When it comes to gator bites, it turns out we’re the problem (it’s us). Recent research has found that the vast majority of violent alligator incidents in the U.S. are provoked by “risky human behaviors.” Scientists at the University of Florida and Centre College in Kentucky conducted the study, which analyzed recorded human bites from American alligators (AlligatorÂ mississippiensis) dating back to the 18th century. Nearly all of the time, the encounters were preceded by humans not paying attention or taking ill-advised risks, such as swimming in waters clearly inhabited by the ferocious reptiles. The findings show that most gator bites are preventable, the authors say. The researchers were inspired to look into the nature of gator bites by another reptile commonlyâand incorrectlyâblamed for attacking humans unprovoked: snakes. âI wondered if crocodilians had an unwarranted reputation for attacks the same way snakes do,â said Mark Teshera, lead author of the study and a biology professor at Center College, in astatementfrom the University of Florida. Teshera and his colleagues began by searching through the CrocBITE database (now located atCrocAttack.org), which has collected data on recorded alligator and crocodile attacks across the world. To track down other documented incidents, they searched online and in the academic literature, and also reached out to state fish and wildlife agencies. In total, they analyzed 270 gator bite incidents across 11 states recorded between 1734 and 2021, 44 of which were fatal. The researchers then categorized the behaviors that people were engaged in right before the bite by their level of risk. In 96% of the incidents, the bites only happened after the person had taken some sort of “risky human behavior,” with roughly half involving a moderate level of risk. These risks included people not keeping a close eye on their children, people ignoring posted signs warning about gators in the water, or “contact while inebriated.” Only rarely did gators bite someone with no provocation, such as someone simply walking on a road, and those bites tended to cause less severe injuries (none of the “no-risk” bites were fatal). The findings,publishedin the journal Human-Wildlife Interactions, suggest that most gator bites shouldn’t be viewed as “attacks” in the first place, according to the authors. And they argue that nearly all incidents can be prevented so long as people take the appropriate precautions around alligators. âThe takeaway lesson from this study is that many bites can be prevented if humans are aware of their surroundings and minimize risky behaviors such as walking small pets near bodies of water or swimming where alligators are known to be present,â said study researcher Frank Mazzotti, professor of wildlife ecology at the UF/IFAS Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center. Gators arefoundthroughout Florida and parts of the U.S. southeast, particularly along coastal wetlands. They’re known to be more active and territorial during their mating season, which starts in April and extends through June.

    "title": "UnitedHealth Shares Plummet as Too Many People Go to the Doctor",
    "article_text": "UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health, saw its stock price plummet over 20% Thursday morning after the healthcare giant downgraded expected performance for the year. The company’s executives explained on a call with analystsThursdaythat they had been surprised by increased use of physician and outpatient services within UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Advantage business. UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty called the company’s performance “unusual and unacceptable,” while CFO John Rex said he was “extremely disappointed” to share the news of the company’s outlook with analysts. “Within UnitedHealthcare, pressure was largely contained within the senior business where we saw a sharp increase in care activities that became apparent as we closed out the quarter,” Rex said. Rex said the company would now expect adjusted earnings of $26 to $26.50 per share. As recently as January, the company was expecting adjusted earnings of $29.50 to $30, according to theWall Street Journal. The executives were asked about President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have the potential to hit the pharmaceutical side of UnitedHealth’s business. CEO Witty said he felt “pretty good” that various price protections in place through existing contracts would help insulate the company, something that’s been pointed out by other health care experts who believe the immediate impacts won’t be felt by the health care giants themselves in the short term. “In fact, I’d say better than pretty good in terms of the degrees of price protection mechanisms we have in preexisting contracts and also various pieces of legislation, which also limit the ability of manufacturers to pass price increases down through the system,” said Witty. UnitedHealth said that new technologies would allow the company to become more efficient and help deliver better financial results in the future. “Looking ahead, we see a long runway for further technology advances that will translate to more and sustained operating efficiency, which in turn drives opportunity for further innovation and advancements in the company and across the industry,” said Rex. President Trump’s administration recently announced a 5.06% rate increase for Medicare Advantage plans next year, much higher than the 2.23% that the Biden administration had proposed. That bump is expected to raise $25 billion in additional revenue for health care companies, according to theJournal. That sent health insurer stocks soaring earlier this month. UnitedHealth reported net income of $6.47 billion for the first quarter, according to the Journal. UnitedHealth’s stock price is down over 22% on the day at the time of this writing, trading at just over $453 per share. The stock currently sits down 10% from where it was a year ago.

    "title": "Evanescence’s ‘Afterlife’ Music Video Sneaks in a Devil May Cry Season 2 First Look",
    "article_text": "Netflix’sDevil May Cryanime has become the epitome of early aughts edge thanks to its fittingly bold choice to infuse the soundtrack with iconic emo and nu-metal acts likeLimp Bizkit,Papa Roach, andEvanescence. Now, the symbiotic relationship between the show and its music has taken on new forms because the music video for Evanescence’s latest track is giving fans a first look at what its titular demon-killing hero will look like in the show’supcoming second season. Scattered throughout Evanescence’s music video for “Afterlife” are glimpses of Danteâs fresh look, a fitting tease for fans eagerly awaiting the second season ofDevil May Cry. The song itself left a lasting impact on the anime, earning praise for its emotional weight inthe anime’s best episodeand swiftly inspiringNetflixâs own AMV tribute. While Netflixâs announcement poster had already hinted at Danteâs post-timeskip appearanceâsubtly revealing longer hair and possibly his rightful ownership of the legendary pistols, Ebony and Ivoryâthe music video offers the clearest look yet. Granted, it’s through a clip projected onto a hanging blanket sheet, but as the fighting game community likes to say, we take those. Between striking, moody atmospheric shots of frontwoman Amy Lee passionately belting out lyrics to “Afterlife” alongside her bandmates in a crimson-lit room, the music video cuts to Dante effortlessly showcasing his gunslinging prowess at a shooting range. Heâs pulling off every flashy trick in the bookâflipping his pistols behind his back, flashing a cocky grin as if Google Earth is always watchingâwhile a nameless Darkcom soldier and researcher observe from the sidelines. While the music video appears not to offer much outside sneaky video game easter egg nods toTony RedgraveâDante’s aliasâ it does leave some crumbs of story details following the show’s explosive finale, which saw Dante frozen in a cryogenic chamber. Picking up on the few clues the music video has laid out, Darkcom Uno reversed their season finale decision, ditching their plan to sideline Dante for humanityâs sake and instead reuniting with him to once again take on the fate of the world. Given that Lady is nowhere to be seen during this pivotal moment, thereâs no doubt Dante will take the opportunity to serve up an all-you-can-eat buffet of âI told you soâsâ onceDevil May Cryâs second season arrives. In io9’s review forDevil May Cryseason 1, we said Netflix and studio Mir hit the jackpot with its new adaptation of Capcom’s hack-and-slash franchise, writing, “in eight episodes,Devil May Cryreinvents the Capcom video game series, offering an adaptation that seamlessly integrates essential elements of its established canon while introducing novel and unique aspects into the showâs DNA that are so captivating they demand a second season.” All eight episodes ofDevil May Cryare streaming on Netflix.

    "title": "Google Is Operating an Ad Tech Monopoly, Judge Rules",
    "article_text": "Google is starting to have a monopoly on getting called out for having a monopoly. For the second time in under one year, the tech giant has been deemed to be operating an illegal monopoly, this time for its online advertising technology. Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a 115-page ruling on Thursday that found Google violated antitrust laws to establish a firm hold over the online advertising space, allowing the company to charge higher prices and keep a larger portion of ad sales. In his ruling, Judge Brinkema said that Google was âwillfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly powerâ over parts of the web advertising business by connecting its ad server business, DoubleClick, used by publishers to sell ads on their platforms, to its ad exchange operations, Google AdX, which sells ad space off auction-style to the highest bidder. That combination, the judge found, created a “durable and âpredominant share of the marketâ that is protected by high barriers both to entry and expansion.” The judge also found that this monopolistic hold over the online ad space “substantially harmed Googleâs publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.” The findings of the court suggest Google had a vice grip over the online advertising business. Asnoted by Search Engine Journal, the case showed that from 2018 to 2022, Google controlled about 91% of the worldwide publisher ad server market. It also handled as much as 65% of all ad placement transactions, which was about nine times larger than the next closest competitor. With that control, Google was able to squeeze users for 20% of the transaction cost, which it pocketed, compared to competitors taking about 10%. Judge Brinkema’s ruling found Google âliable under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Actâ for its monopolistic behaviors in the ad tech tool and exchange businesses, but the judge did dismiss another charge that Google had operated a monopoly in ad networks. âWe won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs said in a statement to Gizmodo. “The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, donât harm competition. We disagree with the Courtâs decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.â Do what you will with that interpretation, but what comes next is the remedies stage, which could lead to the potential breakup of Google’s adtech operations. In fact, that’s what the Department of Justice has asked the court to do, forcing the company to sell off some of the ad tech operations that it has amassed during its market-cornering days. The potential resolution to this case could reshape a significant portion of Google’s profit centers.Per the New York Times, Google’s Ad Manager generated $31 billion in 2023, about one-tenth of parent company Alphabet’s total revenue. It could also represent a redo for the government, which allowed Google toacquire DoubleClick back in 2007 for $3.1 billionwithout any intervention from agencies that enforce antitrust. The ruling opens a new front for Google’s fight to keep itself together. On top of this latest finding of monopolistic behavior, Google is staring down a hearing that could result in the courts forcing it to break up its search operations, stemming from a ruling last August that the company operates a monopoly in that space, too. The hearings on how to remedy that case will start this coming Monday. With this latest finding in the adtech space, which Google will challenge, it’s increasingly starting to look like Alphabet will be losing some letters soon.

    "article_text": "The Wheel of Time‘sseason threefinale just dropped on Prime Video, but we won’t be spoiling any plot points here. Instead, we’re frantically trying to figure out which weave will properly channel the One Power and bring a fourth season into existence. No matter what, it’ll involve showrunnerRafe Judkins,who told io9before the season began that he already knows how he wants to wrap up his adaptation of Robert Jordan’s epic fantasy book seriesâwith hopes of telling “the whole story.” Now that fans have gotten to the end of season threeâit’s not a spoiler to say there are somemassivedangling threads left after the finaleâhe’s revealing a bit more about what he envisions forWheel of Time‘s future. Speaking tothe Hollywood Reporter, Judkins admitted the finale contains “a lot of place-setting for the next season.” As of this writing, Prime Video has yet to announce season four, but Judkins already has the story wheels in motion. “Weâve definitely laid the pieces for a few [villainous] Forsaken to appear in next season who are new and maybe not so new that you will be excited to see on screen,” he told THR. “I think I can say that much. The interplay of the Forsaken is really exciting and interesting in the books, and I think we want to continue that in the show and continue to meet new members of this group.” If Amazon decides it wants a fourth seasonâwell, that might not be enough, actually. “I really want to deliver this full series,” Judkins said “[And] Amazon [feels] like a place where they do want to invest in shows for the long term. Thereâs not a lot of places doing that anymore. ForWheel of Time, itâs really important for us to be somewhere that does want to invest in shows for the long term and not just for the splash and leave. So I am hopeful that we will get to finish this story. I think itâs a story that in many ways is important because of its length, and because it gets better as it goes.” While Judkins believes “the books get better as they go and the show is getting better as it goes,” he’s also realistic about being part of the TV business. “The history of television is that its strength is long-form storytelling; that you stick with it and you love these characters and you follow them through 60 to 100 hours … So Iâm hopeful for our industry that shows likeWheel of TimeÂdo get to tell the whole story. I think itâs important for television. Itâs what we do best and so we should be finishing these stories.” The Wheel of Timeseasons 1-3 are now streaming on Prime Video. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "I don't know why early 2000s internet is suddenly back, but both Ask a Ninja and Homestar Runner have just uploaded new videos",
    "article_text": "What's going on? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What year is it?The ninja behind early 2000s internet video series Ask a Ninja clearly anticipated the reflexive reaction to his first new video in nine years, leading off with an instant parry. \"What yearisn'tit?\" he says within the first three seconds. \"If you're still believing in time, my friend, I don't know what to tell you. Have you ever heard of the internet? Everything lasts forever on the internet! Except MySpace photos, or if you had a Flickr Pro account. 2025, I'm still alive!\" I cannot believe that the Ask a Ninja guy looks and sounds exactly the same as he did 20 years ago, when pirates vs. ninjas and the general concept of bacon were the most popular topics on the internet. Ask a Ninja sprang forth from the innocent time when memes lasted for years instead of days and putting on a balaclava, doing a funny voice and uploading 360p videos couldget you a book dealand lead to youinterviewing Will Ferrell. Seeing him suddenly pop up and do new jokes in 2025 makes me feel incredibly old. That balaclava better be hiding some gray hair. But I think it's also… making me happy? Maybe confused.Unsettled. Yesterday I was prepared to write the return of Ask a Ninja off as a freak incident, but maybe there's something in the water (or in the tubes), because todayHomestar Runner published a new videocelebrating its 25th year online. It's a song called \"Back to a website,\" and appropriately celebrates a time when \"the whole internet wasn't just on four websites on peoples' phones.\" I have some deep, unhealed wounds from being in high school when Homestar Runner was considered peak comedy by 15-year-olds—I would really be okay going the rest of my life without hearing Strong Bad's voice—but this song still speaks to me. As PC Gamer's Joshua Wolensrecently advocated, the internet was a richer place to be when it was made up of a million thriving pockets of weirdos with no monolithic social media corralling everyone into the same centralized space. But I'm actually a little optimistic about what feels to me like a groundswell of interest in rebuilding some version of the 2000s internet withmore personal blogsanddecentralized social mediathat values people over platforms. In the last year I've seen more people adopt the concept of \"POSSE,\" or Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere;push back against Substack's attempt to own newslettersin favor of independent publishing; and goall-in on making the fragmented web easier to navigate. Maybe the Homestar Runner video is simply a cheeky way to celebrate the site's longevity, but \"let's go back to a website\" manages to feel like quite a timely message to me in 2025. There are some good jokes in there about web rings, guest books and hit counters, quaint fossils of the early internet. Yet Homestarrunner.com still uses Flash courtesy of open source emulatorRuffle, and it's proof the video has a point. Clicking around that website is justfunin a way that most sites today are not. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Ask a Ninja's return video is timely in its own way. \"Is the ninja community being affected by tariffs?\" he's asked, which gets a smooth pivot to \"Ninjas are way more affected bytear-offs—we have to pay an extra duty for every arm that we remove!\" I'm not saying that the ninja returned from his long slumber because the state of the world was so bad it awoke him in grand Arthurian tradition just when we needed him most. But his second Return Era video, released three days ago, is titled \"Zune vs iPod\"—clearly this is a man who knows how to deploy the healing power of Remembering 2009. I'm not sure two incidents are enough to declare a trend, but be on the lookout for the Potter Puppet Pals or the Peanut Butter Jelly Time banana to reappear at any moment. Ifthisisn't proof enough the early 2000s internet is making a comeback, I don't know what is.

    "title": "Co-op submarine survival simulator Barotrauma has a free weekend on Steam, so dive in with friends and experience the most comically horrifying deaths you can imagine",
    "article_text": "It's the first free weekend for the submarine horror game since it went 1.0 in 2023. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Quick story about the most nightmarish death I've ever experienced in a videogame: I was playingBarotrauma, the submarine survival simulator where you explore oceans on alien worlds. I'd left the sub and was swimming around in the inky black waters to investigate some sunken ruins, when I noticed I was out of air. Frantically, I swapped my empty oxygen tank with a full one. At least I meant to do that. What I actually slotted into my oxygen supply was a fuel tank for my welding torch. Just imagine being submerged in the dark, freezing cold waters of a pitch-black ocean on an alien planet, and taking a big panicky lungful of what you expect will be air but is actually welding fuel. Horrible.Horrible.But pretty funny, too, and a teaching moment. I never mixed up my tanks again. That's my sales pitch for trying Barotrauma, the always spooky but frequently hilarious 2D survival game that's currently hosting a free weekend on Steam. Dive in and play from now until Monday, completely for free. There's a bonus, too: if you like it (I suspect you will) it's on sale for 50% off until April 26. It's great timing because Barotrauma recently introduced a bunch of new stuff in itsCalm Before the Storm update, like a new mission spanning three undersea ruins and an outpost that's perfect for PvP deathmatch, making the grim chaos of the game \"even darker, more disturbed, and violent,\" according to developer FakeFish. It's already pretty darn disturbed, if you ask me. Along with inhaling welding fuel, I was also beaten up and imprisoned in the sub's airlock by a co-op teammate, though to be fair, Ihadput on a clown mask and tried injecting him with a bunch of random syringes from the med bay. (Barotrauma isn't strictly co-op, there's a \"traitor\" mode where you can sabotage your team, something I wasn't very good at.) Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I was also eaten by an enormous sea monster while swimming, mistook a plasma cutter for a welding torch while trying to repair holes in the hull (naturally, the cutter just made the holes bigger), got beaten to death by an alien hermit crab, and got cut in half by a rapidly closing submarine door. All horrible ways to go, but all pretty funny, too. In related news, FakeFish announced its next co-op survival game just last week, though this one swaps out the submarine for a train and 2D sidescrolling for FPS action. It's calledFrostrail—but it won't be along until sometime next year, so checking outBarotraumafor the free weekend is your best bet for some chilling but silly co-op fun. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "Thanks to Baldur's Gate 3's new Swashbuckler subclass, it no longer sucks to be a pure Rogue",
    "article_text": "A three-level dip no longer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I love being a sneaky, thiefy guy in an RPG, but Rogues have always been in a really weird spot in Baldur's Gate 3. Thief and Assassin are two of the strongest three or four-level multiclass components in the game, but there's basically been no reason to stick with them beyond that. Thief's extra bonus action and Assassin's surprise round perks are transformative, but they don't get much worth writing home about at higher levels. While Sneak Attack precipitously increases in power throughout the game, Rogues are just fundamentally hampered by being weapon damage-based characters that don't receiveExtra Attack. A full 12-level Rogue is always weaker than a multiclass Bard/Rogue, Fighter/Rogue, or Ranger/Rogue, and you reallyfeelstifled not being able to attack as many times per round. With Patch 8'sSwashbucklersubclass, Rogues finally have an alternative. A full 12-level Swashbuckler is not only seriously strong and Honour mode ready, they nail a unique class fantasy while being fun and engaging to play. The biggest coup is the Swashbuckler's Dirty Trick abilities at level four. All three have their uses, butFlick o' the Wristis the real heat: Potentially disarm an enemy without worrying about expending resources, and you crucially do full weapon damage in the process. Swashbucklers don't get Extra Attack proper, but they can instead make a full main-hand attack with a Bonus Action, making up the difference. What's more, Swashbucklers get this not-quite-but-still-kinda Extra Attack a full level before Fighters et al. acquire the real thing, and in the dog days of early to mid Act 1, that's a huge advantage. Using your Bonus Actions on Dirty Tricks makes dual wielding less desirable for anything other than an offhand stat stick (likeCrimson MischiefwithBloodthirstin the late game), but this does lend the Swashbuckler to using the fun, strong, class-appropriateDuellist's Prerogativerapier. Another strong strategy I've heard is grabbing theGreat Weapon Masterfeat (+10 damage, -5 accuracy with two-handed weapons) and pairing it with thePhalar Aluvelongsword, the only Finesse (and thus Swashbuckler-friendly) weapon in the game that can still be two-handed, activating the feat. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Going the distance with Rogue for a full 12 levels also means Sneak Attack can come alive in a way it just doesn't with a quick dip: 6d6 extra damage per round for a 12-level Swash as opposed to 2d6 on a three-level jaunt. Swashbucklers' Rakish Sneak Attack also lets them land them with no set-up⁠—less important with the plentiful sources of advantage in the late game, but a real boon in Act 1. Swashbucklers' Charisma focus⁠—it determines the saving throw difficulty on their Dirty Tricks⁠—also lends them to taking one multiclass dip in particular, theHexblade. This would still keep the Rogue center stage and grant access to the full gamut of their abilities and 6d6 Sneak Attack. A Swashbuckler 11 / Hexblade 1 just makes sense, consolidating weapon accuracy and damage under Charisma, and it also grants access to the OPBooming Bladecantrip. After testing this out in Act 1 myself, I'd recommend starting as a Rogue and only grabbing Hexblade at level 5, so as to not delay those juicy Dirty Tricks. But even without a Hexblade's rizz-based melee combat, a high-Dexterity, high-Charisma pure Swashbuckler promises to be an enjoyable, powerful way to play through Baldur's Gate 3, nailing that RPG sweet spot of \"fun to roleplay\" and \"feels really good in combat.\" Larian finally liberated pure Rogue from being a self-imposed challenge of a character.

    "article_text": "Here's your chance to see what it's all about. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was a little surprised when Sloclap, the maker of fighting gamesAbsolverandSifu, announced in 2024 that its next project was a multiplayer soccer game called Rematch. It's not what I'd call an obvious fit, but it does look to be shaping up to be a very good game, and this weekend you'll be able to get a taste of what it's like in an open beta set to start on April 18. Rematch takes a different approach to soccer than most other videogame translations: It's a multiplayer-exclusive game in which each person controls a single player on the field. That makes teamwork and coordination essential, because even when you don't have the ball you have to maintain position and keep up with the flow of play to ensure you're ready to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. It's also a very streamlined take on the sport, with no offsides or fouls, which aims to keep the action flowing. \"You are always engaged,\" Sloclap said when Rematch was first announced. \"You cannot drop the pad for even half a second because you'll always have to reposition yourself to serve the action and be where you should be.\" I was a little dubious about the whole thing, but Sloclap may be onto something here. \"Every now and then a game comes along that seems unassuming at first but totally blows away all of your expectations and reveals itself to be something special,\" Daneilla Lucas wrote in a recenthands-on preview. \"Rematch is one of those games.\" Rematch willcost $30 at launch, a bold move that may put off some players accustomed to free-to-play multiplayer. This open beta could put some price-based concerns to rest: It's not the complete package but itisfree, and you can put the boots to the game to your heart's content and see if it lives up to its early billing. To get into the Rematch beta, head around toSteamand hit the \"request access\" button. Sloclap said access to everyone who signs up will be granted gradually, \"as long as the servers hold,\" and everyone should be in by Friday evening or early Saturday at the latest. The duration of the beta has also been extended: It was originally only meant to run for a day but will instead run until 8 am UTC on April 21. Rematch is set to go fully live on June 19.

    "title": "Rivals Hover League is the new standard for vehicular arena-based combat",
    "article_text": "No offers found Sponsor Content Created With Hellcase A high-octane experience like nothing you've ever seen before: hover hard, hit harder. Rivals Hover Leagueis a new vehicular combat game where you laugh in the face of gravity and compete to become the galaxy's top pilot. If you like Rocket League but occasionally think your opponents could use a rocket up their exhaust pipe, this is the fast-paced new contender for you. Rivals Hover League (RHL) has elements of co-op shooters and a new trailer revealed at Galaxies Showcase demonstrates the different hover vehicle classes and playstyles each brings. The ambush-oriented Hunter can pop out of nowhere and get the jump on enemies, or perhaps you prefer the precision of the one shot / one kill Sniper? For those who just want power and pace there's the Raider, but I think I'll be going for death from above with Jet. Developer EF Games, founded by the Ruipérez brothers Joaquín and Gonzalo, builds on their extensive experience leading Estudiofuture and RHL is being built-out with care by a small but talented group, blending indie spirit with high ambitions. PCG got the chance to put some questions to the studio about this ambitious project, and here's the low-down. PCG: What was the first vehicle you developed for RHL? EF Games: The very first vehicle we developed was Jet, which served as the baseline for our original gameplay. Initially, our game featured only one main vehicle, customizable through various weapon loadouts. You could say all other vehicles naturally evolved from this initial concept. The second vehicle we modeled was Hunter, which actually helped us define the final artistic style of the vehicles and the game. What motivated you to develop the different vehicle classes? We're huge fans of games like Overwatch, which brilliantly create drastically different experiences depending on your character choice. We wanted to adapt this concept into RHL, embracing all the strategic depth and team dynamics it implies. Additionally, this approach allowed us to experiment with a wide variety of fun and exciting shooting and “driving” mechanics! What is your favorite/top-pick to play and the reason? Our ultimate goal is that every type of player finds their ideal vehicle. Everyone at the office has their personal favorite, and if someone hasn’t found theirs yet… well, that's a sign we still need to create it! That being said, as the game director, my current favorite (changes each month) is the Mech, because I love its ability to swiftly move from one side of the arena to another, feeling a bit like something out of Attack on Titan. Our CEO, however, prefers the Jet, mainly because he's obsessed with laying mines and, between you and me, because it's probably the easiest to use! Any fun facts you’d like to share? The origins of RHL are quite the story. Initially, we set out to remake and port a previous VR game of ours called Fusion Wars to PC VR. To improve the game we began exploring lots of crazy ideas and mechanics to enhance the driving experience. Little by little, we realized just how fun and promising these new systems were. Eventually, we decided to leave VR behind altogether to fully unleash the acrobatic and dynamic gameplay our new mechanics enabled, giving birth to Rivals Hover League as you know it today! Wishlist Rivals Hover Leagueandjoin the official Discord nowto stay in-the-loop on updates, playtest opportunities, and launch news (you can also follow the gameon YouTube,X / Twitter, andTiktok). This is a community-driven project where the devs are listening, and player feedback will shape the final game, so this is your chance to get in on the ground floor.

    "title": "22-year-old MMO MapleStory is getting the 'old school' treatment with the original lead game designer in charge of new classic servers",
    "article_text": "MapleStory Classic World was revealed as part of the game's 20th anniversary. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's something about taking long-running MMOs back to their roots that fans really seem to like.Old School Runescape, a version of the venerable Jagex MMO that recreates the game as it was in 2007, is enduringly popular, and when Blizzard announcedWorld of Warcraft Classicin 2018, that was abigdeal. Now MapleStory is set to join the ranks with the upcoming Classic World, \"a nostalgic experience crafted just for Global MapleStory players.\" MapleStory hasn't got a lot of attention around these parts, but it's a remarkably successful game that's been running for more than 20 years. We recently cited it alongside EverQuest and Ultima Online as one of the few live service games \"that havepassed the test of time\"—putting it mildly, I think—and it continues to be regularly updated on Steam, where it draws several thousand concurrent players at any given moment. Those years gone by are definitely visible in MapleStory's gameplay, but despite its aged look MapleStory has inevitably changed and evolved over the past two decades, and what it is now is not what it was then. Which is where Classic World comes in: Nexon America chief product officer Hanbyeol Oh, known to fans as Inkwell, says it will be \"a faithful recreation of the old school MapleStory experience, built by a team that understands what made early MapleStory so special.\" That team includes Miyoung \"Nemi\" Oh,lead game designeron MapleStory at original developer Wizet in the years leading up to and immediately after its launch, who's taking on the same role for MapleStory Classic Worlds. \"We've been planning this for a long time and we want to create a meaningful connection between the past and present,\" Miyoung Oh says. \"Classic World will be a special milestone for the 20th anniversary. Just like the Heroic and Interactive Worlds in Global MapleStory, Classic World will be a full part of GMS. Players will be able to create brand new characters and experience a faithful recreation of early MapleStory while also enjoying quality of life additions from GMS to even further enhance the player experience. \"We hope to recreate all the features and qualities that made early MapleStory special, while also looking toward the future and collaborating with fellow maplers to create the best classic world together.\" I'm inclined to think that a lot of the desire for throwback MMOs is driven by nostalgia: Not necessarily a yearning for the way the game was 20 years ago, but for the waywewere, and the emotions and experiences we enjoyed when all this stuff was exciting and new. Alas, we can't go back, but it turns out that in at least some instances, taking the games back to those long-gone days is not a terrible compromise—there's some refreshing challenge to be found in the sharp points and rough edges of the early oughts. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Forget Baldur's Gate 3's new subclasses: Patch 8's most disgusting power gamer combo is the Rock That Makes You Stupid paired with a sneakily revamped level 2 spell",
    "article_text": "Resonance Stone + Shadow Blade = Sicko Mode. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The marquee additions in Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8 are probablyphoto mode, theHexbladesubclass, and theBooming Bladecantrip, but there's also a new sicko combo that's taken the BG3 Builds subreddit by storm:Shadow BladeplusResonance Stone. Neither of these are fully new, but Patch 8 did a complete revamp on Shadow Blade, transforming it from an interesting novelty into a spell you can hang a full build on. Resonance Stone is unchanged, but this longtime powergamer's delight has found its perfect partner in the new Shadow Blade, and I think I've finally settled on my Patch 8 Honour Mode character because of it. Resonance Stone is the Jock Rock, the Rock that Makes You Stupid. It's some kind of Mind Flayer tchotchke you can find in Act 2's Illithid Colony, in the room with all the zombies and the brain-reading head machine (if you know, you know). The Resonance Stone projects an AOE field that gives everyone in it (friend or foe) the \"Steeped in Bliss\" debuff: Disadvantage on mental saving throws (Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma), advantage on physical checks, and, crucially, vulnerability to psychic damage⁠—all psychic damage inflicted on anyone in the bubble is doubled. Until now, consistent sources of psychic damage to take advantage of this were relatively rare:Open Hand Monks, certainGithyanki weapons, and theStrange Conduit Ring, to name a few. The Shadow Blade spell was always interesting: Summon an equipable shortsword that does 2d8 psychic damage (plus your melee ability modifier), but it could only be cast via asingle item in Act 2, and it required concentration, meaning you could lose it on getting damaged or stunned. But now Shadow Blade is a different beast: Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards can not only learn it as a normal level two spell, they can upcast it with higher level spell slots to improve its damage. That none-too-shabby 2d8 Psychic damage gets boosted to 3d8 or 4d8 with level three and five spell slots respectively. It also, crucially, no longer requires concentration⁠—once you've summoned the Shadow Blade, it just sticks around until a long rest. Basically, we're in spellsword heaven. Shadow Blade starts out incredibly strong even at level three⁠—when you first get second level spells⁠—outclassing nearly every other weapon in Act 1, and it only gets better. Pair it with the Resonance Stone, and you're looking at a minimum of 8-64 damage on every attack with the max-upcasted version of Shadow Blade. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are all kinds of other synergies to take advantage of as well: The Shadow Blade being a short sword means you can put a useful stat stick like theKnife of the Undermountain Kingin your offhand, and the large dumber of dice at play means that critical hits, as well as theSavage Attackerfeat, become especially powerful. Of course, you can stillBooming Bladeto your heart's content with this summoned sword. Also, it just has to be said: The summoned mind-sword is just extremely cool conceptually. There is one achilles heel here, though: Psychic damage-immune enemies, most notablyGrymand theSteel Watchers, but with foreknowledge you can plan around these particular fights. The new Bladesinger is primed to take advantage of this one, as could some manner of Sorcerer-Paladin multiclass, but I'm feeling Hexblade: I'll be opting for a Hexblade 9 / Champion Fighter 3 build for maximum crit hit action. However you choose to take advantage, it's seriously boom(ing blade) times for spellswords in BG3.

    "title": "Path of Exile 2's 0.2 update wasn't all bad: The endgame finally feels like it's headed in the right direction",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When Path of Exile 2 first hit early access last December, its endgame was a bit… sparse. Despite delaying development on acts 4-6 to ship the game with more systems in place, the Atlas of Worlds felt like navigating an endless sea of stuff I didn't really want to do in order to get to maps that were actually worth my time. Grinding Gear Games has made a ton of changes with its 0.2 update Dawn of the Hunt. On the whole, theupdate was not popular(an understatement), but it did make some necessary tweaks, especially to the endgame. The Atlas of Worlds still needs a lot of work, but it's headed in the right direction. For the uninitiated, Path of Exile 2 basically exists as two games: The campaign, and the Atlas of Worlds. The Atlas is a procedurally generated, essentially infinite web of nodes, each representing a map full of monsters to kill. Beat the map, and you can progress through the Atlas and discover more of its secrets. Maps get harder and harder, from tier 1 to tier 15, and for the truly devoted, you can start juicing your maps with all kinds of modifiers that will try to kill you in order to get more rewards. Almost every change GGG made with 0.2 has made mapping more interesting. As you progress, you'll complete quests that give you Atlas passive points—essentially another skill tree, but instead of being for your character, it's for your Atlas. These points are a huge boon, offering things like more monsters, rarer loot, and increased odds to find useful stuff like essences and strongboxes. Almost every change GGG made with 0.2 has made mapping more interesting. On initial release, you had to do a set amount of maps at each tier to get your points, which was… well, it was boring. Now, you've got to traverse the Atlas and find areas of corruption. Corrupted areas offer more monsters, more loot, and at their center lies a nexus. Clear the nexus and the area will become cleansed and you'll get a couple points for your Atlas tree. This change gave us areasonto want to explore the edges of the Atlas. Instead of just grinding whatever map was closest as quickly as I could, on this patch I found myself scouring the edges of the Atlas for signs of corruption, little hints in the mist. It gave the experience a sense of purpose, and the areas of corruption themselves are more interesting—more monsters, better loot, and a miniboss to fight. Another huge gripe I had about PoE2 was that the maps weregigantic, and in order to clear them you had to kill all the rare monsters. That meant that if you missed some little jerkwad hiding in a bush at the start of the level, sometimes you had to backtrack and waste a bunch of time trying to find him. Now, they show all the rare monsters on your minimap right from the beginning. Technically, it hasn't made the maps any smaller, but now theyfeelsmaller because I don't have to kick over every rock and wander back and forth as much. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All of this wandering and backtracking was made a lot worse by the fact that if you died in a map, you had to start the whole thing over again (without any of the fancy added content it may have had). This made dying feelawful, especially when the animation still popped up with our six portals like in PoE1. They were just sittin' there, taunting us. In 0.2 we can respawn a few times per map without losing our progress or rewards, getting fewer and fewer tries the more we juice the map with explicits. I can't stress enough what an incredible change this is. It completely altered the feel of mapping for me. If your build wasn't humming just yet, mapping before felt like agony—roaming through huge maps just hoping some random ground effect didn't oneshot you while you tried to loot something and having to redo areas and whole maps over again for less loot. Now it feels much less punishing. The way towers and tablets work has also been vastly improved. By reducing the number of towers and increasing their impact, it's made them more special. I used to have to do a ton of busywork to set up good areas to farm in—beat maps to a cluster of towers, clear them, load tablets,thenfarm good stuff. I was running 10-15 maps of low reward to get to 5 or 6 I actually wanted to run. Now the areas covered by the towers are huge, and my Atlas looks nice and juicy basically all the time. GGG has also introduced some new unique maps, which you'll need to clear to get your final 10 points. These are pretty cool, and offer another interesting thing to go and find on the Atlas. I especially like the Silent Cave, which has a bunch of essence monsters. Kill them and the boss at the end gets their modifiers, which means the more loot you want the more you risk loading her up with the power to kill you. Finally, they've made interacting with the pinnacle bosses much better. On initial release, farming enough material to go and challenge one of the big bosses took a huge amount of time, and you only got one shot to kill them. This left more points (each of the five pinnacle bosses also have their own skill trees that make their mechanics more rewarding) gated behind not only a savage grind, but a tough boss fight that you never really got to learn. I've written beforethat if Path of Exile 2 wants us to have meaningful combat with challenging boss encounters, they need to give us time to do it. GGG has made big steps here by allowing us to try them as many times as we want, with fewer and fewer tries as we scale up the difficulty. This solves one of my biggest problems with 0.1, because I would just never want to go and fight the bosses—risking a fortune in fragments to go and get oneshot by some ability I didn't know they had feltawful. The only strategy that made any sense was to have enough damage to kill the boss before they did anything, which wasted all the potential fun of an interesting boss with cool mechanics. All in all, the changes to the endgame mark a tremendous improvement. There's still a lot of work to be done, but GGG has shown us again that it hears our feedback and is working to make things better. This is still a game in early access, we're lacking half the campaign, and the Atlas still feels like it could use more interesting stuff to go find at the edges of madness. But we're on the path.

    "article_text": "Abiotic Factor is getting a $10 price increase just before it's 1.0 launch, but you can save $15 if you grab it in April. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We had a tough call last year awarding our GOTY for best survival game—it ultimately went to single-player driving survival game Pacific Drive, but only by a razor thin margin because of these two words: Abiotic Factor. Abiotic Factoris basically what would happen if all those unfortunate science nerds Gordon Freeman left behind in the first Half-Life game starred in their own co-op survival adventure: you cobble together weapons and gear from space science parts, battle horrifying interdimensional monsters, and survive in a massive secret scientific complex. It is, quite simply, a great game. To quote Morgan, who fell in love the moment he strapped a couch cushion to his chest and called it body armor: \"Abiotic Factor restored my faith in survival games.\" If you've had your eye on it but haven't yet bought it, here's some pretty critical news: the price of Abiotic Factor is going up by $10 on May 1. That's not actually bad news, though, it's good: it means the Abiotic Factor 1.0 \"Cold Fusion\" update, which adds loads of new craftable gear and an entire wing of the science facility, is on the brink of release. Plus, developer Deep Field Games is letting you know about the price change a full two weeks in advance (thank you!) so you've got a chance to grab it before that happens. Still want more good news? Abiotic Factor is on sale between now and the end of April, so not only are you getting it for the early access price, you're saving another 20% on top of that. So really, you're getting a game that will be priced at $34.99 in a couple weeks for a mere $19.99 today. And yet, there's more. Anyone who buys Abiotic Factor in early access (including those who bought it already) will receive the Supporter's Edition for free—though what's in that edition hasn't been revealed yet (Deep Field Games says it will be detailed in an upcoming blog). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If you'd like all that information I just gave you but in an extremely enjoyable video format, please check out Abiotic Factor's pricing announcement below, which will explain everything, including why the price is $34.99 and not $80 (\"We're not Nintendo\") or even $40 (\"The economy's sick. People have less money for games.\") Then go buy Abiotic Factor if you haven't already.

    "article_text": "Don't like it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Some Discord users are now being asked to scan their faces or IDs to verify their age group when they attempt to view sensitive content. While some might call this a chilling advancement of the global surveillance apparatus, Discord says these new \"features\" are \"an experiment\" that only applies to users in the United Kingdom and Australia, which recently passed laws requiring more rigorous age verification on platforms that might expose children to harmful content. On itssupport pagedescribing the new verification procedure, Discord says users may be asked to verify their age when they either encounter \"content flagged by our sensitive media filter\" or try to modify their sensitive content filter settings. When asked, users will be presented with two methods for age verification. First, they can allow Discord to scan their face with their device's camera. If, hypothetically, the user finds it disagreeable to let the gamer group chat app analyze their facial features, they can instead scan a QR code with their phone, which leads to a page where they can upload a scan of their government-issued identification as proof of their age group. After providing either a face or ID scan, the user will receive a notification about their age verification status via a DM from Discord's official profile. Discord says the process \"typically takes just a few minutes.\" Users will only need to verify their age once, but can retry the process or submit an appeal if they believe their age has been verified incorrectly. Recent years have seen the UK and Australia join a trend of governments adopting stricter age verification requirements for web platforms with the intent of protecting children from harmful content. In 2023, the UK's Online Safety Act entered into law, requiring websites and platforms that might host explicit content to enforce\"robust\" user age limits. Last year, Australia's parliamentpassed a banpreventing children under 16 from using social media. The ban is due to take effect in December 2025. While the purported intent of these measures is to protect children, digital rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation say that they undermine online privacy, security, and free expression, going so far ascalling the Online Safety Act\"a blueprint for oppression around the world\"—in part due totheir relianceon \"unreliable tools like biometric scanners.\" Discord, at least, says it won't maintain a record of age verification scans. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The information you share to power the age verification method that you choose is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or its vendor,\" Discord says. \"For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.\" Based on screenshots on the support page, the age verification vendors in question are k-ID and Veratad. Thek-ID websitesays it provides technology that \"enables publishers and platforms to stay compliant with the latest global privacy and safety regulations.\" It's also got a lot of imagery with that pseudo-Pixar AI-generated stink on it, including one boy withtruly inscrutable footwear. Veratad, meanwhile, says it provides \"customer identity verification solutions\" by \"bringing together the World's most disruptive IDV tech.\" To soothe the fears of anyone who might be wondering what \"disruption\" entails when it involves processing your facial geometry, Veratad provides a reassuring image of a computer spraying fluorescent dots all over a guy's face like it's calculating a targeting solution for its onboard ordnance package.

    "title": "RuneScape: Dragonwilds skill trees and levelling guide",
    "article_text": "All the special unlocks in each skill tree and how to grind all your skills just a little faster. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It wouldn't be a RuneScape game without level grinding, andRuneScape: Dragonwildsmixes XP grinding into the usual open-world survival game formula. Leveling up skills makes you more efficient at collecting materials and killing enemies and improving your skills also unlocks powerful spells that make so many parts of the game easier. It can be tough to level up skills in Dragonwilds, though, especially some of the less common ones like Runecrafting or Artisan. Thankfully, there are ways to speed things up and grind XP without putting in too much effort. You gain skill XP in RuneScape: Dragonwilds by performing actions related to that skill. To level up Woodcutting, you cut some wood. To level up Mining, you mine some rocks. If you ever forget which actions are related to each skill, you can press K to open the skill tree and it will tell you how to earn XP with a handy tooltip. Harder enemies and rarer resources grant much more XP, too, so seeking out tough bosses and precious ores is worth the effort. You can sit there and mine stone all day, but the Mining grind will be much faster if you just go find some clay. The same goes for skills like Attack. You're not going to hit the level cap fighting rats unless you have all the time in the world. Attack is one of the most straightforward skills to level up in RuneScape: Dragonwilds. All you need to do to get XP is, well, attack! Kebbits and chickens in particular are great for early game players since they're weak and spawn in large numbers. Every melee blow you land on an enemy will net you some XP for the Attack skill. Notice how we said melee, though. Ranged and Magic are different skills, so bows and staves have separate progression systems which actually aren't currently implemented in RuneScape: Dragonwilds, so you can only level up melee weapons right now. Tougher foes reward more XP per hit, so seek out goblin camps and roam the more difficult regions of Ashenfall like the Fractured Plains or Stormtouched Highlands to catch the strongest of hands. You'll need decent gear to survive in these regions, so I recommend leveling up the Artisan skill alongside Attack so you can be adequately prepared. Level Skill Effect 5 Parry Parry attacks by blocking at the last moment to stagger your enemies and deal increased damage. 8 Melee Special Action Unlocks unique Special Actions for melee weapons. 11 Tempest Shield Conjure a shield of Air Magic that prevents all damage while blocking for a limited time, triggering a powerful burst when the spell ends. (Requires 15 Air Runes) 16 Weapon Expertise Unlocks additional attacks for all melee weapons. 20 Enchant Weapon: Fire Enchant your current melee weapon with fire to apply burning with critical hits. (Requires 15 Fire Runes, 5 Astral Runes) 23 Adaptability Evading or blocking no longer interrupts your combos when using a melee weapon. 27 Weapon Rack Unlocks the ability to build a weapon rack to display your weapons. 30 Enchant weapon: Air Enchant your current melee weapon with the power of air to increase attack speed. (Requires 15 Air Runes, 5 Astral Runes) 34 Lesser Potion of Attack Unlock the recipe for Lesser Potion of Attack at the Brewing Cauldron. 37 Training Dummy Unlocks the ability to build a training dummy. 40 Whetstone Allows crafting whetstones at the crafting table to sharpen melee weapons for increased damage. Anything you can harvest with a pickaxe will give you Mining XP. Stone is the most basic material, but clay and ore will grant much more XP per strike. While you can just run around Bramblemead Valley mindlessly mining stone, there's an even better way to farm Mining XP. At Mining level 11 you unlock a spell called Rocksplosion. This is your new best friend. It automatically breaks all boulders and ore within the casting radius, which grants huge chunks of Mining XP at a time. It has a really low Rune cost, too, so you don't have to waste too much Rune Essence to afford each cast. The Whispering Swamp is an outstanding grinding spot for this since it has a bunch of tightly-packed clay deposits. Walk around the swamp, blow up rocks with Rocksplosion, and watch the XP roll in. Pro tip: At Mining level 24, you unlock a spell to detect clay and ore nodes, essentially giving you a GPS for mining XP. Level Skill Effect 5 Lift With Your Hips The weight of stone, clay, and sand material is reduced by 25%. 11 Rocksplosion Conjure a powerful blast to break apart stone boulders and ore. (Requires 15 Earth Runes, 5 Fire Runes) 16 Gem Prospector Mining now sometimes produces precious gemstones. 20 Mine crumbled walls Allows you to knock down crumbled walls with a pickaxe, granting access to hidden or blocked areas. 24 Detect ore and clay Invoke the power of the Stone Spirits to guide you to the nearest ore and clay rocks. (Requires 5 Astral Runes, 5 Earth Runes) 36 Not-so-heavy metal The weight of metal ores is reduced by 25%. You'll earn woodcutting XP from chopping down trees. That's all there is to it. Stronger trees like oak reward more XP per strike. Even though it seems simple at first glance, Woodcutting actually has some fancy tricks that you can use to your advantage to gather resources and grind XP faster. At Woodcutting level 11 you unlock the Axtral Projection spell. This conjures a magic axe that cuts down all trees in a straight line in front of you and you can line up three or four trees at a time once you get the hang of it. You still have to individually chop the fallen logs, but Axtral Projection saves so much time. Once you hit Woodcutting level 27—which actually doesn't take too long—you unlock another helpful spell called Splinter. Splinter automatically harvests wood from fallen trees. Combined with Axtral Projection, you can commit acts of deforestation that would send a chill down the Amazon Rainforest's spine. Pro tip: Use Axtral Projection on hills so all the logs roll down to the same spot for easy clean up with Splinter. Level Skill Effect 4 Overhead Chop You can perform an overhead chop that deals greater damage against fallen logs but little against trees. 11 Axtral Projection Conjures an Astral Axe and launches it forward, instantly chopping down trees in its path. (Requires 5 Astral Runes, 10 Air Runes) 16 Bird nests You can find bird nests containing useful items when felling trees. 20 Chop thorny vines Allows you to cut down thorny vines with a hachet, granting access to hidden or blocked areas. 27 Splinter Chops fallen trees into wood logs. (Requires 5 Nature Runes, 10 Earth Runes) 40 Lumber Storage You can build a high capacity lumber storage for logs and planks. Level up the artisan skill by crafting weapons, armor, and tools. It's one of the hardest skills to level up since you don't craft new equipment very often and some of the materials are frustrating to farm. The best way to grind Artisan XP is just to craft a bunch of armor. You need a lot of Coarse Thread, Leather, and Bones to craft most equipment in Dragonwilds, and there's not an easy way to farm these. I recommend running around Bramblemead Valley and collecting Flax (the pretty blue flowers) since they can be converted one to one into Coarse Thread at a Spinning Wheel. While you're on the hunt for Flax, grind some Attack XP in the process by smacking every cow, rat, and Kebbit you see. You should have a decent stock of hides and scraps that you can convert into Leather at a Tannery. You'll also get a few Bones during this process. It's best to use the Bark to Bones skill unlocked at Artisan level 11 to transform trees into bundles of Bones. It has a long cooldown, so use this spell whenever you can. Level Skill Effect 11 Bark To Bones Use alchemy to transmute a tree into a stack of bones. (Requires 10 Nature Runes, 10 Earth Runes) 20 Superheat Cast on fire-based crafting stations to power them and boost speed. (Requires 15 Fire Runes, 5 Air Runes) 27 Magical Mending Throw your items down and repair them instantly. (Requires 10 Nature Runes, 20 Earth Runes) 40 Decorated Adventurer Unlocks the armor mannequin where you can mount a full set of armor. Construction is the other hardest skill to level up in RuneScape: Dragonwilds since you get XP from placing structures and furniture. You need to burn a ton of resources to level Construction, so it's best to focus on it after leveling up Woodcutting and Mining to increase your gathering efficiency. The best way to get Construction XP fast is to build a bunch of stuff from the Decoration tab of the build menu. More specifically, you should focus on building barrels. These are basically resource dumps for you to get rid of any excess stone and wood, which you should have a ton of if you've been leveling up Woodcutting and Mining. Barrels of Stone in particular give a bunch of XP for very little effort if you have the Rocksplosion spell unlocked. Level Skill Effect 3 Middle Ground Unlocks medium-sized building pieces. 5 Fine Details Unlocks small building pieces. 8 Sacred Geometry Unlocks triangular building pieces 11 Eye of Oculus Build structures easier from a fly-cam perspective. (Requires 3 Astral Runes) 16 Creature Comforts Unlocks more furniture and decorations. 18 New material: Oak Unlock the next tier of building pieces. 20 Summon Shelter Construct a temporary shelter including a bed. (Requires 10 astral Runes, 10 Earth Runes) 40 Personal Chest Access your personal storage chest from anywhere. (Requires 20 Law Runes, 15 Astral Runes) You get Cooking XP in RuneScape: Dragonwilds from the Campfire and Cooking Pot. You'll level this up naturally over time because you have to cook and eat food to survive, but there's actually a super easy \"exploit\" that you can use to passively gain Cooking XP without any hassle. All you have to do is find a river, place a bunch of Campfires down, and then boil as much water as you can. You can collect Dirty Water as fast as you can press the E key, so you basically have access to an unlimited supply of things to cook since boiling water counts as cooking. The only hard part is chopping down enough trees to keep the fires burning. Level Skill Effect 11 Fancy Cookware Unlocks the Pan Rack furniture piece. 20 Internal Alchemy Resets any active food and drink buffs. (Requires 10 Nature Runes) 27 Bones to Peaches Transmute bones on the ground into peaches. (Requires 10 Nature Runes, 5 Earth Runes) 40 Yes, Chef! Unlocks the recipe for Chef's Hat in the crafting station. You gain Runecrafting XP in RuneScape: Dragonwilds by crafting Runes at a Rune Altar and harvesting Rune Essence from glowing deposits throughout Ashenfall. You can craft a bunch of Runes at once, so you'll likely level up Runecrafting a few times whenever you use a Rune Altar. To power level Runecrafting, run around the wilderness and stop at every glowing Rune Essence deposit you see. Mine the Rune Essence from the ground with a pickaxe and shoot the floating rocks out of the air with a bow so you can mine them too. Then, just take all the Rune Essence to a Rune Altar and mass craft whatever Runes you need for your favorite spells. That's all there is to it! Level Skill Effect 8 Windstep Summons air magic to jump higher and descend slower. (Requires 5 Air Runes) 11 Earth Runes Unlocks Earth Rune recipe for the Rune Altar. 13 Fire Runes Unlocks the Fire Rune recipe for the Rune Altar. 16 Law Runes Unlocks the Law Rune recipe for the Rune Altar. 18 Nature Runes Unlocks the Nature Rune recipe for the Rune Altar. 20 Fire Spirit Conjure a fire spirit to generate light. (Requires 10 Fire Runes) 27 Essential Strength The weight of rune essence is reduced by 50%. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Don't miss this one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We described Botanicula in our 2012reviewas \"the result of Monkey Island and Terry Gilliam falling into a vegan's blender: A gorgeous-looking mix of point-and-clicking surrealism, whipped together out of nature, discovery and adorable humour.\" And yup, that about nails it: It's weird, funny, heartwarming, and—this is why we're talking about it right now—free for the week on theEpic Games Store. Botanicula is an Amanita Design game, and if you're familiar with any of the studio's other work then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It follows the bizarre adventures of five insectoid weirdos living in a tree that's come under attack by parasitic spiders. That might sound grim, and the spiders are definitely a little creepy, but it's really a lighthearted, upbeat experience overall. It also bears more than a passing similarity to Amanita's 2018 slapstick adventure Chuchel: Solving puzzles is technically the name of the game, but the real fun is in the aftermath of getting it wrong. As we said in the Botanicula review, \"Getting the right answer first time is rubbish: it means you miss out on seeing the failed attempts.\" Anyway, Botanicula is a great game, one of Amanita's best (although truth be told, I could point to pretty much any Amanita game and say that), well worth its regular price, and now it's free, which means we really don't need to be talking about it at all—just go grab it. And yes, for the record, this is the first time Botanicula has been free on the Epic Store—here's our running list of everything that is and has beenfree from Epic over the years, if you're curious about that sort of thing. This being our first crack at Botanicula makes it an even more notable addition to the freebie lineup. Botanicula is free on the Epic Games Store until April 24.

    "title": "MSI RTX 5060 Ti 16G Gaming Trio OC review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's an attention to detail on the MSI RTX 5060 Ti 16G Gaming Trio OC that I'm yet to see on other third-party graphics cards in the lineup. However, that has meant a price tag to match the MSRP of the RTX 5070 and that's simply too high to justify. If you can afford this card, you can probably find a good deal on a better GPU worth buying instead. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. There's no Founders Edition for the RTX 5060 Ti. That means it's up to you to decide on a third-party design. We've tested three 16 GB models for the card's launch, including two aiming for the MSRP of $429, but this review covers the only one brave enough or stupid enough to disregard that price tag completely. Easily the highest quality of the lot, it's the MSI RTX 5060 Ti 16G Gaming Trio OC. Some care and attention have been paid to the design of this triple-fan graphics card. That's clear to me as soon as I remove it from its crinkly packaging and spot the dragon motif cut away from its metal backplate. That's not the sort of flare you'll find on either MSRP card from PNY or Palit, with the latter actually lacking a metal backplate altogether. Metal, plastic, who cares? For this graphics card, it actually does matter. The backplate has a few benefits on the Gaming Trio beyond looking good. First off, it offers some structural rigidity to help prevent any sag on the card, but more importantly it offers a way to help cool the four GDDR7 memory chips loaded onto the rear of the PCB. You only get 16 GB of VRAM on the RTX 5060 Ti by doubling the four RAM chips used on the 8 GB model. That's some simple maths I can get down with. In practical terms, however, that means using what's called 'clamshell' mode to stick another four 16 Gb (2 GB) chips on the opposite side of the PCB to the GPU. These memory chips are not covered by the GPU's heatsink and will run hotter without some other cooling solution in place.

Aww. Though you can get away with none, as proven by the Palit RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Infinity 3 with a plastic backplate, no pads, and a maximum average temperature across all chips during a never-ending loop of 3DMark Steel Nomad only marginally higher than this Gaming Trio (68°C to 62°C). Still, data be damned, I don't like the idea of leaving these memory chips without any cooling over years of use. So, that's one benefit to the MSI Gaming Trio. Another are its dashing good looks. This is by far the best-looking of the three cards I've tested. Admittedly, that's only three cards, but the other two I'm not a fan of, and they're the affordable ones. I'm a sucker for translucent plastic on just about anything—I was a see-thru Game Boy Advance kid—and there's some of that effect to the shroud on this card. It has RGB lighting zones on either side of the central fan and around the MSI badge on the tip of the card, which is easy to see through the glass-fronted MSI Pano 100R PZ case it's currently mounted in. Good-looking, runs cool, well-built… this card has a lot going for it. But then we do have to talk about the price at some point. In myPalit RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB Infinity 3 review, you'll find this sentence: \"You should walk away immediately at anything above $550. That'sRTX 5070money.\" Now, want to take a guess as to the price of the Gaming Trio? It's$550. That's 28% more than the reference MSRP for this card. It's notthatunusual for a third-party graphics card to charge the same price as the 'next tier up'—ie an RTX 5060 Ti for the price of an RTX 5070—but it's never an easy pill to swallow. A sign of the times to be charged over $500 for the bottom-rung GPU of the entire RTX 50-series, too. This card is overclocked out of the factory to the tune of 2647 MHz, which is 75 MHz above the reference clock. That's not a large overclock for this card, a mere 3%, and we'll push it further in just a moment, but here's how it fares out of the box. The RTX 5060 Ti is able to deliver a healthy performance bump over the RTX 4060 Ti 8 GB. In my tests, the Gaming Trio is 20% ahead at 1080p, 23% ahead at 1440p, and 41% ahead at 4K. I should qualify that we're talking pretty slim 4K frame rates most of the time, often sub-30 fps, and you'll need to tap DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation to access more playable frame rates—you can, of course, as this card supports all that. PC Gamer test rigCPU:AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D|Motherboard:Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master |RAM:G.Skill 32 GB DDR5-6000 CAS 30 |Cooler:Corsair H170i Elite Capellix |SSD:2 TB Crucial T700 |PSU:Seasonic Prime TX 1600W |Case:DimasTech Mini V2 Compared to the reference clocked Palit RTX 5060 Ti Infinity 3—the one with a plastic backplate—the extra money doesn't get you any more frames at 1080p or 1440p. They equal out for gains/losses across our benchmarking suite. The Gaming Trio does run cooler than its counterparts—it's a couple of degrees lower than the Palit at stock clocks and way better than the PNY Dual Fan OC. The Gaming Trio is, as the name suggests, a triple-fan unit, but it's also a little larger than the Palit at 300 x 125 x 44 mm. That is MSI's measurement, inclusive of the PCIe slot. It's about 110 mm wide just the shroud itself. The other measurements seem bang-on. The Gaming Trio also maintains its cool composure when overclocked, which is the one place where it really shines. Many of the RTX 50-series cards I've tested have kept power limits under lock and key. Not the Gaming Trio. You're free to tinker with the power limit, voltage, and, of course, clock speeds to your liking. I managed to push this card with a 410 MHz offset, which is pretty high considering the factory OC of 75 MHz already applied, and altogether pushes the card in excess of 3100 MHz while gaming. I also pushed the memory a little but ran into some instability, which forced me to dial back a touch. I'm sure with a little more time, someone could cook up a mean overclock on this card and drop back the power demands, which would be the ideal scenario for long-term use. This untuned overclock netted me a 10% increase in average frame rates at 1080p.10%.That's excellent, and exactly what I'm after on an expensive third-party card such as this. At 1440p, that shrinks a little to just under 9%. I also managed to push the core clock on the Palit Infinity 3 with a 400 MHz offset, which handed me almost as much of a leap, but it is still slower than the MSI. The Gaming Trio leads it by 2.4% at 1080p and 1.5% at 1440p. ✅ You want to overclock the RTX 5060 Ti:Even with a fairly lazy overclock, you can pull 10% higher frame rates from this graphics card. That's immense. ❌ You could throw more money at your GPU:You can find an RTX 5070 for near to the price of this RTX 5060 Ti. Albeit likely not as high-quality cards, but I'd rather the bigger GPU in the long-run. You don't often see these sorts of gains in either clock speed or resulting frame rates on modern processors. Take 'em while you can. The big companies don't like to leave performance on the table like they used to, which has made us wonder why Nvidia's left so much headroom on the RTX 50-series. Their loss, our gain. Even with a lick more megahertz, the RTX 5060 Ti is still nowhere close to the RTX 5070 in terms of raw performance. That's an awkward admission to make with the MSI stalking the better card's price tag. But would you get an RTX 5070, especially one in a card of this quality, for anything close to $550? That's a good question. Right now, as of April 17, 2025, you can buy anAsusPrime RTX 5070 for $600. That should be an MSRP card, and it's unlikely to have all the bells and whistles on this MSI, but it houses a much larger chip and makes better use of its 12 GB of memory for it. In the UK, you can buy anRTX 5070 for £500—or £30 less than MSRP—which is thesame price as MSI will ask for thiscard in dear ol' Albion. That's a very basic model, not that dissimilar to the Palit I've reviewed, but it's darn affordable. By far my favourite RTX 5060 Ti of the lot so far, the MSI has been built to a much higher standard than its cheaper counterparts. That does count for something, but not quite the $121 premium it's asking over the MSRP models. If you can splurge on this MSI, you can probably also save another $50 for an RTX 5070, or just wait for that card to drop to $550. It will happen, eventually, and I'd much rather the RTX 5070 for the same money in the long-run. There's an attention to detail on the MSI RTX 5060 Ti 16G Gaming Trio OC that I'm yet to see on other third-party graphics cards in the lineup. However, that has meant a price tag to match the MSRP of the RTX 5070 and that's simply too high to justify. If you can afford this card, you can probably find a good deal on a better GPU worth buying instead. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "title": "'It unfortunately won't be happening in the foreseeable future': Fortnite's Arcane skins continue to be in crossover jail as Riot boss confirms they won't be back anytime soon",
    "article_text": "A real shame for new Fortnite and Arcane fans. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite the fervor for both Netflix's Arcane and Fortnite continuing to climb since the two collaborated back in 2021, it seems that highly-requested skins won't be making a comeback anytime soon. Both Jinx and Vi made their Fortnite debut shortly after the first season aired, and it's officially been over 1,100 days since either of them were available to purchase. We've had an entire second season of Arcane since then, one which seemed to be equally as well-received as its predecessor. Yet, the two protagonists have still laid dormant inside Fortnite's vaults. They've been great partners, but we haven't been able to find the right fit to bring the Arcane skins back and it unfortunately won't be happening in the foreseeable future. That won't be changing in the near future, either, according to Riot co-founder Marc Merrill. I guess the team's been getting a whole lotta noise about whether the skins are coming back, since hetook to Twitterto basically say sorry, but nope. \"Rewinding back to 2021, when we first teamed up with Epic to bring Jinx and Vi to Fortnite, it was a new kind of crossover for us and we hope it helped make S1 launch feel truly special,\" he wrote. \"Since then, Fortnite has evolved a ton with new experiences and collabs, and we've had a lot of conversations with Epic about what might be possible. \"They've been great partners, but we haven't been able to find the right fit to bring the Arcane skins back and it unfortunately won't be happening in the foreseeable future. We know there's been a lot of love for these—and we really appreciate how much you all care and how much effort you've put into advocating for their return. If anything changes in the future, we'll let you know ASAP!\" Now I'm no detective, but \"a lot of conversations\" and \"haven't been able to find the right fit\" certainly sounds like one or both sides aren't quite bringing their A-game here. I wonder if it's a timing thing, a financial thing or a licensing thing—probably all three, in reality—but it seems a shame that Riot and Epic weren't able to cap off an excellent second season with a re-run. I can only imagine this'll continue to be an issue as Epic continues to swallow up just about damn near every franchise and celebrity it can get its hands on, and certain skins will become all the more lucrative. I've mercifully been spared from the Arcane hype, so I'm not personally downbeat about this one in particular, but I still can't help but feel for the more recent fans who're wanting to get their hands on these. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Virtual scarcity is never fun, even in something as trivial as a videogame, and who knows? Maybe all this noise might prompt the two to get back to discussions and do a re-release when season three of Arcane rolls around.

    "title": "Roblox's latest legal entanglement is with the creator of the viral 'Apple' dance who took TikTok by storm: 'Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work'",
    "article_text": "Kelley Heyer is taking the behemoth platform to court. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Roblox has landed itself in hot water with viral TikTok choreographer Kelley Heyer, as she's filed a lawsuit against the platform for using her dance without permission. Heyer is behind last year's Apple dance—choregraphed to Charli XCX's song of the same name—which propelled both her and the tune to fame, even leading Heyer to perform the dance live at one of Charli XCX's concerts. If you're as online as I am, the trend was completely inescapable. Hell, even if you'renotas online as I am, you've probably come across the song or the dance at least once since it went viral last summer. If you've somehow not seen the dance or heard the song yet, here's Heyer performing the song on her TikTok: That's the dance that Heyer's legal team alleges was taken by Roblox without Heyer's consent, which was then released as part of Dress to Impress's Charlie XCX-themed Brat update back in August 2024. According toPolygon, the two parties were in talks to license the dance out on August 12, but Roblox went ahead and released it before the two could come to \"a signed agreement.\" Heyer went ahead and copyrighted her dance at the end of August, a couple of weeks after the Brat update had hit Dress to Impress. The lawsuit alleges that Roblox has made around $123,000 from selling the emote between August and November last year, with legal representative Miki Anzai saying Heyer is \"an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work.\" It's worth noting that Heyer has successfully worked with a different game to turn her dance into an emote: Fortnite added the Bratty dance back in mid-December, with Heyer notingon TikTokthat \"the whole Fortnite team was really wonderful and super easy to work with.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. She even hinted back then that Roblox hadn't exactly been kosher about its own emote release, saying in the same video that Fortnite was \"the only videogame platform that has a signed contract to license the dance\" from Heyer. It's an interesting case, one which isn't all that unique in today's landscape as games like Fortnite continue to immortalise (and more importantly, monetise) pop culture internet moments. Fortnite itself is no stranger to dance-related lawsuits: The actor behind the iconic Fresh Prince of Bel Air 'Carlton Dance'Alfonso Ribeiro sued the developer, though he hit some copyright snags in the process. Other viral dance creatorslike 2 Milly(the Milly Rock), Backpack Kid (the Floss, whichNinja painfully performedduring a disastrous Times Square New Years Eve special) andOrange Shirt Kid(the Orange Justice) have all previously had lawsuits against Epic Games for using their dances without any formal agreement, thoughthey were droppedwith the purpose of refiling (it's unclear if that actually happened, though). ActorDonald Faison—whose moves to Bell Biv DeVoe's Poison on an episode of Scrubs is now more commonly known as the Fortnite default dance—never got around to filing a lawsuit, but has previously expressed his frustration with seeing his creations being used unpaid. But now it's Roblox's turn to be in the firing line, and I hope that Heyer receives some kind of positive outcome from all this. It should hopefully help that she's filed for copyright, though we've already seen in previous cases that ownership around viral internet dances is rather shaky. At the end of the day, I'm here for more creators being paid their worth. Be it music, dances, the written word, or any other creative outlet, people deserve to get their coin just as much as big corporations feel they deserve to profit off them.

A few months after the game first launched, some players started to realise that after losing a few games in a row, they'd beplaced into bot matcheson the down-low. Given the sneakiness at hand, the devs grabbing friends' names to be used by bots isn't all that surprising, but that doesn't make it ok. \"Taking people's account names for bots isn't right,\"Maleficent_Roll3450 says. \"I was in a player vs AI match, and someone that I have on my friend list was in the match as well, and I kept trying to talk to them the entire time, wondering why they were ignoring me, as I haven't seen them online for ages.

That's not cool to use another account's username as a bot, especially when the player is on my friend list. Excited for no reason.\" The whole point about player vs AI matches is that it's meant to beplayersvs AI. If people wanted to play against a bunch of AI on both sides, then you can just go into a custom match and make a game for yourself. The fact that it's so easy to create a custom match also means there's no reason to fill player lobbies with bots; simply redirect players to custom matches if you're concerned about queue times. While players may not be happy with this new discovery, Marvel Rivals isn't the first game to do something like this. Forza will take your friends list and use their names for bots while you're driving around, and Fortnite uses bots to fill empty slots, usually for new players, when it could be difficult to fill an appropriate lobby. But it doesn't necessarily make the practice ok just because other games do it. Also, if you connect the dots, it wouldn't be outlandish to assume that some bots in Quick Play matches will also copy player names. As I said before, players coined onto the fact that NetEase was placing those on bad losing streaks into bot matches in Quick Play to hand them an easy win. So if there are bots in the matches, and they're designed to be awful at the game, there is a possibility that someone, somewhere, thinks that you're god awful at Marvel Rivals. But I think the most important thing to remember is this: If you see someone with my name playing like an idiot on Emma Frost and completely throwing the game, just remember that it's not me, it's a bot, trust me.

    "title": "We called its first cyberpunk setting 'cooler than Night City,' and now the studio behind The Ascent says it's making 'the kind of game that every developer wants to work on'",
    "article_text": "Details are sparse, but Neon Giant says its next game is \"ludicrously ambitious\", first-person, and focused on \"player agency and creativity.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We had a lot of nice things to say about top-down co-op shooter The Ascent back in 2021. Former PC Gamer editor Andy Kelly awarded it an enthusiastic 84%in his review, andcalled its cyberpunk setting\"way cooler than Night City.\" Now Swedish developer Neon Giant is teasing its next game, but it's not giving away much. It'll be first-person, and it's big on \"player agency.\" A handful of screenshots tease a new world clogged with old-school tech (see the gallery below). The whole mysterious thing is \"ludicrously ambitious,\" the studio promises. Following the success of The Ascent, Neon Giant could have \"asked for nearly anything\" from the investors that came courting, creative director and studio co-founder Arcade Berg told PC Gamer in a call last week, which also included fellow Neon Giant creative director and co-founder Tor Frick. They could've gone on a hiring spree, and that was still the thing to do in 2021, just before the games industry began its wrenching contraction. But Berg and Frick and the other founders had started Neon Giant because they wanted out of the triple-A scene, so despite selling the company to South Korean giant Krafton—the publisher behind PUBG andInzoi—Neon Giant's founders have kept it small. The team is \"just over 20\" people. Why sell at all? \"We didn't start a studio to run a studio,\" Berg told me. \"We started [Neon Giant] because we wanted to make games in a certain way,\" the co-founder continued. \"That's the only thing that's really important to us. So we said, well, you know what? Why not? Why not find someone to work with so we can get the rocket fuel that we feel that we need to be even more ambitious, and also feel that we have some stability, we can have the courage and afford to take risks, creative risks and project risks, because we think that will lead to a frankly cooler product in the end.\" A condition of the acquisition was that Neon Giant wasn't going to become a support studio or take assignments. It had to be free to make its own games with its small staff, where everyone contributes to the creative vision. Sounding a little like theValve employee handbook, which promises a \"flat structure\" (a subject ofsome debate), Frick explained the studio's approach to game development. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"This is a studio for people who want to be very involved in the creative and technical aspects,\" he said. \"You need to be a problem solver. If we're going to make a game, you need to get dirty—we don't really have managers, right? Everyone here, even if they had managers in a previous studio, in triple-A, like, when you're here, you need to just solve the problems and build the game yourself.\" Over half of Neon Giant's staff were previously directors at big studios, according to Berg, and both Berg and Frick previously worked on the Wolfenstein series at MachineGames, as well as at People Can Fly during its Bulletstorm and Gears of War: Judgment days. I failed to extract any precise details about Neon Giant's upcoming game from the pair of creative directors, but they did give us a few hints. The studio is focused on building a believable, \"reactive\" world that's more grounded than The Ascent's cyberpunk metropolis, and \"player agency and creativity\" are at the center of it. Berg also mentioned that it's \"the kind of game that every developer wants to work on\"—sounds to me like we're in the immersive sim realm. There's no word on when we'll hear more, but I suspect that it won't be too long before we get another call from Sweden. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

    "title": "Ultrakill publisher co-founder throws up hands, jokes 'Tarkov has done irreparable f*cking damage to the game industry' because even FromSoftware games are extraction shooters now",
    "article_text": "Honestly, I kinda get it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I have something to confess to you, dear reader: I'm not an extraction shooter guy. I wasn't a battle royale guy, either. If I'm playing any sort of PvP game, I don't find it fun to slink around in the shadows for 10 minutes only to have a heart attack when I'm finally confronted by some dude with more patience and a better handle on their crosshair than me. So believe me when I say I share Ultrakill publisher New Blood's co-founder Dave Oshry's frustration on theQuad Damage Podcast(thanks,GamesRadar+) when he jokes, in an exasperated fashion: \"You've seen the posts, like, Miyazaki's been playing Tarkov—Tarkov's done irreparable f*cking damage to the game industry.\" Oshry is speaking on both Nightreign and the Switch 2-exclusive Duskbloods—the first of which is a PvE battle royale-style co-op game, while the other appears to be shaping up to be some sort of weird extraction shooter… thing. Both titles are clearly the studio handing smaller projects to budding devs and experimenting with its vast success, but still. Oshry gets in a good-natured huff about it: \"Everything needs to be a f*cking extraction shooter—and like, it's cool, but it's just like… I just like regular-ass games. But I'm old. I get it, I'm not the target audience for these games anymore.\" Honestly Oshry, I understand you, I really do. Call it a skill issue on my part—and there's some truth to that—but I can't stand the short windows of action in your average BR or extraction shooter game. I like to chew on a challenge: I've played most of the Souls games, and against the health of my thumbs I've gotten back into Guilty Gear: Strive recently. But when I'm trying to get better at a game, I like to iterate, y'know? I'm a kinesthetic learner. I've gotta get my butt handed to me a handful of times so I can figure out what has and hasn't gone wrong. In any game where you have to spend a lot of time being very vigilant in very quiet environments, my understimulated brain meat vanishes into nothingness and startsthinking about Pathfinder 2e or something. I'd be very surprised ifFromSoftwareis doing a full pivot to this kind of thing, though—rather, games like Duskbloods and Nightreign seem more liketechnical test runs, and I'm all for the devs at that studio getting to play in the space some more. Just… leave me out of the Tarkovs and the Fortnites of the world. I've only got so much time to kill.

    "article_text": "A trackball? In MY keyboard? I'll roll with it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Don't worry—I'm not going to spoil anything about the Severance season 2 finale. Why? Well, because I simply haven't seen it. My limited understanding of the show has been acquired by social media osmosis, so I can only assume it's a workplace drama with vaguely uncomfortable vibes but also lots of kissing. Jokes aside, Severance is definitely on my never-ending to-watch list—even more so now, thanks to thismysterious and important keyboardfrom Atomic Keyboards (viaPCWorld). Dubbed the MDR Dasher Keyboard, neither a final price nor a firm release date has been confirmed, but you can sign up toget updates on its limited release here. The keyboard's name comes from Data General's 'Dasher' Terminals for a retro computing hit straight from the '70s. These machines are used as salvaged props in the Macrodata Refinement (MDR) department of the fictitious Lumon Industries, central to Severance's confined universe. And before you ask, yes, Atomic Keyboards' take alsoomits the Escape, Control, and Options keys just like the show. It's certainly a unique 73-key layout, standing out against even the original Dasher keyboards with the inclusion of a trackball immersed in the right-hand side of the hardware. Also, unlike the ancient hardware serving as a source of inspiration, Atomic Keyboard's 70% boards feature a USB-C connection plus compatibility with Windows, Mac, and Linux machines. Now, you know me,I love attention-grabbing hardware, especially if it's akeyboard with a gimmick. A blue board that comes with a trackball mousedefinitelydoes it for me—and would probably pair quite nicely with my army of Miku Hatsune figurines. However, with a very tentative guide price of about $400, I think I'd rather spend that kind of money fortifying the ranks of my anime figures. Still, maybe that's just me. If you can't wait to appreciate every key of the MDR Dasher Keyboard equally and are looking for ways to kill time before it sees the light of day, you can always tool around with thisMacrodata Refinement Simulator.

    "title": "US-made chip prices could soar if the rumour that TSMC might charge 'as much as 30%' more for its Arizona chips pans out",
    "article_text": "So tariffs on foreign chips and hiked prices on domestic ones? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The chip industry—as with many others, I'm sure—is, at least to onlookers like myself, in very uncertain waters of late, thanks to the United States' upsy-downy-round-and-roundy 'will he, won't he?' tariff position. The goal is ostensibly to have production shimmy on over to the US, but we're now hearing rumour that even some chip production that is already in the US might have its prices raised. This latest rumour comes fromEconomic Daily(viaTrendForce), which reports that \"market sources say that due to the high demand for production capacity and reflecting costs, TSMC is planning to increase the price of [its] 4nm foundry at its new US plant by as much as 30%\" (machine translated). This \"new US plant\" isTSMC's Arizona fab, which is alreadymaking AMD Ryzen 9000-seriesandNvidia Blackwell chips. It's currently producing chips on a 4 nm (N4) process but is aiming at 3 nm, 2 nm, and following this, according to today's TSMC earnings call (transcript here), 1.4 nm and 1.0 nm. Currently it's 4 nm, though, and a 30% price hike would be nothing for we gamers to scoff at, not in a market where Nvidia is pointing out there'snothing it can do about potential chip tariffs, and it's looking like said tariffsmight actually be right around the corner. In fact, if TSMC does raise prices, this might be a result of actual or threatened tariffs for two reasons. First, it could be a means to make up for losses caused by tariffs on TSMC's larger non-US side of the business. Second, there's the simple fact that in economics, higher demand means higher prices, and if Trump launches tariffs at foreign semiconductors, then US semiconductors such as those coming out of TSMC Arizona will be in high demand. During its earnings call today, TSMC didn't have much to say about 4 nm prices, and it rarely does comment on customer prices. It did, however, say that some \"margin dilutions\" may \"come from the cost [of] inflation as well as potential cost increases from the tariff policies\", and regarding this, \"discussion with the customers are continuous.\" In other words, cards close to the chest, as always. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. I must say, the \"as much as 30%\" rumoured figure is strikingly close to the current 32% tariff on Taiwan, where TSMC—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company—is, of course, based. That doesn't apply to semiconductors, of course, but it looks like it, or something like it, soon might. I'm also struck by the vision ofTrump threatening TSMC with up to 100% tariffsif it didn't build its plant in the US. Now I'm not saying this is what's going on, but there would be a certain satisfaction to saying, 'Sure, we'll build our fabs in America… and then charge American companies up to 30% extra. You have your tariffs, we have our pricing.' Still, TSMC has announced a$100 billion investment in the USand raising prices for no reason other than retaliation might not be the smartest business decision. If prices are raised, it'll likely be for the reasons discussed earlier. Here's hoping things simmer down long enough to land us with some actual RTX 50-series and RX 9000-series stocks.

If you haven't had a chance to try out Baldur's Gate 3's new photo mode, then you're in for a treat, because this thing is absolutely stonking stacked. Dozens upon dozens of poses, 10 unique dances, and a bunch of different ways for a cat to sit, for some reason. I shouldn't really be shocked at this point, mind you. BG3 is one of those games that's rammed to the bursting with detail, but still—the amount of work done to make your last journey through the Forgotten Realms (alas,this'll be the final major patch for the game) a memorable one. What's really staggered me, though—more than the 300-odd stickers or filters or dances, is how someone bothered to go through and add some stances for most of the game's summoned creatures and wildshapes, as well. While the lists here aren't as populous as the main body rigs, the fact you can still pose a Wood Woad or a Mephit is astonishing. The Owlbear wildshape, for example, has seven different sitting positions. Why? Because someone thought it'd be cute, and the fact that was enough to have said poses make it into the game is honestly delightful. Running down the list, bare minimum, there are 47 poses for humanoid characters. Some of these are nested, too, with multiple options therein. I mentioned there are 10 dances before, but there aresevendifferent vogue options. Seven. I guess Astarion's in the game, so that tracks, but I'm still flabbergasted. As you can imagine, the community's already been hard at work recreating memes with this thing. Being able to make The Dark Urge do a little uwu finger-touch pose over the corpses of their enemies is something I didn't know I needed. My heart has found its missing puzzle piece. But what I'm really looking forward to is those among us with a predilection for the cinematic—that is, to say, people who're good at making serious screenshots rather than memes.

    "title": "RuneScape: Dragonwilds has fixed the classic survival crafting trope of endlessly chopping down trees thanks to an excellent spell system that does the hard work for you",
    "article_text": "How am I supposed to play other survival crafting games without my spectral axe? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When I was first shown RuneScape: Dragonwilds—Jagex's answer to survival crafting games like Valheim and Enshrouded with its own Gielinor flavour—the star pupil of the whole presentation were most certainly the spells. They're shortcuts to make some of the more tedious parts of survival crafting a lot more palatable: Spectral axes that can chop down several trees at once, before another spell can zap them all into logs without me even having to whip out my real axe. Or making rocks explode into tiny stones with just a vaguely magic-looking wave of my hand. Even turning the bones of my enemies into tasty peaches to satiate my hunger. Yum! When I first got to witness the Spectral Axe in action, I remember thinking \"hm, yeah, pretty cool,to look at.But will it feel cool to play?\" The answer to myself (and to you) is yes, it feels incredibly cool. It's such a small tweak to the standard survival crafting gameplay loop, one which doesn't feel invasive enough that I forgo the manual method altogether—after all, I still have to make the effort to skill up my woodcutting for the privilege of speedrunning the process later down the line—but also isn't a total ballache to use. Each spell is on a cooldown, all of which feel pretty reasonable, but also are distinctly RuneScape in that they need different runes to cast. Anyone who's levelled up magic in Jagex's MMOs will know that most spells require some sort of rune: Law runes, fire runes, earth runes. You name it, you'll probably need it to cast everything from combat magic to teleportation. You'd think an MMO mechanic like that wouldn't transfer too well over to survival crafting, but it really does. I think part of that is down to the fact the mechanic already feels kinda survival crafting-y within the confines of its MMO origins. Sure, you can buy runes from shops or find them as mob drops, but you can also mine rune essences and then craft them into what you need. It's such a simple way to jazz up Dragonwilds' basic resource collection, and I can't help but feel like it's something more survival crafting games should crib from. That works, well, almost exactly the same in Dragonwilds. There are floating rocks scattered around that can be mined for rune essences, and then crafted into specific runes via a specialist crafting table. The method is flexible enough to transcend genre, and I love that it's one of the fundamental RuneScape things that Jagex has kept in. And I don't even need to go seeking a rune pouch to put 'em all in, thank goodness. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's such a simple way to jazz up Dragonwilds' basic resource collection, and I can't help but feel like it's something more survival crafting games should crib from. I thought we'd run out of ways to chop a tree or mine a rock, and yet here we are. There are even more bespoke, battle-oriented spells like a shield that can block all incoming damage, or spells that refresh food buffs, and even one that makes basebuilding much easier by disconnecting the camera from my adventurer and letting me free roam inDragonwilds' excellent build mode. I haven't had too much of a chance to tinker with these yet, though I should most definitely be busting that shield out against the ridiculous number of goblin raids I've been experiencing in my first few hours. I've especially had fun with Windstep, a low-cost and low-cooldown traversal spell that lets me jump ridiculously high before floatingly descending. It's been key to leaping over large bodies of water that slow me down to a crawl if I try to wade through them, or leaping over gaps that otherwise would've seen me plummet to my death. I'm only a handful of hours into my first Dragonwilds server right now, and I've barely scratched the surface of what spells can do. It's taking me a little while to remember to make good use of them—I'm constantly forgetting about that handy-dandy building spell, for instance—but I worry the next time I venture to a magicless survival crafting game, I won't be able to manage without 'em.

    "article_text": "Is it raining? Yes—and also no. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a lot to say about AI's integration into journalism—and if you're only asking me, almost all of it would be extremely negative. Well, an engaged reader wouldn't just take my word for it, instead seeking to read widely on the subject to better inform their own opinion. My one request, if I may be so bold, is that your wider reading doesn't begin and end with asking an AI chatbot how it 'feels' about the subject. In recent weeks, the LA Times has begun book-ending its opinion pieces with AI-generated'Insights'(viaAP News). Clicking on this dropdown tab offers information such as the supposed political alignment of the piece you've just read, a bullet point summary of the piece itself, as well as points offering \"different views on the topic.\" It's a 'both sides' approach by way ofPerplexity-powered AI. Insights was first implemented on March 3, so it remains tricky to get a solid sense of the quality of this still very recent addition. Still, it's notable that some of its features, such as identifying the supposed political alignment of a piece, has so far only been applied to opinion pieces and not news. At the very least, I appreciate the AI-generated bullet points offer some linked-out citations so you can dig deeper into its claims yourself. Mind you, that's a very journalist thing to say; how many peoplewillinvestigate the quality of the included citations beyond noting the AI presents them at all? There's also arguably more to this story than mere AI bandwagon-hopping. First, a brief recap: AP News notes the LA Times was bought back in 2018 by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a transplant surgeon, medical researcher, and investor who has also served as the publication's executive chairman for the last seven years.Interviewed by Fox News last year, Soon-Shiong said, \"We've conflated news and opinion,\" later adding that the LA Times wants \"voices from all sides,\" before going on to say, \"If you just have the one side, it’s just going to be an echo chamber.\" As such, opinion pieces are very clearly demarcated from news, often labelled as 'editorial' or 'Voices'. Beyond that, the publication also chosenot to endorse a specific presidential candidate last year—about two weeks prior to election day—despite an editorial in favour of Kamala Harris being allegedly already prepared. The Los Angeles Times's editorial editor, among other members of the editorial board,resigned in response to this decision. To put it another way, since at least last year, there appears to have been a greater push from upon high to steer the publication more centrally in the name of impartiality. Right so, with that context in mind, let's take a peek at the LA Times' AI-generated 'Insights' in action. Inthis opinion piecetouching upon recent ICE detainments and deportations, Matt K. Lewis claims, \"The point was never really about deporting violent criminals. The point was a warning to anyone who wants to come to America: Don’t come here. Or, if you’re already here, get out.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In response, Insights offers, \"Supporters defend enhanced immigration enforcement as necessary to address a declared 'invasion' at the southern border,\" and \"Restricting birthright citizenship and refugee admissions is framed as correcting alleged exploitation of immigration loopholes, with proponents arguing these steps protect American workers and resources.\" While the opinion piece's stance is very clear, the AI-generated so-called-insight is comparatively mealy-mouthed, with phrasing like \"a declared 'invasion' at the southern border,\" leaving far too much unchallenged. While it would be far from ideal to descend into a rabbit-warren of AI-versus-human counter arguments, it feels very odd to allow AI the last word. What's most frustrating is the implied assertion that the AI's regurgitated claims are at all equally valid views to be presented alongside the opinion writer's stated, well-sourced horror at ICE's overreach. As such, I fear Insights may be yet one more far from neutral, bias-reproducing AI, rather than a worthwhile tool that offers valuable context to readers. Insights notes, \"The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit [this] content,\" so you can be sure that no pesky journalists were allowed to do their job and give the AI a stern talking to about uncritically repeating hearsay. Naturally, it would be ridiculous to hold the AI accountable for the decisions of the humans steering the ship—I just hope the course correction is swift.

    "title": "Tempest Rising review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unashamedly retro in spirit yet modern where it counts, Tempest Rising is a riveting flashback to the halcyon days of the RTS. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Calling Tempest Rising a spiritual successor to Command and Conquer would undersell just how fiercely this game wants to be a part of the Westwood dynasty. From the thinly veiled faction analogues to the thundering synth metal soundtrack, right down to the mission interludes where your faction's influence bleeds through the countries of Europe on the campaign map, Slipgate Ironworks' mimicry of Westwood's 1995 RTS is utterly brazen. What is it?A self-appointed Command and Conquer successor with modern production values and a few mechanical tweaks.Release dateApril 24, 2025Expect to pay$40/£35DeveloperSlipgate IronworksPublisher3D Realms, Knights PeakReviewed onAMD Ryzen 5 3600, Nvidia 2080 Super, 32 GB RAMSteam DeckTBALinkOfficial site Yet Tempest Rising does more than sneak into Command and Conquer's room and prance about in its clothes. It understands what made Westwood's RTS such a timeless classic, enriching those elements to suit a modern audience. Its RTS action is pacey and spectacular, its dual factions are tactically divergent and demonstrate surprising strategic depth. Most importantly of all, its twin campaigns are meticulously crafted pressure-cookers that spin out the strategic fundamentals in thrilling, imaginative ways. In fact, Tempest Rising isn't that far off being a classic itself. Tempest Rising's takes the premise of C&C, switches out a few proper nouns and chucks in a nuclear war for good measure. Set in 1997 in the wake of World War 3, the world has become afflicted by a strange new growth called Tempest, a russet, flowery structure that looks like a plant but isn't. Tempest is hazardous to human health and spreads rapaciously, but it's also an abundant energy resource. This makes it the primary catalyst of a war between Earth's two dominant factions, the Global Defence Force (GDF) and the Tempest Dynasty. Likewise, the basic play of Tempest Rising will be familiar to anyone even vaguely accustomed with real-time strategy. You establish a headquarters in a corner of the map, harvest some resources, build a base, recruit an army comprised of infantry and vehicles, then dispatch that army to pummel your opponent. Tempest Rising doesn't alter these fundamentals in any radical fashion—it never intended to. Buthowyou do these things is quite different depending on which faction you play as. While the GDF and Tempest Dynasty are broad approximations of C&C's GDI and Brotherhood of Nod, there's considerably more going on in terms of how each faction operates. Virtually every action you perform in Tempest Rising works differently depending on the faction you play as. The GDF, for example, harvest resources using a refinery building that comes with its own tempest-gobbling dump truck, while the Tempest Dynasty uses a mobile harvesting rig with wheels that double as cute little cluster-robots when deployed. Even basic construction works differently for each faction. The GDF place building blueprints on the ground which then construct over time, whereas the Tempest Dynasty hark back to the original C&C, building their structures within the construction menu,thenplacing them on the ground where they assemble instantly. This means they're protected from being damaged during construction, but it also means you must be Johnny-on-the-spot when placing them, as queued buildings won't begin construction until you deploy completed projects. This asymmetry is most important, of course, when it comes to units and combat. The GDF is built around advanced technology and intel gathering. Its ground infantry are supported by drone pilots which fire micromissiles against vehicles and aircraft, while its mechanised units are led by fast scout 4x4s that can mark enemy vehicles to provide bonus damage for tanks. The Tempest Dynasty, by comparison, have a more fire and fury approach to combat, with an army led by flamethrower infantry and supported by offroad SUVs that fire cluster missiles and devastatingly powerful mobile rocket trucks. But they also have access to some of the weirdest units of all, such as a giant metal sphere that instantly destroys small and medium units by rolling over them. Indeed, there are some real treasures within Tempest Rising's unit roster. An obvious highlight from the GDF is the trebuchet, a heavy tank that transforms into an even more powerful stationary artillery cannon. Trebuchets areexcellentdefensive units, but they can also be devastatingly effective in the backline of an assault. My personal favourite, however, is the GDFs shieldmaiden, an anti-air hovercraft that quickly became an essential part of all my assault forces. Not only does its gatling laser make mincemeat of The Tempest Dynasty's slightly superior air units, but it can also deploy a repair capsule that will automatically fix up your units in the field. Most units have an active ability like this, which are complemented by a small selection of faction-wide abilities you can use at any time. These can also be combined in powerful ways. For example, the GDF can recruit a specialist sniper unit who can turn invisible, letting her sneak up to enemy positions and pick off infantry targets. But the GDF can also call in an airstrike on any positions it has line of sight with. So you can effectively use the sniper to conduct one-unit bombing raids on distant enemy bases. Of course, you'll have to watch out for the Dynasty's machinist, as this specialist can detect enemy units in stealth. There are some real treasures within Tempest Rising's unit roster I could spend this whole review hashing out all the various abilities and combinations, but two things Tempest Rising is particularly good at are supporting armies within the field and empowering territory control. Both factions feature abilities that let them quickly establish small sub-outposts to claim key points on the map like tempest fields. The GDF can call down a beacon that lets them build anything within its radius while it's active, while the Dynasty can recruit a salvage van that can deploy as a small construction centre, which both lets you construct buildings and defence while automatically repairing them when damaged. This means the GDF can spring up a small outpost out of nowhere, while the Dynasty's can combine salvage vans with their harvesting rigs to spread across the map like a weed. Hence, you're not just throwing clusters of units at one other's bases, with fights often encompassing large swaths of the map. And thanks to units like the shieldmaiden and the salvage van, which can be used as a mobile repair unit as well as a mini HQ, your armies are less disposable than in other RTS', though they can still be obliterated in seconds if you're not careful. In short, beneath Tempest Rising's simple throwback exterior is a ton of more specific features and abilities you can take tactical advantage of. Admittedly, it can be difficult to remember all these nuances in the heat of battle, but Tempest Rising tries to assist you in a number of ways. Pressing TAB will cycle through different units in a selected cluster, letting you quickly find the unit with the ability you want. Similarly, holding ALT while clicking will cause all units in a cluster to move at the same speed, meaning your faster, more fragile units don't rush off and get blown apart by your enemy's defences. The main way Tempest Rising readies you for battle, however, is through its campaigns. Both campaigns are designed to guide you through the specifics of each faction, but they're not tedious tutorials. Indeed, they're totally unafraid to throw you into the wringer. The fifth mission of the GDF campaign, for example, sees you assume control of a central base with the goal of destroying several Dynasty convoys. These convoys travel through different areas of the map at set times. So you must clear out these areas of Dynasty defences and have enough firepower left over to deal with the convoy, while managing constant Dynasty attacks on your base, all in the space of about 25 minutes. There are also just some great mission premises in general. The sixth mission of the GDF campaign is titled Pull that Base Apart, a stirring call to action that sees you slowly dismantling a sprawling Dynasty operation with a sniper and a handful of stealth hovertanks. The Dynasty campaign is a little slower to get going, but there's a great mid-campaign mission where you're abruptly pulled from the frontline for some bullshit assignment to help a large-scale tempest harvesting operation meet its quota. Naturally, things don't go to plan, and you end up having to defend multiple bases from a massive GDF assault. Slipgate understands how to craft exciting mission concepts out of the basic RTS toolkit, and Tempest Rising has that same immediacy and boldness that makes the old C&C games still fun to play thirty years on. This culminates in a dramatically different final act for both campaigns, one where you battle against a third faction known as the Veti, which function in a wholly different manner from the Dynasty and the GDF. I won't go into too many specifics about the Veti, apart from to say they are quite scarily powerful and have some units that make the Dynasty's crushing spheres look boring. In any case, their arrival into the campaigns gives them a real shot in the arm. Indeed, the final mission of the GDF campaign ended with me completely and utterly beaten—I was saved only by the clock. Slipgate understands how to craft exciting mission concepts out of the basic RTS toolkit As a package, Tempest Rising is pretty neat and tidy, with no glaring flaws I could point to. There are a few areas where I think it could be better, however. While the third faction is present in the campaign, you can't play as them yet in multiplayer or skirmishes—they're planned for a future update. And while I wouldn't say I'm disappointed by this as such, a third campaign centred around the Veti would certainly help Tempest Rising stand apart from its inspiration. Elsewhere, the fact the campaigns have the same general trajectory means whichever one you play second won't have the same impact as the first. Finally, the inter-mission briefings are a welcome callback to C&C, but the real time 3D characters simply don't have the charm of Westwood's lovably daft FMVs. This is the only area where the presentation falls short. Tempest Rising looks great in motion, with your vehicles kicking up dust as they roll across terrain, destroyed buildings collapsing in big, soupy explosions, and aircraft spinning out of the sky when shot down. Arguably more important, however, is that itsoundsfantastic. Not only is the game itself sufficiently thunderous, the soundtrack is absolutely tremendous, with an array of musicians paying gleeful tribute to the music of C&C. Standout tracks includeDeath Squad, a Mick Gordon-ish spin on Red Alert'sHell March, a pulsing, Rammstein-like synth affair namedAegisand ametal Soviet anthemwritten by former Witcher composer Adam Skorupa. And of course, there's a bit ofFrank Klepackiin there, as a treat. Short of that third playable faction and a few more personable faces between missions, Tempest Rising is as good as you could hope a C&C successor to be. I say this with enthusiasm, but also some relief. The RTS has been in active retreat for years now, with strategy gaming pushing overwhelmingly toward turn-based tactics and grander 4X affairs. There have been several attempted counteroffensives, but none have succeeded. Rather than try any bold new gambits, Tempest Rising digs its heels in, mounting a stalwart defence of everything that made the RTS great in the first place. It may not revolutionise the genre, but apart from that, Tempest Rising is exactly what the RTS needs right now. Unashamedly retro in spirit yet modern where it counts, Tempest Rising is a riveting flashback to the halcyon days of the RTS.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tempopo's rhythmic puzzling is undeniably great, but is let down by a lack of mechanical pacing and an absence of Witch Beam's coveted storytelling. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Tempopo's greatest strength is that its puzzles never frustrate me. Even when I'm stuck on them for an embarrassingly long time, trying to slot in one final piece to successfully direct adorable pink blobs—the titular Tempopo—as they rhythmically hop from tile to tile, gathering musical flowers and reaching the goal. What is it?A musical puzzler with directionally challenged seedlings.Release date[April 17, 2025]Expect to payUnknownDeveloperWitch BeamPublisherCULT GamesReviewed onNvidia GeForce RTX3070, AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, 32GB RAMSteam DeckTBALinkOfficial site Part of that is thanks to the fact that Witch Beam's newest game doesn't pressure me to speed through each level at lightning speed. There's no timer, no limit to the hints I can use, and I can reset each puzzle as many times as I want. It's a wonderfully calm puzzler through and through, but if you're looking for the fantastic visual storytelling seen in the developer's last title—2021's Unpacking—you unfortunately won't find it here. There is a vague semblance of story, mind. After young girl Hana majorly botches a concert, her garden's musical flowers get scattered across 60 different levels. Her job is to get them back alongside her Tempopo, using different commands to direct them into each flower. Commands include redirecting Tempopo in fixed directions, turning them into blocks that other Tempopo can traverse, pushing blocks around or even smashing them to create new paths or blockades. The game throws all of them at me pretty fast, where I was expecting them to drip-feed them to me as the difficulty increased. Each level only gives a fixed amount of certain commands, and most of them are of the smashing or flying variety. In my first 60 levels with Tempopo I was rarely given the directional arrow commands to use, and it was hard to pinpoint where the difficulty curve was going up and whether I was actually improving at my puzzle-solving skills. Complexity does come in through more intricate level designs, forcing me to spin the level around and inspect each tile from all angles, as well as increasing the number of Tempopo I have to keep an eye on as they hop around. They don't all actually have to make it to the goal—only the ones holding flowers—so knowing when it's okay to let one fall off a cliff or hop straight into a thorny vine is also surprisingly important. There is a bit of cleverness through just how I have to use each command as well, though the game never really makes it clear when I can use them to bend the rules a little bit. One command that is used to push blocks can also be used to push other Tempopo across gaps, for example, something I only found out completely by accident. A little nudge in the right direction would've been appreciated. The game's union of puzzler and rhythm works incredibly well, with composer Jeff van Dyck soundtracking serene, unobtrusive melodies for when I'm in the planning stages of each puzzle, before letting the music swell into an upbeat symphony as I play each one out successfully. Hearing Tempopo bounce along each block scratches an itch deep in my brain, and I can't help but tap my foot along in rhythm. It's not just my round, pink friends who contribute to the soundscape, either. Some levels have reanimated skulls who eat anything in their path—my Tempopo included—satisfyingly crunching along the tiles in a way no ASMR mukbanger ever could. Progressing through levels and collecting flowers even lets me pop them back into my garden wherever I feel like in order to create my own melodies. Each tile can house up to four of the same flower, and I can create songs with harmonising roses, percussion florets and harp orchids. It all further folds into Tempopo's pursuit of the relaxing and cosy, and every 15 levels whisks me to Hana's garden to plant all my collected flowers so she can sing a melody. I didn't spend much time in the mode outside of when I was prompted to, but I'm sure the more musically inclined will have a good time creating different melodies. Unfortunately, outside of Hana's songs, there's relatively little narrative to be found in Tempopo. As someone who adores Unpacking—that gut-wrenching moment when trying to find a space for my degree lives rent-free in my head—I was hoping to see some of that incredible subtle visual storytelling throughout Tempopo. Ultimately that doesn't seem like it was a priority here, which is fine, but I couldn't help but wish for a little something as I flicked through each level with relatively little to do in-between. I'm not asking for grand cutscenes or never-ending text boxes here, but something more frequent to break up the puzzling would have been appreciated. As much as I enjoyed Tempopo's puzzles—I don't want to downplay their challenge here, and I even had to switch difficulty modes down to Adventure, which highlights which blocks require a command, on one or two levels—I couldn't help but feel likesomethingwas missing. Something to elevate it beyond a relatively solid puzzler. I think Tempopo's biggest problem is it throws all of its tools at you straight away, and then doesn't do a whole lot to build upon them. It makes many of its original 60 levels—there are additional levels once you finish the main game, though I've yet to dabble in them—feel samey at times, even when they're not. But despite that, Tempopo is still a good, robust puzzler. It's the model Steam Deck game, too. Part of my time spent reviewing Tempopo was while I had the flu, and it proved to be the perfect game to lie on my couch with while fighting whatever nasty germs were ripping through my system. I can imagine this'll be a great one to tackle a couple of levels at a time before bed or on a long weekend morning, challenging your brain just enough in short bursts that you can pick it up and put it down again 10 minutes later. If you're looking for a nice, slow-burn puzzler, Tempopo is one you should definitely keep an eye on. Engaging and relaxing all at once, each level is a joy to figure out. However, if you're searching for pockets of Witch Beam's excellent storytelling, it's sadly taken a pretty major backseat here. Tempopo's rhythmic puzzling is undeniably great, but is let down by a lack of mechanical pacing and an absence of Witch Beam's coveted storytelling.

    "title": "Forget Dress to Impress and Blue Lock Rivals, my new favourite Roblox experience is literally driving around Dorset",
    "article_text": "Back to the home land. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I haven't spent a huge amount of time exploring the variety of experiencesRobloxhas to offer, but when I see a particularly niche one, I feel compelled to check it out. Rather than spending any more time strutting my stuff on the runway, or becoming the best soccer player my newest obsession hits a little closer to home. This time around, I've been taking the wheel of a pink Ford Ka and revisiting the humble county of Dorset in the United Kingdom. All you do inDorset Countyis drive around the actual county of Dorset. There is literally nothing else to it. There's nothing to aim toward, nothing to unlock, and no skills to master. Besides good driving of course. You boot up the game, spawn in a car of your choice from a pretty extensive list, and you're off. Or so I thought. I actually sat in the car park for way longer than I like to admit begging someone in the chat to help me figure out how I could get my car to move in any direction. This is because driving in Dorset County is surprisingly in-depth. I expected to just lean on W and shoot forward, but you actually need to change gears with Q and E in order to navigate the roads. This also applies to reversing, since you need to manually select reverse gear too. So yes, parallel parking is still my nemesis and takes me about 10 minutes to do, even in Roblox. On top of remembering to change gears, you also have keys to indicate left and right, and a horn which other players were using pretty generously as I slowly pulled out of basically every junction I came across. But once you're remembering all your changes and correctly signalling where to go, Dorset County becomes your oyster. Or moreso, the section of Dorset that's currently available does. There are quite a few sections currently consumed by a white haze I like to call \"the fog\" and labelled with a promise that they are coming soon. But still, there's more than enough of Dorset for you to enjoy for the time being. If you're anything like me, most of this time will be spent stalling in a car park. I don't really play racing games, and driving simulators definitely aren't a genre I reach for. But there was something about Dorset County that kept me coming back. I wasn't racing to get ahead or competing with other players, I was just free to pootle along in my own car at my own pace, and there was something really comforting about that. Until a car comes speeding up behind you and pushes you into a ditch before racing off again, but I digress. Another thing that surprised me about Dorset County is that bad driving gets banned, which is stated very clearly on the experiences page within the Roblox launcher. From my days jumping in and out of Dorset County, I did notice that players were ruthless when it comes to rolling out these reports, too. I accidentally found myself amidst several virtual pile ups while definitely not speeding down country lanes, whether or not these people were roleplaying I'm not sure, but the enraged reactions and threats to report each other were definitely flowing. These were the only instances where my fellow drivers turned on one another though. The rest of the time I was impressed by how sociable everyone was. Especially since most of my other experiences in Roblox have been competitive and I've left feeling like everyone is really mean. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One of the most wholesome experiences I witnessed was a group of people inside the supermarket which definitely wasn't Lidl who were roleplaying doing their weekly shops. I can only assume this was a group of young kids, mostly because I hate doing a weekly food shop so I just assume everyone else feels the same, but it was sweet to see nonetheless. One day they'll learn the stress of any supermarket after work on a friday but for now, I'll let them enjoy it. Moments like these really made me appreciate Dorset County. For a game that is so simple by premise, the people playing it really love it. I liked it because of the lack of pressure it puts on you, and I assume a lot of the people I came across feel the same way. But also maybe everyone just has a soft spot for Dorset. Or driving around a virtual United Kingdom. Or both, I'm not one to judge. Kara is an evergreen writer.

    "title": "Corsair Void Wireless V2 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Corsair Void Wireless V2 offers a comfortable headset with a decent set of cans to immerse yourself in most gaming experiences. It won't blow the doors off, but at $120 its flexibility between PC and console makes it a solid option. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The Corsair Void Wireless V2 is the latest gaming headset refresh from the peripheral company. While they don't overtly dazzle, they're a versatile entry to the roster with simplicity at the heart. Gaming headsets have become a key element for a lot of players. Esports like Call of Duty and Counter-Strike 2 become four-dimensional tactical experiences once you find that pair of cans that fits the bill. I'm not best equipped to talk about the nuances of footstep listening, but the 7.1 surround sound embedded in the Void V2 certainly added to my routine of respawning. Irritatingly, the Dolby Atmos inclusion isn't baked into the iCUE software and requires a separate download. I understand why licensing and software agreements must be a nightmare for hardware manufacturers, but good lord, don't make me endure the Microsoft Store. Spatial audio like Dolby Atmos is still incredibly effective though and the Void V2, despite not having top of the line innards, managed to impress. Hearing bullets and explosions pop off around you in FPS games will never not be satisfying. Bloatware is the bane of gaming peripherals, filling your PC with yet more things to stop launching at boot. It's a shame Dolby Atmos relies on external software, but thankfully Corsair's iCUE remains fairly unobtrusive. Audio driver:Custom 50mm neodymiumFrequency response:20 Hz - 20 kHzImpedance:32 Ohms @ 1 kHzSensitivity:116 dB (± 3 dB)Mic type:Omni-directionalMic impedance:2.2k OhmsMic frequency response:100 Hz – 10 kHzMic sensitivity:-40 dB (± 3 dB)Dimensions:105(L) x 170(W) x 193(H) mmWeight:303 gPrice:$120 | £100 | €120 | $189 AUD In non-esports titles, like the recently released Promise Mascot Agency and 2024's Slitterhead, the headset again was good enough. I found that three hours had passed driving around in Promise Mascot Agency, without any need to take off the headset for a moment. When connecting the headset to the Steam Deck, where iCUE isn't available, it sounds good enough at its defaults. Yes, of course altering the presets to the exact settings would be great, but sometimes that's just not an option. Corsair always bring at least a baseline of quality, where the average player will probably enjoy what they have and as someone who spends quite a bit of time with higher-end hardware, these are perfectly adequate at $120. The Void V2 is exceptionally light, with its slightly cheap plasticky feel paying off dividends for those of us who go long. Headsets tend to dig in or hurt the top of the head after a while, especially in the cheaper end. It's killer that Corsair has managed to make the most out of that Void name, because it sometimes feels like one wrapped around my head. Adding to that comfort is a pair of memory foam cups, with the same material on the headband. As someone who can get quite \"dusty\", usually I tend to stray away from anything with a fabric and if that's you too, it could be better to seek out something with a different material. However, the Void V2 is comfortable, and after a few weeks with the device I did notice the memory foam slowly taking shape. Where the Corsair Void Wireless V2 shines is in its versatility. Yes, this is PC Gamer, and yes, the headset functions best on PC. You've not only got access to 2.4 GHz wireless, but Bluetooth for things like PC handhelds. Bluetooth has gotten so robust that you no longer need the dongle for other supported systems like the Switch or PlayStation 5. Connections are super quick, and swapping between the two modes when moving over to another system is simply a button press. As long as you don't do what I did, and connect the Bluetooth to the PC as well, stupidly trying to figure out why it wouldn't then connect to the Switch. On PS5 you can even use the spatial audio capabilities through Bluetooth. However, it was a choice between rent and a PlayStation, so I've not been able to test just how good that is myself. While I appreciate that this is a wireless device, there is no method of wired connections. Even the AceZone A-Spire Wireless still supported a wired connection, and this omission is genuinely quite irritating. Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz have gotten infinitely better, but sometimes with a computer loaded up with dongles, there can be some connection issues. Thankfully, they work while charging, unlike some recent headphones I've come into contact with. Listen to the Corsair Void Wireless V2's microphone here: Usually I'm not a fan of RGB, but here it's mostly inoffensive. It shines forwards through two thin strips and isn't bright enough to bother anyone or myself late at night. ✅ You're after a one solution fits all headset for your gaming:The Void V2 works on Switch, PlayStation, and PC with no hassle for an all-in-one headset, with super quick switching between 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth. ✅ You're after a comfortable headset option:The Void V2 rarely needed to be taken off for a break during testing, as its 303 g weight barely makes a dent after several hours in front of the PC. ❌ You're expecting top-of-the-line sound:Much like other headsets in its range, the Corsair Void V2 doesn't do much in the way of anything impressive with its sound, outside of Dolby Atmos, with the defaults being passable. As for the microphone, it's also something that didn't bother me. Some headsets in the same category as the Void V2 will attach a bulbous wind screen or make it so the arm is constantly in the peripheral vision. It bugs the hell out of me, mid-game, and all I can do is slowly find my eyes permanently gazing at it. Corsair's Void V2 offers a thin boom arm with an equally thin head. With it raised, it remains out of sight and is fairly strict with its pull-down-to-activate design. There's a bit of resistance as you yank it down, confirming physically when it is a hot mic. It also sounds fine. Again, nothing to write home about and not something you'd want to live stream with. On that front, it'd do in a pinch, but it's mostly for gaming with, and I had no complaints from people on the other end. The omnidirectional nature also means you don't have to expertly twist it so you don't sound like you're at the end of a narrow corridor. The Corsair Void Wireless V2 will not blow anyone away, and that's fine. It's a straight shooter, with minimal gimmicks and a focus on getting the job done. In the few weeks I had with it, I rarely had a complaint and found its lightweight nature an exceptional boon in a sea of increasingly heavy hardware. At the very minimum it sounds perfectly passable, and at its best, a decent option for the $120 price mark. This is absolutely the device you want if you're after something that works between multiple systems, without the headache of swapping dongles and worrying about console compatibility. The Corsair Void Wireless V2 offers a comfortable headset with a decent set of cans to immerse yourself in most gaming experiences. It won't blow the doors off, but at $120 its flexibility between PC and console makes it a solid option. Joel’s grim obsession with bad games and even worse hardware has led him on this path.

    "title": "This single-fan RTX 5060 Ti has me *this* close to upgrading",
    "article_text": "And I don't even care much for Frame Generation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The RTX 5060 Ti launch wasn't the most exciting ever, but it at least signalled that we're finally in an era where affordable GPUscould(stocks willing) start gracing the shelves. In fact, as someone still using an RTX 3060 Ti, a reasonably priced RTX 5060 Ti is genuinely tempting in a way the rest of the RTX 50-series is not. I've found myselfespeciallytempted by theZotac RTX 5060 Ti Solo, a dinky thing with a single fan. It's just been announced by Zotac, alongside Amp and Twin Edge (OC) designs for RTX 5060-series cards. Single-fan cards arenothing new, of course—especially not for Zotac—but something about the RTX 5060 Ti Solo tickles my fancy in just the right way. I'm not sure whether it's the diagonal lining, subtle brown colouring, or just the fact that it's a relatively low-power GPU (compared to the rest of the RTX 50 series) that will presumably not be too hampered by the stubby single-fan design—whatever the reason, something about it is calling out to me the current GPU market, which is a hellscape of out of stock signs in the US and apparentlycompletely fine in the UK. Nvidia's RTX '60 Ti cards are often good choices for SFF builds because they tend to offer decent entry-level current-gen performance without all the heat production and power guzzling of RTX '70 and '80 cards. In our Jacob R'sRTX 5060 Ti review, he found the latest Nvidia GPU to perform about 20% better than the RTX 4060 Ti and only consume alittlemore power and produce just alittlemore heat (though much depends on the specific AIB design, of course). We tested two triple-fan cards for that review, and both largely stuck around the mid 60 degrees celsius mark. The twin-fan PNY RTX 5060 Ti Dual Fan OC, however, hit mid 70 degrees at times. This single-fan design? Well, let's just say a 180 W TGP is quite a lot for a compact card to dissipate, but it's not impossible. We're not given any actual pricing for the RTX 5060 Ti Solo yet, though, so I might have to eat my words. But let's be optimistic, eh? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. About this particular card,Zotac says: \"For true SFF-PC enthusiasts, the single-fan ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 5060 SOLO remains a top choice for its maximum compactness, and the ability to sit comfortably in 99% of PC cases on the market. Despite being the smallest GPU of ZOTAC GAMING’s 50 Series line-up, the compact SOLO offers the same great performance.\" That 99% figure comes from the fact that it's two slots wide, and of course a little horizontally challenged—which is a good thing. Zotac's well into the SFF market, as we've seen with theZotac ZBox Magnus One SFF gaming PC, and I reckon a single-fan RTX 5060 Ti makes a lot of sense as another step in this direction. That, or I'm just looking for ways to justify finally upgrading my GPU… don't judge, okay.

I don't see the need for yet another currency in Marvel Rivals. With the addition of unstable molecules, which is a mouthful anyway, there are now four different kinds of cash in Marvel Rivals: Lattice (the gold currency which you can purchase), Chrono Tokens (which is used for the Battle Pass), units (which you use to buy skins), and now unstable molecules. The only benefit I see from having so many different kinds of currencies in Marvel Rivals is having the ability to confuse players just enough that they spend more money than they understand. There's just enough distance between purchasing Lattice and buying in-game items with the other currencies that spending could be quite hard to keep track of, especially if you can earn Chrono Tokens and Lattice through the battle pass or challenges every now and then. \"Costume token, lattice, chrono tokens, units, unstable molecules,\"mentionsa fan on Reddit. \"This is wayyy too many currencies to keep track of lmao.\" While anotherplayer points outthat this move is kind of on-brand: \"I'm not surprised, it's very mobile-gamey of them. Here's to hoping it's not a grind.\" But most players seem to be focusing more on the new customisable colours than the currency, which I totally understand. Seeing the new recolours, loads of people are talking about how Magik kinda looks like Hatsune Miku (orHatsune Magiku) or how Bucky now resembles a Belmont with his brown hair and vampire-hunting attire: \"Bucky even has holy water strapped to his leg,\" oneplayer notices. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Although a couple of players do point out how making players pay more for a better version of an already expensive skin is kind of scummy. \"My very first thought was that they conveniently add a paid-for recolour to a colour scheme that is MUCH better than purple and pink,\" oneplayer says. The Luna Snow skin in question is already 2,200 units ($22 / £19.58), and spending an extra $6 on it to make it look better feels like an unnecessary extra step. While these recolour options are really cool and a great idea to add a personal touch to costumes, I'll probably steer clear of them for now. With how expensive the base skins are, plus the recolour fee, and how confusing and annoying a new currency is, it just doesn't seem worth the effort right now, but hopefully it'll change for the better going forward.

After widespread fan requests,Marvel Rivalsfinally has skin customisation, but it comes with a catch. You can't just pick any old colour you want and slap it onto your skin. No, instead, you need to getunstable moleculesto buy colour palettes. Alongside chrono tokens, costume coins, and various premium currencies, this new item is yet another thing to keep track of. On the bright side, the newMarvel Rivals costume customisationoptions do look great. This feature hasn't been rolled out to every character or skin quite yet—just a handful of the most popular faces that you can likely guess right away—but more are coming in the future. As such, you'll want as many unstable molecules as possible. Right now, you can only get unstable molecules byexchanging latticein a one-to-one conversion. Each recolour costs 600 unstable molecules, so that's 600 lattice you'll have to put down. You'll be prompted to convert your currencies when you go to buy a costume recolour, whether in the store or the hero gallery for applicable characters. Frustratingly, you can't buy lattice in a single 600-pack. Instead, you'll either have to get 1,000 lattice, which costs $9.99/£7.99, or a 100-pack and a 500-pack, which will cost you $5.98/£4.78. NetEase has commented that there will benew ways to get unstable molecules in Season 3, but whether that's purchasing them directly (without the need to exchange), usingunits, earned through events, or even the battle pass, is yet to be seen.

    "article_text": "Tweak your already fancy supersuits with new colour palettes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At long last, NetEase has finally treated us tocostume customisationinMarvel Rivals. It's not quite as extensive or intricate as many would have hoped, but it's certainly a step in the right direction. That being said, its limited rollout across the roster and yet another currency added to the mix make skin customisation rather complicated. Right off the bat, it's important to note that NetEase has confirmed changes will be made to this system in Season 3, particularly regarding how you get the premium currency required. Below I'll go over exactly what you need to do to customise your skins and all the costumes that currently have colour swaps available. To customise skins, you need to find an applicable costume in either the hero gallery or the store, and click thenew customise button above the usual acquire or equip option. Then you just need to select an alternate colour palette, purchase it using a new premium currency calledunstable molecules, and equip it. You'll unlock the default colour palette whenever you purchase a skin with customisation options, but you need to buy additional colours separately. You can swap between colour palettes whenever you want by heading back to this menu if you ever change your mind. Where it gets confusing is that only a handful of skins actually have customisation options right now, so it's easy to miss this new feature as the majority of the roster (let alone individual skins) don't actually have access to it. Right now, only four characters and skins have customisation options: Changing your costume colour won't just change your in-game model during gameplay, but also in MVP animations and emotes. Given how oddly restrictive emotes and animations can be, I'm actually quite surprised to see this, even if it is just changing a suit's colour scheme.

    "title": "Former BioWare producer says Baldur's Gate 3's impact on game dev will be 'somewhat muted' thanks to industry convention, and I can't help think we've got it all backwards",
    "article_text": "\"A perfect storm of factors, working together, to make this game work.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Baldur's Gate 3 is a singular game—a step up for the CRPG genre, proof that turn-based combat and deep, thoughtful storytelling is still fashionable no matter what somelive-service brainwormed EA suitmight tell you, and likely to be one of the best RPGs that'll arrive this decade. It's so singular, in fact, that there's been an enduring discourse around whether it's raised the bar for the genre, or whether that's setting a standardimpossible for other studios to meet. Mark Darrah, an executive producer at BioWare until 2020, clearly leans towards the latter, as he explainedon his YouTube channel yesterday. \"Baldur's Gate 3 was immensely successful—and [it] did change the landscape in terms of who was willing to look at an RPG,\" Darrah explains. \"But I think itsimpacton the way that games are actually developed is going to be more muted than people who are outside the videogame industry might be expecting.\" Darrah explains that it's not about time or money—though BG3 did have both—but rather, he posits that the game was a \"perfect storm of factors, working together to make this game work. Some of which are externalities that aren't something that another studio can replicate.\" Those factors include working with D&D \"arguably at the peak of its popularity—and its popularity has since declined\", but also a unique combo of licensing, good will, and studio structure that has allowed Larian to go against conventional trends and industry wisdom about RPGS. \"Having an [unvoiced] protagonist, having cinematics that are simplified in some cases,\" and so on. Now, I won't disagree with Darrah and say that these things haven't been tremendously unpopular with AAA developers—but I've been banging the 'unvoiced protagonists are better' drum since Dragon Age: Origins, and I'm feeling a little miffed. I've been plenty immersed by CRPGs such as Pillars of Eternity where most of the action just happens in a text box. Glossy cinematics and a Shepard-esque heroes are nice, but they're also completely overvalued, and have been ever since Dragon Age made the jump. \"Maybe the videogame development industry is wrong about these assumptions about what it can get away with, but to a large degree when they look at Baldur's Gate 3, what they see is a game that very successfully executes on what it is trying to do. But what it's trying to do isn't something that a lot of other games would be allowed to do.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I think Darrah is coming from a case of practical wisdom here, and he is very much correct when he says \"It will have impact, it will influence RPGs going forward, I just expect that the influence will be somewhat muted.\" I think most big studios with execs looming over the development teams foster incredibly punishing environments with little room for agility—justlistening to Gaider describe the acrid environmentthat plagued BioWare before his departure is proof of that. But I can't help but wonder if we've got it backwards. Baldur's Gate 3 might have a muted impact if the games industry—which has seen a huge amount of turmoil and job insecurity despite making an absurd amount of money all the time—simply continues on as it has been. Mind, I'm not expecting developers working under duress to simply spin up Baldur's Gate 3, and my sympathy goes to them. Especially since your average punter will strike out at developers, rather than publishers or publishing executives—working under the assumption that videogames are made with a magic wand and not massive projects controlled by enormous corporations. But we've been shown a game like Baldur's Gate 3 ispossible,and it's incumbent to work towards a future where that's a thing. As PC Gamer's own Robin Valentine pretty astutely pointed out earlier this year, the future of RPGsvery well may just not liewith AAA studios like BioWare. RPGs might just be a genre beyond the corporate environment, requiring a level of enthusiasm a board of shareholders simply can't spin up. That doesn't mean the industry won't change, it'll just be leaving studios like BioWare behind.

    "article_text": "Get around a lot quicker. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Getting around inRuneScape: Dragonwildscan be a bit of a pain. There's a lot of ground to cover, so getting from point A to B, or from your bedroll to your gravestone, can be time-consuming. Luckily, there's a way you canunlock fast travel, but to do so, you need to start crafting lodestones, and you won't be able to do this until you've found a specific material. Confusing, right?To craft a lodestone, you need a vault core. These are, funnily enough, exclusivelyfound in vaults which are marked by a little white gate iconon your map. Once you've got a hold of one, you're one step closer to getting around a lot quicker. Here's what you need to do to actually unlock fast travel. Crafting a Lodestone once you've got a vault core is very straightforward, and the chances are you already have the additional materials you need in your pockets. I'd advisemaking two at once, since you can only travel between lodestones, so only having one seems pretty pointless. There are around three vault cores per vault, so you'll have more than enough after clearing your first one. If you only craft one to start, you'll only be able to travel between the temple where you start the game and the lodestone you've just placed. You'll need the following materials for a single lodestone: When you've crafted one in the build menu, you'll be able to place it wherever you like. Just remember that vault cores can be challenging to come by, especially if you don't make it far enough in a single vault run to get more than a measly lone vault core, so you might want to think a little more carefully about your placement. Once your lodestone is placed, walk up to it and interact with E. This will open up your map, and you need to select which lodestone you want to travel to. This willcost you law runes,and the further you want to go from your current location, the more it'll cost you. Fortunately, you canget law runes easily from goblin sacksto start. But, you will unlock the crafting recipe to use at a rune altar once your runecrafting skill hits 16.

    "title": "The latest rumoured AMD Ryzen Z2 processor could be used in cheap SteamOS handhelds",
    "article_text": "The Steam Deck's 'Van Gogh' APU to hit the open market? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are currently moreAMD RyzenZ2 processors than there are different handhelds using them, and the list seems to grow ever longer. Now, at least, we have some idea what one of the latest rumoured Z2 APUs might be all about: It might be for SteamOS handhelds. There are currently just three officially announced Ryzen Z2 processors, but we've been hearing talk of two more. We first heard about asupposed Ryzen Z2 A processorearlier in the month, alongside a supposed Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, which is said to be the same as the Z2 Extreme but with an added NPU. Now, Hoang Anh Phu, the same leaker who originally tipped us all off to these two APUs, isclaiming(viaVideoCardz) that the Z2 A will be a 'Van Gogh'-based processor. 'Van Gogh' is the codename given to the Zen 2/RDNA 2 APU at the heart of theSteam Deck. The eagle-eyed among you will notice that those are a lot of '2's (Zen 2 and RDNA 2) for an upcoming processor—we're currently on Zen 5 and RDNA 4, so what gives? The answer to that might have something to do with SteamOS. The AMD Van Gogh APU was custom-made for the Steam Deck, which really means it was custom-made for SteamOS. So, if the Ryzen Z2 A is based on Van Gogh, it's reasonable to assume it'll be tailored to run SteamOS very well. Combine this with the fact that SteamOS has beenreadying 'support for non-Steam Deck handhelds' for quite some time, and that we're anticipating non-Steam Deck SteamOS handhelds in the near future, and the picture paints itself. It looks like the AMD Ryzen Z2 A might be an upcoming APU specifically tailored to non-Steam Deck SteamOS handhelds. So, whileValve has said \"there is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck\", if this latest rumour is true there might very well be reason to believe there will at least be Z2 handhelds running SteamOS and using the same (or similar) hardware to the Steam Deck. The three currently announced Ryzen Z2 processors are theZ2 Extreme(Strix Point and RDNA 3.5),Z2(Hawk Point and RDNA 3), andZ2 Go(Rembrandt-R and RDNA 2). The latter in particular, the Z2 Go, shows that AMD isn't afraid of using previous-gen architectures in the Z2 line-up. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. However, this doesn't fully account for the fact that Van Gogh is still such an old processor that it will hardly offer next-gen performance for upcoming handhelds. Unless, of course, there are some changes made. The Van Gogh APU in the Steam Deck has four CPU cores, with eight threads, and eight RDNA 2 compute units (CUs) for graphics. If that CU count was bumped up to the 12 that we see in many handhelds today, we might get a cracking SteamOS processor. The CPU cores wouldn't even need to be bumped up, really—not for an entry-level handheld. It would still presumably be a cheap/entry-level APU, too. And given the first SteamOS handheld we're expecting to see is aLenovo Legion Go S, that would make sense, because the Windows version of this that I tested is also relatively cheap/entry-level thanks to its Z2 Go 'Rembrandt-R' generation APU. All of this is speculation, of course, but if Ryzen Z2 A does launch and it's based on Van Gogh, then I reckon we can expect some cheap and efficient SteamOS handhelds on the market before too long.

    "article_text": "The Kickstarter page has closed leading up to launch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Portable PC gaming has to be one of the coolest innovations in the space in recent years. Valve's own Steam Deck and other similar Switch form factor gaming PCs are becoming huge business, and there's plenty of competition keeping the space fresh. One such competitor was theAOKZOE A1 Pro,which impressed us with its great battery life, performance, and quiet and cool processing. Well AOKZOE is back, and its new A1X handheld PC is quickly reaching its launch date onKickstarter. We first got a sneaky look at the A1 successor at thebeginning of the yearwhenAOKZOEteased us with a look at the specs. It doesn't look to have changed much since this early look. The new A1X still looks a lot like the A1 Pro with the biggest change being that sweetAMD Ryzen9 AI HX 370 chip. We'll have to wait to see how real world testing goes, but this boosted chip could give us upwards of 30% in performance over the A1. The other features spruked are the 8-inch 120 Hz VRR native landscape display (many handheld screens are currently natively portrait) and a 72.7 Wh battery. That screen should provide a much smoother experience than the 60 Hz we saw on the A1, and it being natively landscapeshouldmean that the touch experience is better calibrated in normal use, but will probably require more power to run it. This means we might not see the benefit of that larger battery, as the boost over the A1's 65 Wh may go entirely to powering the screen and new chip. Even if that's the case it should make for a nice upgrade, especially as our reviewer was pretty happy with the life on the A1. The Kickstarter page for the A1X has locked down as it comes up to launch so there's not a heap more information to go on. We'd love to know more about some of the other specs, especially which clocks AOKZOE have gone with to see how effective that new Ryzen chip will be, but for now we'll just have to wait. Pricing is another thing we're going to have to wait and see about for this new handheld. The AOKZOE A1 Pro is currently sold out at its sale price of $899 USD, and has a MSRP at $1,099. It's fair to expect the A1X to sit slightly higher than that thanks to its extra specs, but that also unfortunately positions it at a prime price point to sufferTrump's tech tariffs. Still, with the Kickstarter set to launch soon, hopefully that wait won't be much longer.

    "title": "Android phones will reboot after 3 days of inactivity in new security update, but don't worry, this is a good thing. Just make sure you know your PIN",
    "article_text": "Make sure your loved ones know theirs too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Android users should double check their pincodes thanks to Google's new update for the mobile operating system. The new v25.14 release of Google Play Services includes a security update forcing phones to reboot after three days of inactivity. This will trigger the standard boot up procedure for an Android device, which includes requiring the users pin before allowing full functionality. The update has gained attention among tech sites across the web, includingThe Verge,ArsTechnica,TechCrunch, and of course us here at PC Gamer. All this press tends to make little updates like this feel a whole lot scarier than they need to. But, don't worry, all you need to do to prepare for this one is make sure you know what pin you set for your device. It's probably a good idea to check in on any tech-challenged relatives and friends to make sure they do the same. You might save yourself a few hours of pain in the future for the hassle. Rather than be something to fear, this security update is actually a pretty friendly and helpful one, and most are unlikely to ever see it in action. If you can remember the last time your phone was inactive for three whole days, I salute you. For most folks, it's pretty likely that this kind of inactivity indicates a lost or stolen device. Forcing a restart means the phone will enter a semi-functional state that keeps a bunch of data encrypted and inaccessible until that pin is entered. This makes it that little bit harder for bad actors to get into your precious data like social media accounts, emails, bank apps, and of course your curated collection of personal images. This won't just work on recognised thieves, if your phone is ever being detained this is also a great feature. Needing to get passed that initial pin will make snooping much harder for nosy authority figures of all stripes. As far as personal security is concerned, this update is a win for the consumer's rights. Even thesoon to be slightly lowered walled garden of Applehas had a similar feature in iOS running since last year, which has alreadyhampered police effortsto get information from phones. The other big benefit behind a feature like this is phones like to be rebooted. The ancient scrolls of wisdom teach us to ask ourselves a simple question when a device misbehaves: \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\" Those words continue to ring true today, because they are. Computers almost always benefit from a restart, and thanks to the almost constant use, phones usually don't get one often enough. As a person who spent years working in mobile device technical support, please, restart your damn phones sometime. But before you do that, make sure you know your pin. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If there's one other thing I learned working with phones, it's how few people know their pins. Since phones don't turn off that often, a lot of users who only have pins for restarts have completely forgotten they even set one. Really the only thing even slightly scary about this security update is how many users are going to get locked out of their phones. So please, make sure you know your pin. TheGoogle Play Services v25.14 updatehas already begun its rollout, and will continue releasing across Android devices over the following weeks. It might be a good time to call your grandfolks, see how they're doing, ask about any important sets of numbers in their life.

    "title": "Nintendo take first Japanese Switch modder to court, resulting fine is 400,000% less than the one given to Gary Bowser",
    "article_text": "\"I was curious if people would think I was great for selling modified machines.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a Japanese first for the console, the Kochi District Court has delivered a guilty sentence for modifying and selling Nintendo Switch consoles. A 58-year-old transportation worker from Ryugasaki City, Fumihiro Otobe has been met with a fine and jail time for soldering and selling second-hand Switch consoles loaded with pirated software. Though these consequences seem like a slap on the wrist when compared to Nintendo's usual litigious tenacity. TechSpot reportsFumihiro Otobe was arrested in January this year after his house was searched under the suspicion of modifying Switch consoles to run pirated games. Police found four modified Switch units which had their circuit boards soldered allowing them to run modified games. Though they likely didn't even need to look with Otobe confessing immediately upon being charged saying \"I was curious if people would think I was great for selling modified machines.\" Otobe does what Nintendon't. While far from impossible, modifyingSwitch console hardware isn't easy. Even when using an also illegal premade modders chip, there's some super finicky soldering involved that most don't recommend consumers tackle by themselves. So, even if the police and Nintendo clearly aren't, I'm a little impressed by Otobe's efforts here. After modifying, Otobe was selling these modified switches online for 28,000 yen or about $195 USD. They also came generously prepackaged with 27 pirated games which could be worth somewhere between nothing and $70 USD a pop. Given a brand new Switch is about $300 USD, and even aSwitch 2 is only slated to be $450, that seems like a pretty good deal. Morally questionable, sure, but still a good deal. What makes Otobe the great's work really impressive here is just how lightly he got away with it all. He's only been ordered to pay a 500,000 yen or around $3,500 USD fine, and his two-year prison sentence has been suspended for three years. This usually means as long as Otobe plays nicely for the next few years he might not have to serve any time at all. It seems fair given this we can assume his scale of operation was pretty small and you'd have to be one of a lucky few to score one of his consoles. The small scale here is also why we see such a stark contrast in punishment when compared to other Switch hackers. In 2022 we saw one of the faces behind creating a slew of those Nintendo console modding chips we talked about earlier receive a40-month sentence and a $14.5 million finefor his crimes. That 400,000% price hike on the fine is less ridiculous when you realise he was part of an operation that far exceeded the hobby tamperings of Otobe. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. His last name is also Bowser, so it seems fair Nintendo wanted to make sure they got as many gold coins out of him as possible.

    "title": "Researchers develop Graphene Oxide membrane that could be used to create 'forever chemical'-busting water filter. Yes, another funky use for the wonder material",
    "article_text": "\"This breakthrough in PFAS filtration has the potential to revolutionise how PFAS contamination is managed globally.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As someone who's been writing about cool developments in the tech space for far too long now, I'm quite familiar with graphene. I can't go a few months without reading about some new use for this miraculous substance. Whether you're wanting to makesuper thin almost immediately rechargeable batteries, createtiny hard drives with massive storage capacity, ormimic human synapses, graphene is your go-to-guy. Now a team of researchers fromAustralia's Monash Universityhave developed a graphene water filter that just might change the world. Over the course of our lifetimes we consume a lot of stuff that really isn't fond of the human body. It's a human tradition. For our forefathers it was things like lead, coal dust, asbestos, and now we have microplastics and PFAS; things often referred to as forever chemicals because they just don't leave or break down, and instead prefer to build up inside our flesh vessels. PFAS are a big problem. They are a man-made chemical used in heat resistance and fire extinguishing chemicals quite widely, which has led to their buildup in places like waterways that provide drinking water. PFAS molecules have proved to be slippery little suckers, and traditional filters have only been able to remove about 35% of them, leaving the rest to keep flowing right into our taps.\"PFAS are difficult to manage because they dissolve easily in water and can spread far from their original source, making contamination challenging to contain and remediate. Removing small PFAS molecules from water has been a major hurdle for existing filters,\" explains Monash PhD candidate, Eubert Mahofa.\"Our approach solves this by filtering out and concentrating these harmful chemicals while still allowing water to flow through efficiently, making it a strong candidate to supplement the technologies for PFAS destruction.\" The new beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) modified graphene oxide (GO-βCD) membrane with nanoscale channels developed by the researchers at monash is a game changer for this. Not only has the team managed to filter closer to90% of PFAS in tests, they can also alter the graphene filter to selectively retain specific PFAS, and potentially other chemicals to deliver cleaner water. \"This breakthrough in PFAS filtration has the potential to revolutionise how PFAS contamination is managed globally, with applications ranging from landfill leachate treatment to industrial wastewater purification,\" says Professor Mainak Majumder, Director of the Australian Research Council’s Research Hub for Advanced Manufacturing with 2D Materials. \"Our technology opens new possibilities for developing advanced nanofiltration membranes tailored to remove specific molecular species by selecting appropriate binding chemistries.\" Not only can it be calibrated, but thanks to the shear alignment printing technique used it should also be easy to scale up for use on large projects. Hopefully this means we'll see the technology implemented to benefit communities large and small as soon as it's deemed safe to do so. In the meantime, that's still one more win for graphene, I can't wait to see what miracles researchers can work with it next.

    "article_text": "Help with today's Wordle if you need it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Whatever you need to solve today'sWordle, you'll find it ready and waiting for you just below. Cut straight to a win with today's answer if you like the idea of an easy victory, or see how you go and then take a peek at our clue for the April 17 (1398) puzzle if those yellow letters are refusing to turn green. You've got this. Three green letters right from the start? Heaven. Or hell, in my case. I had managed to uncover the only three green letters in the universe that could create a billion different five letter words (please don't check that \"fact\"), and spent the rest of the game panicking. Make sure you take a look at today's hint and spare yourself the same worry. An object, placed in a particular location. A castle would do this on a hill. A town on a riverbank. More plainly, a person using their feet to stay upright. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word. If you're stuck, there's no shame in coming back to the puzzle later in the day and finishing it up when you've cleared your head. A helping hand. The answer to the April 17 (1398) Wordle isSTOOD. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Meta is set to train its AI models with Europeans' public data, and you can stop it doing so",
    "article_text": "Public posts and users' interactions will soon feed Meta AI training When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta has resumed its plan to train its AI models with EU users' data, the company announced on Monday, April 14, 2025. All public posts and comments shared by adults across Meta's social platforms will soon be used to train Meta AI, alongside all interactions users directly exchange with the chatbot. This comes as the Big Tech giantsuccessfully launched Meta AIin the EU in March, almost a year after the firm paused the launch amid growing concerns among EU data regulators. \"We believe we have a responsibility to build AI that’s not just available to Europeans, but is built for them. That’s why it’s so important for our generative AI models to be trained on a variety of data so they can understand the incredible and diverse nuances and complexities that make up European communities,\" wrote Meta in theofficial announcement. This kind of training, the company notes, it's not unique to Meta or Europe. Meta AI collects and processes the same information, in fact, across all regions where it's available. As mentioned earlier, Meta AI will be trained with all public posts and interactions' data from adult users. Public data from the accounts of people in the EU under the age of 18 won't be used for training purposes. Meta also promises that no people's private messages shared on iMessage and WhatsApp will ever be used for AI training purposes, too. Beginning this week, all Meta users in the EU will start receiving notifications about the terms of the new AI training, either via app or email. These notifications will include a link to a form where people can withdraw their consent for their data to be used for training Meta AI. \"We have made this objection form easy to find, read, and use, and we’ll honor all objection forms we have already received, as well as newly submitted ones,\" explains the provider. It's crucial to understand that once fed into an LLM database, you will be completely losing control over your data, as these systems make it very hard (if not impossible) to exercise theGDPR's right to be forgotten. This is why privacy experts like Proton, the provider behind one of thebest VPNand encrypted email apps, are urging people in Europe concerned about their privacy to opt out of Meta AI training. \"We recommend filling out this form when it's sent to you to protect your privacy. It's hard to predict what this data might be used for in the future – better to be safe than sorry,\" Proton wrote on aLinkedIn post. Meta's announcement comes at the same time that the Irish data regulators have opened aninvestigation into X's Grok AI. Specifically, the enquiry seeks to determine whether Elon Musk's platform uses publicly-accessible X posts to train its generative AI models in compliance with GDPR rules.

    "title": "You can't hide from ChatGPT – new viral AI challenge can geo-locate you from almost any photo – we tried it and it's wild and worrisome",
    "article_text": "GPT o3 will think hard and find you When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's no secret that digital photo metadata contains everything from technical info about the camera that shot it to, based on GPS data, exactly where you were standing when you took the photo.ChatGPT, doesn't need that detail. The latest model GPT-o3 is shockingly good at geo-locating almost any photos you feed it. In thelatest viral crazeto sweep through the AI meme universe, people are feedingChatGPTPlus running the Advanced Reasoning model o3 images, often stripped of all metadata, and prompting it to \"geoguess this\". The really cool thing about it is that because model o3 is a \"reasoning\" model, it shows you its work, telling you how long it's thinking, displaying how it's splicing up an image to investigate specific parts, and explaining its thinking and how well it's doing at solving the goelocation riddle. I tried a few experiments, starting first with an image culled from an article about the26 best beaches. In this test, I made what I think was a critical error and gave away the game to ChatGPT. After downloading the image of the Praia de Santa Monica beach in Cape Verde (off the coast of Africa), I dropped it into ChatGPT with the prompt \"GeoGuessr\", which also happens to be the name of a popular online geo guessing game and is one of a handful of prompts people are using for geolocation guessing. It only took 24 seconds for ChatGPT to respond: Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Here’s an educated “GeoGuessr”‑style guess, following AP style: Probable setting:Boa Vista, Cape Verde — specifically a stretch such as Praia de Santa Mónica. Why this beach fits: Water color and clarity:The gradient from pale aqua to deep teal is common on mid‑Atlantic tropical islands, where volcanic shelves drop off quickly. Sand tone:The sand is light gold with very fine grain, matching Boa Vista’s deserts and dune‑fed beaches rather than the whiter coral sand of much of the Caribbean. Surf and slope:The breakers are modest but steady, typical of Atlantic swell hitting a long, shallow shelf; Mediterranean beaches rarely show this consistent whitewater. Sky and horizon:A faint haze over a light‑gray blue sky is consistent with harmattan dust that sometimes drifts west from Africa across the Cape Verde archipelago. Confidence level:Low to moderate. Many open, dune‑lined Atlantic beaches—from the Canary Islands to parts of Western Sahara or even certain Caribbean coasts—could look almost identical without landmarks. That was remarkably accurate. However, I noticed afterwards that the image file name included some location information. It was time to give ChatGPT o3 a more challenging task, and I knew exactly how to do it. Instead of downloading images, I would screen capture them and paste them into the prompt field. This method strips out all metadata and forces the model to use the image alone for its geolocation sleuthing. I chose an image of a bookstore, one where I wasn't even sure of the location. ChatGPT started by examining potential bookstores. It also zoomed in on numerous image details that it considered clues, like a Persian rug, and even some of the books and signage. In its thinkling out loud sort of way, o3 considered a wide range of bookshops in New York City and around the world: \"Hmm, the modern filament-style bulbs suggest a more contemporary feel. It could potentially be \"Daunt Books,\" but their walkway has an arched skylight, not the wooden style I'm seeing here.\" I know, it sounds like a real person. This went on for a few minutes as it thought, analyzed, and searched the web. Ultimately, it failed to come up with an answer. I could tell this feature was going viral because ChatGPT o3 failed multiple times, even to ingest and analyze the photo, complaining of server errors. Eventually, I got it working again and fed it first a portrait mode selfie and then the same shot without the portrait mode effect. On the former, it broke my image up into pieces and told me that I was in mid-town Manhattan. That was mostly accurate, but ChatGPT failed to determine my exact location and even admitted that its \"Confidence level\" was low. When I turned off the bokeh effect and fed it only a screen grab, it found my exact location in just 56 seconds. The result: Most probable location Midtown Manhattan — on the south side of East 42nd Street, just east of Park Avenue, in front of Cipriani 42nd Street (110 E. 42nd St.). Estimated coordinates: 40.7518 N, 73.9775 W. How the clues point there A green octagonal sign with yellow script and a matching pennant flag both read “Cipriani,” the exact street frontage of the landmark Bowery Savings Bank building that now houses Cipriani 42nd Street. Across the street stands the gold‑tinted curtain wall of 120 Park Ave. Its sloped glass pavilion, visible over your left shoulder, is unique to that address. The camera looks west; Midtown’s setback towers, a Sixth Avenue bus stop disk and the sliver of One Vanderbilt’s crown align with that sight line. A green Evergreen shipping container, used as a construction barrier, currently sits outside Grand Central’s Pershing Square plaza, matching the photo’s lower left corner. Confidence level Moderate. The Cipriani branding and the distinctive 120 Park Ave. façade give a high‑quality anchor, though similar curtain‑wall towers exist farther west on 42nd Street. I frustrated the model with a photo from Antigua that was taken on my car ride to the airport. It was a shot of a hillside through a fence. ChatGPT rightly guessed a tropical island near the Caribbean but could not pinpoint the exact location. For my last test, I gave it a clearer picture of the resort where I stayed. ChatGPT o3 thought for two minutes, 22 seconds before deciding it was Hawksbill Bay in Antigua. It got the island right, but my resort on Long Bay is located 46 miles away on the opposite side of the island. This is another fun AI game to play with friends, but there are some concerning privacy implications. If you take digital photos of yourself or anything in any location around the world and post them online, anyone with access to ChatGPT Plus could use them and the o3 model to suss out where you are or have been. And it's not just friends and family you have to worry about. Your employer could be looking or even the authorities might be interested in your location. Not that I'm implying you would be sought by the authorities, but just in case, maybe stop posting photos from your latest hideout.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just a day after massiveoutages on SpotifyandZoom, Walmart was experiencing issues with its online store in the United States. While it wasn't a complete outage, it did prevent folks from viewing products and checking out on the web and via the retailer's app. During the peak of the outage, which lasted from about 3 PM ET to 5 PM ET, we, along with many others, were unable to successfully search for anything, including products, or even load shopping category pages. For instance, when searching for an item – be it a Nintendo Switch 2 preorder, AirPods Pro, or Lego sets – we received a “Sorry…” graphic. Down Detector, a site that tracks outages and lets people mark issues, showed over 3,250 reported outages for Walmart as of 3:12 PM ET, which only began to lower closer to 5PM. The good news is that Walmart's site issues have since been resolved, but the retailer hasn't shed light on what caused the issue or acknowledged it publicly. Ahead, you can see our live reporting during Walmart’s issues with its online store on April 17, 2025. All appears well for Walmart as Down Detector reports continue to drop further and faster - now at just 489 as of 4:51 PM ET. Searching, adding to cart, and checking out all appear to be fully restored. It looks like the worst may be behind us as Walmart's website seems to be working as far as searching for and adding products to your cart goes. Searching for \"ipad\" wasn't working properly less than 20 minutes ago, but now it seems to work just fine. Similarly, searching for \"macbook air\" and \"apple juice\" all turn up tangible results. Down Detector reports are falling even lower to just 1,157 at 4:31 PM ET, so we hope this means Walmart is back online and ready for shopping. We'll keep an eye on Walmart's website and app to let you know if there's any more trouble in paradise. We'll call it that Walmart's online store appears to be coming back online, as just a few minutes after a few successful searches, that functionality appears to be hit or miss again. Category pages are still working, though, so hopefully it's a sign that the Walmart team is working to identify, fix, and eventually resolve the issues affecting its online store. Down Detector reports are starting to lower, now sitting at 2,505 as of 4:07 PM ET. Some good news for folks trying to shop on Walmart – Search is working for me again and letting me click into products and then add them to my cart. Plus, I can click on departments like Electronics or Fashion again. If you're not having a good experience with Walmart's online store, it's worth trying again. While there are still over 3,160 reported outages on Down Detector and many Walmart customers taking to X (formerly Twitter) and Threads to note issues loading and using both the site and app, the retailer has yet to comment on the issues. Judging from the comments on Down Detector, the issues accessing Walmart's online store appear to be happening across the United States. @Walmart Is .com down?April 17, 2025 @Walmart is your app down??April 17, 2025 Here's a look at the error page you'll encounter if you try to click on a department or one of the highlighted products on the homepage. If you're trying to click on one or are searching, know you're not alone in receiving the error page.

    "title": "Tiny startup could challenge Wasabi, iDrive, and BackBlaze with sovereign EU cloud storage solution at rock-bottom prices",
    "article_text": "Europe’s answer to cloud giants is here When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Storadera, a Tallinn-based cloud startup, is offering some of thebest cloud storage for photoswith S3-compatible storage at €6/TB/month. This puts it head-to-head with providers like Backblaze, which offers a slightly lower rate of €4.75/TB/month. The company's pitch lies not just in low pricing but also in jurisdiction. Being a Europe-based startup, its stored data is beyond the direct jurisdiction of non-EU countries, making it appealing to organizations that require data sovereignty. Storadera’s architecture relies onHDDsrather thanSSDsfor primary writes. “If we can offer fast enough service on 10x less expensive hardware, then it sounds like magic,” Tommi Kannisto, the founder of Storadera, explained. While SSDs are used for metadata, accounting for just 0.05 percent of total disk space, all major writes are done to traditional disks. \"QLC 100-plus TB SSDs are still too expensive – and probably will be for the next ten years,” Kannisto said. The company uses a hyperconverged setup, with all servers writing to JBODs – racks containing 102 conventional Western Digital hard drives – using erasure coding schemes such as 4+2 and 6+2, with 8+2 coming soon. Each server has 32GB of RAM and runs services written in 100,000 lines of Go code. “All software runs in all servers and all servers write to all JBODs. There is no load balancer unit,” Kannisto said. The system adapts to load, using “small blocks at times of low load with bigger blocks used at high load times,” and can achieve “close to 300MBps with 2MB files.” It is also preparing to implement higher-capacity shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives to reduce capital expenditure by up to 25 percent. Storadera also offers bucket geo-replication, object locking for immutability, and integrity checks every 60 days.

The company says it is doing well financially, with around 100 customers, including Telia and the Estonian government. It has positioned itself as one of thebest cloud storageandcloud backupoptions available. Despite making slightly less than €1 million a year, the company says it is sustainable and eyeing further growth. “We are profitable… we make a very good profit [and] we’re growing 5 percent/month in revenue,” Kannisto said.

    "title": "I fed NotebookLM a 218-page research paper on string theory and the podcast results were mind-blowing",
    "article_text": "Your fermions need to hear about my bosons When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. My latest NotebookLM podcast creation is deeper and more fascinating than anything I've ever created, and I bet it'll shock you, too. I don't understand string theory. In fact, I bet there's fewer than 1% of the world that can speak cogently on the subject, but I am fascinated by the concept and have read a bit on it. Not enough to understand or explain it to you, but enough to have a steady and abiding curiosity. AI, on the other hand, I think I understand and now regularly use as a tool. WhenGooglereleased a recentNotebookLM updatethat includes, among other things, mind maps, I thought it was time to bring together something at the very outer edges of my understanding and this bleeding-edge artificial intelligence capability. So I created a String Theory Podcast. First, a tiny primer on NotebookLM. It is a powerful AI-based research tool in which you can upload sources, and it will turn them into summaries and extrapolated information in the form of text, podcasts, and visual guides like mind maps. For me, the most fascinating bit has been the podcasts or \"Audio Overviews\", which churn out chatty audio conversations about virtually any topic you feed into them. I call it a podcast because the audio style walks a well-worn path of most popular podcast series. It's conversational, usually between two people, sometimes funny, and always accessible. I've been wondering, though, if you can stretch the limits of the format with a topic so deep and, honestly, confusing, that the resulting podcast would be conversational nonsense. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. My experiment, however, proved that while the current version of NotebookLM has its limits, it's far better at comprehending dense science bits than me and probably most people you or I know. Once I decided I wanted NotebookLM to help me with the topic, I went in search of string theory content (there's a lot more of it online than you might think), quickly stumbling on this218-page research paperfrom 2009 by University of Cambridge researcher Dr. David Tong. I scanned the doc and could tell that it was rich with string theory detail, and so far over my head, it probably resides somewhere near the rings of Saturn. Imagine trying to read this document and make sense of it. Maybe if someoneexplainedit to me, I'd understand. Maybe. I downloaded the PDF and then fed it into NotebookLM, where I requested a podcast and a mind map. It took almost 30 minutes for NotebookLM tocreate the podcast, and I must admit, I was a little anxious as I opened it. What if this mass of detail on one of physics' most confounding topics overwhelmed Google's AI? Might the hosts just be babbling incoherently? I shouldn't have worried. I'd heard these podcast hosts before: a somewhat vanilla pair (a man and a woman) who banter casually, while making witty asides. In this case, they were trying to explain string theory to the uninitiated. They started by talking about how they'd walk through the topic, covering bits like general relativity, quantum mechanics, and how, at least as of 2009, we had never directly observed these \"strings\". Earlier this month, somephysicists claimedthat they had, in fact, found the \"first observational evidence supporting string theory.\" But I digress. The hosts spoke like physics experts, but, where possible, in layman's terms. I quickly found myself wishing they had a guest. The podcast would've worked better if they were proxies for me, not understanding much at all, and had an AI-generated expert to interview. As the podcast progressed, the hosts dug into the details of string theory, specifically, the definition of a \"string.\" They described them as tiny objects that vibrate and added, \"all stuff in the universe comes from how tiny strings are vibrating.\" Things got more complex from there, and while the AI podcast hosts' tone never changed, I struggled to follow along. I still can't tell you what \"relativistic point particle viewed through Einstein's special relativity\" really means. Though I did appreciate the analogy of \"imagine a string moving through space time.\" The AI hosts used various tricks to keep me engaged and not completely confused. The male host would, like a podcast parrot, often repeat a bit of what the female host had just explained, and use some decent analogies to try to make it relatable. At times, the female host lapsed into what sounded like she was reading straight out of the research paper, but the male host was always there to pull her back to entertainment mode. He did a lot of chatty summarizing. I felt like I reconnected to the whole thing when they explained how \"string morphed into the theory of everything\" and added, \"bosons and fermions, partners in crime due to supersymmetry.\" After 25 minutes of this, my head was stuffed to the point of bursting with those still-theoretical strings and spinning with terms such as \"vertex operators\" and \"holomorphic.\" I hoped for a grand and glorious summary at the end, but the podcast abruptly ended at almost 31 minutes. It cut off as if the hosts ran out of stream, ideas, or information, and walked away from the mics in frustration and without signing off. In some ways, it feels like this is my fault. After all, I forced these SIMs to learn all this stuff and then explain it to me, because I could never do it. Maybe they got fed up. I also checked out the mind maps, which are branching diagrams that can help you map out and represent complex topics like string theory. As you can imagine, the mind maps for this topic start simple but get increasingly complex as you expand each branch. Still, they're a nice study companion to the podcast. It's also worth noting that I could enrich the podcast and mind maps with other research sources. I would simply add them into the sources panel in NotebookLM and rerun the \"audio overview\". For as much as I learned and as much as I trust the source material, I wondered about the podcast's accuracy. AI, even with solid information, can hallucinate, or at least misinterpret. I tried contacting the paper's author, Dr. Tong, but never heard back. So, I turned to another physics expert, Michael Lubell, Professor of Physics at City College of CUNY. Dr. Lubell agreed to listen to the podcast and give me some feedback. A week later, he emailed me this brief note, \"Just listened to the string theory podcast. Interestingly presented, but it requires a reasonable amount of expertise to follow it.\" When I asked about any obvious errors, Lubell wrote, \"Nothing obvious, but I’ve never done string theory research.\" Fair enough, but I'm willing to bet Lubell understands and knows more about string theory than I do. Perhaps, the AI podcasters now know more about the subject than either of us.

    "title": "What Strava buying Runna means for users of both fitness apps – according to their CEOs",
    "article_text": "\"We're keeping the two apps separate for the foreseeable\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This morning, news broke that two of the services on ourbest fitness appslist were joining forces:Strava is buying Runna. Strava, which we rated an excellent serviceat both free and premium tiers with a terrific social media platform and run-tracking integrations, doesn't really have much in the way of coaching, bar the availability of some static training plans. This seems to makeRunna, another highly-rated appbuilt around coaching plans, including an AI coaching service, a great fit. As Strava CEO Mike Martin put it in an interview with TechRadar, alongside Runna CEO Dom Maskell, \"The way that I think about it, it's like the world's largest team just got a new coach. I think that's a really exciting way to position it.\" After reading the reactions on the Runna subreddit (cautious optimism, unlike the furor aroundGarmin's new Connect+ premium tierlast month), I wanted to ask both CEOs, especially Martin, if there's a temptation to force Runna users to eventually onboard to a new system, in the same wayGooglehas done with theFitbitcommunity. Martin said: \"I want to be really clear to both communities and user bases... A key component of Strava is that we are and remain an open platform for the entire connected fitness industry. So we expect to continue to do that, and that is the way that Runna is is integrated in with Strava as well. \"I think there's lots of interesting opportunities for us to accelerate both the support that we provide for the the running community between the two businesses. And just to put a fine point on it, this is a growth and investment play for us... not to do a forced integration play, or something like that.\" I asked Maskell and Martin what the acquisition means for users of both platforms, and in the short term, nothing will change. However, it seems like a given Strava will eventually be able to use some of Runna's comprehensive workout plan-building Runna AI technology in some way. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I also asked what Runna will be taking from Strava: of course, Strava also offers features for cyclists, swimmers, triathletes, and all sorts of other disciplines. Could we see Runna-branded AI coaches for other sports in the future, with Strava's help and investment? Short answer: not yet. Maskell said: \"It has always been our long-term intention to explore other sports one day. The reason why we didn't do triathlon kind of a couple of years ago is because it's very complicated to do. We would have to build a swimming app for theApple Watch, and we would have to give customer support to cyclists, and all this kind of stuff. We wanted to really, really nail running before we started exploring other sports.\" However, Maskell has revealed some changes to his roadmap: \"We'll probably look to internationalize to non-English speaking languages, probably in the next couple of years. Strava has a lot of users... that number [of non-English speaking users] is very, very high. \"We might decide to translate a bunch of the coaching comments, all of the videos, all the kind of content in the app sooner, so that we're able to serve those users. I think that's the kind of thing that would make sense to expedite. \"In terms of other sports, I think that's more the long-term vision.\" Matt is TechRadar's expert on all things fitness, wellness and wearable tech.

    "article_text": "The Insta360 X4 is good, but it could be even better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Insta360 has long topped our guide to thebest 360 cameras– and a new teaser suggests it's preparing to launch a new flagship model. Fortunately, some recent leaks have also given us an idea of what to expect, with a successor to last year'sInsta360 X4looking highly likely. The X4 was only launched a year ago in April 2024, but a promo image for Insta360's event on April 22 suggests it'll be replaced next week. The image (below), which has the tagline \"all day, all night, all angles\", shows the reflection of a camera that very much looks like an X4. We've also recently seen some leaks that point to the arrival of an Insta360 X5 on April 22. The reliable@Quadro_Newshas posted two leaked images for an X5, and the 360 camera also appears to have been prematurely posted in an ad in the Best Buy app. WIN our next camera 👇 All day. All night. All angles.1️⃣ Follow @insta3602️⃣ Like & repost (1000+ reposts and we'll give away TWO!)3️⃣ Reply with the #1 activity you'd film with the cameraWinner on April 22 🤞*Do not attempt to replicate–smashing a camera may damage it. pic.twitter.com/vvElzEFvW0April 16, 2025 So what can we expect from the Insta360 X5? The leaks so far don't give much away, other than hinting at a mild redesign of the pill-shaped camera and potentially a bigger battery to boost its recording times. Insta360's teaser video is also light on details, mainly focusing on some of the impressive creative video effects that are the series' hallmark. OurInsta360 X4 reviewalso gave the current model five stars, suggesting that there's little room for improvement. The @insta360 X5 has gotten a nice upgrade. Let's see how the DJI 360 stacks up against it. Not much time left before the show,)#insta360 #insta360x5 pic.twitter.com/nZEz3HNWbuApril 15, 2025 But with Insta360 looking to extend its lead over GoPro (which still hasn't launched itsGoPro Max 2) andDJI, which is tipped to belaunching a DJI Osmo 360 camera this year, there are definitely some new features it could squeeze into its flagship camera. So, here are five things we'd like to see from the rumored Insta360 X5... Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Like most 360 cameras, one of the Insta360 X4's biggest weaknesses is low-light performance. It's still very much a day-time camera, but Insta360's teaser – with the tagline \"all day, all night, all angles\" – suggests its new model could improve this. The low-light weakness comes from a combination of sensor size and processing. Our X4 review noted that, while low-light images look \"fairly clean\" after being processed with Insta360's mobile and desktop editors, they were also \"a little smudgy as a result of noise reduction\". Hopefully, a combination of improved processing and a larger sensor (see below) will make the rumored X5 a more versatile camera that can be confidently used outside of bright daylight. The challenge for 360 cameras is that they need to house two image sensors, while remaining pocketable and travel-friendly. The Insta360 X4 combines two 1/2-inch sensors, which are decent but still something of a bottleneck on image quality – hence the inclusion of anHDRvideo option to improve detail in highlights and shadows. While I'm not expecting the X5 to go quite as far as theInsta360 One RS 1-Inch 360 Editionand jump to a 1-inch sensor, it'd be nice to see it upgraded to 1/1.3-inch sensors (the same size as the ones we recently saw on theInsta360 Ace Pro 2). That would help improve dynamic range, low-light shooting and straight-out-of-camera image quality. It could also help the X5 match the incoming DJI Osmo 360, which has been rumored to be going straight in with 1/1.3-inch sensors. It sounds like some long-awaited competition in the 360 camera space could be good news for us… While not a big issue in most recording modes, we did find that the X4 has a propensity to get warm quickly – particularly in those demanding high-resolution video modes. The obvious way to prevent this is to avoid shooting static, long-form8Kvideos, but it'd be good to see the rumored X5 take a step forward in heat management. This is less of an issue when shooting action, as there's some natural airflow to cool the camera down in those scenarios – but a reduction in overheating during stationary recording would again make for a more versatile 360 camera. We don't have many qualms about the Insta360 X4's build quality. Our review called it \"superb\" in this department and the camera is fully waterproof to 33ft / 10m, with all of its ports rubber-sealed and some handy color-coding inside the catch letting you quickly check to make sure everything's locked. But one upgrade that would be useful is user-replaceable lenses. While it's possible to do this with third-party kits, it certainly isn't straightforward and sending your camera in for repair is usually the best bet for deep scratches. It'd be good to see the rumored X5 offer something like GoPro's swappable lenses system. That may be difficult to achieve on a 360 camera, even if it is hinted at in Insta360's teaser video, where a workman smashes the camera with a hammer. The Insta360 X4 isn't exactly cheap at $499/ £499 / AU$879, but it is probably the most fun camera you can buy for that money. We also thought that was a fair price at the time of the X4's launch, because it was only a 10% markup from the X2 – a camera that launched back in 2022. Because Insta360 is based in China, there's a danger that the recent US tariffs could meddle with this pricing. But we're hoping that isn't the case and that the X5 (if it does indeed launch on April 22) comes in at a similar price to its predecessor, outside of the US at least.

    "title": "Apple has removed yet another popular VPN app from its Russian App Store",
    "article_text": "NORSE Labs DVPN was reportedly ranking #3 among Apple's top free apps in the country When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Earlier today, April 17, 2025, the Founder and CEO of NORSE Labs, Aleksandr Litreev, received a notification from Apple that itsdecentralized VPNapp was removed per Roskomnadzor's demand \"because it includes content that is illegal in Russia.\" The NORSE Labs DVPN app has gained huge popularity lately across the country, ranking #3 among Apple's top free apps before the block – theprovider reported. It adds to the over 100 VPNs, including some of thebest VPNson the market, currently unavailable in Russia's Apple App Store. \"Just a few hours ago, Apple removed our NORSE Labs DVPN app from the Russian App Store – without any valid court order – at the request of Roskomnadzor, the government’s censorship agency,\" announced Litreev in aX poston Thursday morning. A popularfree VPNapp especially for Russian Apple TV, Mac, and iPad users, DVPN is a decentralized VPN service by NORSE Labs that relies on a global network of independent nodes rather than centralized VPN servers. This feature, the providerexplains on its official website, should make it much harder for governments or ISPs to block access to the service. It doesn't then promise only better privacy and security, but also stronger censorship circumvention skills – exactly what's needed to bypass Roskomnadzor's internet blocks currently in place. A Russian activist and IT engineer,Litreev is a well-known opposition figurein Russia who was involved with Alexei Navalny's movement. In 2020, he managed to flee to Estonia and escape trial. Since then, he's been working in the decentralized VPN space to offer privacy and anti-censorship solutions to help people in Russia, China, Venezuela, and other countries enforcing strong control on the national internet. \"Ensuring secure and free access to independent media is a fundamental duty of any democratic power in the fight for human rights, and Apple picked the wrong side,\" said Litreev. Just a few hours ago, @Apple removed our @norselabs DVPN app from the Russian App Store—without any valid court order—at the request of Roskomnadzor, the government’s censorship agency.Thread 👇 pic.twitter.com/cVWWCzJsaoApril 17, 2025 NORSE Labs is only the latest victim of Roskomnadzor's crusade against VPN. VPN censorship efforts intensified in 2024 since a law enforced in March begancriminalizing the spread of informationabout ways to circumvent internet restrictions. This is likely the legal basis upon which the Russian censor body issues these requests. In 2024 alone, Apple was found to have killed at least 60 VPN apps in this way, bringing the total to98 VPN unavailable appsin September. These include some of TechRadar's favorites, such asNordVPN,ExpressVPN, andProtonVPN. The current toll is expected to be even higher, especially considering that another popular Russian VPN,Amnezia VPN, reportedly disappeared from the country's App Store at the end of October,becoming the last targetof Russia's anti-VPN actions in 2024. While Apple appears to have been largely compliant with Russia's orders so far, Google Play has also been targeted by similar removal requests. According to AppCentroship's latest data,Google received 212 VPN blocking ordersbetween March and April 2025. Among these, however, only 6 apps appeared to have been removed so far, bringing the total of unavailable VPN services on Russia's Google Play Store to 53. Litreev ensured that all users who have already downloaded the NORSE Labs DVPN app before its removal know that the app they have downloaded isn't at risk. \"The app will continue to work despite the Russian government’s attempts to block it,\" he said. In case you haven't downloaded it yet, you can still do so by changing your App Store region to any other country. The DVPN app remains available globally. Another alternative is using the DVPN mini-app version that the provider has launched on Telegram. This will remain functional as long as Telegram does, Litreev explains. \"While we’re working on a tool to help our Russian users bypass this absurd restriction and install the app directly, we’re also evaluating our options for legal action,\" he added.

Nintendo has quietly removed any mention of variable refresh rate (VRR) support from some of its regionalSwitch 2websites, suggesting the console may not offer the feature after all. That's according to Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie (viaVGC), who spotted that the US website has been updated since theNintendo Switch 2 Direct, and no longer mentions VRR support for docked play.

Googleblocked more than five billion bad ads in 2024 and suspended almost 40 million advertiser accounts that were engaged in fraudulent behavior in what was apparently a bumper year for scammers. In its2024 Ads Safety Report, Google outlined how bad ads have really taken off in recent months, alrgely thanks to the advancements inGenerative Artificial Intelligence(GenAI).

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Google's proactive measures in 2024 were impressive. The company either blocked or removed 5.1 billion ads that violated Google Ads policies. Furthermore, the search engine giant suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts, which prevented many ads from ever reaching the consumers in the first place. As a result, the number of stopped bad ads did not grow year-on-year, but remained relatively stable. Last year, Google removed 5.5 billion bad ads, and the drop seems to be due to the fact that Google banned significantly more advertiser accounts (12.7 million). The company also said to have permanently banned more than 700,000 advertiser accounts for policy violations related to AI-driven impersonation scams. \"To fight back, we quickly assembled a dedicated team of over 100 experts to analyze these scams and develop effective countermeasures, such as updating our Misrepresentation policy to suspend advertisers that promote these scams,\" Google said in the report.

This led to a 90% drop in reports of this kind of scam ad last year.

It implemented more than 50 enhancements to its Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling more efficient and precise enforcement. Most of the AI-powered bad ads revolved around deepfaked celebrities.

    "title": "Latest Instagram feature asks if you’re ready to reveal your innermost Reel personality to your besties",
    "article_text": "But why? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you’re anything like me, you can spend maybe too much time (though I’ll never admit it) scrolling through Reels on Instagram, and clips on TikTok. But not so surprisingly, Instagram wants to keep you within the walls of its app and has a new feature that lets you make a custom Reels feed for you and your friends. Dubbed Blend, and launching right now, you can set up this custom feed for you and a friend and be served Reels that match both of your interests. It’s an invite-only Reels feed that you can scroll within your chat window and reply to at the bottom to strike up a conversation about whatever you’d like. And if you were guessing itlives within DMs, you’d be right, as that's where Instagram invites you to keep the conversation going. Further, if you’re concerned that the Reels will live in line next to your messages, GIFs, and potentially other shared Reels … fear not. Blend will live via an icon at the top of the chat that looks like a merge of two basic emojis. You’ll tap on that to access your Blend, which is a Blended feed of Reels that hit your interests, and it’s also where you can invite someone to join your blend. Another important note – you can’t force someone to join your Blend on Instagram; whoever you invite will need to accept it. Instagram also says you can set up blends for you and one other person or for a group of people. So once you’ve set up a Blend with, say, two of your besties, you’ll open that group message within Instagram and tap the new icon next to the call buttons on the top right of the chat. Tap that, and you’ll be taken to your customized Reels feed. It should look pretty similar. You’ll see the Reel creator’s username, the audio used, a snippet of the caption, and the ability to like it, comment, and even share it. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The difference is that you’ll see a bubble that says “Suggested for [insert username here],” so Instagram will clue you in as to who it thinks will like the Reel the most. And yes, this is based on whatever Reels you’ve engaged with and what Instagram knows about you. More specifically, Instagram says “Suggested are based on each person’s activity on Instagram, including the reels they watch and interact with. They can also be based on reels sent in the chat.” As you scroll, if you feel compelled to, you can send a message back to your group about the Reel you’re watching or even drop a reaction like an emoji. For instance, if it’s a particularly epic one, you might use the fire emoji. It’s pretty neat and a new way to explore Reels with friends on your own time, while still interacting with each other. Not for nothing, you won’t need to risk SharePlaying on iOS or screensharing on Android, not knowing what might appear in your regular feed. However, since this is based on your interests, your friends might learn something – those I invite to Blend will know I like Bruce Springsteen, Disney Parks, Lego, andStar Wars. That’s the risk of the Blend: it essentially shows your Instagram Reels interests to a friend (assuming they accepted the invite). If you’re up for the fun and the challenge, you can give Instagram’s latest feature a try as it’s rolling out now. Just make sure that the Instagram app on your iOS or Android device is up to date.

    "article_text": "Marvel's First Family is up against it in the latest teaser for their MCU debut When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvelhas revealed the official trailer forThe Fantastic Four: First Steps– and, if I wasn't already super excited for its release, I certainly am now. TheMarvel Phase 6film's latest teaser is full of new footage that fans will want to *ahem* stretch their eyeballs around. Indeed, from first looks at Julia Garner's Silver Surfer and Pedro Pascal's Reed Richards using his stretchy superpowers, tonew teases of the movie's villain Galactus, it's an unmissable two-and-a-half minute feast for the eyes. The arrival of a newFantastic Fourtrailer shouldn't come as a big surprise. Indeed, a new teaser was shown exclusively to CinemaCon 2025 attendees a two weeks ago. That trailerconfirmed a big fan theory about Vanessa Kirby's Sue Storm– i.e., that she'll be pregnant for a portion of the film. With this latest round of footage doing likewise, it appears that Marvel has simply released the trailer it showed at during Disney's presentation at the trade show on April 3. A new trailer hasn't been a long time coming for the final Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie of 2025. Thefirst teaser forFirst Stepsonly achieved lift-off in early February, so it's not like we've had an excruciating wait for new clips to pore over. Still, withMarvel'sThunderbolts*movieset to be released in theaters in early May, the comic book giant will want to run a new teaser ahead of that flick to further build anticipation forFirst Steps' own launch, which will take place in late July. #TheFantasticFour: First StepsOnly in theaters July 25. pic.twitter.com/OyTgSYCl2hApril 17, 2025 Joining Pascal, Kirby, and Garner on the film's cast are Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/The Thing, Ralph Ineson as the voice of Galactus, and John Malkovich, Paul Walter Hauser, Sarah Niles, and Natasha Lyonne as TBC. Marvel fans think they know who Lyonne is playing inFirst Steps, though, and many are also convinced that Hauser and Malkovich are playing B-tier Marvel antagonists in Mole Man and Red Ghost respectively. Lastly, Mark Gatiss appears to be playing the TV host of a show that Marvel's First Family appear on in the trailer and forthcoming film.

It's official:The Sandmanseason 2will wake from its slumber this July – and it'll arrive in two parts. The acclaimed fantasy show, which is based on Neil Gaiman's graphic novel namesake, will return for its second and final chapter in mid-2025. Volume 1, which will consist of six episodes, will make its debut onNetflixonJuly 3, 2025. Season 2's five-part second volume will be released onJuly 24, 2025. The Dreaming awaits your return. The Sandman: Season 2. Volume 1 - July 3rd. Volume 2 - July 24th. pic.twitter.com/ORsNJRh89pApril 17, 2025 Netflix didn't just unveilThe Sandman's two new launch dates today (April 17), though. The Tom Sturridge-fronted TV Original also received its first teaser trailer, which shows The Endless, Sturridge's Dream included, summoned to a meeting by one of their siblings Destiny. It's unclear why Destiny has called on his fellow immortals to join him (well, unless you've read the source material) and the teaser doesn't exactly reveal what the purpose of the meeting is. Nevertheless, it suggests one of thebest Netflix shows– depending on who you ask, anyway – is aiming to go out with a fantastical bang with its final installment. This is the first official information we've received aboutThe Sandman 2since last September. During Netflix Geeked Week 2024, the streaming titanrevealed a dreamy behind-the-scenes look at season 2, which revealed a 2025 release window. Prior to that, Netflix confirmedwho would play Destiny, Delirium, and The Prodigal in season 2last May, before announcingnine new cast additions forThe Sandman's final seasonin July 2024. Netflix hasn't provided an official statement about endingThe Sandmanafter two seasons. With so much source material left to adapt, general audiences might be bemused by thebest streaming service's decision to do so. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Anyone who's kept up with the news over the last year, however, will have an idea about why the high fantasy series is prematurely ending – and it's all to do with Gaiman. In July 2024, the award-winning writer was accused of sexual assault and abuse by five women on a Tortoise Media podcast called 'Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman'. Since then, more allegations, some of which date back to 1986, have come to light about Gaiman's behavior and include his alleged involvement in human trafficking. As of February 2025, three federal lawsuits have been brought against the author, too. Gaiman has strenuously denied all of the accusations made against him. Nonetheless, live-action adaptations of his works have been impacted since he was accused of the aforementioned crimes. That includes the third season ofGood Omens, the popularPrime VideoTV show, which Gaiman is no longer involved in and has since been turned into a 90-minute movie. As I wrote earlier, it's unclear if Netflix is bringing its retelling ofThe Sandmanto an end because of what's been outlined above. One thing is certain, though:The Sandmanwon't get another outing on Netflix.

    "title": "Samsung says a next-gen TV with RGB backlight is still coming this year – but the size will rule it out for most of us",
    "article_text": "The future of TV tech means big screens – and big prices too When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsung's next TV is a big deal: it'll use anRGB backlight, which looks set to be the next key technology in high-end televisions. Unfortunately, the TV is going to be big in two other respects: it'll be a 115-inch model, too big for many homes, and it'll come with a big price tag that'll make it unaffordable for many too. We've covered Samsung's RGB LED TV plans before: the firmshowed off an 8K RGB micro-LED TV at CES 2025. That was a 98-inch model but Samsung said at the time that the actual product might be differently sized… though we weren't expecting it to belarger. The news comes via trade siteThe Elec, which says that the RGB micro-LED TV tech will be used in an \"ultra premium lineup\", with more models appearing after the 115-inch TV makes its debut this year. This isn't a traditional micro-LED TV. That tech works likeOLED, in that each pixel generates its own light. Samsung's RGB micro-LED moniker is for TVs that use a backlight and LCD panel just like its QLED TVs – but the backlight can display a wide range of colors, it won't just be one hue, enabling far better color depth and more efficient brightness levels. Samsung previously told us that by using micro-LED rather than mini-LED backlighting for these sets would deliver \"three times more LEDs\", which means better brightness and more local dimming zones for more precise control. However, it would suggest that we're not really talking about LEDs that are truly in line with micro-LED. Still, the TechRadar team has seen this type of TV in the flesh, and we're very excited about the technology: while the first TVs to use it will have huge price tags, mini-LED has plummeted in price and micro-LED is likely to do the same. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Hisense has announced that its first RGB backlit model will arrive this year, and will be 116 inches, so will probably also have a huge price tag.TCLhas also confirmed plans to release a TV with this tech in 2026. We've been told that the tech will generally not cost much more than current mini-LED backlit TVs… but not if it's stuck at over 100 inches, whereeveryTV is super-expensive. We'll have to see if sizes can come down to something more realistic next year – otherwise, current budget mini-LED tech will remain dominant for a while.

However, new testing found Saily's ad blocker feature blocks ads at the network level. Powered by NordVPN's threat protection, the ad blocker feature appliesDNS filteringto block ads and prevents websites from loading malicious ads. The test was carried independently by West Coast Labs across 22 global websites spanning gaming, shopping, travel, and entertainment - with results showing a 28.6% reduction in data usage with Saily.

WhenTech Radar Pro spoke with Saily CEO Vykintas Maknickas,he highlighted how they company building a 'network-level security for travel eSIM connectivity'. Saily's suite of security features reflects a broader industry shift towards a low-cost and safe solution for travel. As thedemand for eSIMs continues to rise, providers like Saily are setting themselves apart from other players by creating an all-around travel service.

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he is“not happy”with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and the way he is handling the conflict with Russia. At a press conference with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House on Thursday, a reporter suggested that Trump is holding Zelensky responsible for the conflict with Russia. “I don’t hold Zelensky responsible, but I’m not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,”Trump replied.“So I’m not happy with him. And I’m not happy with anybody involved.” Trump went on to say that Russia has a“bigger military force”than Ukraine.“If you’re smart, you don’t get involved in wars … I’m not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn’t say he’s done the greatest job, OK? I am not a big fan.” Trump once again claimed that the conflict would not have started under his watch and blamed his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Although Trump has criticized Russia at times, he has repeatedly argued that Zelensky failed to conclude a peace deal with Moscow.“You don’t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,”he said on Monday. During a heated exchange at the White House in February, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being ungrateful for American aid and“gambling with World War III.” The US president and his negotiators stated that they are aiming to broker a ceasefire as soon as possible and to sign a deal on extracting profits from Ukraine’s mineral wealth. Trump has declined to provide specific security guarantees to Kiev. Vance said this week that Zelensky’s claims that the Trump administration is peddling Russian narratives are“absurd.”",

The debate over burden-sharing between the allies has further complicated the Trump administration’s strained relations with Europe. At a joint press conference in Washington on Thursday, Meloni stated that“Italy is going to the next summit of NATO, announcing that it will raise [defense spending] to 2%, and that’s also progressed.” “It will go up,”Trump interjected. When asked by a reporter if the 2% target was sufficient, the US president replied,“It’s never enough.” Last year, Italy’s defense budget stood at 1.49% of GDP – one of the lowest in NATO. Meloni has been advocating for some time to reclassify expenditure on border patrols and coast guards as military spending. In January, Trump accused European countries of taking advantage of the US and argued that NATO members should spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense. Last year, 23 of the 32 members hit the 2% target set by NATO in 2014, according to the bloc’s own estimates cited by the BBC. The US spends around 3.5% of GDP on defense and is NATO’s biggest overall contributor. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told the newspaper La Stampa this week that it is“unthinkable”to assume that all European nations would slash social programs to fulfill Trump’s 5% demand.“European countries can’t touch welfare and social achievements,”he said. Last week, Trump said he would not rule out withdrawing some or all of the 84,000 US troops currently stationed in Europe.“We pay for the military in Europe. We don’t get reimbursed by much,”Trump told reporters at the White House. The New York Times reported on Monday that the US could slash“almost all funding”for international organizations, including the UN and NATO.",

    "article_text": "A shooting at Florida State University (FSU) has left two people dead and several injured, including the suspected gunman, who is now in custody, police have said. According to FSU Police Chief Jason Trumbower, the two people who died were not students at the university, but the shooter is believed to be a student, the AP reports. Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil identified the suspect as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the son of a local sheriff’s deputy.“Unfortunately, her son had access to one of her weapons,”McNeil said. According to a law enforcement source cited by CNN, three firearms were recovered: One on the suspect, a shotgun inside the Student Union building on the Tallahassee campus, and another weapon in a nearby vehicle. The incident reportedly unfolded around midday on Thursday near the Student Union building, prompting a swift lockdown and shelter-in-place orders for students and staff. More than 42,000 students are enrolled at Florida State’s main campus. Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare has said in a statement that six individuals were hospitalized following the attack. One victim remains in critical condition, while the other five are listed as serious.

    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a phone conversation on Thursday. The two top diplomats focused on the Ukraine conflict and ongoing multilateral contacts on a potential settlement, the Russian Foreign Ministry has stated. Rubio briefed Lavrov on the meetings between the American delegation and representatives of Ukraine, France, and other European nations held earlier in the day in Paris, the ministry said. “Lavrov reiterated Moscow’s readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably resolve the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis,”it added. The US State Department said Rubio conveyed to Lavrov the“same message”he delivered to the Ukrainian and European delegations: That US President Donald Trump and Washington“want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace.” “The encouraging reception in Paris to the US framework shows that peace is possible if all parties commit to reaching an agreement,”the statement added, without providing further details. The Paris meetings involved top dignitaries from all sides, with the US delegation led by Rubio and Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, a key official in the talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict. Kiev was represented by Vladimir Zelensky’s head of office, Andrey Yermak, as well as Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Zelensky launched a new personal attack on Witkoff, accusing him of spreading“Russian narratives”and effectively siding with Moscow. Speaking at a televised press conference on Thursday, the Ukrainian leader invoked Witkoff’s recent remarks that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine revolves around“five territories,”the formerly Ukrainian Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions, and Crimea. “I believe that Mr. Witkoff has adopted the Russian side’s strategy for himself... He is consciously or unconsciously spreading Russian narratives... I do not see him having a mandate to discuss Ukrainian territories,”Zelensky stated. Last week, Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg in their third round of direct talks since February. The recognition of the“five territories”is a key to any peace deal, Witkoff told Fox News in an interview earlier this week. Crimea voted to rejoin Russia in 2014, shortly after it broke away from Ukraine in the aftermath of the Maidan coup. The four other regions became part of Russia in autumn 2022 following referendums.",

    "title": "US takes state to court over transgender athletes",
    "article_text": "The US government has sued the state of Maine over its refusal to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order from February banning biological male transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The order directs federal agencies to cut funding to institutions that do not comply. The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department and announced on Wednesday by Attorney General Pam Bondi, accuses Maine of violating Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bars sex-based discrimination in educational institutions receiving federal funds. “The state of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports,”Bondi told reporters. The suit cites two cases in which biological male transgender athletes won girls’ competitions – including a pole vaulter who won the state indoor track and field state championships in February, according to the outlet. Bondi also pointed out that it is not just a sports issue but public safety issue. According to her, male athletes are allowed in women’s bathrooms and dressing rooms. She also noted that women athletes have been injured by transgender athletes in competition. “Some of these young women have endured vicious injuries too, as a result of boys playing in their sports,”she said. Asked whether it was worth using department’s resources to sue Maine over just two athletes, Bondi said,“I don’t care if it’s one. I don’t care if it’s two. I don’t care if it’s 100.”She added the department is also examining similar cases in other states, such as Minnesota and California. The legal action marks the latest escalation in a public feud between the Trump administration and Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills. In February, Trump confronted Mills during televised remarks at a gathering of governors at the White House. He asked whether she intended to comply with his order and warned she could lose all federal funding. Mills replied,“See you in court.” Responding to the lawsuit on Wednesday, Mills called it“an expected salvo in an unprecedented campaign to pressure the State of Maine.”She said the decision to cut federal school funding last week was“unlawful”and vowed to“vigorously defend”the state. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has issued numerous executive orders, including a ban on biological men participating in women’s sports, a reinstatement of the prohibition of trans individuals from military service, and a rollback of the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in federal agencies introduced by his predecessor, Joe Biden. The administration’s approach to transgender athletes has drawn criticism from civil rights groups and LGBTQ advocates. Supporters of the policy, meanwhile, argue it protects fairness in women’s sports.",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has thanked the political wing of Hamas for the release of Russian-Israeli citizen Aleksandr Trufanov, during a meeting with the freed hostage in Moscow on Wednesday. The Palestinian group freed Trufanov in February as part of a Gaza ceasefire agreement with Israel and following diplomatic efforts by Moscow. Two other hostages were also released at the time. “Here we have to offer a word of gratitude to the leadership and to the political wing of Hamas for having met us halfway and carried out this humanitarian act,”Putin said as he welcomed Trufanov and the surviving members of his family at the Kremlin. Trufanov was taken hostage on October 7, 2023 along with his grandmother Irena Tati, mother Elena, and fiancée Sapir Cohen. His father Vitaly Trufanov was killed in the attack. The women were released as part of the Hamas-Israel truce in November 2023. Aleksandr spent 498 days in captivity. “The fact that you are now free is a result of Russia’s many years of stable relations with the Palestinian people, with the representatives of different organizations,”Putin said, adding that Russia will do whatever is necessary to ensure those still in captivity are freed. A Hamas delegation visited Moscow in early February, less than two weeks before Trufanov’s release. The group, led by senior official Mousa Abu Marzouk, met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov to discuss the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza and related humanitarian issues. This visit was part of Russia’s ongoing engagement with various parties involved in the Middle East conflict. The October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel left approximately 1,200 people dead, with around 250 taken hostage. In the past 18 months, over 51,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed amid Israel’s military operation, according to the enclave’s health authorities. On Wednesday, Israel proposed a 45-day truce in Gaza to allow hostage releases and potentially begin indirect talks to end the war. Hamas has said it is studying the plan.",

    "title": "China replacing US oil with Canadian – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "China has been importing record amounts of crude oil from Canada and drastically reducing supplies from the US in light of the trade war with Washington, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. Washington and Beijing have implemented a series of reciprocal tariff hikes over the past two months in light of which the latter has slashed purchases of US oil by roughly 90%, according to the outlet. China previously indicated that it would not implement more tariff hikes against US goods but would rather employ alternative ways to retaliate. Chinese crude imports from a port near Vancouver on Canada’s Pacific coast soared to a record 7.3 million barrels in March and may exceed the figure this month, Bloomberg reported, citing data from London-based global oil and gas cargo tracking firm Vortexa Ltd. Chinese imports of US oil, meanwhile, have fallen to 3 million barrels per month from a peak of 29 million last June, it added. China’s direct imports of Canadian crude oil had historically been minimal, primarily due to infrastructure constraints. Chinese refineries have mainly sourced crude from the Middle East and Russia. Roughly 1.7% of China’s total crude imports came from the US last year, according to Chinese customs data, down from 2.5% in 2023. Nearly all of Canada’s oil is shipped to the US to be processed there or re-exported to Asia. However, the completion last May of the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline, which takes crude to Canada’s Pacific coast, provided the country with an alternative route to export more volumes directly, primarily to Asia, thus reducing its reliance on the US. “Given the trade war, it’s unlikely for China to import more US oil,”Bloomberg quoted Wenran Jiang, president of the Canada-China Energy & Environment Forum, as saying.“They are not going to bank on Russian alone or Middle Eastern alone. Anything from Canada will be welcome news.” China accounted for roughly 5% of US crude oil exports last year, according to ship-tracking data from Kpler. Russia remains China’s largest supplier of crude oil. Russian shipments to China reached the highest level on record in 2024. The increase in recent years is largely attributable to the discounts being offered on Russian crude. China’s imports of oil from Saudi Arabia, its second-largest supplier, declined by 9% year-on-year in 2024.",

    "title": "Russia lifts ban on Taliban",
    "article_text": "Russia’s Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the Taliban’s designation as a“terrorist organization,”effectively legalizing the group’s activities in the country. The Islamist movement, which took power in Afghanistan four years ago, had been listed as a terrorist entity since 2003, making any contact with its members a criminal offense under Russian law. The decision follows calls from Russian officials to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan. The group returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US and NATO forces after their two-decade presence in the Central Asian country. Since that time, Moscow has resumed diplomatic contacts with Taliban officials. Last year, President Vladimir Putin said it was“necessary to build relations with the current government somehow,”as they are now in control of Afghanistan. In May 2024, the Russian Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Justice formally proposed lifting the ban. Earlier this month, the Prosecutor General’s Office submitted the motion to the Supreme Court, leading to Thursday’s ruling. Previously, Russian law had no mechanism for removing organizations from the terrorist list. However, amendments passed in 2023 to the federal law on countering terrorism now allow the courts to suspend the designation if the group in question has ceased activities involving propaganda, justification, or support of terrorism, and no longer violates the Criminal Code. Although the Taliban government is not officially recognized by the international community, several Central Asian countries have recently renewed ties with Kabul. Kazakhstan removed the group from its terrorist list in June 2024, followed by Kyrgyzstan in September. Turkmenistan has resumed cooperation through the TAPI gas pipeline project, and Uzbekistan signed several joint agreements with Kabul in August 2024. Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban’s envoy to Qatar and its de facto international spokesman, told RT earlier this month that Kabul welcomed Russia’s move, saying the ban had stood“in the way of cooperation”between the two countries. Experts say Thursday’s ruling does not constitute formal recognition of the Taliban government, but will facilitate diplomatic engagement.",

    "title": "Stop demonizing Putin – Bosnian Serb leader to EU",
    "article_text": "The EU should stop vilifying Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, the president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, has said. The Serb leader of the autonomous region within Bosnia and Herzegovina also dismissed claims that Moscow harbors aggressive plans against EU countries. In an interview with Switzerland’s Die Weltwoche magazine on Wednesday, Dodik said the“Russian point of view is that the war in Ukraine had been imposed[on]Russia by the Western, global elite.”He went on to cite Boris Johnson’s alleged role in the derailment of peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev in Istanbul, Türkiye in 2022. Russian officials have since claimed that the then-UK prime minister persuaded Ukraine not to sign a deal and“just continue fighting.” In November 2023, David Arakhamia, an MP allied with Zelensky who led the Ukrainian delegation, confirmed that this was the case. Johnson has denied the allegation. According to Dodik,“the Russians have learned that they cannot trust the West because the West lies all the time.”He referenced the admissions by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Francois Hollande that the 2014-15 Minsk agreements had been a mere ploy to help Kiev build up its military capabilities. Commenting on concerns among some EU member states that Russia may be planning an attack on the bloc’s eastern members, Dodik said,“I think that this is not a rational explanation or expectation, and that Putin has no aspirations whatsoever toward thosestates.” Asked for his recommendations to Brussels on dealing with Russia, he argued that“they should, first of all, stop demonizing Putin and demonizing Russia, and trying to invent a narrative that would back that up.” According to Dodik, the Russian president appears to want to engage with US President Donald Trump, while having no wish to“talk with Europe.” He suggested that in his talks with Moscow, Trump“should take into consideration and respect the Russian requirements, the Russian requests,”and aim for a“comprehensive agreement,”as opposed to one narrowly focusing only on Ukraine. Speaking to Serbian media this week, Dodik defied top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas’ warning to EU candidate nations, demanding that they not“take part in the May 9[WWII Victory Day]events in Moscow.” “I want to be there and I will go,”the Bosnian Serb leader said, adding that he does not fear any potential repercussions from Brussels.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a significant reduction of American troops in Syria, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing officials familiar with military planning. American forces have been illegally stationed in Syria since 2014. Washington insisted they were deployed to counter ISIS, though they have remained in the years since Syria’s war ended. A US official focused on the region told the WaPo there’s an expectation that troop numbers would be cut“to a bare minimum,”adding“I think we’re going to go down to one very small place in the northeast.” A defense official confirmed ongoing plans to“reduce”and“consolidate”Washington’s troop presence but insisted a full withdrawal is not currently under discussion. “Stuff is already moving, although they likely won’t announce anything before the Iran talks,”referring to US-Iran nuclear negotiations that began last week, with a second round set for this weekend in Rome. Any withdrawal plans could be derailed by Islamic State’s increased attacks in eastern Syria, according to the WaPo. In December 2024, shortly after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted, the Pentagon acknowledged having 2,000 troops in Syria – more than double the previously reported 900. Later that month, several media outlets reported that US military convoys carrying weapons and equipment had crossed into Syria from Iraq. Both the former Assad government and Russia have repeatedly condemned the US presence as an illegal occupation, arguing that Washington was never granted permission to station troops in Syria. Damascus has also accused Washington of stealing Syrian natural resources, given that the US bases are located in the country’s oil-rich northeastern regions. During his first term, Trump had ordered a partial withdrawal from Syria, though it was never completed. Since returning to office, he has largely avoided the topic, stating only that Syria is a“mess”and doesn’t need American involvement. Last month, Washington handed Damascus a list of conditions for partial relief from Assad-era sanctions. The list, a copy of which was seen by the WaPo, included demands to allow US counter-terror operations on Syrian soil and a formal declaration of support for Operation Inherent Resolve – a US-led campaign against terrorism in Syria and Iraq.",

    "title": "US could block DeepSeek – NYT",
    "article_text": "US officials are taking steps to crack down on China’s DeepSeek AI and its support from chip-making giant Nvidia, the New York Times has reported, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. DeepSeek’s January release shook the foundations of the artificial intelligence industry and rattled the US stock market, heating up the AI race between China and the US. Unlike its main rival – OpenAI’s ChatGPT – DeepSeek’s open-source deep reasoning model was made freely available, quickly making it the most downloaded app on Apple’s and Google’s stores. The model’s development also reportedly cost a fraction of what US companies have been spending on such technologies. On Wednesday, the NYT reported that US President Donald Trump and his administration have been weighing penalties that would block DeepSeek from buying American technologies and are debating banning US users from accessing the Chinese AI. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced that the US government had blocked the sale of some of its AI chips to China without a license and would demand such licenses for future sales. US congressional leaders have been looking to further crack down on Nvidia’s chip deliveries to China and on Wednesday opened an investigation into the company’s sale of chips across Asia. The main focus of the probe is said to be to determine if Nvidia knowingly provided DeepSeek with critical technology to develop AI, which would be a violation of American rules established under former US President Joe Biden. A spokesman for Nvidia, John Rizzo, has since stated that the company has followed the US government’s directions on what products it can sell and where it can sell them“to the letter,”and that it is committed to protecting and enhancing US national security. Following DeepSeek’s launch, several countries, including the US, South Korea, Italy, and Australia, have imposed bans and restrictions on the chatbot, citing national security and data privacy concerns. In February, US lawmakers proposed legislation that would ban the app from being installed on any government-owned devices after cybersecurity experts claimed that the program contained hidden code capable of transmitting sensitive user data to China. Washington has previously accused Beijing of using its apps to attempt to access sensitive data in other countries. China has dismissed the accusation as politically motivated“ideological discrimination,”asserting that the government does not require enterprises or individuals to collect or store data illegally.",

    "title": "German anti-Russia propaganda is reaching Nazi-era levels",
    "article_text": "Like people almost everywhere in NATO-EU Europe, Germans are currently being subjected to a relentless barrage of shameless, often astonishingly crude propaganda. That’s because their political elites and mainstream media are desperately trying to prepare them for war against Russia. And this time, not by proxy, that is, by way of a devastated Ukraine and dead Ukrainians, but directly. As a former,very evil but in his prime all-too-popular German master of mass manipulation– who also happened to love war with Russia more than was good for him (or Germany) – explained a century ago, effective propaganda keeps the world very, very simple. Or, to add a little detail, propaganda’s sometimes literally stunning success is built on two primitive yet powerful – and very old – tricks: the broken-record principle and the litany effect. Their meaning, too, is elementary: In essence, if your image of reality is delusional, you don’t have sound arguments, and your case is absurd, do not despair. Instead, ceaselessly drum in a few very basic and bogus ideas until the audience is dizzy with repetition (the broken-record principle), while also eliciting frequent consent from it (the litany effect). In short: Keep shouting the same nonsense at them and make them bleat back“yes”regularly. You know, like a ritual, really. In the case of the manufacturing of the current iteration of traditional German the-Russians-are-coming hysteria as well, it is easy to identify its handful of specious, daft, and childishly simplistic key motifs: Russia and Russia alone is to blame for the war in Ukraine; Russia intends to attack Europe (if not the world) – and soon; and Russia is incredibly devious and scheming, so you cannot find a reasonable compromise with it. Yet what about the nuts and bolts of this propaganda campaign? Even a simple story needs detail, and, if told and retold almost without letup, that detail at least needs to vary: Same old story but different flavor. That’s where things get tricky. For one thing, if you pick the wrong flavor, your propaganda may start looking as silly as it actually is. A current example in Germany – as well as the EU parliament – would be the recent hysteria over the global hitSigma Boyfrom Russia. Its brilliantly catchy tune is a piece of art, like it or not. But its lyrics are about as profound as a margarine commercial. Yet that won’t stop Germany’s radical-Centrist elite from exploring the song’s ominous depths as a weapon of nefarious Russian cultural warfare. Because Sigma Boy, one EU parliamentarian from Hamburg has noticed – with a little help fromUkraine– isreally“a viral Russian trope used on social media that communicates patriarchal and pro-Russian worldviews”as well as“only one example of Russian infiltration of popular discourse through social media.”Also, you see,Sigma Boy isreallyjust code for – scary sound effect–PUTIN! Silly? So ridiculous it gives you that cringey feeling you get when someone else is making a total fool of themselves and all you want to do is tell them to shut up already and save whatever maybe left of their credibility? Yes, obviously. Indeed, in the case of the Great Sigma Boy Panic Attack, even Spiegel – a usually reliably Russophobic and NATO-militarist publication now – has mildly demurred. Dedicatinga whole podcast to the phenomenon, it had an editor and journalist deliberate on the Sigma Boy case in all earnestness and with proverbial German thoroughness and faces serious enough for Kant and Hegel hashing out the nature of TikTok. The result: Maybe, just maybe, it’s really simply a pop song. Now you could say“Great. At least someone is not completely falling for the mass hysteria.”But that would be too optimistic. In reality, the real question is how could things get so absurd in the first place? What is theZeitgeistenvironment in which an EU parliamentarian is not ashamed to display so much provincial paranoia and Germany’s major news magazine needs intensive research and a long discussion to find out that, perhaps, she doesnothave a point? In that regard, another recent propaganda fiasco is instructive. Its essence is simple: Some may know the ZDF, one of Germany’s most popular and influential public – that is, de facto state – TV channels most of all as a rock-solid mouthpiece of Israeli propaganda, especially during the ongoing Gaza genocide. But the ZDF also has a substantial line in Russophobia. And for once, it went a little too far in its never-slackening eagerness to stick it to the big bad Russians: In its main news show and a long, sensationalist pseudo-documentary in its Terra X History program – under the title“Spying, Sabotage, Fake News. Putin’s war against us”– the broadcaster claimed, in effect if with some cheap pro forma hedging, that Russia was behind, among other nefarious schemes, anIslamist terror attack in the city of Mannheim in May 2024. This was, obviously, an extremely serious allegation, in principle as well as in detail: the attack, carried out by a man from Afghanistan who had lived in Germany for ten years, left five victims injured and one, a policeman, dead. Moreover, in the consciousness of the German public, this particular terror attack is only part of a whole series of unrelated yet similar violent assaults that have taken place over the last year, including another one in Magdeburg as well as in the cities of Solingen and Aschaffenburg. Hence, pointing a finger at Russia over one of these traumatizing onslaughts inevitably implied that Moscow may have had a hand in the others as well. Et voila! A new and particularly horrifying accusation against Russia had been manufactured: Moscow, so the essence of this wildest of many wild tales, was using migrants to instigate bloody Islamist terror in Germany. And this big fat lie started working quickly: Various major mainstream media in Germany and abroad began to uncritically repeat the story, such as Britain’sTelegraphandThe Sun, the GermanMerkur, and the FrenchSud-Ouest. Yet the“research”on which ZDF had based this specific propaganda strike against Moscow was so breathtakingly sloppy that, this time, even Germany’s BND foreign intelligence service had to object. Shortly after the ZDF had made its splash,the BND publicly contradicted it, pointing out that the method – basically a childish misreading of Google Trend data – used to produce these allegations against Russia is, in essence, ridiculously unreliable. Indeed, it turned out that several German intelligence agencies had warned the ZDF already before the Terra X pseudo-documentary was broadcast. Even Germany’s highly conservativeWeltnewspaper called the ZDF’s handiwork – with massive understatement –“negligent.” So far, so bad. Just another case of propaganda becoming self-defeating by going too far. Let’s move on. And that is, of course, what is happening now. While the very worst lie about Russia has been discredited, there are virtually no consequences. Yet, in reality, this is where the whole daft affair is only beginning to get interesting. For one thing, the Terra X feature, almost 45 minutes long, was packed with other, equally unfounded accusations against Russia. Indeed, it consisted of a long sequence of one hearsay after another speculation, all based on profound evidence of the“Western-intelligence-services-believe”type. At Terra X, have they ever heard of those Iraqi weapons of mass destruction? The babies torn from incubators in Kuwait? Or Gaddafi handing out Viagra to his troops to promote rape? All of them, of course, lies; all, in their time, spread by those famously reliable Western intelligence agencies and mass media functioning as their servile propaganda arms. And all of these lies, these actual cases of“hybrid warfare”– by Western elites on their own populations – have always had the same purpose: prepare and justify Western military aggression. Yet, in the Terra X case as well, the fact that the single most egregious anti-Russian allegation of many has been, for once, exposed quickly as at best reckless nonsense if not a deliberate lie, makes no dent in the story as a whole. On the contrary, all that happens is that one scapegoat is singled out and sacrificed: Steven Broschart, the discredited“data profiler”and self-appointed“digital behavioral analytic.”It was all him, is the message now. But that is clearly untrue. Long stretches of the Terra X tale consisted of various, often much more prominent talking-heads lending their authority to a long list of equally unsubstantiated allegations of Russian crimes and, in general, helping beat the war drums against Moscow. There was, for instance, an official of Germany’s domestic intelligence service – the Verfassungsschutz – who first conveniently confirmed that the internet is a“treasure chest”of information revealing sabotage and attack plans and then informed viewers that they are already at war with Russia, even if they haven’t noticed yet. No biggie in Germany now: at war, not yet at war with Russia… Who cares once we all know where we are supposed to be going anyhow, and so soon, too. To be fair, the man from the Verfassungsschutz had his entertaining side: You don’t need tanks to bring down a country, he enlightened us, because you can also strike at its vital infrastructure. Really? You don’t say! You mean the way that Germany’s“allies”in Washington and its spongers in Kiev struck at the Nord Stream pipelines? No, just kidding. Of course, he didnotmean that. Because that would be reality, and his job clearly is the opposite, propaganda. Quintessential German professor Martin Schulze Wessel added platitudes about Putin, who, we learn, thinks in categories of East and West and antagonism. Wow! Aren’t we lucky that no one does so in Garden Value Europe and a Germany that has decided to quite literally define itself, again, via antagonism toward Russia. In addition, the professor confirmed that Russia is a“direct”threat to Germany – clearly unlike, again, Ukraine and the US, obviously, even if they have actually committed the largest act of infrastructure sabotage in German peacetime history. And the German public must be made aware of that non-fact, the professor lectured. Thank you for summarizing the essence of propaganda so selflessly: making the people aware of what isn’t there. And, if we may add, the opposite is also important: that that same public is made unaware of what does, actually, exist, for instance that Nord Stream attack that must go forever unmentioned. My only caveat regarding Schulze Wessel’s amusing contribution is that, as a matter of transparency, he could have let viewers know that he is heavily networked with Ukraine and in particular the rather nationalist city of Lviv. Again, no biggie: On the big crusade against bad Russia, minor sins are forgivable. The cast of Terra X was rich and not everyone can be mentioned here. But we would be amiss to omit Anton Shekhovtsov. Ironically now based at some“Center for Democratic Integrity,”he is the commentator who publicly celebratedthe Odessa Trade Union House fire, while comparing its victims to vermin, literally. Dehumanizing? A little on the fascist side psychologically, perhaps? Oh, come on! Once again, on the grand campaign against Moscow, a little excess of eagerness is more than welcome. On Terra X his function was unspoken yet clumsily clear: He served as the“expert”explaining that everything alleged in the show is“hard to prove.”But, of course, not as in not likely to be true, but as in: absolutely true even without any evidence. Thank you, too, Anton, for demonstrating a basic yet always popular trick of gutter propaganda:“You can’t see them,”as it were,“but that’s only because they are so well hidden. Which proves again how dangerous they are.” The single worst irony about this piece of weaponized“journalism”from one of Germany’s biggest broadcasters is its flatfooted hypocrisy. For, in the context of the Ukraine War, provoked and fought via proxy by the West, therearereal sabotage and terrorism, namely by Ukraine and the West: The attack on theCrocus City venuein Moscow, theassassination of General Igor Kirillov, the heinous murder ofDarya Dugina, the Ukrainian attacks on the Kerch Bridge and on Nord Stream, of course – and this list could be prolonged – are all clear examples of Ukraine using terrorism. And we have known for years now, from Western mainstream media, that behind these activities,there has been hands-on and proud support from Western intelligence services. Is it possible that, in a conflict where the West and Ukraine have liberally deployed“hybrid war”tactics, Russia is sometimes paying them back in the same coin? Yes, in principle. You could even make a plausible argument that it has to do so to remain credible. Accusations of promoting Islamist terrorism, from which Russia has suffered greatly, in any case, should be off-limits to anyone with half a brain and some elementary decency. And the West would do very well to mind the beam in its own eye. For Western media that would mean that, even apart from the straightforward lying, against this background, it is not just dishonest but ridiculous to produce“journalism”that focuses on Russia alone. Thevery leasta serious investigation would have to do is look at all sides and treat information from all sides critically. But then, that would be a piece of practical enlightenment, intellectually and politically empowering viewers and citizens, and it would not be effective war-in-sight propaganda anymore. It might even end up – oh horror! – promoting compromise and peace. As it is now, in Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe, journalists, security service officers, experts, and academics – all are perfectly fine with lending their name to propaganda of the basest form. What a shame.",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Moscow on Thursday to discuss regional security issues in the Middle East, focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the situation in Syria. The visit marked Al Thani’s first official trip to Russia since 2018. Both leaders expressed concern over the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza. Al Thani said Israel had failed to uphold the internationally brokered ceasefire deal agreed with Palestinian authorities in January, in which Qatar played a key mediating role. “As you know, we reached an agreement months ago, but unfortunately, Israel did not abide by this agreement,”Al Thani stated, adding that Doha continues its efforts to broker a lasting ceasefire in the region. Putin and Al Thani both reiterated their support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “Civilians continue to die in Palestine, which is an absolute tragedy,”Putin said.“We believe – and our positions here are the same – that a long-term settlement can be achieved only and exclusively on the basis of the United Nations decision on the creation of the Palestinian state.” The leaders also discussed the situation in Syria following the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad by a broad coalition of armed groups led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) late last year. Assad, a close ally to Moscow, was replaced by HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. “We would like to do everything to ensure that Syria remains a sovereign, independent and geographically integrated state,”Putin said. He added that Moscow was ready to work with Doha to address the humanitarian crisis and stabilize Syria, citing ongoing challenges in politics, security and the economy. Al Thani said he recently met with Syria’s new leader, who conveyed an interest in maintaining strong relations with Russia. “We discussed with [al-Sharaa] the historical ties between Syria and Russia, which were and are of a strategic nature. He is determined to continue cooperation [with Russia], to secure ties based on mutual respect and the interests of the two peoples,”Al Thani said. Syria is“going through a very difficult period”and needs international support to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty, he added. Both leaders also praised the state of Russia-Qatar relations and reaffirmed their commitment to expanding cooperation in trade, investment, and regional diplomacy.",

    "title": "UK researchers announce signs of extraterrestrial life",
    "article_text": "UK researchers have claimed to have found a possible sign of life on a faraway planet. Scientists from the University of Cambridge have announced the detection of a gas that on Earth is only made by living organisms. The discovery, which was made using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, could be the strongest hint yet of life beyond Earth. The team studied K2-18 b, a planet about 124 light-years away in the Leo constellation. It is known as a“hycean”planet, meaning it may have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and liquid water oceans. Such conditions make it a promising candidate for life. The telescope detected dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the planet’s air. On Earth, both gases are made only by living organisms, mainly marine microbes such as phytoplankton. Levels of these compounds on the planet K2-18 b were found to be thousands of times higher than those on Earth. Dr. Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Thursday, said the implications could be profound. The findings“provide new independent evidence for the possibility of a biosphere on K2-18 b,”the study claimed.“What we are finding at this point are hints of possible biological activity outside the solar system,”he told a press conference.“Frankly, I think this is the closest we have come to seeing a feature that we can attribute to life,”he added. Madhusudhan explained that detecting chemical fingerprints of gases that on Earth are created only through biological processes could point to a potentially inhabited alien world.“This is a revolutionary moment,”he added. However, the team warned that the detected gases could also be the result of unknown natural processes. Additional telescope observations are needed to determine if living organisms truly are the source.",

    "title": "A chihuahua that thinks it’s a lion: The decline of Britain",
    "article_text": "There are only two countries in the world that have exercised full autonomy over major political decisions for more than 500 years: Russia and Britain. No others come close. That alone makes Moscow and London natural rivals. But now, we can say with confidence that our historical adversary is no longer what it once was. Britain is losing its foreign policy clout and has been reduced to what we might call“Singapore on the Atlantic”: an island trading power, out of sync with the broader trajectory of world affairs. The fall from global relevance is not without irony. For centuries, Britain caused nothing but harm to the international system. It played France and Germany off one another, betrayed its own allies in Eastern Europe, and exploited its colonies to exhaustion. Even within the European Union, from 1972 until Brexit in 2020, the UK worked tirelessly to undermine the project of integration – first from within, and now from without, with backing from Washington. Today, the British foreign policy establishment still attempts to sabotage European cohesion, acting as an American proxy. The late historian Edward Carr once mocked the British worldview with a fictional headline:“Fog in Channel – Continent Cut Off.”This egoism, common to island nations, is especially pronounced in Britain, which has always existed beside continental civilization. It borrowed freely from Europe’s culture and political ideas, yet always feared them. That fear was not unfounded. Britain has long understood that true unification of Europe – especially involving Germany and Russia – would leave it sidelined. Thus, the primary goal of British policy has always been to prevent cooperation between the major continental powers. Even now, no country is more eager than Britain to see the militarization of Germany. The idea of a stable Russia-Germany alliance has always been a nightmare scenario for London. Whenever peace between Moscow and Berlin looked possible, Britain would intervene to sabotage it. The British approach to international relations mirrors its domestic political thought: atomized, competitive, distrustful of solidarity. While continental Europe produced theories of political community and mutual obligation, Britain gave the world Thomas Hobbes and his“Leviathan,”a grim vision of life without justice between the state and its citizens. That same combative logic extends to foreign policy. Britain doesn’t cooperate; it divides. It has always preferred enmity among others over engagement with them. But the tools of that strategy are disappearing. Britain today is a power in steep decline, reduced to shouting from the sidelines. Its internal political life is a carousel of increasingly unqualified prime ministers. This is not simply a result of difficult times. It reflects a deeper problem: the absence of serious political leadership in London. Even the United States, Britain’s closest ally, is now a threat to its autonomy. The Anglosphere no longer needs two powers that speak English and operate under the same oligarchic political order. For a time, Britain found comfort in the Biden administration, which tolerated its role as transatlantic intermediary. London leveraged its anti-Russian stance to stay relevant and inserted itself into US-EU relations. But that space is narrowing. Today’s American leaders are uninterested in mediators. During a recent trip to Washington, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer could barely answer direct questions on foreign policy. His deference reflected a new reality: even the illusion of independence is fading. Meanwhile, France’s Emmanuel Macron, for all his posturing, at least leads a country that actually controls its nuclear arsenal. Britain claims to have authority over its nuclear submarines, but many doubt it. In ten years, experts believe it may lose even the technical capacity to manage its nuclear weapons without US support. At that point, London will face a choice: full subservience to Washington or exposure to EU pressures, especially from France. Recent talk in London of sending“European peacekeepers”to Ukraine is a case in point. Despite the unrealistic nature of such proposals, British and French officials spent weeks debating operational details. Some reports suggest the plan stalled due to lack of funds. The real motive was likely to project relevance and show the world that Britain still has a role to play. But neither the media spin nor the political theater can change the facts. Britain’s global standing has diminished. It is no longer capable of independent action and has little influence even as a junior partner. Its leaders are consumed by domestic dysfunction and foreign policy fantasy. In practical terms, Britain remains dangerous to Russia in two ways. First, by supplying weapons and mercenaries to Ukraine, it increases our costs and casualties. Second, in a moment of desperation, it might try to manufacture a small nuclear crisis. If that happens, one hopes the Americans would take the necessary steps to neutralize the threat – even if that means sinking a British submarine. There is nothing positive for Russia, or the world, in the continued existence of Britain as a foreign policy actor. Its legacy is one of division, sabotage, and imperial plunder. Now, it lives off the crumbs of a bygone empire, barking from the Atlantic like a chihuahua with memories of being a lion. The world moves on. Britain does not. This article was first published by‘Vzglyad’newspaper and was translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "Europe seeking ‘direct line’ with Trump – NYT",
    "article_text": "European officials are seeking to establish a“direct line”of communication with US President Donald Trump, unsure whether his team can make any real decisions or is willing to cooperate at all, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing sources. The report, based on interviews with numerous unnamed European officials, describes the US president as“the ultimate decision maker”who is often difficult to predict, making the goal of getting Trump’s ear a priority for the Europeans. Many top-level negotiators in European NATO countries have found traditional diplomatic channels – such as the State Department and embassies – ineffective, the report said. The confusion is compounded by the fact that the most effective interlocutors on the US side are not career diplomats but rather trusted special envoys and advisers, such as Elon Musk and Steve Witkoff, the article said. The officials also told the NYT that their US counterparts are primarily focused on fulfilling the president’s wishes, showing limited interest in the perspectives of America’s allies. The Trump administration is“not terribly interested in what the Europeans have to say,”a NYT source said.“It’s all about unilateralism and they don’t consult much. After all, if they don’t consider us allies to that extent, why would they?” While senior Trump officials have held“cordial”talks with their European counterparts on a number of issues,“it is never clear to allies”whether they have“real power over foreign policy or trade,”the article said. ”Everyone in D.C. says you have to talk to Trump directly,”a senior European official told the NYT. However, this has proved difficult even for the highest-ranking EU officials, as Trump“despises the collective power of the European Union and sees many NATO allies as freeloaders,”the paper said, adding that leaders such as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are struggling to get on Trump’s calendar. The communication breakdown comes at a time of tenuous US-EU relations, marred by Washington’s decision to slap the bloc with tariffs and its push to make European NATO members pay more for their defense. Differences over the Ukraine conflict have also come into play, with Trump pursuing active diplomacy with Russia to end the conflict while the EU insists on supporting Kiev for“as long as it takes.”",

    "article_text": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has confirmed he will travel to Russia for the Victory Day celebrations next month, despite warnings from the European Union that the move could jeopardize Belgrade’s accession hopes. Moscow will host its annual military parade on Red Square on May 9 to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Vucic attended the event in 2020, prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. EU foreignpolicy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the bloc does“not want any candidate country to take part in the May 9 events in Moscow.”EU officials have even reportedly threatened to derail Serbia’s bid to join the bloc if Vucic attends the celebrations. “I have not changed my decision... I am ready for the whole sky to fall on my head from the pressure to go to Moscow. Eight months ago, I announced my visit to Moscow, publicly,”Vucic said on Wednesday, as cited by Serbian media. According to the president, a unit of the Serbian Army will take part in the parade. During World War II, Serbia, which was then part of Yugoslavia, fell under Nazi occupation and was liberated by Soviet forces in 1944. Vucic also said that“a period of enormous diplomatic activity is coming,”citing several upcoming meetings with EU officials and a possible visit to the US. The Russian government extended multiple invitations to the May 9 events, including to the leaders of China, India and Brazil, as well as to EU member Slovakia and to Serbia, which was granted EU candidate status in 2012. Belgrade has declined to provide arms to Ukraine and has voiced opposition to the EU’s sanctions against Moscow. Vucic has emphasized the value of maintaining good relations with Russia and has called for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict.",

    "title": "Israeli Army to remain indefinitely in Gaza – defense minister",
    "article_text": "Israeli troops will remain indefinitely in the so-called security zones it has established within Gaza, the defense minister said on Wednesday. He added that their forces will also stay in similar zones in Lebanon and Syria. West Jerusalem has said the buffer zones are necessary to protect its communities and prevent future attacks by military groups. In Gaza, the military has established corridors to separate areas under Hamas control. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a truce with Hezbollah last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria, following the ousting of former President Bashar Assad. “Unlike in the past,”the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)“is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,”Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. The IDF“will remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza – as in Lebanon and Syria.” Israeli forces have taken control of more than half of Gaza in a renewed offensive following the collapse of a ceasefire and the stalling of hostage negotiations last month. The IDF has resumed airstrikes in Gaza to increase pressure on Hamas to release the remaining captives who were taken during the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel. Katz also stated that Israel will block any humanitarian aid from entering Gaza.”No humanitarian aid will be allowed into Gaza,” he said on X on Wednesday. Preventing humanitarian aid from entering the enclave“is one of the main pressure tools that stops Hamas from using this means against the population,”he added. Israel’s stance could further complicate negotiations with Hamas over a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave and the release of the remaining hostages. Palestinians, as well as Lebanon and Syria, regard the presence of Israeli troops as a military occupation that violates international law. On Wednesday, Palestinian health officials reported that Israeli strikes in Gaza killed 22 people, including a girl under the age of one. More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian authorities, since Israel launched its military operation in response to the Hamas attack. Hamas has stated that it will not release the remaining hostages without a permanent ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The Israeli authorities have reported that 59 hostages remain in the enclave, with 24 believed to be alive. Dozens of others were previously released through ceasefire agreements or separate deals. The Palestinian organization representing the families of the hostages accused the Israeli government of prioritizing territorial control over the lives of the captives, despite earlier promises to put the hostages first, according to AP.",

    "article_text": "Qatar advocates for peaceful solutions to global conflicts, including the Ukraine crisis, Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Mohammed Al-Ansari has told RT. According to the diplomat, Doha backs efforts to end the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and is ready to contribute further. Al-Ansari spoke to RT ahead of a visit to Russia by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday. “Qatar has always advocated for peaceful resolutions to all conflicts. This stance… reflects Qatar’s belief that all crises should be resolved at the negotiation table, not on the battlefield,”Al-Ansari said in an interview aired on Wednesday. He praised Gulf states’ diplomaticinitiatives, including recent Ukraine-related talks hosted by Saudi Arabia. “These efforts undertaken by the Gulf states… demonstrate that our region strives to become a center for peaceful resolution rather than a battleground for wars and conflicts,”he said.“We hope to see positive outcomes from these efforts for both our region and the entire world.” Al-Ansari said Qatar is“ready to act as a mediator”and help facilitate dialogue between all sides of the Ukraine conflict. He noted Doha’s past role in reuniting children evacuated from the combat zone with their families and contributing to the now-defunct Black Sea grain deal, which enabled food exports via the freight route early in the conflict. Qatar, he added, wants to play an even“more active role”in resolving the crisis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the Ukraine conflict and related peace efforts are on the agenda for the meeting between Al Thani and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as bilateral ties and Middle East affairs. “Qatar plays an important role in attempts to resolve many crises,”Peskov said, adding that Moscow“highly appreciates a trusting dialogue”with Doha on international issues. He said Putin and Al Thani are also expected to discuss expanding cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture, and industry. “We have good prospects for expanding mutually beneficial trade cooperation,”Peskov stated.“We hope to launch major joint logistics projects soon and broaden cooperation in the transport sector overall.”",

    "title": "Musk wants to seed Earth with ‘legion’ of high-IQ babies – WSJ",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk wants to populate the Earth with a“legion”of high-intelligence children to prevent the collapse of human civilization due to a global decline in birth rates, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing sources. An investigation by the paper focused on what it described as a“harem drama”surrounding Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency and a close ally of US President Donald Trump. According to the report, the billionaire has had at least 14 known children with four women – although the actual number could be much higher. However, his relationships with the mothers reportedly often involve hush-money payments and heated parental disputes. At the heart of Musk’s reproductive drive lies his“dark view”of the future in which humanity could perish as a species due to poor demographics, the WSJ claims.“He is driven to correct the historic moment by helping seed the earth with more human beings of high intelligence,”the report says, citing people familiar with the matter. Ashley St. Clair – one of the women Musk allegedly had an affair with and who claims to be the mother of one of his children – showed the WSJ a message purportedly sent by the billionaire. In it, Musk allegedly referred to his offspring as a“legion”– invoking the ancient Roman military units known for expanding imperial reach – and insisted on making even more babies with other women.“To reach legion-level before the apocalypse,”he reportedly said.“We will need to use surrogates.” The WSJ claims that Musk has used his platform X to recruit potential mothers, often one whom he has never met in person, but who enjoy a high-profile social status. In 2021, Musk said that low birth rates were“one of the biggest risks to civilization.”“If people don’t have more children, civilization is going to crumble,”he said at the time. However, Musk’s private life has drawn criticism. His daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, who cut ties with him and has come out as transgender – a move Musk has criticized – has called the billionaire a“serial adulterer.”He is also involved in a custody dispute with Canadian pop star Grimes, who has alleged that he withheld one of their children from visiting family for several months.",

    "article_text": "The UK would support Germany if it decides to give long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine, The Telegraph reported on Wednesday, citing British government sources. London has long backed arming Kiev with the German-made weapons, which have a 500km range and are capable of striking targets deep into Russian territory, the report stated. Moscow has warned that supplying long-range missiles to Kiev and allowing it to strike Russian territory will be considered an escalation of hostilities. “We continue to work with our partners, including Germany, to equip Ukraine as best we can to defend its sovereign territory,”a British foreign policy official told the outlet, commenting on the potential Taurus deliveries. The report follows recent remarks by incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who signaled he was willing to supply Taurus missiles to Kiev. “I have always said that I would do it,”Merz told German state broadcaster ARD on Sunday. “Our European partners are already supplying cruise missiles… The British are doing it, the French are doing it, and the Americans are doing it,”he added, referencing the UK’s Storm Shadow and France’s Scalp missiles respectively. The move must be agreed upon with Berlin’s European partners, Merz said. His CDU party has said the missiles could be used to strike Russian command centers and supply routes, including the Kerch Bridge to Crimea. Merz’s stance contrasts sharply with that of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has repeatedly refused to give Kiev Taurus missiles and warned that the move could escalate the conflict and draw Germany directly into war with Moscow. Merz is expected to take office in May, once his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) finalize a coalition agreement. CDU defense spokesman Roderich Kiesewetter told The Telegraph that the missile delivery issue“remains a point of contention”in coalition talks. SPD members have expressed concern over the Taurus’ range and power, arguing it poses a greater escalation risk than British or French systems. Party leader Matthias Miersch this week suggested Merz might change course once he receives classified intelligence on the missiles.German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, an SPD member, has previously stated there are“many good arguments”against the delivery, citing confidential national security concerns. Moscow has repeatedly warned that Western arms supplies won’t stop it from achieving its goals in the Ukraine conflict and that such deliveries only drag out the conflict and hinder peace efforts.",

    "title": "EU abandons plans to ban Russian LNG – Reuters",
    "article_text": "EU officials have stepped back from plans to include a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in an upcoming sanctions package against Moscow, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The decision, one official told the agency, was driven by internal opposition, uncertainty over replacing the supply, but also concerns that a ban could weaken the EU’s negotiating power with the US. The 17th package is part of broader efforts by the EU to pressure Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Sanctioning Russian LNG now could strip the bloc of a key bargaining chip in ongoing trade talks with Washington, an unnamed EU official told Reuters. The European Commission is reportedly seeking to use energy imports, including LNG, as leverage to persuade the US to lift tariffs on EU goods. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the EU to increase purchases of American gas. Some EU officials see this as an opportunity to negotiate the rollback of 25% tariffs on EU steel and aluminum, reinstated in February. Enforcement of the tariffs was delayed by a 90-day pause to allow time for negotiations. Last week, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic met with US officials in Washington for initial talks. The commission described the meeting as a“scoping exercise”and said the US must still clarify its demands. The idea of banning Russian LNG was previously floated during talks on the EU’s 16th sanctions package, adopted in February 2025, but was dropped following discussions in January due to reported opposition from member states. Some countries, including France, Spain, and Belgium, continue to import significant volumes of Russian LNG, accounting for 85% of Europe’s Russian LNG imports, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). While pipeline gas imports from Russia have declined since 2022, the EU’s imports of Russian LNG have increased. In 2024, Russia accounted for 17.5% of the bloc’s LNG supply, making it the second-largest source after the US, which held a 45.3% share. The European Commission is currently drafting a roadmap to end dependence on Russian energy by 2027, with the plan expected in early May. In February, Russia’s first deputy energy minister, Pavel Sorokin, told RT during India Energy Week in New Delhi that the country is ramping up its LNG production and exports despite international sanctions. He said Russia could boost LNG shipments to India, noting the“competitive pricing”and stressing that Moscow will continue to trade with its partners despite growing pressure from the US and its allies.",

    "title": "‘West as we knew it no longer exists’ – EU’s von der Leyen",
    "article_text": "The traditional idea of a united West is a thing of the past, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has admitted. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Zeit published Tuesday, she claimed the EU no longer sees the US as its most important trading partner, after sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “The West as we knew it no longer exists,”she said.“The world has become a globe also geopolitically, and today our networks of friendship span the globe, as you can see in the debate about tariffs.” Her comments come after the Trump administration imposed a sweeping 20% tariff on all EU goods and a 25% tariff on all car imports. The EU responded by introducing its own retaliatory 25% tariffs on US imports. Trump later announced a 90-day pause on most global tariffs, pending negotiations with trade partners. According to von der Leyen, tensions with the US have had a“positive side effect”in the form of numerous states attempting to court the EU.“Everyone is asking for more trade with Europe – and it’s not just about economic ties. It is also about establishing common rules and it is about predictability,”she said. Asked whether her remarks about the West should be interpreted as“a final farewell to the United States,”von der Leyen stressed that she“firmly believe[s]”in the US-EU friendship.“But the new reality also includes the fact that many other states are seeking to draw closer to us. 13% of global trade is with the United States. 87% of the world’s trade is with other countries,”she said. The EU should therefore“open up new markets for our companies and establish as close a relationship as possible with many countries that have the same interests as us,”von der Leyen added. As tensions with the US continue to rise – with Trump even suggesting that the EU“was formed in order to screw”America – some leaders in the bloc have called for a review of bilateral ties. Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron urged European firms to halt new investments in the US, asking:“What message would we send by investing billions… while they are hitting us?”",

    "title": "US can manipulate time and space – White House",
    "article_text": "The US possesses technology that can“manipulate”and“bend time and space,”White House innovation czar Michael Kratsios has claimed. Kratsios delivered the remarks at the Endless Frontiers Retreat in Austin, Texas, just weeks after being confirmed as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. He emphasized President Donald Trump’s ambition to usher in a new“golden age of America,”which includes fostering scientific research and the application of cutting-edge technologies. According to Kratsios, the US can emerge as a global leader by making“smart choices”regarding public funding and deregulating innovation. “Our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. They leave distance annihilated, cause things to grow, and improve productivity,”he stated, without elaborating. Later in his speech, Kratsios insisted that overcoming the“sclerosis of the state”would enable Americans to achieve“scientific discoveries that will bend time and space, make more with less, and drive us further into the endless frontier.” Trump himself has recently alluded to advanced technologies not yet revealed to the public. Last week, he claimed China would hesitate to escalate trade tensions with the US partly due to the existence of secret weapons in the American arsenal. “We have weaponry that nobody has any idea what it is, and it is the most powerful weapons in the world that we have. More powerful than anybody even, not even close,”he told journalists in the Oval Office. In March, Trump announced the development of a sixth-generation fighter jet, which he described as“the most lethal aircraft ever built.”Boeing was awarded the contract for the project, he noted.",

    "title": "Trump rejected Israel’s plan to attack Iran – NYT",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has rejected Israel’s proposal to strike Iran’s nuclear sites, the New York Times reported on Wednesday evening, citing White House officials and others familiar with the matter. Trump reportedly chose instead to pursue a new deal with Tehran. According to the NYT, Israel had drafted plans to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities in early May, aiming to delay its ability to develop a nuclear weapon by a year or more. After considering a combination of airstrikes and commando raids, the Jewish state reportedly proposed“an extensive bombing campaign”that would have lasted more than a week. Israeli officials had hoped that the US would not only greenlight the operation but also actively support it. Trump, however, shot down the plan earlier this month, following a“rough consensus”in the White House. Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard were among the top administration officials who reportedly raised concerns that the strikes would“spark a wider conflict with Iran.” Iran and Israel exchanged strikes in April and October of last year, marking the most dramatic escalation between the regional rivals. Trump tore up the 2015 UN-backed agreement on Iran’s nuclear program during his first term in office. He accused Tehran of secretly violating the deal and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by rolling back its own compliance with the accord and accelerating its enrichment of uranium. Last month, Trump threatened to bomb Iran“if they don’t make a deal,”to which the Islamic Republic vowed not to bow to pressure. Despite the belligerent rhetoric, the US and Iran held the first round of talks in Oman on Saturday. The negotiations took place in a“productive, calm and positive atmosphere,”Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said.",

    "title": "Incoming German chancellor will change mind on missiles for Ukraine – SPD",
    "article_text": "Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be swayed from delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine once he begins to receive classified intelligence briefings on the matter, Matthias Miersch, the leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), has said. Berlin ruled out giving Ukraine the long-range weapon system, which has a range of 500km, while the SPD led the last German government. Following an historic election defeat in February which saw the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) surge,  Merz's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Miersch's SPD began talks to form a government. Speaking to the n-tv news channel on Wednesday, Miersch criticized Merz’s readiness to deliver the Taurus and risk open confrontation with Russia. “We have always been against it,”Miersch said.“I assume that Friedrich Merz, once fully informed by [intelligence] agencies, will reassess the issue clearly. We will then make the decision together,”he added. “I assume that we do not want to contribute to an escalation or become a party to the war – the very reason we chose not to deliver the Taurus [to Ukraine]. And I assume it will remain that way,”Miersch said. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, an SPD member, earlier said there are“many good arguments”against sending the missiles, and some of them cannot be discussed in public. Speaking to ARD on Sunday, Merz confirmed that he would like to supply Taurus missiles to Kiev.“Yes, that was exactly what I meant – not that we would intervene in the war ourselves, but that we would be equipping the Ukrainian army with such a weapon.” He suggested that Kiev could use it to strike the bridge connecting Crimea with mainland Russia. Roderich Kiesewetter, the CDU’s defense spokesman, argued that the Taurus would help Ukraine“destroy Russian supply lines and command bunkers.” The missile debate is unfolding as US President Donald Trump works to broker a Russian-Ukrainian ceasefire through shuttle diplomacy. Moscow has warned that no amount of Western arms deliveries will prevent it from achieving its goals in the conflict. The Taurus will“not bring any changes to the battlefield,”Russia’s ambassador to Germany, Sergey Nechayev, said on Wednesday. They would, however, make Germany directly involved in the conflict, as“Ukrainian soldiers… cannot operate the long-range weapon”without Berlin’s help, Nechayev said.",

    "title": "Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan flattens leadership structure, names new AI chief, memo says",
    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Intel logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO :     Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is flattening the semiconductor giant's leadership team, with important chip groups reporting directly to him, according to a memo from Tan seen by Reuters. Intel has also promoted networking chip chief Sachin Katti to be chief technology officer and artificial intelligence chief, according to the memo. The leadership changes are the first major move under Tan, who took the top job last month, to turn around the venerable Silicon Valley chipmaker after years of problems. Intel's data center and AI chip group, as well as its personal-computer chip group, will report directly to Tan. They previously were overseen by Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who remains chief executive of Intel products and whose work will expand to new areas. \"I want to roll up my sleeves with the engineering and product teams so I can learn what’s needed to strengthen our solutions,\" Tan wrote. \"As Michelle and I drive this work, we plan to evolve and expand her role with more details to come in the future.\" The shakeup by Tan, who has promised a leaner version of the storied American chipmaker, follows an extended period of turmoil at Santa Clara, California-based Intel. The previous chief left last year after disagreements with its board of directors over how to turn the company around after years of manufacturing and product missteps. A top challenge is confronting the rise of Nvidia, which has become the dominant supplier of AI chips. BECOMING 'ENGINEERING-FOCUSED' Despite acquiring several AI chip startups, Intel failed to settle on a coherent strategy to challenge Nvidia, and in January shelved its most recent attempt, a chip called Falcon Shores. Developing the new AI strategy will now fall to Katti. Tan's email says Katti \"is expanding his responsibilities to include the role of chief technology and AI officer for the company. As part of this, he will lead our overall AI strategy and AI product roadmap, as well as Intel Labs and our relationships with the startup and developer ecosystems.\" Katti, who is also a professor at Stanford University, will succeed Greg Lavender, who is retiring from Intel, according to the memo. In recent years, Intel's executive team had included many business unit leaders, with technical leaders often layers below the CEO. Tan's memo said that three longtime technical executives - Rob Bruckner, Mike Hurley and Lisa Pearce - will now report to Tan. \"This supports our emphasis on becoming an engineering-focused company and will give me visibility into what’s needed to compete and win,\" Tan wrote in the memo. The memo follows Tan's public comments that he aimed to trim layers of management from the company so that executive leadership would work more closely with its engineers. \"It’s clear to me that organizational complexity and bureaucratic processes have been slowly suffocating the culture of innovation we need to win,\" Tan said in the memo. \"It takes too long to make decisions. New ideas are not given room or resources to incubate. And unnecessary silos lead to inefficient execution.\" (This story has been corrected to say that Michelle Johnston Holthaus remains chief executive of Intel products, in paragraph 4) Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "White House offered reassurances on visas for LA28, USOPC says",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport FILE PHOTO: IOC Vice President and LA28 Coordination Commission Chair Nicole Hoevertsz gives an interview after a press conference held by the International Olympic Committee Coordination Commission for the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 14, 2024. REUTERS/Daniel Cole/File Photo NEW YORK :The USOPC has received \"significant reassurances\" from the White House on visas for the Los Angeles 2028 Games, Chair Gene Sykes said on Thursday, weeks after an internal memo showed the Trump administration was weighing sweeping travel restrictions. The memo last month listed 41 countries that could be subject to partial or full visa suspensions, potentially complicating the effort to host the Games, with thousands of athletes, coaches, personnel and tourists expected to travel. Leadership from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said that they met with legislators and members of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last week to discuss a wide range of issues around U.S. sport. \"It's very clear that, from the very top of the administration, they want this to be an incredibly successful experience for all Americans and all of the athletes and visitors who come from frankly every country in the world,\" Sykes told reporters. \"They understand what it means to host the Olympic Games, so we were provided with significant reassurances about the work they're going to do with us to manage the visa process to make this work well for athletes and their appropriate entourages.\" One topic not raised was the issue of visas for qualified transgender athletes, after Trump said he would not allow transgender competitors in the LA28 Games. Trump signed an executive order in February aimed at excluding transgender girls and women from women's sports, clashing with international norms. The IOC has long refused to apply any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games, instructing international federations in 2021 to come up with their own guidelines. \"(We) didn't discuss the issue and our general discussion on visas is to make sure that we have as much support from the administration, the State Department as we can possibly receive, and the reassurances have been very broad,\" Sykes said. Los Angeles 2028 Olympic officials told Reuters late last year that they were confident the U.S. federal government would deliver on its promise to support the Games.

    "title": "'Want to join?': These 4 mums started the Mindful Mamas community to make motherhood a less lonely journey",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness Remarkable Living Living Remarkable Living People Style & Beauty Obsessions Experiences Style & Beauty Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Singapore Dining Travel Women Women Mindful Mamas is a 1,000-strong community where mums can connect through play dates, book clubs, and shared stories of parenthood – all in the spirit of growing into more present, grounded versions of themselves. CNA Women meets its four founders. (From left) Amanda Ong, Jiezhen Wu, Ho Kin Ing and Hema Nathan with their babies on a walk at MacRitchie Reservoir. (Photo: CNA/Izza Haziqah) This audio is generated by an AI tool. It was at MacRitchie Reservoir that I met the four founders of Mindful Mamas. The late afternoon sun filtered through the canopy, and a breeze cooled our brows. Each woman had her baby in a carrier or in her arms, looking more than ready to gofor their regular walk. A year ago, they were strangers. Today, they work closely to build their growing community of nearly 1,000 mums in Singapore, who want to slow down, manage their stress better, and raise their children in amindful, unrushed and intentional manner. Before they found each other, motherhood mostly felt like a struggle. Amanda Ong, a 30-year-old musician, became a mum for the first time in May 2024. Elated and in love with her daughter, she also often felt alone. Most of her friends weren’t mums, and few were interested in the way her life had changed since motherhood. “I love my daughter and being a mum, but theloneliness of new motherhoodgot to me sometimes,” she told CNA Women. Ho Kin Ing, a business owner, gave birth to her third daughter, Cherish, in September 2023. But experience didn’t make things easier. The 33-year-old hadbattled postpartum depressionwith her first child, and even after having her third, she often felt anxious and burnt out. “With my first two girls, I was overly cautious, full of nerves, and unable to relax,” she said. This time, Ho was determined to do things differently. Meanwhile, 36-year-old leadership coach Jiezhen Wu and 37-year-old educator Hema Nathan crossed paths outside a nature-based daycare where they sent their older children. Both mums of two, they bonded over slow walks with their newborns and having quiet, unhurried mornings that gave space for conversation, reflection, and rest. They began taking regular walks at MacRitchie Reservoir, where the surroundings helped them reconnect with themselves. Over a few months, the four women found each other serendipitously: Wu met Ong at a baby yoga class; Ong met Ho at a cloth diapering course; Wu roped Nathan in to meet Ho at a baby event. And the four women realised they shared a deep desire for community. “We felt most at ease in nature. Less hurried and more connected to our babies, and to each other,” said Nathan. “We all knew how lonely it could get. So if we met a mum at the daycare, supermarket or even at the void deck, we’d say, ‘Hey, we’re going for a walk, want to join?’” Ho remembers her first walk with the group vividly. “I was so burnt out that I’d see a leaf fall and suddenly panic for no reason,” she said. “I never thought of nature as healing, and I hardly brought my first two out on walks, but that first stroll with the other three was life-changing.” Initially, Wu would drop each of the others a WhatsApp text to organise a walk. She then started a group chat for easier communication and called it Mindful Mama Walks. Soon, the invitations to go for walks spread beyond the four. Wu said: “Each of us just started sharing about the walks with other mums, and the other mums then shared about them with other mums, and soon, the whole community of mums going on mindful, silent, nature-surrounded walks just grew and grew.” Most of the invitations happened on WhatsApp or via word of mouth, as the four mums often attended events related to pregnancy and parenthood. Ong said: “Eventually, it wasn’t even us doing all the organising. Mums being mums, many just took the initiative. There was one day when five walks were happening across the island at the same time. It was beautiful.\" What began as four mums looking for calm turned into a movement of mothers choosing presence over pressure. Mindful Mamas offers a space for women to gather, walk, chat, play, and raise their children with intention together. By late 2024, Mindful Mamas had grown far beyond the original walking group of four. As more mothers joined the WhatsApp group, the community blossomed into 11 different subgroups and interest circles. A post shared by Kindle Space | Prenatal & Postpartum Yoga, Pilates, Wellness 🇸🇬 (@kindlespace.sg) There are now groups for homeschooling or delayed formal schooling, a platform to initiate and plan regular play dates and share structured educational activities, a gifting and swap chat for pre-loved items, and even workouts designed for mums who are always with their babies and can’t leave home. The main chat buzzes with dozens of conversations each day. But while the community began as a digital gathering space, in-person meet-ups remain at the heart of Mindful Mamas. “We’re a community on WhatsApp, and there are hundreds of us, but we always make it a point to meet,” said Wu. “That’s where the real connection comes in, where mums can genuinely feel less alone and know that someone – another mum – has got their back.” Aside from the casual walks that happen all over Singapore – at Chinese Garden, Kent Ridge Park, East Coast Park, Botanic Gardens, and Bukit Timah – Mindful Mamas also organises events. These include gatherings that welcome other family members anditem swapswhere mums can exchange used clothes, toys and accessories. A post shared by lyric’s mom ++ (@fishmeatball) The four founders see it as their role to create and protect a safe, judgement-free zone, both in real life and online. “It’s also important that we get mums out,” said Wu. “Being at home for long stretches with little to no adult interaction can be incredibly isolating.” That’s why whenever a mum says she’s too tired or unsure about joining an outing, the group responds, not with pressure, but with empathy and encouragement. “I spend every waking moment with my 10-month-old daughter. I go literally everywhere with her, and it can be a lot,” said Ong. “But I also want to show that it’s okay for kids to cry in public; it’s okay to settle them however works for you. It’s okay to struggle. That’s what this space is for.” When tensions arise, the community has shown maturity and grace. Ho recalled one incident on WhatsApp where two members clashed over differing approaches to baby sleep. “Sleep is always a sensitive topic,” she said. “Some mums co-sleep, some sleep train, some nurse to sleep, and a lot of us have very strong opinions on this.” Before any of the four could intervene, other members stepped in. The messages poured in, gently reminding everyone of the group’s values: Openness, mindfulness, empathy and mutual respect. “It really touched me,” Ho said. “That the group could self-regulate, and that the mums truly believed in what this space was meant to be.” Thinking back to life before motherhood, before Mindful Mamas, Ong said she never imagined her parenthood journey would look like this. “I’ve gained so much insight. Before this, I only had my parents and in-laws to turn to. And while they’re great, this community opened my eyes to different ways of parenting. I’d never even considered homeschooling, but now it’s all I think about.” Nathan told CNA Women that the space helped her embrace who she is as a mum and a wife: “As a working mum, I always had doubts – am I doing enough? Is it okay to feel this way? But then I met other mums who felt just like me or are going through the same situation and challenges I am, and I realised I’m okay. We’re all okay.\" Looking ahead, Ho hopes Mindful Mamas can grow into a space that raises awareness about parenting-related issues. Inspired by the Breastfeeding Mothers’ Support Group Singapore, Ho envisions Mindful Mamas as a platform that can advocate for different issues that affect parenthood and children growing up in Singapore, such as conscientious screen use around children or even rethinking how education is structured. As for Wu, she’s proud that the group has grown organically. Now that it’s crossed 1,000 members, she knows it’ll need more hands on deck to be more inclusive and welcoming, to manage meet-ups, guide conversations, and make sure the community stays grounded in its original intention of mindfulness, connection, and slowing down together.

    "title": "What is 'cloud skin' or blurring makeup? Here’s how to pull off that soft-focus, glowing look",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness Remarkable Living Living Remarkable Living People Style & Beauty Obsessions Experiences Style & Beauty Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Singapore Dining Travel Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Goodbye harsh contouring and hello soft-focus skin. What is blurring makeup? (Photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The blurring makeup trend isn’t new. Also known as “cloud skin”, this beauty trend that champions a soft, diffused finish that enhances skin – rather than cover it up – can be traced way back toK-beautyin the 2010s. Designed with a light-diffusing effect that make pores appear smaller, it also minimises oiliness so makeup lasts longer. In its early days, blurring makeup used to centre around base makeup primers,foundationsand powders. These days, it’s taken over every aspect of our beauty look, including lips, cheeks and eyes. And it’s not justK-beauty brands, this trend has gone global with makeup brands from all over the world jumping on the bandwagon, including Hailey Bieber’s Rhode toC-beauty’s Judydoll and Into You. Instead of sculpting and contouring, think of the blurring makeup trend as a softer blending of colour minus the harsh lines, explained celebrity makeup artist Elain Lim who is Jeanette Aw’s go-to makeup maestro. The focus is on blurring out the lines, pores and smoothening the skin’s surface. Some dub it \"cloud makeup,\" likening it to that soft, cotton-like finish, added celebrity makeup artist Lasalle Lee who works with Michelle Wong, Jernelle Oh and YES 933’s Gao Mei Gui. These products usually feature actives such as silicone to diffuse light, which in turn, minimise the appearance of imperfections such as enlarged pores, fine lines and skin roughness while also absorbing excess sebum to keep unwanted shine at bay. And while you might think that this blurring makeup look is what we’ve always known as airbrushed skin, there are some differences. Though both makeup looks do smooth the appearance of the skin, airbrushed makeup can look heavy and appear like it’s sitting on the skin’s surface, whereas blurring makeup gives the illusion that it’s part of the skin,” said Lim. Ready to embrace this soft-focus look? Follow these easy tips: 1. Prep your skin.Skincare prep is important, especially if you want your base makeup to look natural, emphasised Lim. This means massaging the skin with moisturiser prior to makeup application. When skin is well-hydrated, you won’t need a lot of makeup to achieve that flawless coverage. Plus, it also helps makeup adhere better and last longer. 2. Going in circles.Apply your makeup primer with the pad of your finger in circular motions, akin to massaging it into the skin, said Lee. This helps create a smoother canvas for the foundation and powder that follow. 3. Use a beauty blender.For foundation application, use a foundation brush to get an even coverage, followed by a beauty blender to pat it in to give that soft, diffused finish, shared Lee. 4. Tap, don’t spread.Invest in a small finger puff to tap your makeup in. “Tapping is better to let the colour set into the skin rather than fingers as fingers can wipe off the colour,” explained Lim. 5. Dot, dot, dot.For concealer, Lim recommended using a fine tip makeup brush to lightly dot it onto the areas needed and then patting it in with the brush to prevent it from looking cakey. Don’t forget to add a light layer of loose powder to give it that soft-focus finish. 6. Buff it out.Want definition but yet still have that soft-focus finish for your lips? Line the lips with your favourite lip liner, then buff over your natural lip line with your ring finger. This not only gives a blurred effect, but also makes lips look fuller and plumped. 7. Beware of pilling.Blurring makeup products often tend to have silicone in its formulations. If you can’t avoid silicone, then Lee advised using less instead of more during product application. And if your makeup does pill, don’t try to brush it out, instead pat it down to reduce further pilling.

    "title": "Haikin the hero as Bodo/Glimt Europa League fairytale continues",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport ROME () -     Bodo/Glimt's incredible run in the Europa League continued on Thursday as they bounced back from conceding three goals to force a penalty shoot-out that keeper Nikita Haikin won for them by saving the decisive spot-kick against Lazio, sending the Nordic nation into raptures. Nowhere will those celebrations be bigger than inside the Arctic Circle in Bodo, where fans will now be preparing for a semi-final against English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur after one of the greatest nights in Norwegian sport. \"There are so many ifs and buts and brackets, but the team did it. Nikita is decisive for us. He decided both the match and the penalty shoot-out,\" Bodo/Glimt boss Kjetil Knutsen said following the 3-2 shoot-out win after the tie finished 3-3 on aggregate. \"Nikita is a fantastic penalty keeper. We knew that the chance was good if there was a penalty shoot-out,\" added midfielder Patrick Berg, who had every reason to be grateful to his keeper after blazing what could have been the decisive kick high over the crossbar. For Haikin, the shoot-out win was a moment of redemption in a career that has seen some incredible twists and turns, from seeing his hero Petr Cech train when he was a junior player at Chelsea through clubs in Spain, Russia, Israel and England. \"It's crazy! I didn't think the game would go this far, but we couldn't give up. We just had to keep going,\" an emotional Haikin said. \"We knew the chances were coming. I couldn't be happier. This means a lot to all of Norway. For Bodø. For my family. It's huge. A historic night.\" Such was the scale of the fairytale victory that Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere was quick to offer his congratulation on social media. \"Reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League is huge – it shows what’s possible when you give everything for the shirt. A great night for the northerners and for all of Norwegian football in Rome,\" he wrote on X.

    "title": "Meet the Singapore bike collector with 17 classic and modern cruisers",

Any rusty bicycle left in the bushes by the side of the PCN looks destined for the junkyard. Not to the discerning eyes of Tan Ruiping, who had such an encounter on one of her rides with friends. “I knew I had chanced upon something special,” she said when she recognised its unique shape. The “old bike” turned out to be a cruiser bicycle. In the world of two wheelers, cruiser bicycles or cruisers stand apart from road bikes, mountain bikes and foldies for two reasons: Chill riding (none of that Lycra-clad need for speed) and looking good while doing so. After all, these riders are not like the cookie-cutter road bikes you get from Decathlon. The distinctively curved frame – often accentuated with an ornamental “gas tank” – is a giveaway that it’s based on something. Then, there are the swept-back handlebars that don’t look out of place on a motorcycle and you start to wonder: Is the cruiser designed to look like one? You wouldn’t be wrong. The name “cruiser” might have been coined by the Chicago-based Mead Cycle Company, whose line of Crusader Cruiser bikes back then were based on the appearance of WWII motorcycles. Or the originator could have beenSchwinn, another Chicago bike manufacturer that is now synonymous with classic cruiser bikes. In 1933, it introduced its iconic Autocycle model and revolutionarywhite-wallballoon tyres. The 1930s to 1950s were the heyday for these classic rides, said Tan, with brands such as Schwinn, Dayton and Columbia taking big bites out of the cruiser pie. It is easy to see their popularity then:The solidly built bikes were made of steel and had single-speed gears and wide tyres, which make them hardy and as easy to fix as they were to ride – practically two-wheeled heroes for newspaper boys and bicycle couriers back in the day. Cruisers’ popularity took a tumble in the late 1950s and early 1960s when lighter and nimbler road bikes or racers with multiple-speed gears from Europe rode into the scene. After all, these steel old-timers easily weighed between 28kg and 35kg, according to Tan. It was during the 1990s that the modern cruiser made its appearance and revived interest in the genre. By the turn of the millennium, aficionados were smitten, thanks to collaborations with graphic designers and pop culture references such as Paul Frank and Hello Kitty. The move accomplished what Swatch did for quartz watches. Take the eye-grabbing Dyno Taboo Tiki Beach Cruiser Bike, for example. It was designed by Von Franco, a Los Angeles lowbrow artist known for melding graffiti, tiki and hot-rod cultures. Throw in personalised touches such as Tan’s zombie rat fender ornament and matching hub caps, and you’re on to something special. Halfway around the world in Singapore, cruisers, too, got the attention of connoisseurs such as Tan. Her very first cruiser – and probably her favourite (“It’s like asking me which child is my favourite.”) – is a cheeky yellow fellow called the Nirve Paul Frank Scholastic Women's Cruiser Bike. “I was casually surfing the internet about four years ago when I saw it. I was immediately taken in by the design because it was bright yellow. And it's got race checks on the fenders. Being in the media, in design, those details appealed to me,” said the media director. Tan sold her “COVID-19 mountain bike” soon after getting the Nirve Paul Frank, and over the next few years, she acquired more cruisers to make up her current collection of 17. Other than the Nirve, she also owns four Schwinns, six Electras, two Felts, a JC Higgins, Columbia, Roadmaster and Dyno to date. The jewel in her two-wheeled crown, so to speak? The original Schwinn B6 Autocycle 1951 that she bought from a collector in Singapore, who had it shipped from the US. The way a cruiser is ridden is another attraction point for her. “You ride comfortably upright, instead of bent over like on a road bike,” said the 50-year-old Tan appreciatively. “It’s very good for older folks and people with backaches and bad backs.” Coupled with fat balloon tyres that promise a plush ride and you have a bike that’s made for cruising on the beach, she added. In fact, cruisers are also known as beach cruisers in the US. Regardless of vintage, cruisers in general, are heavier than the other bikes such as road bikes. “Even the newer ones made of aluminium can weigh about 10kg to 15kg,\" she said. Not that Tan minded. “Hitching a bike onto my car rack is my version of going to the gym,” she said of the times she’d to drive one of her bikes (she picks them on a rotational basis) to East Coast Park for a leisurely weekend ride to Marina Bay. So passionate is Tan that she drove four hours each way from Tennessee to Cleveland – and even crossed a time zone – to attend her first-ever swap-meet known as the Get-A-Grip Bike Show. “I've always read online about people going to swap-meets, buying bikes, shopping parts and all that. So, when I was in the US for a work trip two years ago, I decided, okay, I am going to attend one.” It was well worth the solo drive. “It was like visiting Bike Disneyland, the happiest place on earth for bike enthusiasts like myself,” she recalled. “From colourful banana seats to antique bike lamps, bells, tires, grips and pedals, there was a piece of something for every treasure-hunter seeking a prized find.” One of her favourite memories about the swap-meet was seeing a bike that was dedicated to a collector’s mother who had just passed on. “It was an expression of his love for his mother. It also won the top price in the competition for customised bikes.” Tan couldn’t cart any bike home but “it was truly one of the most memorable moments of my US trip”. Most of Tan's bikes are acquired from Carousell, particularly from sellers in the US, the place of origin for cruisers. “These bikes usually come from people who have had them in their families for generations. The bikes were probably lying in the barn, attic or garage for years until somebody decides to sell the house. Their great-grandfathers or grandfathers probably rode them,” she said. Tan is also not above picking up abandoned cruisers, like the one mentioned earlier, which she has since sold. “I bought the others from owners in Singapore, who might have gotten them from the US or back when cruisers were sold here in the 90s.” It was an uphill climb in the beginning. “I had no idea what to do. I didn't even know how to ride my first cruiser when I got it. The brakes weren’t the typical caliper brakes, if it even had a front brake in the first place.” According to Tan, it is common for cruisers to feature a coaster or backpedal brake like those used in fixies. “It's illegal to ride a bicycle without a front brake in Singapore, so I had to go and figure it out. I brought it to a bike shop and thankfully, the uncle had a caliper brake that was big enough for the front wheel,” she recalled. These days, Tan gets her parts from Carousell, Amazon or eBay – the latter two for more unusual options. “Whenever I travel, I try to look for parts that would otherwise be expensive to buy online.” The same goes for accessories such as baskets, lights, bells and helmets. \"I had a benign brain tumour removed 10 years ago, so helmets are important to me,\" she said of the eight she has to match some of her bikes' designs. How much can you expect to pay for a cruiser? “Pre-loved ones can start from S$150,” said Tan. “Brand-new ones can go for above S$1,000. It really depends on the brand, condition of the bike and its rarity.” The most affordable cruiser in Tan’s collection is also her first, the Nirve Paul Frank, which she bought off Facebook Marketplace for S$130. “It was a steal. I think the owner didn't know the value of the bike,” she said. “Then again, it was a fairly basic bike.” Her most expensive is a Felt that she bought brand new for about S$1,400 from a local bike shop. “I don't usually buy my bikes brand new. I like them used so that I can restore them. That was the only one I bought new and even so, I customised it a little to make it sportier and unique.” If space wasn’t a consideration, Tan definitely has a few bikes on her wish list, including the Felt Hot Wheels, Monark Super Deluxe and the classics by Columbia and Elgin. \"They may cost a few thousand US dollars each.\" Other covetable well-known classic brands that collectors seek, according to Tan, include Western and Dayton. “Micargi, Huffy, sixthreezero and Firmstrong are also popular brands.” If you don’t mind a reproduction, and not an original collectable, you can get one from Japan, Europe or China, said Tan. “China has really dominated the market. They have copied the models and designs of the original bikes to make modern reproductions, which I have a few. They resemble the originals and are cheaper but in terms of quality, stalwart collectors of American cruisers will tell you they are crap,” she said, laughing. Another path that cruisers are taking is the electric bike route, said Tan. \"People like a bit of pedal assist these days. You can still ride these electric cruisers like a regular bike and can also push the throttle and speed up a bit like a PMD.\" She hasn't got one in her collection as she still prefers to peddle. \"Peddle power is what gets me the exercise.\" Tan is aware of just about 20 active collectors in Singapore. But when it comes to the number of cruiser owners, who “may simply use the bikes as a mode of transportation” and “not actively pursuing or sharing the hobby”, she believes there are probably over a hundred here. “Generally, the cruiser bike community in Singapore is very small,” said Tan, who manages aFacebook pagethat has about 130 members. “There are fewer than 10 local members and the rest are from all over the world.” She let on that the group has not met up in real life “because there’s nothing to swap”. “In fact, if you have anything, it's quite a rarity,” she said. “Honestly, I don't think many of the members realise that I'm a woman. That’s gonna change after this!” she said of the male-dominated but welcoming and friendly community. “When sellers meet me, they’re always looking for a guy. It’s a hilarious surprise when I walk up to them and see their eyes pop and jaws drop.” Tan isn’t only bringing the community together online; she has also single-handedly produced two editions of the magazine SpokesPeople inSeptember 2022andJanuary 2023. “I have a background in media. I do a bit of design and writing, and I like taking photographs of my bikes. So, I thought, why don't I combine my interests, so that I could have a little magazine that chronicles my rides?” “My husband threatened to kick me out of the house once. No, I’m just kidding!” laughed Tan when asked about her family’s take on her hobby. “He and my daughters are resigned to the fact that I’m a collector. They are quite accepting, understanding and nice about it.” And yes, other than curating cruisers, Tan is also a mother to two girls. “In the early days when my collection started to grow, my daughters would ask, ‘are you looking at bikes again’ whenever I was online, or ‘how come there's one more bike in the house?’. My younger daughter even said, ‘Mum, every time you bring back a bike, I'm gonna take away something’,” she recalled their ribbing. But lest you think her HDB apartment and corridor are choked up with bikes, you couldn’t be more mistaken. Part of Tan’s collection is expertly incorporated into displays of vintage memorabilia, retro Coke fridge, family photos and ornamental licence plates; the rest are split between a warehouse and her office building’s multi-storeyed carpark. She admitted that cruisers can take some getting used to because of their heft. But as she wrote in her magazine, “if you have a sense of style, enjoy feeling the breeze and admiring your surroundings while riding, you’ll love cruisers”. And we can all slow down a little in life. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Soccer Football - Copa Sudamericana - Group C - Corinthians v Huracan - Neo Quimica Arena, Sao Paulo, Brazil - April 2, 2025 Corinthians coach Ramon Diaz reacts REUTERS/Jean Carniel Brazilian club Corinthians have sacked Argentine coach Ramon Diaz after a dismal season in which they have taken just four points from four Brasileirao games, the club announced on Thursday. Diaz guided the club to the Paulista Championship title at the end of March but they have had a sluggish start to the Brazilian top flight, most recently losing 2-0 to Fluminense on Wednesday. Their poor performance in the Copa Sudamericana also contributed to the coach's dismissal. \"Sport Club Corinthians Paulista has announced the departure of Ramon Diaz from his position as team coach. The board of directors would like to thank the coach for his services to the club and wish him every success in his future career,\" the club said in a statement. The 65-year-old coach, who joined Corinthians in July last year, helped the team to avoid relegation and win the Paulista 2025 championship in his first season in charge. Orlando Ribeiro, Corinthians' U-20 coach, will lead the first team's training session on Friday, and the club said they had not contacted any other coaches.

    "title": "Bodo/Glimt stun Lazio in penalty shoot-out to make Europa League semi-finals",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport ROME :Nikita Haikin made the vital save as Bodo/Glimt pulled off a stunning penalty shoot-out win away to Lazio on Thursday to become the first Norwegian team to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they will face Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur. Lazio appeared to have done all they needed to, overturning the two-goal deficit from the first leg to take a 3-0 lead on the night, but a sucker-punch goal in extra time from Andreas Helmersen sent the tie to penalties, where Haikin became the hero. Lazio had taken the lead in the 21st minute through an exquisite flick from Taty Castellanos and that set the tone for what was to come, with the Italian side dominating and the visitors floundering for much of the game, unable to keep up with the slick passing of the Italians. However, it took until second-half stoppage time for Tijani Noslin to squeeze in their second goal to make it 2-2 on aggregate and send the tie to extra time, with Boulaye Dia heading home to put Lazio 3-2 up on aggregate 10 minutes into the first period. Then came Helmersen's decisive cameo appearance. After missing a sitter in second-half stoppage time, just before Noslin's goal, he scored with a powerful downward header to level the aggregate score at 3-3, throwing the club a scarcely believable lifeline. Helmersen's all-action contribution saw him receive a second yellow card in the dying minutes as the tie headed to penalties after a nerve-jangling encounter. Things looked bleak for the Norwegians when Jens Petter Hauge saw his spot kick saved and Dia scored, but up stepped their well-travelled goalkeeper Haikin, an Israeli-born Russian who spent much of his teenage years in London. He saved from Loum Tchaouna and watched as Noslin fired wide and, with Bodo scoring their next three kicks, the stage was set for Patrick Berg, whose family is synonymous with the Norwegian club, to win it with their fifth penalty. There was to be one last twist before the fairytale ending, with Berg blazing his effort high over the bar and Haikin called upon once more. He cemented his hero status by saving Castellanos's effort for a 3-2 win in the shoot-out that made them the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition, prompting wild celebrations among the travelling fans, as well as those at home inside the Arctic Circle.

    "title": "Maguire's 121st minute winner sends Man Utd through to Europa League semis",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport MANCHESTER, England :Harry Maguire scored in the dying seconds of extra time to help   Manchester United snatch a place in the Europa League semi-finals on Thursday with a sensational 7-6 aggregate victory over Olympique Lyonnais in their quarter-final clash. A thrilling second leg tie was taken into extra time after  United threw away a two-goal lead on the night to be pegged back to 2-2 after 90 minutes, with goals from Rayan Cherki and Alexandre Lacazette putting Lyon on the verge of the semi-finals at a stunned Old Trafford. However, United made their numerical advantage, given to them after Corentin Tolisso's late red card in normal time, count. Maguire sent Old Trafford into delirium with his 121st-minute header which sealed a 5-4 victory in the second leg. It was the hosts who took an early lead, Manuel Ugarte slotting home 10 minutes in after a fine team move, before Diogo Dalot added a second just before the break to double hosts's lead. As the minutes ticked on, however, the nerves crept in and two goals in six second-half minutes from Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico drew the match, and left the tie level in sensational fashion. Tolisso's late sending off swung the momentum back in United's favour, but Cherki's fine strike and Lacazzette's coolly-taken penalty seemingly settled the exhilarating contest. Fernandes' spot kick straight down the other end gave home supporters hope of another dramatic finale, before Kobbie Mainoo levelled the tie with what appeared to be the last kick, only for Maguire to have the final say. United are now the first team in history to score two goals in the 120th minute of a major European match, as they storm into the last four to face Athletic Bilbao. \"I felt like the fourth goal for them was a sucker punch but that we'd get chances to get back into it,\" Maguire told TNT Sport. \"It fell to myself and thankfully I scored, it was an amazing feeling. \"An incredible game, we made really hard work of it.\" Old Trafford has not been a happy place this season especially in the Premier League. Long-regarded as one of the toughest places in England to visit, seven of United’s 14 league defeats this season have come on their home patch. FAST START Their record in Europe, however, remains much more formidable. Lyon travelled to Manchester looking to register only the second away win at Old Trafford in 30 Europa League encounters. Nothing could have prepared supporters for a night of drama on this scale, however. The team who had conceded first 19 times in the Premier League this season needed a fast start to breathe life into their crucial clash and Ugarte converted Alejandro Garnacho's low cross to nearly lift the roof off Old Trafford’s famous Stretford End. After Dalot’s well-taken second, Garnacho wasted a glorious opportunity to kill off the contest early in the second half, with that miss costly as the nerves set in, some tentative defending allowing Tolisso in to get Lyon back in it. Tagliafico was then on hand to fire home from a tight angle past United's returning goalkeeper Andre Onana, the Argentine defender's former teammate at Ajax. Tolisso's red card, after picking up two yellows, lifted Old Trafford once more, but it was Lyon who looked more dangerous in the first period of extra time. Cherki is very much Lyon’s dangerman and his brilliance put the visitors in front for the first time, before Lacazette had the away side's substitutes storming the pitch. Casemiro's tumble in the penalty area gave Fernandes the chance to give United hope, with substitute Mainoo's superb finish sensationally levelling the match up once more. Maguire was not done there, as he headed home Casemiro’s cross to spark scenes of joy this stadium has been longing for - the first time there has been a winner this late in Europa League history. \"The only negative point I might make is we celebrated too much when our fourth goal went in,\" Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca said. \"We shouldn’t really celebrate until the very end of the match.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "How will Xi’s visit aid or hamper Southeast Asia countries in their tariff talks with the US?",
    "article_text": "Asiaanalysis analysisAsia Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia rolled out the red carpet for Chinese President Xi Jinping to show they won’t be bullied in tariff negotiations with the US, analysts say. But they add that it remains a delicate balancing act for ASEAN states. President Xi Jinping (left) and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim meet in Putrajaya during the second leg of Xi's Southeast Asia tour on Apr 16, 2025. (Photo: Prime Minister’s Office of Malaysia) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Fresh from theofficial visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia will aim to use the outcomes to portray a position of strength as they try to negotiate lower tariff rates imposed by the United States, analysts say. At the same time, these countries will still be wary of being too reliant on Beijing, given the threat of cheap Chinese products flooding their domestic markets and the fear of alienating Washington amid the ongoing negotiations, they added. Xi spent Monday (Apr 14) and Tuesday in Vietnam before heading to Malaysia on Tuesday evening for a visit until Thursday morning. He then concluded his Southeast Asia tour with a one-day trip in Cambodia on Thursday. As Vietnam and Malaysia emerge from Xi’s visits having signed dozens of memoranda of understanding (MOU) in areas ranging from security to railway cooperation, analysts told CNA on Thursday that the Southeast Asian countries are sending a signal to the US that they will not be held ransom in tariff negotiations. \"You do not go to the negotiating table with a bloody nose begging for the tariffs to be reduced; it is important to project strength while negotiating,” said Adib Zalkapli, managing director of Viewfinder Global Affairs, a Malaysia-based geopolitical consultancy firm. “So, you can say that Vietnam and Malaysia are projecting their strength firstly through ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) unity and now highlighting their strong bilateral ties with China.” Xi’s Southeast Asia tour comes as China is engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with the US, with US President Donald Trump specifically excluding Beijing from a 90-day reciprocal tariff reprieve he granted for other countries. Earlier this month, the Trump administration slapped tariffs of 145 per cent on most Chinese imports. Beijing later responded with its own 125 per cent tariffs on American products coming into China. ASEAN member states' economic ministers had met last Thursday to discuss the US tariffs and the 10 countriesagreed thatthey would not respond with retaliatory measures. Xi’s Southeast Asia tour is a well-timed andstrategic charm offensiveaimed at strengthening regional ties while bolstering Beijing’s reputation as a dependable economic partner, analysts previously told CNA. Still, given that the US remains a key trading partner for Malaysia and Vietnam, which also have to contend with their own maritime disputes with China, the optics and outcomes of Xi’s visit were the result of a fine balancing act, the observers said on Thursday. In a sign of how the US might be keeping a close eye on China’s overtures in Southeast Asia, Trump has described Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders as one that was “trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America”. Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow in the Southeast Asia programme at the Lowy Institute think tank in Australia, said Xi’s trips to the three countries aimed to project China's image as a more reliable and responsible partner for the region, especially since Washington is “confused” about its direction in imposing sweeping tariffs. “The three countries are still developing and maintaining close relations with China (which) is critical to access resources for developments, especially since USAID has ceased many projects,” he told CNA, referring toTrump’s hollowing out of the US development agency. “Having said that, they will avoid being over reliant on China, and will seek to expand their economic partnerships.\" Ahead of his arrival in Vietnam on Monday, Xi called for stronger ties with Hanoi on trade and supply chains amid disruptions caused by US tariffs. According to Chinese state media outlet Xinhua, Xi told Vietnam's Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam during his visit to \"jointly oppose unilateral bullying\", although he stopped short of naming the US. The countries also signed dozens of cooperation agreements, footage of the documents reviewed by news agency Reuters showed, including deals on enhancing supply chains and railway cooperation. “Faced with the uncertainty, instability and unpredictability of the international situation, the two sides will firmly uphold multilateralism,\" a joint statement from the two countries said. Vietnam's approach to its relations with China is to “walk along with Beijing” but stand up to its larger and more powerful neighbour if necessary, Abdul Rahman said, highlighting that Hanoi is able to isolate South China Sea tensions from broader ties. Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia,Bruneiand the Philippines have overlapping claims with China in the strategic and resource-rich waterways, most of which Beijing claims as its own. “Hanoi is sophisticated in balancing between the US and China. Behind the scenes, I believed Vietnamese officials would engage their American counterparts to address any concerns Washington may have about the visit,” Abdul Rahman added. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46 per cent - the third-highest in ASEAN - before the Trump administration issued the 90-day pause last week. Hanoi had reportedly proposed to cut tariffs on US imports to zero before the reprieve. Chong Ja Ian, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, said that Vietnam would “obviously complicate” its efforts to negotiate with Washington had it fully endorsed Beijing’s position on the US levies. “Vietnam’s leadership will obviously not want to contradict Xi during or soon after his visit, but they are likely to find ways to mollify the Trump administration as they discuss tariffs,” he told CNA. “Moreover, many of the documents inked during Xi’s visit seemed to be MOUs which are indications of intent, but non-binding.” Meanwhile, Xi’s visit to Malaysia yielded 31 MOUs and documents covering various sectors of cooperation, including on upgrading the countries’ joint industrial parks as well as setting up a joint diplomatic and defence dialogue. During the visit, Xi and Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim traded Malay and Chinese proverbs before acclaimed Malaysian singer Siti Nurhaliza serenaded the leaders with a Mandarin classic. In a starkly-worded speech, Anwar said he sees \"steadiness, reliability and purpose\" in China’s conduct at a time when multilateralism is under \"tremendous strain\". While Chong believes Xi’s visit has been “positive” in terms of soundbites and optics, especially for domestic audiences in Malaysia, China and ASEAN, he said it remains unclear how this might affect Malaysia’s tariff negotiations with the US. The Trump administration had imposed a 24 per cent reciprocal tariff rate on Malaysia before the reprieve, prompting Putrajaya to plan a diplomatic mission to Washington for later this month. Malaysia is the current rotating chair of ASEAN. Anwar had reiterated that the regional bloc will not impose retaliatory tariffs on China. However, ahead of Xi’s visit, Anwar himselfacknowledgedthat it would be difficult for ASEAN to maintain its centrality and a balance between the US and China. “How (Xi’s visit) changes the situation is less clear, including on how negotiations with the United States might work,” Chong said. “Moreover, there remain outstanding issues with China that remain unaddressed.” These include territorial disputes as well as a potential oversupply of Chinese goods to Southeast Asia as trade gets diverted away from the US, putting pressure on Southeast Asian economies and smaller businesses. “The extent to which China is able to provide a market for Southeast Asian goods given its low domestic demand and traditional use of Southeast Asian components in manufacturing exports to the United States, as well as Beijing’s ability to provide financing given its own economic headwinds were left undiscussed as well,” he added. As with Vietnam, Malaysia faces a “difficult act” of balancing its relations with both the US and China, Abdul Rahman said. “It has territorial disputes with China, but Beijing is a key trading partner,” he said. “Malaysia under Anwar has put up positive optics about China. But on the defence front, the Malaysians are building their capabilities in Sabah and Sarawak, facing the South China Sea.” Abdul Rahman said he would be interested to see how the two countries’ joint foreign and defence dialogue develops, as this signals China's push for closer defence relations with Malaysia. \"At this point, it is difficult to assess if these agreements may affect Malaysia's efforts to negotiate lower tariffs with the US, as Trump consistently gives out mixed signals on tariffs,” he added. Over in Cambodia, a government spokesperson said the country was betting on more financial and infrastructure development support from China ahead of Xi’s visit on Thursday. Cambodia, one of China’s staunchest allies in the region, was hit with a 49 per cent reciprocal US tariff, one of the highest rates globally and the highest in ASEAN, ahead of Laos (48 per cent) and Vietnam. A major exporter of clothing and footwear to the US, Phnom Penh has dangled lower import taxes on US products in efforts to stave off the tariffs. After touching down in Phnom Penh, Xi was greeted by King Norodom Sihamoni at the airport and a military welcome ceremony. Former Cambodian leader Hun Sen and his son Prime Minister Hun Manet later met Xi. Chinese state media Xinhua said Xi told Hun Sen that trade wars undermine the multilateral trading system and impact the world economic order. Hun Manet had earlier described Xi's visit as a display of the two countries' \"iron-clad\" friendship. Both sides signed 37 documents during Xi's visit, including on investment, trade and finance, Cambodia's government was reported as saying by Reuters, though Phnom Penh did not elaborate. Lowy Institute’s Abdul Rahman said he was not surprised to see “similar rhetoric” emerging from Xi’s Cambodia visit as in the first two countries he had visited, with “plenty of agreements” signed. But Abdul Rahman pointed out that China has ceased approving new loans to Cambodia since January 2024, amid concerns that the current Cambodian government under Hun Manet might be moving towards the US. “Xi may use this visit to reinforce the message that China is a reliable security and economic partner,” he said. Chong said the tone and optics of Cambodia’s reception towards Xi could be “amplified” given the close ties between Beijing and Phnom Penh. “That said, no one can be sure of whether or how Cambodia can effectively calibrate its ties with Washington and Beijing given the uncertainty in the United States and the highly negative tone between China and the United States at the moment,” he added. Analysts said that overall, the statements issued by the countries that hosted Xi have been relatively measured. “They don't want to obviously antagonise the US, because all of them have shown that initiative and the inclination to pursue negotiations over the eventual tariffs that will be imposed,” Harrison Cheng, director of global risk consultancy Control Risks’ Singapore office, told CNA’s Asia First television programme. “At the same time, they do want to show the US that they have options, right? They have friends in the region who can help them, albeit not immediately.” Adib from Viewfinder Global Affairs said this does not mean the countries are taking sides or becoming pro-China. “This is part of the process, part of the broader response to the Liberation Day tariffs,” he said, referring to Trump’s initial announcement of the reciprocal tariffs. Despite that, Chong cautioned that ASEAN has to \"recalibrate\" after benefitting from being middlemen in the US-China economic relationship. \"Holding on to existing positions when the underlying dynamics have changed may result in losses, some of them potentially significant. ASEAN and ASEAN member states may be facing that risk right now,” he said. “They may ultimately have to look at other options for cooperation and economic growth other than the United States and China, or end up looking like the investment bank Bear Stearns during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

    "title": "‘It might kill off the whole industry’: What’s at stake as US-China tariff war hits Southeast Asia",
    "article_text": "CNA Insider CNA Insider Even as Southeast Asia struggles with access to the US market, the region will be hit hard by a “tsunami of Chinese goods”, predict experts. The programme When Titans Clash quizzes thought leaders on US behaviour, China dumping and more. Pressure on textile companies in Indonesia is growing, as the United States’ tariffs and imports from China squeeze the industry on both sides. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR/JAKARTA: Amid rising tariffs under United States President Donald Trump, and their impact round the world, Singapore Institute of International Affairs chairman Simon Tay laments a “tragic story” that is unfolding in Southeast Asia. Tariffs of up to 271 per cent have already hit the solar industry in the region, where the manufacturers are almost all from China because of Chinese companies’ technological advantage. The US announced these anti-dumping tariffs on solar imports from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in November.The move had been in the making for months, and it meant a slowdown in the solar firms’ production until factories started closing. Jinko Solar, one of the largest solar manufacturers in China — and the world — shut down its Penang plant last year after spending US$800 million to build the facility in 2015. It had created more than 1,000 jobs and a multiplier effect on the local economy. Chinese solar companies Risen Energy and Longi Green Energy Technology Co have also scaled back operations in Malaysia. And as tariffs continue to expand under the Trump administration, Tay describes what is happening with solar panels as a “tragedy”. “The technology actually came from America. Chinese have learnt to do it more cheaply and (at) pretty high quality. And that’s been the formula … since the end of the Cold War,” he says. “America inventing, China learning how to produce … with other Asian countries more cheaply — that’s benefitted so many people. And … facing climate change, don’t you think the world would benefit from cheaper but good solar panels?” Instead, US policies are having a detrimental impact on Malaysians and others in the region. “It’s pretty bad,” says Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association president Davis Chong. “Some of the companies (had) just started to expand their Southeast Asian facilities, like (in) Malaysia, to capture the US market. “So (the tariffs) will impact Malaysia’s solar panel manufacturing industry a lot. It might kill off the whole industry.” Chinese solar manufacturers have also announced plant shutdowns in Vietnam and Thailand. And even as the US negotiates trade deals with dozens of countries amid its tariff pause announced last week, there is the issue of American tariffs on China and its impact on Southeast Asia. For example, about 25 per cent of Malaysia’s total exports go to China. So the escalating US-China tariff war pulls down Malaysian exports. WATCH: US-China tariff war — What will Southeast Asia's manufacturers stand to lose? (46:55) The programme When Titans Clash looks at what the region’s manufacturers stand to lose and how the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can weather the storm. In Malaysia, the new tariffs are set to adversely impact many industries, including textiles, furniture, rubber and plastics, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week. In the US, some politicians believe the tariffs will isolate China and block its use of third-party countries to ship cheap made-in-China products, including solar panels, to America. They say Chinese companies have been using ASEAN countries as a cover for some time now. But it is a political accusation and not a fair one, opines Chong, as local businesses and workers add value to the manufacturing process. “The silicon wafer (for solar cells) comes from China. Then you need to process it (for it) to become the final solar panel,” he says. “There are a lot of semiconductor processes needed. … A lot of test assembly manufacturing processes (and) source materials have already been localised.” There was a time when the US was a stronghold for solar module manufacturing, accounting for around a quarter of global solar module production in the early 2000s. But by 2010, Chinese manufacturers had gained comparative advantage globally. While the US has a huge trade deficit now, Tay says it is “false thinking” to expect to make America great again by bringing that number down. “But we need to assuage this by having China and other ASEAN countries (that) have a surplus with America start to figure out how (to) buy American goods? And they’ve been doing it for some time,” he says. “What else does America have to sell? And that’s where I think, fundamentally, (in) America, the CEOs have to look themselves in the face. How much have they hollowed out the industrial capacity of America?” What some countries such as Vietnam have suggested doing is to also reduce their tariff and non-tariff barriers in negotiating trade deals with the US. But Victor Gao, chairman of the China Energy Security Institute and vice president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, decries the use of tariffs as “an instrument of political power against other countries”. “Mankind, as a whole, needs to realise the real motivation of the United States,” he says. On the other hand, Southeast Asian economies are also being squeezed by Chinese exports. And with the US tariffs imposed on China, policy experts warn of more headwinds. “We’re about to be hit by a tsunami of Chinese goods for various reasons. One is the slowdown (in domestic demand) in China,” says former Indonesian trade minister Mari Pangestu, who is deputy chair of Indonesia’s National Economic Council. “More importantly, … the goods that were originally supposed to go to the US will have to find new markets. And the obvious markets are in this part of the world.” In Indonesia, the textile industry is already facing intense competition. According to Indonesian Fibre and Filament Yarn Producers Association estimates, 60 textile companies closed between 2023 and last year and as many as 250,000 workers were laid off. With other companies enforcing unpaid leave or reducing the number of working days or hours, the total number of workers affected could be 800,000, estimates the association’s chairman, Redma Gita Wirawasta. Even Indonesia’s largest textile company, Sri Rejeki Isman (Sritex), saw its fortunes decline. In 2020, it reached nearly US$1.3 billion in sales and posted a net profit of US$85 million. But this March, it ceased operations following bankruptcy, leaving about 10,700 workers jobless. “The problem with Sritex is almost the same with other companies, because the market is flooded by China fabrics,” says Redma, adding that the competition is not only in the domestic market but also the export market. “We know that some brands like Mango, Zara, Nike, Adidas, H&M … had to cut their production in Indonesia because they also have to compete with China products in US and also in Europe.” China is the world’s largest garment exporter, with its textile and garment shipments hitting US$301.1 billion last year. Textiles are not the only sector Indonesia worries about, however. China’s total exports last year rose to a record US$3.58 trillion. And its largest export market since 2023 has been ASEAN, with last year’s annual value reaching US$586.5 billion. Whether the goods are toys, homeware, party accessories or in the high-tech arenas of batteries and electric vehicles, China leads in these industries and more. It boasts of being the only country with industries across all categories in the United Nations industrial classification system — “a country with a complete industrial chain”, cites Wang Yiwei, the director of Renmin University of China’s Institute of International Affairs. “China can produce everything, from matches to rockets, from satellites to MSG (monosodium glutamate), from nuts to aircraft carriers. … Whatever China decides to produce, its price will become cheap as cabbages.” The increase in imports of all sorts of low-cost Chinese goods in Southeast Asia has been aided by Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Temu, Shein and Lazada, which is owned by Alibaba. And to manage the pressure on local manufacturers, countries are responding. Vietnam, for example, suspended the operations of Temu in December. Thailand, meanwhile, has identified 58 products including furniture as targets for anti-circumvention duties. It has already imposed a tariff on some steel products from China. The kingdom also introduced a 7 per cent value-added tax last July on imported goods below 1,500 baht (US$45). It led to a 20 per cent reduction in imports in this category, mostly from China, by December. Malaysia, too, is taking steps such as the enforcement of anti-dumping duties. And in Indonesia, the government has said it would look at imposing duties of up to 200 per cent on some Chinese imports, including textiles. Indonesia has also banned Temu for fear that small enterprises in Southeast Asia’s largest economy might be “destroyed”. Gao, however, hopes the region will not close the door on “highly efficient” e-commerce platforms. “I don’t think it’s worthwhile to pick a fight with the emerging technologies,” he says. “Maybe the better way is to understand the change in doing business … and embrace those platforms and applications that you may eventually choose with the purpose of increasing efficiency, … lowering the price for the consumers.” It is not just in Southeast Asia, however, where there are concerns about Chinese exports. Countries such as Brazil, Chile, India and Mexico have imposed anti-dumping penalties on some Chinese exports. What ASEAN can also do is “have a dialogue” with China to share the bloc’s worries and find solutions, suggests Mari, who recalls going through the same issue as trade minister during ASEAN-China Free Trade Area discussions previously. “The conclusion was, okay, we need to increase investments (from) China to produce here. So I still think that’s a valid argument,” she says. “Now we should come together as ASEAN.” With the US overtaking China, however, as ASEAN’s biggest export market last year — and with access to an increasingly protectionist America under threat — the bloc’s member states must also deal with Trump’s tariffs. A proactive approach is needed here too, says former Malaysian deputy minister of international trade and industry Ong Kian Ming. “This would entail Malaysia … preparing certain value propositions that we can put forth to the Trump administration. “For example, … Malaysia can be a good player in the critical mineral supply chain,” he cites. “We already have a critical minerals processing plant in Lynas. We should be, I think, open to more investments in this area.” Several countries in the region have rare earth deposits and have said they are open to investments in this space from all countries. China, meanwhile, placed export restrictions on seven categories of rare earths — much needed for defence and technology — as part of its response to US tariffs this month. Countries like Indonesia are also trying to deepen their other trade relations. Discussions on the Indonesia-European Union Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, for instance, are ongoing. “This is a very important part of our strategy — to do trade diversification, especially with the Europeans,” says Septian Hario Seto, executive secretary of Indonesia’s National Economic Council and former deputy minister of investment and mining coordination. His colleague Mari thinks Indonesia is resilient enough to navigate the external headwinds. “We have the domestic market as the base for our growth,” she says. “And if we can use our domestic resources to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of Indonesia and create jobs, I think we’ll still be able to grow at 5 per cent (this year).” Ong is also “cautiously optimistic” about Malaysia and the region’s growth trajectories. “What’s happening in the US may give even more reason for global companies … to invest in ASEAN because of our stability, because of our growing domestic markets, because of our increasing income per capita,” he cites. Regional integration, rather than “Trumpian views”, must take hold more deeply, stresses Tay. “(ASEAN countries) have got to work with willing partners who see the same thing, … who are facing certain dilemmas as well,” he says. “ASEAN has swum with the tide. When globalisation was strong, … ASEAN moved fast. We’re now swimming against the tide, but we’ve got to keep swimming.” Watch this episode ofWhen Titans Clash here.

    "title": "Commentary: As US and China dig in on tariffs, this is no longer just a trade war",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary While Donald Trump threatens more tariffs and Xi Jinping turns on the charm, Southeast Asian nations will have to navigate between the two while preserving as much autonomy as possible, says Enodo Economics’ Diana Choyleva. This audio is generated by an AI tool. LONDON: If theUS-China trade warhas become a big game of chicken, who will be the first one to blink? As the dust settles on the latest round of tariff salvos between the world's two largest economies, one thing is clear for everyone else: This all-out economic confrontation will rapidly force countries to choose their economic allegiance. Beijing's response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs has been swift and pointed. After several tit-for-tat retaliations – bringingUS duties on Chinese goods to a staggering 145 per centandChinese tariffs on US imports to 125 per cent– China said it would ignore further hikes in a “numbers game” that “will become a joke\". Don’t count on China blinking first. Beijing sees no reason to mollify the US. For President Xi Jinping, there was always only one politically viable response to Mr Trump's provocations: strength. Having already surprised domestic audiences with a forceful initial reciprocal tariff, any appearance of backing down would be politically untenable. Yet Beijing's response suggests strategic patience rather than reckless escalation. Chinese leadership appears prepared to endure the economic confrontation, confident that mounting domestic pressure within the US will eventually force the Trump administration to the negotiating table on terms more favourable to China. This patient approach aligns with traditional Chinese strategic thinking. By allowing economic gravity to do the work as American consumers and businesses absorb the inflationary shock, Beijing can project strength while exercising relative restraint. The question is whether China can afford this strategy given its current economic challenges. Despite grappling with significant headwinds – overinvestment, excessive debt levels, and persistently weak domestic demand – China enters this trade confrontation with multiple structural advantages that strengthen its position. First, Beijing enjoys considerable political stability compared to Washington. While Mr Trump confronts the constraints of democratic politics and election cycles, China’s Communist Party operates without such limitations. This gives Chinese leadership the ability to weather short-term economic pain for long-term strategic gain. Second, China's centralised governance allows for coordinated deployment of all available policy tools. Unlike the fragmented American system where monetary policy remains independent from fiscal decisions, Chinese leadership can simultaneously pull all economic and financial levers. Beijing possesses substantially greater fiscal headroom and monetary flexibility to cushion trade impacts. Most importantly, China has deliberately kept substantial monetary and fiscal reserves dry in anticipation of this exact scenario – and is now poised to deploy them aggressively. The People's Bank of China is expected to implement multiple reserve requirement ratio cuts alongside targeted credit easing measures, while fiscal authorities will front-load planned expenditures with particular emphasis on employment support for the export sector. Far from dooming China to a middle-income trap, this trade war may actually accelerate Beijing's planned economic pivot toward domestic consumption. The party’s flagship newspaper People's Daily has already framed this crisis as a strategic opportunity to establish \"domestic demand as a long-term strategy\" with \"consumption as the main engine and stabiliser of economic growth\". For the United States, the immediate economic calculus appears far less favourable. Mr Trump's aggressive implementation timeline creates significant inflation risks that directly contradict his campaign pledges to lower prices for American consumers. His administration's intent remains clear. Washington appears determined to seal off alternative routes for Chinese goods entering the US market. Even with the current pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, the inflation risk remains genuine. If Chinese goods cannot be effectively rerouted through third countries as they were previously, US consumers will inevitably face price increases across household goods, electronics and apparel. Moreover, the way Mr Trump has framed bilateral trade flows solely in terms of volume ignores another crucial aspect – the asymmetry in the types of goods traded between US and China. Chinese imports from America predominantly consist of manufacturing inputs and equipment, insulating Chinese citizens from immediate price shocks. But American households will directly bear the burden of higher prices on everyday consumer products imported from China. More immediate and visible economic pain for Mr Trump's electorate will potentially undermine political support for continued confrontation. His recent decision to exempt smartphones and other consumer electronics from the steepest reciprocal tariffs reflects this. What we are witnessing is not merely a trade dispute but the acceleration of global economic bifurcation – a process that was already underway but has now shifted into overdrive. The Trump administration reportedly plans to put pressure on trading partners to curb trade with China in exchange for tariff concessions. This new reality is particularly stark for Southeast Asian nations caught in the crossfire. Having prospered by straddling both economic spheres, countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia now face pressure to choose between continued access to American consumers or maintaining deep integration with Chinese supply chains. Mr Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week was planned long before the tariffs were announced, but his charm offensive has now taken on a new sense of urgency. While all three countries will continue trying to hedge between the US and China, each faces distinct pressures.Geographical proximity and economic dependence give China clear leverage, but strategic alignment remains complex. Vietnam harbours deep historical distrust toward China, yet may ultimately lean toward Beijing given economic interdependence. Cambodia, though increasingly wary of overreliance on China, remains closely tied to it.Malaysia, meanwhile, could tilt toward the US, shaped in part by domestic sensitivities around its ethnic Chinese minority and a desire to balance external influence. Despite their differences, none of these states will choose sides lightly. But when forced, the alignments may not be where they first appear, especially as China steps up its charm offensive while the US under a more confrontational Trump makes it harder to win regional trust. In this emerging economic landscape, between the two poles stand critical swing players like the European Union and India, whose ultimate alignment will substantially shape the new order. The EU appears to be hedging its bets with increasing sophistication. China-EU trade negotiations have restarted \"with a strong top leadership push\". For China, the EU represents a critical counterbalance to US economic pressure. For the EU, deeper engagement with China offers leverage in negotiations with Washington while potentially securing concessions on market access. India, with its massive market and growing manufacturing base, is making calculated moves that reveal its complex position in the emerging bifurcation. Senior Indian officials have adopted a conciliatory tone towards the US, yet this eagerness for a US trade deal appears more political than economic: India's exports to the US represent just 3 per cent of gross domestic product, making it relatively insulated from tariff impacts. The imperative for countries, companies and investors is clear: understand which bloc offers the best strategic fit, or develop sophisticated strategies to operate across an increasingly divided global economy. For Singapore and other Southeast Asian nations, the challenge will be particularly acute: navigate between these competing economic spheres while preserving as much autonomy as possible. The trade war has moved beyond simple economic competition into a fundamental restructuring of the global economic order. Those who recognise and adapt to this new reality of a bifurcated global economy will be best positioned to thrive in the challenging years ahead.

    "title": "Commentary: Is the Russian air force coming to Indonesia?",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Indonesia says Russia isn't seeking an air base in Papua - but that doesn't discount Moscow's clear strategic interest in pursuing the idea, says this defence and security expert. SINGAPORE: The story lasted barely a day but caused outrage in Australia and prompted a quick denial from Indonesia. On Apr 14, the respected defence analysis company Janes claimed that Russia had asked Indonesia for access to the Manuhau Air Base on Biak Island in Papua. But when the rattled Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles sought clarification from Jakarta, his Indonesian counterpart, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin,insisted the report was untrue. But did the story have any truth to it? Why would Russia want access to an air base so far from home? And would Indonesia have given it serious consideration, and, if so, why? Taking into account Russia’s strategic interests, the story was at least somewhat plausible. The tiny Papuan island has been on Russia’s radar for nearly two decades. In 2006, Moscow proposed establishing a commercial satellite launch facility on Biak using heavy-lift Russian aircraft. That proposal fell through due to problems over the transfer of missile technology to Indonesia and opposition from the island’s inhabitants. But in 2017, two nuclear-capable Tu-95 strategic bombers from the Russian air force refuelled at Manuhau Air Base before conducting an air patrol over the South Pacific. At the time, it was unclear why Jakarta had agreed to host the aircraft but it seemed to be a one-off. If the Janes report is true, however, it would appear that Russia is intent on securing regular access to the air base. After all, Biak occupies a strategic location, only 1,400 km from the Australian city of Darwin and 4,000 km from Perth. In addition, the US territory of Guam is just 1,900 km away. All would be within range of Russian surveillance aircraft operating from Biak. As Russia views America as its primary strategic rival, it has an intense interest in monitoring military activities in these three locations. The United States has a significant rotational military presence in Darwin. Guam is home to major US air and naval bases. And Perth will host US and British nuclear-powered submarines from 2027 as part of the AUKUS agreement, which Russia opposes. For Indonesia, however, the story seemed much less plausible. Since independence in 1945, Indonesia has regarded the presence of foreign military forces as incompatible with the country’s non-aligned status and “independent and active” foreign policy. Multi-ethnic Indonesia is also very sensitive about perceived foreign support for separatist movements in the country, including in Papua, which still has an active separatist movement. When Australian-led forces intervened to stabilise Indonesian-occupied East Timor in 1998, it triggered a near-existential crisis in Jakarta. Six years later, and with feelings over that incident still raw, Indonesia initially hesitated to allow foreign military forces into independence-leaning Aceh to provide humanitarian assistance in the wake of the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami, though ultimately it did so. Indonesia’s sensitivities over sovereignty, and its opposition to separatist movements, led it to vote in favour of resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly which condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Moscow’s support for separatism in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine. A Russian military presence at Biak would also damage Indonesia’s strategic ties with the United States and especially neighbouring Australia. When the Janes story broke, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese immediately declared, “We obviously do not want to see Russian influence in our region, very clearly”, and emphasised Australia’s opposition to Russian aggression against Ukraine. From Indonesia’s standpoint, the idea of a Russian military presence in Papua was not very plausible. But that does not make it impossible. Indonesia’s Constitution does not explicitly forbid foreign forces from being stationed in the country, and during the Sukarno era, when defence ties between Indonesia and the USSR were tight, there were plenty of Soviet military advisers in the country. President Prabowo Subianto has a tendency to make snap decisions, some of which have been criticised for contravening the country’s non-aligned policy (his 2022 Ukraine peace plan) and undermining the country’s sovereignty (a 2024 joint communique with China which made Indonesia a party to the South China Sea dispute). Moreover, Prabowo is keen to strengthen bilateral relations with Russia, including defence ties. As defence minister and president-elect, Prabowo visited Russia four times, most recently in July 2024. In February 2025, Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s former defence minister and now secretary of the Russian security council, visited Jakarta. According to Janes, it was either at that meeting, or shortly thereafter, that Russia made the request to use the air base on Biak Island. Intriguingly, there could also be a link between the 2017 visit by Russian strategic bombers to Biak and the recent Janes story. As noted, it was unclear why Indonesia had agreed to host the refuelling mission. At the time, however, Indonesia and Russia were negotiating the sale of 11 Su-35 fighter aircraft for US$1.14 billion. As part of that deal, Russia may have requested access to Manuhau Air Base (Russia has a similar agreement with Vietnam for naval and air deployments to Cam Ranh Bay). The Su-35 deal was signed in 2018 but collapsed three years later, allegedly due to the threat of US sanctions. But under Prabowo, the procurement of Russian fighter aircraft may now be back on the table. Did Moscow push the envelope by offering Indonesia a discount on the aircraft in return for landing rights on Biak? At the end of the day, due to sovereignty concerns and Indonesia’s foreign policy principles, it was always unlikely that Indonesia would agree to Russia’s request. But stranger things have happened.

    "title": "Commentary: A US brain drain doesn’t benefit anyone",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary What Europe may gain in attracting American talent is far outweighed by the overall cost to science and innovation, say Bloomberg Opinion’s Lara Williams and Mark Gongloff. Researcher Kim Gruver looks at tissue samples in the electron microscopy lab at the Allen Institute in Seattle, US, in this photograph released on Apr 9, 2025. Allen Institute/Handout via REUTERS LONDON: Just before Albert Einstein departed for America from Britain, where he’d sought refuge from Nazi persecution, he attended a meeting intended to raise funds for academic refugees from Germany. There, he stated that without the intellectual and individual freedoms fought for by his European ancestors, “there would have been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, no Newton, no Faraday, no Pasteur and no Lister”. Almost a century later, it seems that the United States may have forgotten this vital truth. There’s a growing chance that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate attacks on science will prompt the kind of brain drain that’s affected Russia and other places in the grips of authoritarian regimes. Such an exodus would have global implications and undermine one of America’s great strengths. The US government’s aggression has targeted disciplines ranging from climate studies to biomedical research. Thousands of experts have been fired from government agencies and cash-starved universities; research proposals with language that an AI algorithm or an Elon Musk associate working for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) might mistake for “woke,” including those featuring words such as “water quality” and “women,” are being rejected. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is rounding up researchers with green cards or visas on the flimsiest pretences. “The biggest factor here is simply the raw uncertainty of it all,” says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School. “If you’re a natural scientist with massive labs and post-docs and pre-docs and research assistants, and all your funding depends on one government agency that may be in the crosshairs of DOGE, that uncertainty is even larger.” Parts of Europe are already stepping up to take in those affected by the assault. Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), a research university in Belgium, has established a dedicated contact point for American researchers looking to continue their work abroad, and it’s opening 12 postdoctoral positions for international scholars; Aix-Marseille University (AMU) has launched a €15 million (US$20 million) Safe Place For Science programme, which will support 15 American scientists. Eric Berton, president of AMU, said that by the Mar 31 deadline he’d had received about 300 applications – and more have come in since. Similar programmes are being replicated across the continent, and the European Commission has increased the financial support offered by the European Research Council, a public body that funds scientific enquiry within the bloc, for relocating scholars. It’s also working on other ways to enhance the bloc’s attractiveness such as special visas for top talent and a system to help governments and universities pool resources to support incoming scientists. Berton is concerned, though, that support doesn’t yet match the scale of the problem, with universities waiting on decisions and funding from the Commission or their respective national authorities. The AMU is using money from its own coffers to fund its programme because he views the situation as an emergency. International mobility is fairly normal among researchers, especially early in their careers, and is typically viewed as a positive for science by helping to foster innovation and scientific discovery. But both VUB and AMU are seeing an unusually high number of senior scientists reaching out about opportunities. These late-career scholars are typically less mobile – for personal and professional reasons – so it’s notable that they, too, are considering quitting the US. Moreover, it’s not just potential departees; Mette Morsing, director of Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment, says there’s also been an uptick of scientists who would have sought visas to attend prestigious American universities and research institutions instead turning to Europe. A scientific exodus would leave scars that will last for decades; Einstein, for example, never returned to Europe. If the US’ best brains depart in droves, there’ll be fewer scientists at all experience levels to develop future generations – fewer tenured professors to train PhDs, fewer PhDs to train postgraduates, fewer postgraduates to train grad students, and so on down the pipeline. We’ve seen this movie before; following lower-intensity attacks on climate science during the presidency of George W Bush and Donald Trump’s first term, many young scientists chose other fields, according to Kevin Trenberth, who worked at the National Center for Atmospheric Research for 36 years and has been a lead author of several reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “You can see already that, instead of a steady flow of people into the field, there’s a hole,” Trenberth said in a phone call from his home nation of New Zealand, to which he returned in 2020 – with no plans to return to the US. “As people like myself are retiring, you would expect to see new people stepping up and taking over leadership positions, and those people aren’t there. And now it’s going to be a lot worse.” Even before this brain drain had begun, the Trump administration has already done lasting damage to a scientific capacity built up over decades and with mountains of tax dollars. Those investments were repaid many times over in a healthy population, world-leading technological innovation and a booming economy. Without that capacity, the US will fall behind the rest of the world in all of those areas, noted a recent open letter signed by nearly 2,000 scientists. AMU’s Berton is emphatic about his motivation. While European institutions stand to benefit from an influx of fresh talent, he’s focused on the broader view and a need to defend long-standing values of academic freedom and international collaboration. Universities should be nonpartisan institutions that gather evidence, generate data and further our collective knowledge. Supporting US scientists is necessary to cushion the blow to science, rather than an opportunity to poach the brightest and best. Science also benefits from diverse voices and experience. The biodiversity and climate crises, for example. look different depending on where in the world you are – centring research in just one region or omitting an entire nation’s observations will have profound impacts on how we understand the world. Worse – as much as it pains middle-aged scientists and columnists to admit – many of the best scientific innovations come from younger generations. Their brains haven’t yet been tainted by age or cynicism, and they’re motivated by a need for jobs, money and recognition to make their mark. Diamonds are formed in such conditions. “Every 10 years we have jumps forward, because we have pressure on people who have the capacity to respond to it,” said Daniel Sandweiss, a professor of anthropology and climate at the University of Maine. “My grad students are better trained and smarter than I am. That’s where the hope is.” By terrorising a generation of young scientists, Trump is extinguishing that hope. Without academic freedom, we run the risk of missing out on the next generation of Edisons, Feynmans, Sagans, Rubins and Doudnas. That wouldn’t just hurt America – it’d be a loss for the whole world.

    "title": "Fed proposes averaging large bank stress test results to reduce volatility",
    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: The Federal Reserve building is seen in Washington, U.S., January 26, 2022. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo WASHINGTON :     The Federal Reserve kicked off a sweeping effort to overhaul its annual stress tests of large banks on Thursday, proposing to average results over two years in setting capital requirements. The central bank also proposed giving banks three more months to adjust to the capital requirements set by the exam, as part of its overarching bid to make the process more transparent and less volatile. Under the proposal, banks receiving test results in June would have until January to adjust capital plans, as opposed to the current October deadline. In addition, the Fed said it was streamlining the data it collects from banks under the process, but noted that none of the changes are designed to significantly change the capital requirements banks face. The Fed announced in December that, following several court rulings curtailing regulatory authority, it would begin making several changes to the annual exams of big bank health. The industry has griped for years the tests, which set the so-called \"stress capital buffer\" for large banks, are opaque and subjective. More changes to the stress tests will be coming later this year, as the Fed said it planned to propose allowing the public to see and comment on the models and hypothetical scenarios it applies to the test each year, a longtime industry priority. The changes were opposed by Fed Governor Michael Barr, who served as the Fed's top regulatory official until he stepped down from that post in February. In a statement, he warned the changes, and others in the works, risked turning the tests into an \"ossified exercise that will provide false comfort in the resilience of the system.\" Specifically, he said opening up the tests to public comment not only could give banks a chance to whittle away at stricter aspects of the exam, but also allow them to maximize results by identifying areas that may underestimate risk. And the process of requiring the Fed to regularly solicit and incorporate feedback could make the tests less dynamic, as Fed staff have less time to build ways to measure different types of risk. Separately, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler voted in favor of the proposal, but expressed concern about relying equally on financial statements submitted by banks over a year ago with more recent figures. She said she would welcome feedback on whether to place more emphasis on fresher numbers to be more sensitive to current economic conditions.

    "title": "Bilbao beat Rangers 2-0 to reach Europa League last four",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport BILBAO, Spain :Athletic Bilbao advanced to the Europa League semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Rangers in their quarter-final second leg on Thursday, winning by the same score on aggregate to keep alive their dream of reaching the final at their San Mames stadium. After the sides drew 0-0 at Ibrox in the first leg, there was a fast, intense start to the return game, with Rangers looking unintimidated by the raucous atmosphere at the San Mames, where a record crowd of 52,114 was in attendance. Bilbao had an early chance, with Nico Williams's mazy run from the wing ending with a save from keeper Liam Kelly and Oihan Sancet's rebound effort was charged down by James Tavernier. Rangers forward Cyriel Dessers appealed in vain for a penalty after having his jersey pulled in the area, his ripped shirt proof of contact, and he was booked shortly afterwards for complaining when sent to change his jersey. Maroan Sannadi missed the target from the edge of the six-yard box as Bilbao began to gain the upper hand, but lacked precision when reaching the Rangers area. Alex Berenguer curled a shot just wide of the upright and Sancet controlled a pass on his chest before firing high over the bar from close range, but the Bilbao midfielder soon broke the deadlock. John Souttar was penalised for a foul on Sannadi in the box and Sancet converted from the spot in added time before the break. Rangers keeper Kelly had saved Berenguer's penalty in the first leg but was sent the wrong way this time. \"First half we were a shadow of ourselves. We let the occasion get to us,\" Rangers captain Tavernier told TNT Sports. The second half began with Bilbao looking intent on grabbing a second goal but it was Rangers who came closest with Nicolas Raskin hitting the upright from close range. Rangers grew in confidence, putting the hosts under a lot more pressure than they managed in the opening half but unable to find an equaliser and they were punished 10 minutes from time. Oscar de Marcos floated a cross into the box and Williams lost his marker at the back post to head past Kelly and the final minutes were played out in a party atmosphere as the sea of red-and-white celebrated in the stands. \"San Mames deserves it more than anyone else and once again closer to the final,\" Williams told Movistar Plus. \"Rangers made things very difficult for us and very happy for the pass to the final. Low profile and keep going.\" Bilbao, who ended a 40-year trophy drought by winning the Copa del Rey last season, are looking to win a first European title, and will face Manchester United, who beat Olympique Lyonnais 7-6 on aggregate, in the last four.

    "title": "The Best Time to Eat Breakfast? It’s Not Right When You Wake Up",
    "article_text": "People love to debate thetiming of dinner, but no meal drums up divergent opinions quite likebreakfast. The popular thinking pushed by cereal companies calls breakfast “the most important meal of the day.” And yet, millions of people skip it entirely, and subside offcoffeeuntillunch. Should we be eating breakfast at all? If so,whatshould we be eating? And what, from a health perspective, is the besttimeto eat breakfast? Nutrition experts generally agree that you shouldn’t be scarfing down food as soon as you wake up—wait a couple of hours, at least, until mid-morning. There are a few reasons for this. One is that it extends your overnight fasting window and “gives your gut a little bit more of a rest,” says Rupy Aujla, a doctor who produces podcasts and cookbooks asThe Doctor’s Kitchen. Time-restricted eating—waiting at least 12 hours between the last food you eat one day and the first food you eat the next—makes the body burn fat rather than carbs and is associated withweight lossand general good metabolic health. When you first wake up, says Aujla, you should be much more focused onrehydrating with water, because “your kidney’s been working overtime” during the night. He puts a bit of salt in his water for that purpose, and doesn’t eat any proper food until around 9 or 10 am. Many people simply aren’t hungry first thing in the morning. This, saysAdam Collins, associate professor of nutrition at the University of Surrey, is because your body “has already started to export glucose out into the blood in readiness for you to wake up. You’ve already got some energy in the system.” The problem with traditional,carb-heavybreakfast foods, like cereal, toast and pastries, is that they give you “a lovely glucose spike that fuels your cells, and then you have a corresponding crash,” says Aujla. “You’re hungry [again] by mid-morning, and need coffee and other stimulants to keep yourself focused and up and running until lunchtime.” Instead, he recommends a meal high in protein andfiber—partly because we often generally skimp on protein, which we need for “longevity,” and partly because protein and fiber keep us energetic and satiated through the morning. Aujla has a few go-to breakfasts along these lines. During the week, he relies onovernight oatsthat go easy on the actual oats. “I have two tablespoons of oats, two tablespoons of milled flax seed, one tablespoon of chia and one tablespoon of hemp seeds,” he says. “Then I’ll add grated apple, some pumpkin seeds, a bit of protein powder, and then water or coconut milk or whatever. You’re matching those oats, that are quite carbohydrate rich, with [things that are] fiber and protein rich.” When he has more preparation time, he has scrambled eggs or tofu on properly seeded bread (“not like a supermarket bread that’s actually quite carb rich”), or shakshuka with lentils and avocado. He also recommends leaning into savory foods, or simply having leftovers for breakfast. “I’ll quite happily have last night’s salmon withsweet potato, [a] bit of greens, and maybe some salad leaves,” he says. “Most of our breakfast food is antithetical to what we would have been eating as hunter gatherers—we’d just be having savory foods the whole time.” There’s no need to load up with a massive meal. It’s your first of the day, so you need to ease into eating anyway, and most importantly, he says, “it needs to have the right nutrients.” But back to the more fundamental question: do you need breakfast at all? For many, the meal is no more than a distant memory, especially on weekdays. There is an association, says Collins, between skipping breakfast andobesity, although that’s most likely due to overweight people trying to eat less by cutting out a meal. A late-morning, protein-and-fiber-packed breakfast is generally a good idea, but it might just be too logistically inconvenient. Don’t stress if you generally miss breakfast completely, he says–—ust make sure you compensate, nutrition-wise, with your other meals, and don’t overcompensate by overeating later in the day. “Maybe there’s some something to be said aboutbrunch,” he adds. Maybe so—what’s the difference between a late, savory breakfast and brunch, anyway? This article originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "20 Best Body Wash for Men 2025: Lather Up Like a Pro",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Whether you’re on the hunt for thebest bar soapsor the best body wash for men, it really is just a matter of preference. Both use the same key ingredients to cleanse, nourish, and refresh skin. And when it comes to the best way to scrub-a-dub-dub, you need to find one that agrees with your skin’s needs and variables. Skin variables include sensitivity,acne,dryness,oiliness, and evenbody odor. And a high-quality body wash will honor those variables without disrupting the skin’s barrier functions. The skin needs this barrier in order to trap moisture and maintain softness, and if it’s compromised, you’ll know it via redness, itching, dehydration, or cracking. This could mean finding a body wash that has specific and targeted active ingredients—or simply choosing one that lacks any bad-for-you ingredients. Read on forGQ’s picks for the best men’s body wash across various needs and budgets. Wonder Valley Amazon Wonder Valley Revolve Key Ingredients:A mixture of (mostly) natural ingredients, extracts, and oils that soothe, hydrate, protect, and cleanse.Scent:Japanese hinoki, cedarwood, and Siberian fir make for a universally appealing woodsy aroma What makes the best overall body wash? While there’s no one-size-suds-all solution, Wonder Valley can claim the crown for most guys. A multitasker that cleanses, hydrates,andsupports your skin’s microbiome? Check. Suitable for all skin types? Check. Stylish, sustainable aluminum packaging? Check. A silky yet viscous formula? Check. Free from parabens, phthalates, sulfates, or artificial dyes? Check—you get the idea. Wonder Valley keeps it simple yet effective with a focus on key natural ingredients: willow bark, an antioxidant emollient that hydrates and improves skin tone; ashwagandha, which boosts collagen production; aloe vera to soothe; and Wonder Valley’s own California extra virgin olive oil for hydration and antioxidant benefits. The result? An exceptional cleansing lather paired with a subtle, woody, balsamic, citrus fragrance. All of this comes in a chic container that adds some indie style to your tub. Wonder Valley proves that the niche grooming movement is not going anywhere—it is only expanding with fantastic products, like this body wash, that are natural, effective, and darn cool. Sachajuan Amazon Key Ingredients:Earth Silk Technology (a.k.a. Oat Beta Glucan) stimulates collagen and reduces the appearance of wrinkles. Oh, and it majorly softens and hydrates. Scent:An earthy and artisanal Lavender softened by vanilla and tonka bean While proprietary tech in grooming products can sometimes feel like a gimmick, Sachajuan’s Earthen Silk Tech’s proof is in the pudding. Given the brand’s cult-favorite roots in haircare, it’s no surprise their body washes also leave your skin silky smooth. At the heart of their Earth Silk Technology is oat beta-glucan—a soothing and softening ingredient derived from Scandinavian-grown oats (the Swedes know their skin care). These soluble oat fibers penetrate deep into the skin, giving some serious hydration you can feel. The gel lathers beautifully, and while there are plenty of body washes that soften skin, this one stands out. After showering, my skin felt extra smooth for most of the day. As for the scents, an intoxicatingly good lavender blend with vanilla, musk, and tonka bean adds a layer of calm to an already soothing experience. Malin+Goetz Malin+Goetz Key Ingredients:A physical (pumice) and chemical (acids) exfoliator and various antioxidants and niacinamide for hydration and skin tone.Scent:Minty green, apothecary-esque, and invigorating eucalyptus Exfoliation is a must once or twice a week to slough off dead skin cells and keep your skin fresh and healthy. Some folks prefer chemical exfoliants, like glycolic or lactic acids, which dissolve dead cells for easy removal, while others prefer the physical slough of granule scrubs and particles. But why choose? Malin+Goetz’s new eucalyptus hand + body scrub offers the best of both. Its alpha hydroxy acid blend (lactic and mandelic acids) brightens and exfoliates, while pumice—a mineral-based physical exfoliant—smooths, resurfaces, and clears away dirt and dead skin. Toss in niacinamide, vitamins, and antioxidants to brighten and soothe, and you’ve got a cleansing, skin-rejuvenating powerhouse. It’s both a scrubber and latherer, and true to Malin + Goetz form, the eucalyptus scent is an herbaceous artisanal aroma. Bonus: it doubles as a hand scrub. Win, win. Saltair Saltair Key Ingredients:Lots of good stuff. Coconut water and an oil complex moisturize and soften while hyaluronic acid and niacinamide hydrate and strengthen. Scent:Unscented, of course. Founded by model Iskra Lawrence in 2022, Saltair champions inclusivity and affordability without compromising quality. Honestly, the brand could charge far more for what you're getting—but that's the point: Making luxury accessible for everyone, and we're all for it. Saltair's body washes come in a striking range of vibrant colors that reflect their scents, all housed in hefty, sustainable aluminum pumps that feel satisfyingly substantial. But our top pick? The unscented option. Great for sensitive or easily irritated skin, it feels anything but basic with a minimalist, luxe vibe that’s indulgent in its simplicity. True to the brand's ethos, the formula leans on natural powerhouse ingredients: Saltair's coconut water and a fermented oil complex to leave skin silky-soft, plus skin care standards like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide to hydrate and even skin tone. Dove Men+Care Amazon Key Ingredients:Glycerin retains moisture, and antioxidant-rich Gardenia Florida fruit extract, known for its anti-inflammatory benefits, soothes dry skin.Scent:A walk in the woods with some verdant eucalyptus nearby. I fully get that \"best pump design\" might seem like an odd category for a body wash list, but hear me out: Among the many things I love about Dove Men+Care Body Wash, its longevity stands out—except it skips the bulk-store vibes and looks downright practical by your tub. The pump is easy to dispense mid-shower without awkwardly picking it up (it is larger), and it lastsforever. I've been a fan of Dove Men+Care for years because they blend science-backed ingredients with natural elements, creating accessible men's grooming staples that are simple, effective, and available in most places. This body wash delivers as a no-fuss, everyday cleaner infused with a few essential oils for good measure. My skin felt clean, fresh, and soft after cleansing with this. Oh, and the eucalyptus-cedar is an olfactory upgrade from the usual options at this price point. Soft Services Soft Services Key Ingredients:A hefty dose (25%) of glycerin provides serious moisture and hydration.Scent:Fragrance-free, because if you shower often, too much fragrance will irritate your skin. Most of us don’t shower more than once daily, but sometimes life (or a solid workout) calls for a second rinse. The downside? Frequent showering can wreak havoc on your skin, especially if you’re using body washes that strip away essential oils. The Soft Services Comfort Cleanse is a hydrating cleanser that is gentle on your skin during extra shower time, even if your water bill takes a hit. Specifically designed for daily use, it features a hefty dose of glycerin to lock in moisture and protect your skin barrier while its water-oil texture binds to surface grime, cleansing without scrubbing. Instead of a lather overload, it transforms into a soft, silky foam. Bonus: Its slick formula doubles as an in-shower shaving cream, making it perfect for multitaskers. Flamingo Estate Flamingo Estate Key Ingredients:Oil, and more oil—six times the amount of essential oils than usual for a seriously luxe, hydrating wash. Plus, of course, ingredients hand-picked from their renowned garden.Scent:You can smell the morning dew on the leaves of their garden estate—awakening, herbaceous, and verdant. Flamingo Estate is enjoying a well-earned moment in the spotlight—and it’s likely here to stay. Best known for its coveted olive oils, this apothecary-inspired brand has expanded into luxurious hand washes, candles, and, naturally, a stellar aromatic body wash. Picture a farm-to-table restaurant owned by a niche perfumer and grooming expert concocting this formula, and you’ll get the vibe. True to its roots, this cleanser is crafted with nourishing oils like olive and babassu and thickened with natural sea salt for a honey-like texture. Available in various scents, each evoking the estate’s garden, the rosemary and clary sage blend is herbaceous and transportive, like showering amongst lush greenery. While lab-formulated luxury has its place, Flamingo Estate celebrates the gifts of Mother Earth—and it’s hard to imagine a more indulgent (and fittingly aromatic) upgrade to your body-wash lineup. Jack Black Amazon Key Ingredients:Aloe vera calms and glycerin hydrates, but Pro Vitamin B5 is that star here as it moisturizes, softens, and soothes your hair follicles.Scent:A pretty complex fragrance pyramid, but if spicy, herbal, and woodsy notes had an aromatherapeutic Spa gathering, it might smell like this. Even the least grooming-savvy among us might approach a 2-in-1 body wash and shampoo with a bit of skepticism. But some of these multitaskers have shed their stigma with newer formulas—including ambitious 3-in-1s (yes, even for your face). For our money, Jack Black delivers the goods with its JackZen wash, packaged in the brand’s signature cobalt blue that’s come a long way since its breakoutlip balms. The sudsy lather is bolstered by skin-soothing aloe vera and moisturizing glycerin, but the real standout is Pro-Vitamin B5, which provides lightweight hydration to leave hair soft and smooth—impressive for a 2-in-1. While these aren’t a substitute for a full grooming routine (they can sometimes dry hair or lack targeted follicular care), JackZen is great for travel or time-crunched mornings. Plus, its aromatic scent—a mix of cardamom, bamboo, clary sage, and patchouli—elevates your shower into a ritual that might even rival your cologne. Bathing Culture Revolve Key Ingredients:All natural stalwarts: aloe vera soothes, shea butter softens, olive oil moisturizes. Scent:All three scents are stellar, but Cathedral Grove smells like bathing in a redwood forest. Bathing Culture isn't just our select for the most eco-friendly body wash—it's also the cool kid on the body wash block. Other brands here boast elevated, chic packaging that leaves the plastic banality of body wash past in the dust, but Bathing Culture's niche, artisanal vibe really shines. Their pop-art refillable glass bottles add style to your tub, and they're designed to last—you can get gallon refills to cut down on waste. The soap feels refreshingly natural with hydrating and soothing plant-based ingredients like aloe, shea butter, and olive oil. You won't find synthetic fragrances here; the aromas blend 10+ essential oils and extracts into perfume-grade creations. My favorite, Cathedral Grove, captures the essence of a foggy redwood forest with lush undergrowth and a subtle oceanic tinge. If eco-friendly, effective, and hip could coexist in a body wash, Bathing Culture would be it. Salt & Stone Salt & Stone Key Ingredients:Heavy hitters like niacinamide for skin support, hyaluronic acid for hydration, blueberry extract and vitamin C to fight aging, and orobiotics to balance your microbiome.Scent:Four intoxicating aromas that a luxe indie perfumer would approve of. Salt & Stone has earned its place as a stand-out grooming brand synonymous with incredible scents. Their deodorants feel more like high-end colognes, complete with top, heart, and base notes. And the body washes? Downright addictive. Each is a sensory experience so fragrant and perfectly balanced that you might skip cologne that day. Case in point: the Santal and Vetiver wash leaves a regal, amber-green scent that lingers in your bathroom for hours—think luxury spa meets fragrance atelier. The Saffron and Cedar wash balances warm, spicy gourmand notes with the floral depth of jasmine, while Bergamot and Hinoki marries bright citrus with the sweet earthiness of Japanese hinoki. Black Rose and Oud delivers a deep, mysterious aroma for cooler months. Beyond their fantastic scents, these washes shine in skin care performance, too, packing hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and antioxidants like blueberry extract and vitamin C for a nourishing cleanse. Cetaphil Amazon Target Walmart Key Ingredients:Glycerin, shea butter, soybean oil, and avocado oil help nourish skin while bolstering its barrier defenses.Scent:Unscented, of course—why else would so many dermatologists recommend it? Sometimes as I make these \"Best Of\" lists, I find myself thinking \"Oh, how unique, another pick from Cetaphil...\" but there's a damn good reason this derm-favorite brand satisfies so many people—especially those with dry and sensitive skin. This lotion-like body wash lacks any fragrance and coats skin with its generous base of glycerin and shea butter. I've even used it as a hand wash at peak winter, when my mitts are super cracked but I need to wash them multiple times a day. Pair this with some short, mild showers (letting the cream set on skin for a good 30 seconds before rinsing), and you'll leave the shower feeling like you already lathered on some body lotion. (I'd still suggest using the body lotion, too, for ongoing defensiveness, but at least this one leaves skin feeling fantastic.) Nécessaire Amazon Necessaire Key Ingredients:Omegas 6 and 9 replenish and hydrate skin, while glycerin nourishes, plant oils remove impurities, and niacinamide fortifies.Scent:It's fragrance free, which is a must for sensitive skin types. Nécessaire is a master of the body nourishing craft, and alongside its terrificunscented body lotion, this fragrance free body wash is perfect for sensitive skin. It's all about those active ingredients, too: This omega-rich glycerin-based shower gel houses niacinamide and Vitamin E galore, for smoothed and soothed skin. Everytime this brand sends anything to my doorstep, I mutter something akin to \"oh hell yeah...\", then have to concoct some way tonotshare it with my partner. I just feel so goodandso cool when I use their products, and it's this body wash that I put atop their roster overall because of its universality, its gentleness, and its effectiveness. I can skip the fragrance, I just want nourishing, refreshing results, and I get that with Nécessaire. Baxter of California Harry's Nordstrom Baxter of California Key Ingredients:Pumice and jojoba meal remove dead skin cells while glycerin cushions and cradles.Scent:This one has Baxter's now-signature oakmoss and cedarwood essence; the scent is dangerously delicious smelling. Oooh, I could wax poetic on this product for a while. It's way grittier than most exfoliating body washes I'd otherwise recommend (since I'm a fan of chemical exfoliants over physical ones). But, as a dry-skin buffer, this pumice-packed formula also packs a punch. I wouldn't recommend using it every day—especially since it's smaller than most other options and won't last you as long. Deploy it when you need that extra effort, like on dry elbows, crusty ankles, cracked heels, or even just targeting your pits and groin to promote better hygiene. But here's my favorite part of all: This thing smells phenomenal. It's a remix of the brand's best-selling (and best-smelling)exfoliating body bar, with its brilliant oakmoss and cedar essence that has also recently made its way intoBaxter's deodorantstoo—which, for what it's worth, is also aGQ-chart toppingbest deodorant). Harry's Harrys Target Harry's Key Ingredients:A synthetic recipe reads like a foreign language, but translates to a big-batch/science-forward formula (and one that saves you money).Scent:Its citrusy, mineral-rich aroma grounds you mid-cleanse. Ain't nothing compromising about the best cheap body wash, which currently comes in six different scents. And while that scent profile continues to grow, my favorite remains one of Harry's original options, the crisp and mineral-tinged Stone. This one builds a big lather, and I may have even used it as a light bubble bath base more than once.Kiran MianofHudson Dermatology and Laser Surgeryin NYC recommends your body wash have pH-balancing citric acid, and this one does, which is the perfect example of whydrugstoreoptions are often as good (if not better) than the top-shelf options. Differin Amazon Walmart Walgreens Key Ingredients:Salicylic acid flushes out pores and balances oil levels while blue tansy soothes on contact.Scent:Smells like a lack of bacne, and nothing else. While there are two key ingredients used in body washes to target acne—salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide—I'd sooner recommend this salicylic acid option to readers at large. Benzoyl options (common in Differin's own face wash formulas) are best for acne induced by bacteria, whereas salicylic acid seeps into the pores to free up any trapped skin cells and sebum buildups. For me, I use benzoyl more reactively, since I find it dries out my skin (and risks staining towels), while this body wash suits me better day to day—and as an acne mitigator in the first place. As an unusually sweaty person, I also find that it helps temper clogged pores all around the body, not just the chest, back, shoulders and neck as advertised. Native Amazon Key Ingredients:While you're not going to recognize these sciencey-sounding ingredients, you'll notice a lack of offensive ingredients, too—hence why the doctors love Native.Scent:Refreshing mint and mind-clearing eucalyptus; it's like a forest bath, really. \"Native uses citric acid, a great pH balancer to maintain our skin barrier, along with derivatives from plant-based oils that add hydration,\" says Dr. Mian of Native's hydrating body wash, which she recommends readily to her patients thanks to a paraben- and pthalates-free formula. “It also smells nice without overdoing it on any artificial parfums. Its texture is sudsy yet luxurious at the same time, and instead of leaving you with that tight squeaky-clean feeling, it leaves you soft and cleansed.” Aesop Aesop Leave it to Aesop to release a body cleanser that smells absolutely divine. Its Eleos body wash is on the creamier side, and while it doesn't lather super well, it does make you feel clean and moisturized once you've rinsed it away. Plus, the smell really lingers on the skin long after you've hopped out of the shower. Dove Amazon When it comes to shopping for products that work well on sensitive skin, Dove is one of the first brands to come to mind. Its body wash is formulated to cleanse the skin without stripping it of its natural oils, and it feels nice and creamy to apply. And despite its creamy consistency, it lathers up nicely to make you feel like you're getting a good sudsing. Nerra Nordstrom Hyaluronic acid, squalene, and pink clay all come together to create a nourishing and cleansing body wash that'll make you feel clean yet hydrated—an oxymoron that actually makes sense once you suds up yourself. Malin+Goetz Amazon Refreshing eucalyptus helps to make this Malin+Goetz body wash feel like you've just been cared for at a luxury spa. Its gel-like consistency feels nice on the skin, especially in the warmer months, and it lathers up nicely without making the skin feel too dry. Ingredients: Dr. Gmyrek advises a few ingredients to support your skin’s health and moisture levels, a.k.a. Body Wash 101. “Look for ceramides, which strengthen the skin’s protective barrier, retain moisture, and guard against environmental stressors. Plant-based oils like jojoba, shea butter, coconut, and sunflower oil are excellent for soothing and moisturizing dry or irritated skin, while squalane and glycerin draw in moisture, repair cracks, and leave the skin smooth and supple.” Sulfates: “Not all sulfates are inherently bad—many body washes, including popular mass-market options, use sulfates because they're effective at creating lather and removing dirt, oil, and sweat. However, sulfates can strip the skin of its natural oils if used excessively or in high concentrations, leading to dryness or irritation, especially for sensitive or dry skin types,” Dr. Gmyrek says. Look for washes that balance sulfates with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, ceramides, or natural oils to counteract potential dryness. She also emphasizes that less is more: \"Don't overuse (your wash) and be sure to wash off well and follow with moisturizer application.\" Scents: If you have sensitive skin, you might want to avoid heavily scented body washes as it could irritate the skin. However, if you don't have that issue, then find a body wash that you'll actually enjoy smelling like, because the scent can linger on your body long after you've rinsed away all the suds. Finding your perfect formula might take some trial and error: “The effectiveness of a body wash can vary from person to person depending on factors such as skin type, lifestyle, and personal preference,” says board-certified dermatologistJames Collyerof Seattle’sModern Dermatology. “It's always best to try a few options to see what works best.” Hopefully, our own experience with body washes will give you a shortcut to a solution, though. We also asked for advice on how to shop smarter for body washes from board-certified dermatologistDr. Robyn GmyrekofUnionDermand board-certified dermatologistKiran MianofHudson Dermatology and Laser Surgeryin NYC. “Look for a body wash with benzoyl peroxide, and/or salicylic acid,” says Dr. Mian. “Benzoyl peroxide is anti-bactericidal [so it neutralizes blemish-causing bacteria]. It also decreases sebum and sweat.Salicylic acidhelps to clear out the debris from our pores, taking away the starting point of acne formation.” “Choose a body wash with glycerin andceramides,” says Mian. “Think of your skin as a brick wall. Ceramides make up the cement in between the bricks. Without proper ceramides our skin barrier is not as strong, increasing transepidermal water loss. A strong skin barrier will help to maintain hydration in super dry skin.” If you want to buff away dry skin, there are many physically gritty exfoliating body washes, as well as those withchemical exfoliantslike alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), includingglycolic acidandlactic acid. Dr. Gmyrek advises, \"If you have dry skin, look for a low-foaming body wash containing gentler cleansing agents or surfactants, also known as cream or oil cleansers. Look for glycerin, shea butter, and sunflower seed oil to help retain moisture and nourish the skin.\" Additionally, \"Non-foaming washes cleanse more gently without stripping oils from the skin. So, if you have dry skin, choose washes that lather less and hydrate more.\" While your body probably isn’t quite as oily as your face, it can still be an issue below the neck, especially if you want to prevent acne and mitigate sweat buildup. Collyer says to use oil-balancing formulas, like those including salicylic acid for an all-around deep-cleansing finish. Many will double as terrific options forfighting breakoutstoo, thanks to the deep clean of it all. Dr. Gmyrek advises: \"For oily skin, I recommend foaming body washes, which are more effective at removing some of the oils from the skin. Washes that contain salicylic or glycolic acid can also help to remove excess oil and dead skin cells. In addition, ingredients like niacinamide and ceramides help regulate sebum or oil production and keep the skin barrier healthy.\" “Body odor can be caused by a variety of reasons including bacterial or fungal overgrowth, hormones, and hygiene routine,” says Dr. Collyer. Mian adds that most commonly, odor occurs “when the natural flora of bacteria on our skin breaks down sweat, which releases byproducts that lead to odor.” So, the best body wash for BO will decrease bacterial count as well as keeping the skin clean and exfoliated, she says. “A combination of gentle exfoliating acids like mandelic or salicylic acid, antibacterial salts like benzalkonium chloride, and even gentle fragrances can help neutralize body odor.” Depending on how sensitive your skin is, Dr. Gmyrek advises you to try to avoid ingredients known to irritate, such as sulfates and dyes, and look for soothing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal and ceramides and moisturizing agents like glycerin. She adds, \"Opt for an unscented body wash since it's free from dyes, and many fragrances—even natural ones—can irritate those with sensitivities.\" Also, prioritize hypoallergenic washes to reduce the risk of irritation or allergic reactions. Collyer says to prioritize anti-inflammatory agents, like chamomile, aloe vera, and allantoin—all of which “can help to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation.\" What should you look for in terms of hydration? Dr. Gmyrek breaks it down into three key hydrating ingredients.Humectantsattract water from the environment or deeper within the skin to increase the skin's water content. Common examples include hyaluronic acid, glycerin, lactic acid, and squalane.Emollientshelp restore the skin barrier and soften its surface with ceramides, shea butter, glycerin, and dimethicone. Finally,occlusivesseal in moisture and prevent water loss. They include waxes, lanolin, argan oil, petrolatum, and coconut oil. “For maximum hydration, look for body washes with two or three hydrating ingredients. Some ingredients, like glycerin and ceramides, even offer multiple benefits.” What is exfoliating, and how often should I do it? Exfoliating is important for maintaining healthy, smooth skin, but it’s not something you should do every day. Aim to exfoliate once or twice a week to get the benefits without irritating. There are two main types of exfoliators. “Chemical exfoliants, such as AHAs like glycolic, lactic, and mandelic acids, and BHAs like salicylic acid, work by dissolving the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to slough off while enzymatically smoothing and brightening the skin. Physical exfoliants use scrubs with grainy substances, like walnut shells, coconut shells, oatmeal, or pumice, to mechanically remove dead skin cells from the skin’s surface,” says Dr. Gmyrek. Hybrid exfoliating washes (like the Malin+Goetz wash above) combine physical and chemical exfoliants for a dual-action approach. Why is everything “plant-based” nowadays? Dr. Gmyrek explains that natural ingredients like shea butter, almond oil, jojoba oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oil are excellent for replenishing the skin's natural oils. However, not everything labeled as plant-based is truly plant-based or vegan. While such products may feature plant-derived ingredients, they can also include animal-derived components like emu oil or lanolin. Additionally, being plant-based or “organic” does not necessarily mean being chemical-free. \"Everything is a chemical—natural or synthetic—and many 'natural' ingredients, like essential oils, can still irritate the skin.” In short, plant-based sounds great, and there are many reasons to use said ingredients, but approach it with a bit of healthy knowledge. What about antioxidants? Dr. Gmyrek states, \"Antioxidants combat free radicals, slowing cell damage and preventing collagen and elastin breakdown. While antioxidants in body washes can be beneficial, their short contact time with the skin limits their effectiveness compared to leave-on products like serums and creams.” The best approach? Use antioxidant-infused body washes as a supportive step in your routine, but pair them with leave-on products for maximum impact. Are synthetic body washes bad? Says Adam: We don’t have any vitriol to spew about mass-made body washes. Many of the best men's body wash picks on our list lack specific targeted ingredients (and even fully natural ingredients), in favor of tried-and-true synthetic surfactants. And it’s probably not worth divingsodeep that we’re discussing whether an ingredient like “cocamidopropyl betaine” is going to damn your skin to eternity if it’s featured in a well-revered recipe. Let’s just leave it at this: Read reviews. Go for reputable brands. When curious,dothat research into the oddball ingredients. We’re not even 100% negative on sulfates here because whodoesn’tlove a sudsy lather? (But that’s because some sulfate-inclusive formulas are well-researched and will honor many skin types.) So, keep that in mind as you shop around. Sometimes the best choice is one of the most affordable drugstore body washes because it’s probably also been tested on the most people—with the top-regarded scientists and researchers writing the script, no less.

    "title": "16 Best Aviator Sunglasses for Men in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best aviator sunglasses for men have always been cool, but I first became enamored with them as a kid, watching reruns ofCHiPsbefore school. The plot lines were largely forgettable. The reflective, teardrop-shaped frames those fictional highway patrol officers swore by? Not so much. Once I moved on from spending my mornings with Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox, there were aviators again, framing the faces of Robert De Niro inTaxi Driver,Tom Cruise inTop Gun, and Robert Redford wherever he went. All of this to say: Aviators are as American as apple pie, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola—and have represented a specific brand of grownup swagger for as long as I’ve been alive. The original aviators were created in the 1930s by Bausch & Lomb,a precursor to Ray-Ban, but these days, there are countless riffs on the silhouette that yank it into the here and now. The exact ones pilots used to wear are still a sure bet—part of the aviator’s appeal is how much of the eye it protects, making it one of the safest choices for pilots, drivers, and bikers—but there’s no shortage of high-flying designer joints, too. Below is every pair worth your time in 2025, from the age-old, genre-defining icons to the new-school, wild-style iconoclasts. Ray-Ban Amazon Really, there's no better place to start than with the brand that invented the silhouette. In 1936, these iconic sunglasses were introduced for pilots, designed with distinctive large lenses that covered the entire eye to minimize light intrusion from all angles—a critical feature for clear vision during flight. The Ray-Ban design soon soaredbeyond the cockpitandinto pop culture, but beyond their stylish appeal, these aviators also offer 100% UV protection, and come with theclassic Ray-Ban green lenses—though there’s also pink, brown, gray, blue, and other lens options should you lean a different way. Sunski Huckberry You don't need tobreak the bankto shield your eyes from harsh rays, either. Crafted from recyclable materials, Sunski’s more-affordable frames still feature polarized lenses that improve contrast in ultra-bright conditions, and block over 99% of UV light. The Shoreline model stands out, too, with its slightly larger, square-shaped aviator design calling to mind Hunter S. Thompson’s signature oversized yellow lenses. American Optical Huckberry These sunglassesmade it to the moon and back. Carried by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their historic moon landing in 1969, it’s all the proof you need that American Optical’s aviators are more than capable of handling anything Earth throws your way. Crafted specifically for American military pilots, these iconic frames feature bayonet temples specifically designed to eliminate interference with military helmets—or your favorite '47 branded cap. But their impressive heritage is just the beginning. The frames are built to last, with scratch-resistant lenses that offer distortion-free clarity, and an anti-reflective backside coating to combat glare, even when driving into the sun. What’s more, they’re still made in the USA today, adhering to the same rigorous military standards that have defined them for decades. Randolph Engineering Amazon The Randolph Engineering namehas been synonymouswith quality eyewear since 1973. (Like American Optical above, in 1982, the brand secured a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to produce military-issue sunglasses.) Each pair is handcrafted, in a process that takes up to six weeks and involves over 200 intricate steps, taking into account comfort as much as quality, with adjustable nose pads and flexible temple arms to guarantee a fit that's tailored to you. So confident is Randolph Engineering of its military-grade durability, in fact, that the brand backs each frame with a lifetime warranty. Persol Amazon While Persol's tortoise frames aren’t the classic metal frames associated with aviators, those lenses are as aviator as they come, so we’re including them here. Inspired by Turin’s elegant, swift tram drivers, and featuring the iconic glasses brand’s signature Meflecto temple technology—which ensures the glasses fit to your head, rather than putting pressure on it—these glasses offer exceptional flexibility and comfort, making them a perfect choice for all-day wear. That was at least the opinion of Marcello Mastroianni andSteve McQueen, both of whom were frequently seenin their Persol PO0649s. Ray-Ban Amazon It's easy to think that mirrored aviators are only for Highway Patrolmen, but they have plenty of benefits beyond increasing your privacy. For example, mirrored aviators reduce glare more than any other style—and they also just look great. (In fact, Robert Redford was inlong-termrelationshipwith his.) And if you're looking for your first pair, Ray-Ban have pretty much perfected the form. Its mirrored aviators have a dark gray lens and a matte silver frame—because we don’t needeverythingto shine, do we. Mr. P x Cubitts Mr. Porter Mr. Porter’s in-house line collaborated with British eyewear brand Cubitts for this great, showstopping riff on the '70s style aviator. Crap Eyewear Crap Eyewear Crap Eyewear is a brand that defies its cheeky name, offering quality, style, and a price tag that is anything but. Their Spaced Ranger aviator-style shades—reminiscent of Paul Newman’s inThe Color of Money—are a collection standout. Akila SSENSE If you just want to dip your toe into the style with a slim wire frame that makes for low-profile shades, these are a great pick from one of our favorite sunglass brands. Garrett Leight Mr. Porter Not too big, these glasses combine the best of traditional aviators with a distinctive double-bridge and some 70s funkiness. The dark green acetate frames are also a great option for those tired of tortoise or black. Le Specs END. Ok, so you want to feel like you’re in your very own 1970s French New Wave summer thriller? Say less. (Also: Note the gently sloping top of the frame.) Retrosuperfuture SSENSE As the name implies, another very chill and funky pair of glasses. And as if to further imply their offbeat outlook, the double bridge has a slight downward wiggle. Oliver Peoples Oliver Peoples There is a fine line between Cop aviators and Pilot aviators, and I'd say the R-2s are refined enough in shape and look to be Fly-boy all the way. Moscot Moscot These sturdy metal gold frames—with squarer-than-most lenses—are a nice change from many of the more rounded styles seen on most aviators. And they're Moscot, a byword for quality shades. Camp Eyewear REI Polarized sunglasses for under $80 is the headline here, but if you want to know more: These are a limited edition Smokey the Bear edition, based on the friendly fire-fighting bear of our National Parks. American Optical AO Eyewear I’m a firm believer that every man should try a pair of yellow glasses at some point—they improve your contrast and depth perception, and get you that realFear and Loathinglook. This pair comes from one of the true OG aviator manufacturers in the United States. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

It would be unfair to say that thetrench coatis back, since it never really went away. But there’s something in the air (or the water cooler) atGQHQ right now, because each morning, a who’s who of my colleagues arrive at work wrapped in their trenches, protecting their big fits from the elements. Sometimes, it turns out, the best answer to the question every menswear nerd must contend with during the topsy-turvy days of spring—what the heck should I wear today?—is the simplest: a trench coat, of course. But a good trench does more than simply ward off nasty weather: it acts as a defensive buffer against the precipitous demands of the corporate 9-to-5. “It helps me feel locked in and professional on the gray, miserable days I don’t want to be,” saysGQsenior style editor Yang-Yi Goh. This is a coat originally designed forliteraltrench warfare, which means it can more than handlethe battleground of your open-plan office.

Yang-Yi Goh in aPolo Ralph Lauren trench,Muji cardigan,Manresa tee,Morjas belt, vintage Levi's jeans,Everyday Mountaineering beanie, andHaruta shoes. The trench’s fundamental appeal, though, extends far beyond its utility. There’s a reason it’s favored by everyone from Wall Street tycoons to Camden Town punks, to say nothing of the mood board legends who swear by it on screen—among the colleagues polled here, Alain Delon inLe Samouraïis a frequent reference. A trench coat “comes in handy during windy transitional weather,” says Raymond Ang,GQ’s associate director of editorial operations. But to Ang, the coat’s true value is its ability to instantly elevate any regular old outfit. “Jeans and a ratty sweater? Lazy. Jeans and a ratty sweater under a gorgeously wrinkled trench? Kind of chic—evencinematic.” Delon might’ve rocked his trench coat with adark suit and tie, but my ever-fly coworkers all gently suggest mixing it up. “Trenches feel inherently dressy, but they look good over literally everything—hoodies, trashed denim, plaid flannels, whatever,” Goh says. In other words, when a fit feels off for reasons you can’t quite put your finger on, add a trench to the equation and soldier on undeterred.

Raymond Ang in aCommission trench, vintage sweater vest,Everybody.World tee,Issey Miyake Homme Plissé pants, andLemaire slippers. How the folks here arrived at their respective trenches varies.GQcommerce writer Gerald Ortiz picked up his busted ‘60s-era Burberry trench at a flea market in Paris. Global fashion correspondent Samuel Hine scooped aDaniel Lee-designedBurberry trench when his vintage car coat (also Burberry) gradually lost its waterproof coating (he still wears it on sunnier days). Associate commerce editor Tyler Chin snagged his vintage trench after a months-long quest trawling eBay. Which brings me to my next bit of crucial advice, courtesy of Ortiz: “Go vintage if you can”—and make sure it’s roomy enough to layer beneath. (Also, it doesn’t have to be sotan.) “Go long, loose, and flowy with the silhouette,” Goh echoes. “You don't want a trench that ends mid-thigh.” And when it comes to embracing the natural patina secondhand clothing accumulates after decades of hard wear, Ang succinctly sums up theGQparty line: “The more used and abused, wrinkled and beat up, the better.” Gerald Ortiz in a vintage Burberry trench, vintage Abercrombie & Fitch sweater,Oni jeans,An Irrational Element shoes, andAkila sunglasses.

Whether you buy one old or new, calf-skimming long or knee-kissing short, pricey and pedigreed or widely available andwallet-friendly, you really can’t go wrong. Take it fromGQstyle writer Eileen Cartter, who reaches for her preferred trench, a lightly structured riff fromindie menswear sensationCommission, when she wants to feel more put-together. Contra to slouchier jackets, Cartter says, the silhouette “is sort of old time-y reporter, like I'm about to hit the pavement and take notes on a spiral notepad.” What could possibly be moreGQthan that?

    "title": "Shinola’s $550 Dive Watch Breathes New Life Into a Scuba Classic",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Dive watches, much like crustaceans, cephalopods, and other creatures of the deep, come in a myriad of differentspecies and subspecies. These include sleek desk divers (pro-spec underwater watches that are refined enough to wear with a suit);beefy ultra-deep divers(ones whose XXL cases are water-resistant to 500m or more); GMT divers (ones with dual-time-zone functions); and vintage-style Super Compressor divers (identifiable by their dual-crown cases and internal rotating bezels.) Then there’s the skin diver, a genus of tough-yet-affordable sports watches popular in the 1960s and 1970s among scuba hobbyists, weekend spear fishermen, and anyone else who wanted to add a dash of nautical swagger to their wardrobe. While not as prestigious as the dive watches made by stalwarts likeRolexand Blancpain, skin divers’ distinctive looks—which included some very funkyMad Men-era dial designs—made them incredibly popular in their day, and their appeal amongvintage watch collectorsremains strong 60 years later. This month, however, there’s a new addition to the skin diver club that can be yours for the (relatively) reasonable sum of $550: the Shinola Duck 1040. Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Like the best vintage-modern divers (another important species to spot in the wild), the Duck 1040 combines a heavy dollop of midcentury design cues with a raft of modern upgrades including a 40mm stainless steel case, a sapphire crystal, and a Swiss quartz movement. With an engraving of its namesake bird on the caseback, a period-correct basketweave textured rubber strap, and a selection of dial and accent colors including canary yellow, pastel blue, and bubblegum pink, the Duck has all the hallmarks of a go-to summer ticker. As you’d expect from a brand that’s synonymous withthe Motor City renaissance, every Duck is assembled “from gears to gaskets”, and tested at Shinola’s Detroit HQ. Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola “For a watch named Duck, the playful visuals of the golden years of the skin diving era felt like a perfect fit,” says Greg Verras, Design Director at Shinola, who pored over old issues ofSkin Divermagazine for inspiration. With 100m of water resistance, the Duck 1040 is water-resistant enough for a day at the lake or the beach, but like its 1960s predecessors, it’s a more casual proposition than other members of the dive watch family, includingShinola’s 300-metre-rated Monster collection. “Skin diving can be a leisure activity, not a technical, highly controlled endeavor—it’s more about having fun, exploring, and getting sunburned,” Verras says. “In the end, a Duck is essentially the skin diver of the bird community.”",

    "article_text": "It's starting to get warmer out. The sun is shining. Do we really need much more of an excuse than that to round up some of the best men's beach outfits of all time and dole out a few helpful style tips to get you looking your absolute bestsur la plagethis summer? Didn't think so. Whether you're flying off on a weeklong trip to the French Riviera or just driving up the road for a picnic by the ocean, here are 26 men's beach vacation outfits worth pinning to your summer mood board. Steve McQueen, 1968 A great pair of shades and Faye Dunaway by your side doesn't hurt, but what makes this look fromThe Thomas Crown Affairso timeless is the interplay between the long sleeves of McQueen's rumpled creamsicle shirt and the thigh-baring inseam of his shorts. A$AP Rocky, 2022 It's summertime and the livin’ is easy. The sand is soft beneath your feet. The ocean is shimmering before you. If you can't let loose and wild out sartoriallynow, when can you? Follow our guyRocky's lead and lean hard into searing neons, clashing patterns, and metallic kicks. John F. Kennedy Jr., 1980 When you're wearing as little asJohn-Johnis here, every detail counts. Thetiny trunksdo plenty of talking, but it's the righteous tooth necklace (and, frankly, the pack of cigs tucked in his waistband) that sends this to a whole other plane of cool. Shawn Mendes, 2023 Speaking of accessories: Thatreal-deal dive watchyou're so proud of? Let it fulfill its intended purpose. Wearing your timepiece beneath the depths is an especially sick flex if, like Mr. Mendes here, you match the band of yourPatek Philippe Aquanautto your trunks. Jackie Chan, 1984 Breton stripesare never not effortlessly cool—and that goes double anytime you happen to be near a body of water. Mick Jagger, 1987 The beach is meant to be relaxing, sure. That doesn't mean yourclothesalways need to be relaxed too. Jagger's graceful pleated trousers and pressed shirt cut a sharp figure, but they don't feel the least bit out of place as he strides across the dunes. Andre Agassi, 1996 There's plenty to love about (and steal from) this Andre Agassi ensemble. The tucked-inlinen shirt! The pleatedjorts! Thebeeper!!!We're gonna zero in on the Grand Slam winner's choice of footwear as the key to the whole thing, though.Fisherman sandalsare about as hot in fashion circles as they've ever been, and they look as good anchoring casual beach outfits as they do dressed up with a crisp summer suit. Jay-Z, 2020 They're called “vacation shirts” for a reason. Louche, laid-back, camp-collared button-ups have been in again for a minute now, which means there are plenty of options—like Jay-Z's smart plaid Bode shirt here—that run a little subtler and more tasteful than your average thrift-store Hawaiian joint. Jay-Z, 2018 Yup, two Jay-Z looks in a row. Turns out, when you're the greatest rapper of all time and also a billionaire you wind up with a lot of stellar vacation photos. Another side effect of dashing off to tropical locales as often as the Carters do? You master galaxy-brain moves like wearing a suit on the sand. Sure, you can always pull off an airy linen number at a beach wedding. But what Hov is doing here is way,waymore striking—kicking back with a stogie in a fiery red two-piece with no shirt underneath is a hall-of-fame maneuver. If you're gonna pack a suit on your weekend getaway, make sure it's one like this: designed for popping bottles, not the boardroom. Julio Iglesias, 1980 There's something that just feels right about a sports jersey at the beach. Maybe it's an old-school football pullover like Julio's, maybe it's asplashy hoops uniform, maybe it's ablokecore-embracing soccer kit. Doesn't hurt if you actually bring a pigskin to toss around, either. Ethan Hawke, 2022 One of the biggest misconceptions about getting dressed in the warmer months is that layering is no longer an option. But a simple tee or tank under a vibey button-up—as the ever-stylishEthan Hawkeexhibits here, decades after downright perfecting the look inReality Bites—gives you plenty of flexibility and versatility for a long day in the sun. Pierce Brosnan, 1999 The rightsunglassesand a greathaircutmake a world of difference. George Harrison, 1976 Who says you can't hit the beach on a blustery November morning? The thinking person's favorite Beatle understands that no matter the temperature, there are few better places for getting off an epic fit. Bruce Willis, 1986 OK, so Bruce is backstage at the Emmys and nowherenearthe ocean here. But this elegant, all-white-everything kit—with a slouchy, wide silhouette that still feels fresh in 2024—was too beachy and beautiful not to share anyway. Sean Connery, 1962 We're not saying they should replace your nylon board shortsallthe time, of course. In a pinch, though, when you're strolling by the shore and decide you really need to take a plunge? A hardy pair of rolled-upchinosworks—and looks!—mighty fine. Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, 1972 Even less practical than khakis on the beach: A fullCanadian tuxedo,sansshirt butavecwhat appears to be a pair ofhouse slippers. But when you're Serge Gainsbourg—and you've got Jane Birkin on your arm—it makes all the sense in the world. Justin Bieber, 2021 When it's soupy out, the last thing you want is a tight shirt sticking to your torso like saran wrap. The Biebs, of course, is no stranger to jumbo-sized ensembles, but his billowy agenda especially makes sense seaside. Paul Newman, 1958 Even in the dead of summer, it can get pretty chilly down by the ocean at night. And, as my pal Amelia recently put it, there's nothing like wearing a sweater on the beach for feeling like you've been swept up into a swoony Nicholas Sparks novel. Russell Westbrook, 2023 As far as maximizing vibesandsun protection is concerned, you can't beat a goodbucket hat. Matthew McConaughey, 2006 Not really a hat guy? A well-deployed bandana might not offer the same level of cover from the rays, but it sure does look pretty rad. Shirley MacLaine and Steve Parker, 1955 An open-collar, tunic-style shirt like this one feels relaxed enough for a vacation, but still handsome and put-together enough for a dinner date. Harry Belafonte, 1957 If you've made it this far into this story and somehow still aren't convinced you need alinen button-upin your life, well, here's all the proof you need. Robin Williams, 1995 Awife pleaserwith a whole whack ofdangly chains(and maybe a trim tuft ofchest hair)? Yes, thank you, more please. The Beach Boys, 1962 You might associateflannel shirtswith lumberjacks in the dead of winter, but as the Beach Boys so smartly demonstrate here, they've also been worn for decades by Californian surfers in need of an extra hit of warmth following an early morning sesh. Steve McQueen, 1973 One more McQueen photo just to keep the moodboards fed and happy. This is a great lesson in not overthinking things. A flattering navy tee, a great pair of cutoff jeans, and a hell of a watch—that's all you really need to dress like an absolute king. Denzel Washington, 2006 That's what the beach is about, isn't it? Even on a blustery fall day you can still have a damn good time out there, as Denzel, his excellent leather trench, and his extremely good boy prove here.",

    "title": "These Seven Albums Created Modern Stand-Up Comedy",
    "article_text": "Rhino’s new box set of the seven comedy albumsRichard Pryormade between 1974 and 1983—released by several record companies, but now referred to collectively as The Warner Bros. Albums—includes an essay by the historian, critic and PryorbiographerScott Saul entitled “The Age of Pryor.” But when you think about the material on these albums, and consider their impact on the modern landscape of culture as well as comedy, even 20 years after Pryor’s death, it’s fair to wonder if the Age of Pryor ever ended. As an entertainer, Pryor was like Steve Jobs’ iPhone pitch—an all-in-one proposition in which the performer in question not only puts all the most important talents together, but is better at each individual skill than anyone on stage or screen ever had been. He was an observational comedian and an irreverent improviser and a physical comedian and a master of sketch and character and an inherently political social critic and a prophet and a riveting confessional comedian who made his life an open book. He was the son of a pimp and the grandson of a madam from Peoria, rejected by the Illinois school system as well as the army, married seven times, arrested numerous times, addicted to every available drug, violent towards himself and others, and rejected over and over again by Hollywood and America. He was an anthropologist performing an autopsy on Black and white America disguised as stand-up comedy, finding humor in the nuances, in how we relate to one another in the streets and the sheets. He brought an entire community to life on stage, a blend of the pop culture he consumed ravenously in movie houses and the colorful, hilarious, frightening community he grew up in. His material on these albums, masterworks finally given their due ina Janus-levelprestige reissue (That N*gger's Crazy, ...Is It Something I Said?, Bicentennial N*gger, Wanted/Richard Pryor Live in Concert(double-LP),Live On The Sunset Strip, andHere and Now) has captivated several generations of pop culture. Not just his themes, style and delivery, but the actual jokes,quoted incessantly in rapfrom the ‘90s to the present (Kendrick Lamaris a stan), and parroted beat for beat by both white and Black comedians from Jim Carrey to Cedric the Entertainer. Without Pryor you don’t get to Eddie Murphy playing his entire family at a dinner table, or Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle’s both comedic and tragic portrayals of crackheads. Pryor was 33 when he recordedThat N*gger’s Crazyone evening in February 1974 in a San Francisco nightclub, but that performance, and that entire period, was the culmination of nearly a decade of work. He had broken big on bothThe Ed Sullivan Showand with Merv Griffin in 1965with sketch performances. He came from a tradition of stand-ups who leaned on character work and sketch in their acts, like Sid Caesar and Jonathan Winters. But unlike those comedians, Pryor would use this “device” to bring an entire sociological study of his Black Midwestern experience to life with detail-rich dimension. Early in his career in New York, playing Village basket houses, he was a crossover act, popular with largely white crowds, performing a cerebral, conceptual act that a modern viewer would understand as improv play. He hadn’t ever quite fit in the Chitlin Circuit tradition of Black comedians playing to mostly Black audiences, like his friend Red Foxx or Pigmeat Markham or Moms Mabley. Nor did he quite fit with the defiant, Civil Rights-influenced young comics of his peer group, like Dick Gregory and Godfrey Cambridge. Of his contemporaries, he ironically was probably closest in style to Bill Cosby, another comedian who would put on skits— Noah receiving IKEA-style ark-construction directions from God, the indignity of the dentist—though he would later think of himself, and be thought of, as “The Anti-Cosby.” For Pryor, finding his voice and finding his career was a journey. For a time his working life was bifurcated—playing by industry rules afforded to Black entertainers and cultivating an inoffensive screen persona on shows likeThe Partridge Family, while spending his free time on projects like the never-completedUncle Tom’s Fairy Tales,an experimental underground film that imagined the commingling of the concurrent Black and sexual revolutions. He moves around, from New York to LA, from LA to Berkeley, back to LA. He becomes disenchanted with the frustrating low-level fame he achieves and hungers for connection with Black audiences and Black issues in his material. He finds valuable collaborators like Paul Mooney, Lily Tomlin, and Mel Brooks, who are fearless in their transgressive work, as well as a community of serious Black artists, like the writers Cecil Brown, Ishmael Reed and Al Young. He falls in love and falls out of it. He begins incorporating profanity into his act around the time he begins to turn inward (and around the periodobscenity laws are beginning to become more laxwhen it comes to public expression), and notably begins using the N-word in a manner it had never been employed on stage before. In doing so, he’s not pushing boundaries for the sake of pushing them, but to change the way we think and talk about concepts of race, sexuality, and freedom in an honest, frank manner that uses humor to strip away some of their power. But by 1974, and on the subsequent Warner records, you can listen to Pryor inventing the modern format of standup comedy in real time. What he’s finally able to put together in his mature era is his personal history, pain, pathos, struggles with women, sex, drugs, money and fame, all examined from the perspective of a suppressed Black man finally enjoying free expression and finding more acclaim and popularity than he did when he played by society’s rules. It can be understood as a rejection of the limited options, the voice the entertainment industry forced on Pryor, and an embrace of his own taste, his own narrative. Along withMuhammad Ali, Richard was a Black celebrity who you could argue was just before his time—but you could just as easily argue that neither man could have arrived at the “right time.” Both Pryor and Ali were a tide change, necessary to put one conception of Black celebrity in America to rest, so a new one could begin. Pryor found unfathomable success beginning withThat N****** Crazy, an X-rated phenomenon of an album that was impossible to promote but still sold a half million records, and won a Grammy (as did four other albums in the collection). It was a record that expanded the conventional imagination when it came to what a comedy album was capable of accomplishing in terms of popularity and cultural impact. The films Pryor acted in all have moments but are never quite as good as you remember or want them to be. He never really got or wrote a script worthy of his incredible talent (with the exception ofhis role inWattstax), and he was denied the chance to star in what should’ve been his masterpiece—Blazing Saddles, the Black Western comedy he co-wrote with Mel Brooks. His one-season eponymous TV variety series also had moments of greatness, but the idea Pryor could’ve ever found a true platform on 70s network television seems even more insane now than it did then. In lieu of that, we’ll always have over five hours of standup, finally in a packaging befitting their genius and majesty. They are Richard Pryor’s lasting, unqualified masterpieces.",

    "title": "20 Best Mother’s Day Gifts From Gucci, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Moms—the really good ones—spend all year long thinking about you. If you’re emotionally fulfilled and intellectually nurtured. If you’re stretching yourself just enough to squeeze the good stuff out of life. If you’re eating your veggies, texting your dates back, and wearing sunscreen. So forMother’s Day, it’s worth returning the favor—even just for a day, even just through a gesture. If we may, don’t overthink this: Turn toGucci. The Italian brand, beloved for its whimsical threads, makes a gift feel like more than a memory. In place of a fresh bouquet that's bound to wilt in a week, try a floral printed scarf that’ll bloom again each spring. Rather than giving her your go-to body butter set, up your game with lipsticks and fragrances that will have her dreaming of Florence. Here, our guide to the no-fail gifts that will show her you care through a single, simple gesture. The Italian illustrator Vittorio Accornero created the Flora Scarf in 1966 for Grace Kelly, and the lush and expressive floral print became an instant icon. Since then, the brand’s dreamy, untamed florals havegraced the necksof not only princesses but celebrity royalty (ahem: Rihanna) as well. Your mother—yourqueen—will appreciate one of these squares just as much. Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci All the while you were in diapers, your mom lost out on the chance to carry afabulous handbagto accommodate all of your bits and bobs. It’s all been forgiven, of course, but there’s no time like the present to make that feel like a long and distant memory with a Gucci handbag. Four we think are winners for the long haul: The Ophidia Small Boston bag, which has the brand’s classic red and green stripe atop its icon webbed print, the chic black Marmont Mini bag with the GGs on the clasp, the Diana Large Tote bag that (for the right mom) could hold a handful of diapers, and the Gucci Horsebit 1955 bag—which in our humble opinion is the one to beat. Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci When you give a gift from Gucci, you’re handing over a piece from a brand with a long and storied history, not unlike your relationship with your ma. Take the horsebit, a design detail that firstappeared on a loaferover 70 years ago in 1953 (yes, your mom probably wants said loafers if she doesn’t already have ‘em in her closet). Today, the horsebit can be found on details throughout the brand’s line, such as bags, dresses, and—our personal favorite—jewelry. In 18K rings and earrings, the horsebit is recognizable, but it feels fresh and playful, making it a great gift for a mom who doesn’t mind a subtle nod to a brand rather than an outright logo. For moms who would rather cut to the chase, snag one of the brand’s interlocking Gucci Gs in the form of a necklace or studs. Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Shopping for clothingis hard if you start from a place of need. Almost certainly, your mom is always cold (or hot!) and could use a cardigan (or tank!). But Mother’s Day is a time to shop for her dreams and not her day-to-day. So: a frock meant for Italian wine tastings? That’ll do! Adouble-breasted blazerthat makes her feel like the boss you know her to be? But of course! A garden-party-ready poplin that you know will bring out her very best self.Ahhh, you shouldn’t have! Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci We can't say enough good things about Gucci's collection ofloafers, and these two options were hand-picked by one shoe-obsessedGQeditor for their sleek silhouette, versatility, and classic charm. The brand's incredible attention to detail shines here, folks. Trust us: Mom is going to love them. Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Some of our earliest memories with mom are often quiet moments of the morning before life turns up the volume. A swipe of a lipstick or a spritz of scent cue our brain to form memories about who she was and what she wore, and whether you’re looking to tap into nostalgia or give her a new view of herself, Gucci’smakeupmakes a great gift. Originally launched in 2014 in collaboration with makeup icon Pat McGrath, the lipsticks and fragrances have always been the standouts. Give her a tube of Goldie Red, a high pigment, longwearing matte lipstick in a gold, beveled case or the brand’s orchid scent which pushes a vanilla heart note as far from blasé as possible. Each feel festive and thoughtful all at once: Party on, mom. Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci Gucci",

    "title": "Jonathan Anderson’s Dior Men Debut Is Sooner Than You Think",
    "article_text": "During the annual LVMH shareholders call on Thursday, Bernard Arnault confirmed the news that the fashion world has been anticipating for months:Jonathan Andersonis the new artistic director ofDior Men. The LVMH kingpin also disclosed an unexpected scoop: Anderson’s debut is only two months away. The designer is set to unveil his vision for Dior Men atParis Fashion Weekin June. June 27 at 2:30 p.m., to be exact, according to a subsequent press release circulated by Dior. Anderson’s next move has been the talk of the industry since last September, when he took a tearful bow at a Loewe runway show that had the emotional weight (and aesthetic crescendo) of a grand finale. Though designer-swap rumors are a dime a dozen these days, it’s fair to say that Anderson’s career has taken on a genuine importance inside and out of fashion. In his 11 years atLoewe, Anderson—funny, whip-smart, boyish, and a little nerdy—followed his taste in art and knack for imaginative silhouettes to turn a once-obscure Spanish leather label into a “cultural brand” that charmed casual shoppers and wowed elite tastemakers. All while continuing to evolve his language of humorous, conceptual menswear at his London-basedJW Anderson label. By the time the designerdeparted Loewe in March, it was clear that if we were in for amen’s fashion vibe shift, it would be led by Anderson, who has real modern range: he has made audiences look at the men’s suit in a new way, and has also inspired aviral meme about an heirloom tomato. At that point, his destination was an open secret—the talk of Paris Fashion Week was that he was already punching the clock at the Dior studio, where hesucceeds Kim Joneson the men’s side of the atelier. Still, without an official confirmation of his appointment, and amidst further speculation about LVMH’s plans to hand him the keys to Dior womenswear, it was unclear when we would see what he’s evidently been working on. Further questions remain: In his new role, will Anderson still be Luca Guadagnino’sgo-to costume designer? What does it mean for JW Anderson? Will Daniel Craig beholding down the front rowin June? For his part, Anderson wasted no time giving us a sneak peek. Shortly after the news broke, heposteda photo on Instagram of the back of a blue striped men’s shirt. Pinned to it is a label of a retro house logo. Anderson’s caption said it all: “Dior.”",

    "title": "Story mfg.’s Plaid-Wrapped Asics Collab Is a Picnic Blanket for Your Feet",
    "article_text": "When it comes toselecting collaborators, Asics doesn’t copy any other sneaker brand’s playbook. Despite itsrecent mainstream hits, the Japanese maker has always largely catered to a niche audience and seems to value finding collaborators with the same ethos. Whether that’s eclectic brands likeBentgablenitsor gorpy gods likeHaven, they’ve got a great eye for designers with rich, distinct visions. Story mfg.is the latest and greatest addition to the family. The Brighton-based brand was founded by Saeed and Katy Al-Rubeyi back in 2013, long before “sustainability” became fashion’s ultimate buzzword. They never cut corners in crafting their clothes, prioritizing ethically-sourced textiles, an adherence to making vegan-friendly product, and minimizing the use of harmful chemicals in any of their manufacturing processes. It’s worth noting that none of this matters if a brand isn’t making dope clothes, and Story Mfg. very much does. They bring their artful eye for color and print to drapey, modern silhouettes. Story Mfg.’s clothes are practical and functional, but they’re also joyful and expressive—the furthest thing from boring. The label’s Asics debut, then, is just about everything you’d want from a Story mfg. shoe. The collaboration consists of two colorways of the Asics Gel-Venture 6: The first blends creamy vanilla tones with spring-friendly violet accents, while the second decks the silhouette out in a chocolatey brown. Checkered prints adorn both shoes, as do big, floppy checkered laces. It’s a fashion-forward look, sure—but it’s also extremely fun. We’d call this one a match made in sneaker heaven. The partnership between Asics and Story mfg. is off to a great start, and we’re certainly hoping it’s far from finished. After a limited (and instantly sold-out) drop through Story mfg. last week, the shoes will receive a proper global release on April 18 through Asics and selected retail partners. Each pair goes for $160.",

    "title": "I Was Halfway Through ‘The Pitt’ When My Father Died. Here's What It Was Like to Finish It",
    "article_text": "Early in season one ofThe Pitt,a middle-aged woman is forced to come to terms with her father’s imminent death from natural causes. When we first meet her, she’s something of a problem patient, repeatedly rebuffing our hero, the twinkle-eyed resident surgeon Dr. Robby, when he tries to explain that any more attempts to keep her father alive will actually just bring him more pain while only temporarily delaying the inevitable. It takes a couple episodes for this to sink in, and after it finally does, during her father’s final moments, she laments the unfairness of it all and wishes they’d had more time. That was the last episode ofThe Pittthat I watched before learning that my own dad had suddenly passed away. I remember the first thing I watched in the aftermath of getting the news: the next episode in my queue for the final season ofYou. I needed to do something in those wrenching in-between hours of inactivity and it needed to be as far away from reality as possible. Joe Goldberg wreaking stalker mania havoc on trust-fund one-percenters fit the bill. But as the days and weeks went by, I felt an almost perverse urge to return toThe Pitt.I’m not sure if it was a play at defiance, to prove that I could and would be able to handle something as innocuous and evergreen as depictions of death and loss in art. Another part of me wondered if watching people grapple with death, in most cases sudden and unexpected, would offer some kind of comfort or catharsis. Crucially, it was an experiment I wanted to undergo alone. Even with a house full of family on hand to support me, I didn’t want to feel like someone was watching me watch something that could reflect my real circumstances at any given moment. Smash-cut to the wee hours of the morning, me in full vamp mode, as the rest of the house slept, pressing play on what must have been episode six or seven ofThe Pittand, to my surprise…feeling nothing. It was as easy, enjoyable, and escapist as it had been a week before, even with all the dying patients, conversations about sudden loss, and early-onset grief. A subplot involving an older, loquacious Black man charming the ER staff alongside his exasperated son reminded me of being in the hospital with my dad during a Covid scare years ago, him trying to deflate any tension or anxiety with non-stop jokes—but in a matter-of-fact way. Nothing that had me rushing to turn off the television. I felt relieved, reassured, emboldened even. Surely something soon would pull the rug out from underneath me—the game is the game—but in the meantime, I wasn’t fragile enough to crumble at any given moment or in the face of the more obvious red flags. Then a funny thing happened. I put on an episode ofFrasier, my go-to sleep-timer TV show, the ideal, unfussy sitcom for people who can’t fall asleep to silence. Frasier and Martin were commiserating about something, in a scene I’ve likely seen dozens of times. But in this particular moment it hit differently. A guy in his 40s, finding new ways to relate to his father. I’m in my mid-30s and suddenly that experience is no longer in the cards for me. That brief moment changed the whole texture and DNA of one of my favorite shows. No intubations, flatlines, or conversations about loss, and yet it choked me up. I’ve kept up the nighttimeFrasierroutine every night since, but that different perspective is always in the back of my mind now. As is the certainty that more moments like this are on the horizon.",

    "title": "Can Kat Abughazaleh Help Democrats Grow a Spine?",
    "article_text": "Kat Abughazaleh leans over her campaign manager’s shoulder as they review a video from her live appearance on CNN Max the night before. “I want to see if I rolled my eyes,” she says, eyes locked on the screen. “I feel like I did.” It’s late March, less than a week after Abughazaleh, 26, announced her run for Congress in Illinois’s Ninth District—a safe blue seat currently held by longtime incumbent Jan Schakowsky (who is, at 80, more than three times Abughazaleh’s age). Abughazaleh has never held office, but she does have a constituency: around 250,000 followers on both X and TikTok, where she has tracked Fox News misinformation,spoofed conservative “comedians,”and critiqued Republicans and Democrats alike (millions more have come across her viral videos and posts in their feeds). Now, though, she’s testing what it means to translate that internet influence and persona into a real campaign and, ultimately, policy. Onscreen, anchor Jim Sciutto pivots from questions about inflation and Democratic inaction to the subject of transgender health care and whether Democrats have moved too far left. The screen splits between Sciutto and Abughazaleh, seated in front of her signature blue microphone. She doesn’t flinch (but yes, she does roll her eyes). “Absolutely not,” she replies. “The idea that Democrats lost the election because of trans people is ridiculous and offensive.” She goes on to explain that trans and queer communities are often the first targets under “authoritarian and fascist regimes”—and that reinforcing those narratives only strengthens authoritarian power. The real problem, she argues, isn’t messaging but disconnection. It’s that voters don’t feel heard, that the political system is run by politicians who are fundamentally out of touch. It’s the kind of moment that another first-time congressional candidate and her campaign manager might later dissect, anticipating any potential backlash. Abughazaleh rushes to post it on her channels. “No, We Aren’t Losing Over Wokeness: Explaining Why Dems Can’t Move Right With CNN’s Jim Sciutto” she titles her YouTube clip. She makes her eye roll the thumbnail, then shares the link on BlueSky (the X alternative that has attracted the MSNBC set, where she has about 180,000 followers), writing:This is the type of rhetoric you can expect from me as a Congresswoman. I have no interest in debating fake narratives and human rights. Abughazaleh has stepped into the political arena at a moment when the Democratic Party finds itself in an existential spiral. While party leaders debate how—or even whether—to confront rising authoritarianism, Abughazaleh has already picked a side. When she announced her run for Congress on March 24 with a two-minute video, her message was blunt: Democrats need to grow a spine. The launch felt less like a campaign kickoff and more like a rallying cry. And it worked. Within a week, Abughazaleh raised over $300,000, with an average donation hovering around $32. Headlines followed inThe Washington Post,Newsweek,Vanity Fair,The Hill, and others. Her video reached 350,000 views on TikTok and another 130,000 on YouTube. One thousand people also signed up to volunteer for the campaign. Elsewhere, Democratic leaders’ approval ratings have slumped, and a majority of Americans say it’s time to remove the aging political old guard in favor of new, less elderly leadership. Abughazaleh’s campaign raises a set of questions the Democratic Party has yet to answer with any coherence: What does the party’s future actually look like? Could it (should it?) be populist leftist candidates who dismantle the establishment and reject neoliberalism? Or, as Scuitto suggested in his questions (and influential centrist thinkers like Matthew Yglesiasargue), are more-moderate politicians better positioned to win back voters and stop Trump from destroying American democracy? These aren’t abstract concerns. Abughazaleh is a half-Palestinian, Gen Z woman running in the post-Roe,unleashed-Trump era. She’s unapologetically left and already a lightning rod for conservative ire. She also knows the right-wing echo chamber inside and out—the full MAGA cinematic universe—and she’s happy to dive headfirst into the culture wars. Her candidacy could prove to be a blip or a bellwether. But in the yearlong lead-up into the primaries, as Trump presumably continues to run roughshod over our economy, institutions, and the rule of law, and the balm of a blue-wave midterm seem impossibly far off, Abughazaleh will help answer a critical question: Can Democrats summon even a spark of excitement from the depths of their darkness? “The establishment Democratic opinions are calcified,” says Hasan Piker, a progressive media personality whose Twitch streams and YouTube content have made him a key figure in leftist internet discourse (if not the “liberal Joe Rogan”). “And too little too late on the policy side. We need bold actionable changes and people who will fight for those changes. This is what makes Kat a great fighter for the moment.” Younger candidates know what they believe in, says Amanda Litman, cofounder and executive director of Run for Something, an organization that recruits and supports young progressive candidates in down-ballot races. “They're showing you who they are to build trust. That’s what the Democratic Party needs now more than ever—to rebuild trust with voters.” Several of these new challengers have already announced their candidacies. They include Jake Rakov, a 37-year-old opposing 70-year-old Rep. Brad Sherman, and Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, who has mounted a challenge against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And there’s Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist, running for mayor in New York City. Millennial and Gen Z candidates know the digital ecosystem in a way older politicians who aren’t named Trump simply don’t. “Kat has a very pragmatic approach to the internet,” saysGarbage Daywriter Ryan Broderick, who has written extensively about the online right and followed Abughazaleh’s career for several years. “She understands how to play the game.” While many establishment Democrats are still stuck in what Broderick calls “2010s liberal cringe,” Abughazaleh’s tone is much more current. “It’s both earnest and playful, but serious when it needs to be. She’s willing to step into the ring and say, This game is rigged. It’s broken. And they’re lying to you.” After graduating from George Washington University, Abughazaleh started working at Media Matters, a progressive nonprofit focused on monitoring and correcting conservative misinformation in US media. Her job was to watch hours of Fox News, tracing how a lie moved from a Tucker Carlson monologue to a chyron to a congressional talking point. After work, she started turning the camera on herself, posting videos that unpacked what she’d seen. Her clips began circulating and she quickly built a viewership. Abughazaleh’s recent CNN appearance marked an early attempt to apply her online fluency to more traditional media streams. The segment’s real life, however, began once she clipped, re-captioned, and circulated it on social platforms, where political identity is increasingly shaped. Less than a week after Abughazaleh posted the edit, it had already racked up nearly 50,000 views on YouTube and another 33,000 on TikTok. Campaign donations ticked upward too. There’s a dark side to viral fame, of course, especially for a young woman. Abughazaleh has blond hair, round blue eyes, and symmetrical features, and she leans into a femme aesthetic. “I have all the makings of a trad wife, except what comes out of my mouth and what’s going on in my brain,” she says wryly. The contrast seems to short-circuit something in the minds of online trolls and inspire a particularly deranged strain of hate. “It drives them insane. They get so confused and triggered by women they’re attracted to.” To illustrate this for me, she pulls up the hundreds of comments on her campaign-announcement video. Nestled among the racist jokes about her name and epitaphs like “Marxist cunt,” there’s one that reads,“How can someone so hot have such bad opinions?” “You don’t have to say that!” she exclaims. “No one is forcing you to call me hot while you insult me.” That comment reminds her of another one she read recently. “Some guy told me he was jacking off to my video and it de-radicalized him,” she says, deadpan. “Like, I’m glad you’re not a Nazi anymore but also, come on.” Among the many men Abughazaleh has managed to piss off is one of the most powerful in the country. In 2023, Elon Musk sued Media Matters for defamation after the organization published a report showing that major brands’ ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content on X. Last summer, Musk’s lawyers deposed Abughazaleh for, according to her, nothing more than “mean tweets.” While she can’t speak about the ongoing lawsuit, Abughazaleh doesn’t hold back when it comes to Musk himself. “He wants to be liked so bad. He bought an entire website [Twitter, now X] to make people like him, and it didn’t work,” she says. “In fact, people hate him so much that he can wave millions of dollars underneath their noses and they still won’t like him. Elon Musk is a loser.” The opportunity to confront men like Musk motivated Abughazaleh to run. Few things toughen a person faster than being an outspoken young woman on the internet. And after years of fending off trolls, Abughazaleh is ready for a bigger fight. “People are begging their representatives to do something,” she says. When members of the DOGE team forced their way into government networks, including the federal payment system, politicians “should have been standing arm-in-arm in front of every single treasury entrance. They shouldn’t have let Elon Musk's goons in there.” The thought that Democrats sat back and let it happen infuriates Abughazaleh. “People want to know that they’re being defended and that someone cares about their rights. They gave you this job, so you should do it.” And if not, Abughazaleh adds, “I will.” In person, Abughazaleh defies the caricature of someone shaped by internet outrage. A few days before the CNN interview, I sit with her in a café on Chicago’s North Side, where she’s hosting her first campaign “office hours.” Under skies hesitating between winter and spring, Abughazaleh radiates a kind of seasonal optimism. She’s dressed in a blue linen romper, a loose-knit fruit-themed sweater, and Cloudnova sneakers in a muted 1970s orange-and-pink colorway. She’s warm and at ease among the half-dozen strangers who’ve come to meet her. The idea that the current system isn’t working unites the small group gathered here. And Abughazaleh intends to run a different kind of campaign, one that invests funds back into the community rather than spend money on consultants and traditional advertising. At her launch event, for example, Abughazaleh asked for period product donations rather than an entrance fee. At this table, Abughazaleh’s strategy is met with enthusiasm—not just because she’s trying to build a ground game from scratch, but because her supporters see her approach as the only way to outmaneuver the Democratic machine. “AOC caught the Democrats sleeping at the wheel,” one supporter says. “They thought, Hispanic girl, bartender, whatever—she’s not going to be a problem. They were wrong. And once it started, they couldn’t stop it. They had to give her a seat at the table. And now, they’ll never let themselves get caught like that again.” On Fox News, anchor Jesse Watters called Abughazaleh a “far-left influencer” hijacking the Democratic Party. But Abughazaleh has also been asked in good faith about why she is challenging Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, a popular, vocal, and progressive representative for IL-9, who has run almost entirely unopposed in primaries since she took office in 1999. Abughazaleh has said Schakowsky has been good, but she will be better. (As of early April, Schakowsky had not yet announced whether she’d seek reelection.) For the young man at the café, though, Abughazaleh’s appeal is obvious. “Kat’s authentic,” he says. “She’ll take care of her people and she’ll fucking fight.” One key issue that distinguishes Abughazaleh from most American politicians, including other Democrats, is her stance on Gaza. Outspoken in her criticism of the war, she has been labeled “anti-Israel” by opponents—a tag that could prove difficult to shake in her district, where many voters are Jewish. (Schakowsky has also supported resolutions to limit arms transfers to Israel, citing humanitarian concerns.) “It’s pretty basic,” Abughazaleh says. “I believe in basic human rights. War crimes are a bad thing no matter who commits them. No matter who they’re being committed against.” Whether her positions resonate with people outside Abughazaleh’s regular orbit—like the younger Americans who are“more likely to sympathize with the Palestinian people than the Israeli people”—remains harder to measure. And incumbency is very hard to overcome, especially in a race where the incumbent is a respected progressive with deep Chicago roots and the newcomer is especially new—Abughazaleh only moved to Chicago last July. But in many ways, says Run for Something’s Litman, the campaign will send an important message, regardless of the outcome. “If Kat’s campaign inspires even 10 more like her to run,” says Litman, “that in itself is a victory.” “I’m going to tell people exactly what I care about and what I believe in,” says Abughazaleh. “And if they don’t like it—well, that’s democracy, baby.”",

    "title": "Everything You Need to Know About the Mets’ Collab With New York or Nowhere",
    "article_text": "In just five short years, the lifestyle brand New York or Nowhere has become nearly as ubiquitous in the five boroughs asblock-long lines, bacon egg ‘n cheeses, and people awkwardly carrying enormous plants they bought on Facebook Marketplace home on the subway. The popular label has already partnered with New York institutions likeSaturday Night Liveand the New York City marathon on previous collections—as well as theKnicks,Yankees, and Rangers—and now it’s time for the Mets to get in on the fun. Photo courtesy of New York or Nowhere The Mets collection—which drops today, following ateaser campaign starring franchise legend Mike Piazza—includes varsity jackets, T-shirts, hoodies, crew necks, and baseball hats. There’s children’s apparel, too, so the whole family can be decked out in NYON when they trek to Citi Field. For a label as predicated onNYC cultureas New York or Nowhere, continuing to work with the city’s beloved sports teams is a home run (and, in this case, keeps impassioned Mets fans from screaming at them about being left out). A few days before the threads went on sale, GQ caught up with NYON creative director Quincy Moore, as well as James Benesh, the Mets’ VP of Ballpark Experience, to get the inside scoop on how these two inescapable Big Apple cultural forces merged. Quincy Moore:One of my earliest memories is going to Mets games at Shea [Stadium] in the ’90s with my dad. Bobby Bonilla was my favorite player at the time, and we’d always sit behind the third base dugout so we could cheer him on. I’ll never forget how the stadium would literally shake after the Mets made a big play. Airplanes constantly flying overhead. Concrete and rusty seats. That place was rough around the edges and I loved it! The Mets have always had soul, but now it feels likethere’s an aura surrounding the team, especially after last season’s magical run and the [Juan] Soto signing. They deserve all of our attention. They’re one of the best organizations—with the most loyal and passionate fans—in professional sports. James Benesh:Over the past few years, our vision for team merchandise has evolved beyond the standard ballpark apparel. We’ve made a concentrated effort to focus on strategic collabs with culturally relevant, fashion-forward lifestyle brands. That’s allowed us to expand and offer a much wider array of female offerings and streetwear pieces. This started withAimé Leon Doreand Siegelman Stable, and now partnering with New York or Nowhere is a huge next step. Our fans have been clamoring for a collaboration with New York or Nowhere for quite some time, and we’re happy we can deliver with such an extensive collection from the iconic brand. It’s a partnership that just makes sense for both parties. We can’t wait to see these pieces in our ballpark and on thestreets of New York City! Photo courtesy of New York or Nowhere Moore:The varsity jacket is the most iconic piece ofAmerican sportswearthat exists. It’s timeless, endlessly stylish, and lends itself incredibly well to various interpretations and fabrications. This collection includes three variations of the same silhouette—one with a wool body and leather sleeves, one in 100% cotton twill for more of aworkwearvibe, and the last in this beautiful Japanese satin that feels equal parts nostalgic and now. We finished them off with multiple forms of embroidery, including chenille and appliqué, as well as a trio of sleeve patches. As a designer, the varsity jacket is easily my favorite canvas. It sets the perfect foundation for a collection like this, which is ultimately rooted in heritage and fandom. Moore:The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. This project has been in motion for over two years, and the Mets have been incredible partners throughout. They’ve trusted our vision from the jump, which I think has resulted in some of our strongest work as a brand to date. Players have shown a lot of love, too. We create these collections for the fans, first and foremost, but it’s always icing on the cake when the squad embraces the product as well. Pete Alonso has worn NYON in the past, so we made sure he was the first guy to receive pieces from the collection. [Francisco] Lindor requested a bunch of stuff. The GOAT—that’s the greatest owner of all time—Alex Cohen wore one of the varsity jackets to the first home game. The response has been pretty humbling, both internally and externally. Benesh:We’re thrilled with what we’ve seen. Not only does the look and feel of the collection marry our brand’s history and imprint with New York or Nowhere’s fashion-forward take. But beyond that, we’re happy that we can offer our fans such an extensive collection. Fromhoodies, hats and shirts, to streetwear apparel like jackets and accessories, there’s a New York or Nowhere piece for all of our fans, adults and kids alike. Moore:Each collection always informs the next. Our work with New York sports teams started with the Knicks back in 2018, which eventually led to projects with the Yankees, Rangers, andnow the Mets. Having the opportunity to iterate has allowed us to refine our design process and gain a deeper understanding of what makes this type of product resonate with the fans. There’s a secret sauce, for sure, but the recipe continues to evolve. Moore:All I’ll say is that theYankeesmade the World Series after we dropped our collab with them last season. Hopefully we’ll bring the Mets similar luck!",

    "title": "The Best Christopher Nolan Movies",
    "article_text": "Christopher Nolan is the biggest brand-name movie director since the days ofSteven SpielbergorGeorge Lucas, which puts him in the running for biggest brand-name movie director of all time, at least in the realm of English-language cinema. (Although: His movies are overseas sensations, too.Tenetdidn’t make $350 million worldwide off of a blockbuster U.S. release.) The strange thing about this is that Spielberg at his commercial peak was considered a populist, a director whose name became synonymous with big, mass-appeal hits and his ability to make them. Especially post-Batman, Nolan seems uniquely well-positioned to engineer those hitsfromhis name, maintaining a perception that he’s an artsy auteur even as he makes billion-dollar smashes. He’s a fusion, then, of Spielberg-level monocultural ubiquity and dorm-room-poster quasi-alternative cool—which is to say, for hardcore film people, he’s probably come to seem more than a little square, a basic-bro cliché refreshed for the geek generation. (The James Cameron of Stanley Kubricks?) That’s more about perception of his movies than their vivid alternate realities, however. Despite his nerdy British rep, the increasing size and scale of Nolan’s work is best expressed by the smooth insinuation of Eames,Tom Hardy’s character inInception: “You mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.” His work calls back to noir and war pictures while looking ahead with sci-fi headiness; the further into his career he gets, the more distinctive and inimitable his style becomes, interestingly dependent on editing, score, and tempo as much as a purely visual signature. It’s a fascinating evolution for a filmmaker whose work so often hinges on men who struggle for some greater, perhaps impossible control over their environment. The best Christopher Nolan movies make big-budget blockbusters feel like canvas for art, rather than endless monetization machinery. There’s not a bad film in the bunch, so let’s rank them all. Isn’t it kind of nice to have a designated last-place dweller on this list that likely won’t bother anybody? Surely there are someFollowingpartisans, and there’s plenty to like about Christopher Nolan’s debut; before you even get to the hooky budget-noir premise – an aspiring novelist starts following people at random and meets a criminal, becoming ensnared in his world of deception in the process – there’s the fact that it’s a 70-minute movie shot on black-and-white 16mm film, essentially a scrappy student film with the chops to score a limited indie release. But this is also a filmmaker who has excelled in the studio space, with the top-notch actors, practical effects, and bigger canvases those jobs have afforded him, so this one can’t help but look a bit slim by comparison. (In a clear case of “take what you can get,” this is the only Nolan movie in the Criterion Collection.) That said, it would be a kick to see Nolan pick up any of those limitations again, presumably still at a cost greater than the six grand or so this one supposedly cost; imagine the Nolan of 2025 turning in a movie under 90 minutes! Imagine the grain if he blew up a 16mm print to those IMAX screens!Followingis still very much worth seeing, and there’s no shame in its placement here. Who among us wouldn’t hope to place work we did in our twenties below what we worked up to afterwards? Almost all of Nolan’s movies bend time, whether through non-chronological editing, actual time-travel devices, or the occasional “Wait,howmuch time just passed?” elision. Though it creates zero temporal pincer movements,Dunkirkis one of his headiest time-trips, following a World War II troop evacuation from three cross-cut perspectives: characters in land, sea, and air. The unusual trick is that these three stories, though afforded similar amounts of screen time, cover different spans of action. The land evacuation takes place over one week, the sea material takes place over one day, and the air mission happens in a single hour. It’s likeInception’s dream-layered climax recreated in real life. On a purely practical level, the movie can be a little hard to follow, because it features a bunch of pasty, largely uniformed English guys running, sailing, and flying around in great numbers, depending on action far more than dialogue or characterization. Even more so than many of Nolan’s visually spectacular films,Dunkirkis best seen in a format that’s vanishingly difficult to actually attain: full 70mm film IMAX, which is available at all of about 20 U.S. locations. That’s why, terrifically visceral as it is, the movie doesn’t rate higher here; its full immersive effect (still occasionally imitated in films as diverse in style as1917andWarfare) can't be reproduced in your living room, no matter how big your TV is. On the other hand, Nolan’s most comfortably rentable at-home movie might be this remake of a 1997 Norwegian film that most buffs agree is the superior take on the material. But there’s something deeply appealing about a Nolan movie that now feels like an entry from an alternate universe where he became the best Warner Bros. auteur of TNT-ready programmers. Al Pacino plays a guilt-ridden cop sent to a night-free town in Alaska to investigate a serial killer—played by Robin Williams, in the more overtly evil but also less showy of his two against-type bad-guy roles of 2002. (The other is the more histrionic if still chillingOne Hour Photo.) Pacino v. Williams makes for a surprisingly effective and satisfying mid-movie face-off; it may not beHeat-level, but this is a rock-solid noir with capable support from Hilary Swank, Nicky Katt, and Maura Tierney. LikeFollowing,Insomniaalmost makes you wish there were a couple more of these in Nolan’s filmography before he gets to the big leagues (not that directing one of the best Pacino movies of the 2000s is exactly small potatoes). Boy, it would be perfect if the story ofTenet, obviously conceived well before its 2020 release date, had a stronger allegorical connection to COVID, because it feels like the movie’s reputation was very much forged and then re-forged in that particular crucible. Nolan notoriously agitated for Warner Bros. to make this erstwhile summer event movie the world’s big return-to-cinema marker in September 2020, before anyone had vaccines, to muted and uncomfortable overall reaction, exacerbated by the obtuse nature of the movie’s sci-fi plotting. (The not-even-subtext of the reactions included a bit of: All of that, forthis?) Then, when it did hit streaming, it was gradually embraced as the kind of opulent Pure Cinema studios have largely refused to make in recent years, especially as many people tried to forget about the pandemic, whether to escape for a couple of hours to put the trauma out of mind. To that end, maybe there’s something to be said for the movie’s villain (Kenneth Branagh) essentially deciding that the world might as well end for everyone else if it’s going to end for him; there’s a glimmer of both pandemic-era selfishness and doominess to that monstrous yet weirdly relatable instinct. Or maybe the movie works as a testament to the much-needed power of human connection, because while the time-in-reverse mechanics are often baffling in the moment, the movie works in large part because of the bittersweet camaraderie forged in the midst of all this, between the unnamed Protagonist (John David Washington) and his guide through the twilight world (Robert Pattinson, appropriately). Regardless: Despite its hinkiness feeling like it belongs in some as-yet-unreached Nolan Late Period,Tenetrocks, and may IMAX rep screenings play it back forever. At the time of its release,Batman Beginswas the second-bestBatmanmovie in a walk, so it’s wild that it lands as far down as number eight in Nolan’s canon, behind two additional Batman movies, among others. It’s easy to underrateBeginsbecause it’s a bit more modest, a bit more of a pulpy origin story, than the more ornately ambitious sequels (one of which is quite underrated in its own way). It’s also easy to overrate it for being the first blush of Nolan’s crime-saga take on the Caped Crusader; the relief this represented after the overblown, smirky garishness ofBatman & Robinis difficult to convey to those who weren’t waiting with bated breath for a Bat-movie corrective for eight years following that Clooney-led debacle. (By contrast, it only took Warners four years to re-introduce a live-action Batman after Nolan’s mega-successful Dark Knight trilogy ended.) In the end, it’s also easy to rateBatman Beginsexactly right: As a perfect introduction ofChristian Baleinto the Bruce Wayne/Batman role and one of the most rigorously satisfying superhero origin stories ever made. The movie that should have banished a lot of empty comparisons between Stanley Kubrick and Christopher Nolan instead locked us in for another decade of them, simply because Nolan used a lot of practical effects to shoot a relatively grounded-looking (if still probably scientifically wack) movie set partially on spaceships.Interstellaris a vastly more sentimental movie than anything Kubrick ever made, especially2001, and what it lacks as a visionary trip, it tries to make up in Nolan’s most blatant tearjerking, as in the scene where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) returns from a time-dilated mission on a far-off planet, seeking a new settlement for the people on Earth, and watches a series of video messages where his children age decades and give him up for dead. It’s especially moving coming from a filmmaker so fixated on the flexibilities of time—an acknowledgment of how some things are immutable, whether it's time’s passage or (as Anne Hathaway’s character argues) the enduring nature of love. It’scornyand beautiful! And while Nolan has been accused of humorlessness, this movie also has a sassy talking robot; truly, something for everyone. I know the movie that won Christopher Nolan some much-deserved Best Picture and Best Director Oscars should probably rate higher; the degree of difficulty involved in making nearly a billion dollars off of a three-hour historical drama about the creation of the atom bomb (and, more impressively, the personal fallout of that creation) is insanely high, andOppenheimeris a hell of an achievement: in getting a bunch of IMAX theaters to play a movie with a bunch of black-and-white scenes; in exposinga bunch of dadsto elliptical and non-linear editing with a stunning lack of exposition; in Nolan ensemble-marshaling in general and briefly remindingRobert Downey Jr.that he’s a real actor in particular; in becoming one of the first movies to kinda feel like a doomscroll but, somehow, not really in a bad way? It’s also a neat companion piece to something likeFirst Man, as it chronicles those crucial first steps toward a possible end of the Earth. (See what I mean about the doomscroll?) The only thing that places this excellent movie out of the top five is the nagging sense that sometimes Nolan’s most serious-minded projects also tend to be his most workmanlike. He’s a sci-fi guy at heart—which is also what gives the movie’s build toward the bomb a hurtling, chilling grandeur. Nolan may have been launched to the next level by big-budget franchise filmmaking, but he knows his way around an ending, and even his middle-of-the-trilogy movie finds a perfect non-cliffhanging stopping point—to such an extent that Nolan actively wondered if he could or should follow upThe Dark Knightat all. He eventually did, with perhaps his most undervalued movie, one that patiently awaits the reclamation so many of his “disappointing” blockbusters enjoy a few years later; the sheer size and scope of this thing is a wonder to behold, especially in a subgenre that so often rushes to world-in-the-balance stakes in stories that nonetheless look and feel pixelated and rinky-dink.The Dark Knight Rises, following Bruce Wayne’s return to the Batman cowl for one last ride eight years after the events ofThe Dark Knight, is an intensely physical movie, befitting a trilogy-capper where Wayne has to strap on a semi-magical leg brace just to continue his Batman antics. He’s joined by an idealistic orphan cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and some kind of Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway); is there a more swoonworthy moment in the Nolan canon than Bruce and Selina fighting henchmen together on the Gotham rooftops? (Probably, but not for me!) Basically, everything inThe Dark Knight Risesthat has incited mass eyerolls – Tom Hardy’s voice-mask combo as bad guy Bane (heavily reconfigured from the comics); the fact that Batman escapes a pit of eternal despair in an undisclosed location and rolls back into Gotham with absolutely no intervening scenes explaining how he got back there; “Robin” – is actually pretty awesome, especially in service of a rare degree of actual superhero-story closure. I know this probably “shouldn’t” be ahead ofOppenheimer, but which one would I be up for rewatching, like, right now? “OK, so what am I doing? Oh, I’m chasing this guy. No, he’s chasing me.” It’s probably the biggest laugh in the Nolan filmography, and it doubles as a high-concept synopsis ofMemento,the reverse-chronological story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), a guy with a hell of a short-term memory problem trying, with a doggedness that seems admirable at first, to solve the mystery of his wife’s death. Informational tattoos, helpful-hint Polaroids, Carrie-Anne Moss as a possible femme fatale, Pearce looking befuddled, Joe Pantoliano going “Lenny!”… the imagery, touchstones, and performances ofMementomay be smaller-scale than much of what followed in Nolan’s career, but they’re just as indelible, a necessary reminder that the best Christopher Nolan movies need not cost $200 million to stun us. If anything, his breakout indie hit looks even smarter in (a ha!) retrospect, especially in terms of what it didn’t portend about his future movies. Specifically, it was probably wise of Nolan to mostly abandon the big-twist mechanism that finishes this particular movie with such elan, lest he becomeM. Night Shyamalan(which would ultimately be fine from an artistic point of view, but it's got to be annoying to constantly hear your endings described as “twists”). Instead, the movie’s finale lingers less for the audacity of its rug-pull than its chilling rumination on memories and how we mold them to our use. Two magicians tussle dishonorably for authentic wonder in this Nolan Brothers adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel (Jonathan Nolan makes his first credited return to Christopher’s films since co-writingMemento). I know I just got through praising Nolan for not over-relying on twists, andThe Prestigehappens to have a doozy of one up its sleeve. But this film—perhaps the definitive feature-length attending of that Arthur C. Clarke quote about sufficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic—is precisely about methods of sleight-of-hand, whether old-fashioned commitment or futuristic breakthroughs. It also features one ofHugh Jackman’s very best performances, playing a guy who will do anything to become the greatest showman—a far more interesting precursor, then, to his edgeless, cuddly P.T. Barnum from the hit musical a decade later. We expect to see Christian Bale characters behaving obsessively (and his character here feels like a darkly funny comment on nutty actorly discipline), but there’s something particularly eerie about finding the darkness in Jackman’s top-hatted soul. On top of all that, there’s terrific cinematography, production design, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, andDavid Bowieplaying Nikola Tesla. Plenty of other filmmakers would go to outlandish lengths to make a movie this good. It’s a classic for a reason, mergingEmpire Strikes Backshit-gets-real portent withReturn of the Jedi-style cross-cut momentum. Not to always tell it to you inStar Wars, butThe Dark Knightalso finds further kinship with the future entryThe Last Jedi; both movies obviously connect to and deepen their predecessors while working remarkably well as stand-alone stories. (Hence Nolan’s aforementioned reluctance to even make a third Batman movie, though I’m glad he ultimately didn’t pass, orRise of Skywalkerit.) We’ve all read endless run-downs of how greatThe Dark Knightis, and we’ve all seen multiple Joker performances that still live entirely in the shadow of the workHeath Ledgerdoes here, while never managing to be as funny, scary, or original. It’s not just Joker, though. What’s especially funny and strange is that this movie helped kick off an age of Batman saturation we’re still living in; the eight-year gap between Joel Schumacher'sBatman & Robinand Nolan'sBatman Beginsnow seems unthinkable, and in fact it’s far more likely that there will be multiple ongoing movie Batmen at once than none at all. Yet no matter what you think of the individual variations, it’s hard to shake the feeling that this one will be impossible to top. In his own thrilling and slightly self-serious way, did Nolan help gradually kill off the illusion of a healthy long-term superhero cinema?! The obligatory complicated movie that’s at least partially about the complications of moviemaking,Inceptionhas ample opportunities to disappear up its own ass. (If ever there was perfect timing to produce a boondoggle, it would be following the billion-dollar success ofThe Dark Knight.) Yet this dream-heist sci-fi action-drama, where thieves plug into deeper and deeper levels of subconscious to implant and/or steal valuable ideas, somehow maintains a light touch amidst all of the usual straight-faced menace. Yes, the Nolan narrative and stylistic tropes are all here: the obsessive protagonist; the dead wife; the attempt to impose control; the pacing and cutting that sometimes feels like an endless rising montage. Don’t they have to be, working in concert, to play out so well? The stock criticisms ofInceptionare, unsurprisingly, actually describing secret strengths: The torrents of exposition offered to Ariadne (Elliot Page) don't just give the audience the opportunity to catch up on the movie’s heady rules; they’re actively fun and playful, as crucial to drawing us into the mission as scenes where the leader lays out the blueprint for an impending heist. The lack of blatant surrealism in the dreamscapes, meanwhile, reflects the control that mastermind Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) must attempt to exert in order to manipulate his subjects (and, not unimportantly, is also true to a lot of actual dreams)—and, of course, the recognizable reality that so many big-screen dreams try to stay rooted in, at least on some level. “Always imagine new places,” Dom cautions Ariadne, not to let imagination run wild but for the safety of distinguishing dream from reality. That tension between drilling further into familiar-but-different imaginary spaces—living in that slow-motion shot of the vehicle hurtling off the bridge— and coming back up for real-world air makes the movie more than its rollercoaster of indulgences. It’s a certain kind of magic-trick experience that you can’t stop watching, in hopes of spotting that little wobble of reality. Put in a less convoluted way: Movies likeInceptionare why I love movies.",

Led by professor Nikku Madhusudhan, the group of researchers studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules that, on Earth, are produced only by living organisms like marine algae. Naturally, the astronomers behind the study,publishedWednesday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters are not jumping to any conclusive statements on the matter, but that isn’t dampening excitement at the preliminary discovery. “This is a revolutionary moment,” Dr. Madhusudhan said during a conference on Tuesday, while also emphasizing that no one is claiming to have found life. “It’s the first time humanity has seen potential biosignatures on a habitable planet.” Hopes for continuing this level of research and exploration face an uphill battle as PresidentDonald Trumphas moved toslash NASA’s science budgetby nearly half under an early version of the administration’s proposed budget to Congress; terminating billions of dollars and effectively pulling the rug out from under current and potential research like Habitable Worlds Observatory, an upcoming NASA mission which could build on Dr. Madhusudhan and his team’s findings. In a statement, NASA pointed to astudyof Hycean exoplanets—which researchers proposed K2-18b could be classified as—as a new frontier for scientists, but one that “requires tens to hundreds of hours of observing time for a single planet.” “To deduce the presence of life from an atmosphere alone, we would also need to know about the planet’s surface, interior, and environment,” the statement continued. “For biosignatures, context is key.” Without funding though, it's unclear whether American scientists could continue their search for context—or life.

    "title": "Ex-NPR Chief Says Public Media Could Have Better Prepared for a Trump Gutting",
    "article_text": "Vivian Schilleris familiar with Republican calls to defund public media. When Schiller, the former president and CEO of NPR,resignedin 2011, following the controversialfiringofJuan Williamsandvideosurfacing of a fundraising executive criticizing Tea Party lawmakers, the funding debate in Washington, which had beensimmering for decades, gotreignited. While such calls kicked upagainduringDonald Trump’s first presidency, three months into his second term, the risk of losing federal funding, says Schiller, is “greater than it’s ever been in the history of public broadcasting.” News came earlier this week that the Trump White House intends to ask Congressto rescind$1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. If the package is passed, it would have major ramifications for NPR and PBS, which rely on the taxpayer-funded corporation to maintain a broad collective of local member stations that serve communities across the country. The White House proposal comes on the heels of a fiery DOGE subcommitteehearingin which NPR president and CEOKatherine Maherand PBS president and CEOPaula Kergerdefended their respective organizations and the federal funding they receive. Trump ally and Georgia representativeMarjorie Taylor Greene,who served as chairperson for the hearing, accused both outlets of airing “propaganda” that is “brainwashing the American people,” and called for “the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.” Similar rhetoric came this week from the White House,which characterizedthe government as being “ripped off” by public media, and accused NPR and PBS of spreading “radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.’” In particular, the White House listed examples of coverage aroundgender,sexuality, andracethat it considered “trash.” In a Wednesday Fox News appearance, Office of Management and Budget directorRussell Voughtconfirmedthe rescission package proposal, including the CPB cuts, and accused NPR and PBS of liberal bias. “They are almost pioneering the cultural indoctrination of our kids, putting drag queens in children’s programs, doing documentaries on pushing for reparations, and dividing a country on the basis of race,” Vought said, adding that the administration is “excited about” the proposal to gut the funding pipeline. Kerger said in a Tuesday statement that “rescinding these funds would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations who rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets” and “without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.” Public television stations serve nearly 97% of the nation, regardless of zip code or income level, and PBS is viewed in 87% of non-internet homes, 56% of low-income homes, and 55% of rural homes, according to data from the company. Maher has also been making a public case for funding, echoing Kerger’s sentiments in aninterviewon Wednesday onAll Things Considered.“If federal funding goes away, that network is absolutely at risk, the quality of service, the ability to cover everyone, people who live in what would otherwise be news deserts,” she said. Maher framed NPR coverage on the local level as “tremendously important as a public service,” given that “about 20% of Americans live in an area without any other local news coverage other than their local public radio station.” The Corporation for Public Broadcasting currently allocates$535 millionannually to public media, a cost of around $1.60 per American taxpayer. The funds, however, are mainly allocated directly to NPR and PBS local member stations, both to maintain newsgathering resources and to license programming from their respective national organization. NPR receives about 1% of its annualoperating budgetdirectly from the federal government, with member stations receiving between 8 and 10%. Some of this then travels upstream to NPR when stations license content, which accounts for 30% of NPR’s revenue. As for PBS, the amount of funding varies slightly from year to year, but it currently sits at around 15% of their revenue, according to the organization. Earlier this month,TheNew York Timesreported the existence of a 36-pagedocumentput together by NPR executives in 2011 that explored what would happen to the organization if federal funding were to be revoked. The document acknowledged that most member stations barely operate at break-even and the slashing of federal funds would “cause up to $240 million to vanish and up to 18 percent of roughly 1,000 member stations to close.” Schiller, who also held high-ranking roles NBC, CNN, Twitter, andTheNew York Times,and is currently the executive director of Aspen Digital, dismissed the claims of liberal bias hurled at public media, telling me, “what this is really about is, frankly, an assault on the free press,” pointing to other recent White House efforts to attack the media, includingbarringthe Associated Press from the briefing room and Trumpsuingbroadcast networks over coverage disputes. Regardless, she says, “Independent journalism and federal funding, it’s a toxic mix.” Schiller adds that while she is shocked that it has taken this long for the funding disputes over public media to finally “blow up,” she believes that “the whole system will be better off” by severing all monetary ties. “I hope that this federal funding does not get rescinded this year,” she says, “but let this be a warning that the time now is to begin to move towards removing that reliance.” “I just wish now that they had taken the last 15 years to start moving along that model, as opposed to now having a gun to the head,” Schiller says.

I love this dress so much! It’s Chinese couture and it’s made by Guo Pei. It’s handmade by one Chinese woman and it took her two years to make. I found it online,”she toldVanity Fairat the time. “I was researching Chinese couture on the Internet and I found it.” A testament to just how inspiring the Met Gala’s theme can be. As the countdown toMet Gala 2025is underway, take a look back at ten years of extravagance, grandeur and history-making fashion. In 2015, the Met Gala celebrated China’s influence on Western fashion.

    "title": "Trump’s “Gold Card” Immigration Grift Might Actually Be Happening",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is building a system to process and sell so-called “gold card” visas to paying customers,accordingtoThe New York Times. That's right: the right to live in America is so sacred, the Trump administration seems to be implying, that issnatchingstudents off the street for writing critical op-eds andlocking upscientists for carrying frog embryos through customs—all while selling a path to citizenship off to the highest bidder. Donald Trumpfirstannouncedthe idea in February, saying that gold cards would provide a “route to citizenship” for “very high level people,” including, for instance, Russian oligarchs. “Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are nice people,” the president said at the time. Now, theTimesreports, work on that system is well underway. The people reportedly building it?Marko Elez, the software engineer who onceboastedthat he was “racist before it was cool” and that he wants “a eugenic immigration policy;” as well asEdward Coristine, the 19-year-old former intern who reportedlyworkedfor a cybercrime ring and goes by the online monikerBig Balls. Yes, really. Trump has said that the “gold cards,” which would replace EB-5 visas currently reserved for foreign investors, would go for $5 million a piece. It’s a remarkable level of grift even for this administration. But as experts have noted, Trump can’t lawfully eliminate Congress’s existing immigration laws any more than he can lawfully eliminate all of the spending Congress has allocated and that courts haveconsistentlyorderedhim to unfreeze. “People will be paying for something Trump cannot provide,”David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian think tank Cato Institutewrotein February. Even if Trump tried, Bier wrote, it’s unlikely to do the numbers he seems to think it will. “Even when high-net-worth individuals want to immigrate to the United States, the current immigration system usually provides those individuals with other, cheaper alternatives,” Bier wrote. Of course, as the last three months have shown, just because Trump can’t legally do something doesn’t mean he won’t. Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnicksaidlast week that the gold card program would begin “within a week and a half.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle TheResurrectionofDexter An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "José Andrés Lost 18 WCK Workers to the Violence of War. He Still Believes There’s Good in the World.",
    "article_text": "“Nobody needs to speak up or to have the feeling that they need to take sides,” says the Michelin-starred chefJosé Andrés.“But at the same time, we only live once.” Andrés, who owns more than 40 restaurants—DC’s Minibar holds two Michelin stars, and his restaurants Jaleo, Oyamel, Zaytinya, and China Chilcano have been awarded Bib Gourmands—is no stranger tospeaking his mind. In 2015, following then presidential candidateDonald Trump’s disparaging remarks about immigrants, Andréskilled a dealto haveone of his restaurants go into the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Last spring, amid Israel’s assault on Gaza, heposted a messageto PresidentJoe Bidenon X that read, in part, “I respect you @POTUS and think highly of you…but the ‘better tomorrow’ you are talking about starts by demanding @netanyahu to stop killing children, targeting humanitarian volunteers and press!” 'Change The Recipe' by José Andrés Bookshop Change the Recipe: Because You Can’t Build a Better World Without Breaking Some Eggs(Ecco), his new book, is far from a glitzy restaurant tell-all. Instead, it’s a collection of anecdotes—or what the chef describes to me as “ramblings” that coalesce into a personal philosophy of sorts.Born in Asturias, Spain, and raised in Barcelona, Andrés writes about growing up the son of nurses whose lives pivoted around food; he lovingly describes his mother’s blackened red pepper recipe, or the multiuse life lesson baked into a squabble with his dad over paella. (“If you want to cook, you must first learn how to master your fire.”) He writes of volunteering for the DC program Front Line Classes shortly after moving to the area, where he taught local families how to cook well on a budget. But the bulk of the book centers on Andrés’s work throughWorld Central Kitchen, theNGO he foundedwhen, during a 2010 trip to the Cayman Islands with Anthony Bourdain andEric Ripert,the 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti outside of Port-au-Prince. “I was watching the Caribbean sunset, drinking a great rum sour, when I decided I would stop watching and start doing something,” he writes. In the last five years alone, WCK reports, the organization partnered with restaurants across the United States to serve free meals in the early years of the pandemic, set up kitchen responses to such natural disasters as last year’s Southern US winter storm and this year’s Los Angeles fires, and has served, with the support of local volunteers, more than 276 million meals inUkraineand 110 million meals inGaza. The lifesaving impact has come at a cost. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine,Russian airstrikes have killed seven WCK volunteers. In April last year, the Israeli military targeted a World Central Kitchen three-car convoy ina series of drone strikes,killing all seven aid workers in the vehicles. (WCK had received route authorization from the Israeli Defence Forces; following an internal investigation,the IDF fired a major and a coloneland issued formal reprimands.) In November, a targeted Israeli airstrike on a car killed three more WCK aid workers and two others. Israeli officials claimed that one of the workers had been involved in Hamas’s October 7 attack,demanded an investigation in WCK hiring practices, and flagged more than 60 workers as security risks, with whom WCK subsequently severed ties. “This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,” the organization said in astatement. “We believe we had two options—to close operations in Gaza or adjust to [Israel’s] request. This decision protects Palestinian children and families that come to eat at our sites.” Late last month, WCK reported that Israeli airstrikeshad killed another volunteer, named Jalal, who was working at a community kitchen. The nonprofit continues to operate field kitchens andGaza’s sole remaining bakery,under what a spokesperson describes toVFas “the new normal” of Israel’s renewedaid blockade, producing 134,000 meals per day with “what stock we have remaining.” For Andrés, losing longtime friends and colleagues was, he writes, “one of the hardest moments of my life.” It isn’t a stretch to see howChange the Recipeserved as a balm. “This book comes from, in a very selfish way, to push myself to be happy and hopeful,” he says. “I always believe that we can all have that power to make each other better. We can also have the power to make each other, around us, worse,” he says. But he’s seen more of the former, he adds. “Friends helping friends, fathers helping their children, grandmothers giving wisdom. If you think about it, then the world is full of those moments.” Here, he talks about everything from childhood life lessons to a new project withMartha Stewart. Vanity Fair:You have worked in such difficult conditions. You’ve seen the worst of what humans can do to each other. And yet the book is shot through with hope. Where does that come from for you? José Andrés:I remember my mom, when I was little, would tell me when I would not like to eat something: “Children somewhere in Africa have nothing to eat today.” I believe that came out of care, but the way she delivered it was maybe not the best. But nonetheless, I wanted to take the good side of what she would tell me:Give value to this because you are lucky to have it. I remember being with these children in Gaza in a Qatari hospital building that was never finished. I went up to the roof to see from Rafah, everything going north, and a lot of bombs and fires in the distance, and explosions sometimes not too far from where we were. But the children were smiling. The children were in a very hard situation, still hopeful. They were living their lives. When you see people like that, the same in Israel or in Lebanon or in Ukraine or after a hurricane… when you see situations that you can argue are on the edge of what humans should be able to go through, and still see people that are hopeful, it’s very hard to come back home and complain about anything. I can cook whatever I want right now in my fridge and have every piece of equipment, and hot water, a garden. Not like I’m not entitled to complain—and I’m more the grumpy type—but that’s where the hope comes from, to try to fight against looking to the side when there is a problem. Trying to be a voice of trying tosolvethe problem. We all have that opportunity and responsibility. You work across the globe, but you live in Bethesda, Maryland, and have strong ties to DC. How does the capital feel to you right now? For me, DC right now, politically, we’re going…but I’ve been here since 1992, through different presidents, you know? I’ve seenBush’s andClinton’s andObama’s and Trump’s and Biden’s, and at the end, things keep going on. Obviously it’s a feeling right now that something dramatic is in the air, change is in the air. I wrote the entire book about change, and about why we had to improve FEMA and why we had to improve the Red Cross and others. I tried to do it with constructive criticism. I’m still trying to improve FEMA and improve USAID and improve the World Food Program. But one thing is working to improve, another thing is working towards complete breakdown. During Trump’s first full day in office, he tweeted that you and three other presidential appointeeswere fired. What did you make of that personal call out? Number one, I had already resigned. I was very nice, saying, “Mr. President, I’m sorry you were not informed.” I’m just one more person in a very long list of people that has been totally degraded with words, including people who are in the Trump cabinet, likeMarco Rubio.The message I want to send is, I may disagree with you, but there are ways you can do this, not bullying people. There are ways to do this without calling names. You can do this without trashing the lives and the careers of journalists trying to inform about you. I applaud the initiative of the first lady opening this “don’t bully” platform, whatever she calls it—Be Best. I would sincerely tell the first lady that I applaud the initiative, and I want to be on her team if she needs help, because she needs to start at home. In the book, you refer to Zelenskyy as one of the world’s great leaders. You met with him in Kiev in 2022. World Central Kitchen has been in Ukraine since the start of the war. Have you seen changes following his interaction with Trump and JD Vance at the White House? Are you worried about the work that you're doing? PresidentZelenskyyis the most respectful man—I’ve seen the love people have for him, even people that didn’t vote for him, even people that politically may disagree with him still have high respect for him. I’ve seen a man that has not used words disparaging even the people killing his people. He didn’t have words of insults towardsPutinor anybody else. I arrived in Kiev when the Russian tanks were still in the north of Kiev. That’s a moment I will always remember. In the interactions I had with him and his team and the different team members, I only see people that have a mission, which is saving their country, fighting for freedom, democracy. I love that President Trump wants to end the war, but we cannot forget who the aggressor was. And we cannot forget who began the war. I hope America and Europe and the rest of the world will be on the right side of history on this one. You included, in the book, the heart-wrenching memorial speech that you gave honoring the seven World Central Kitchen workers who were killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. You wrote that it was one of the hardest moments of your life. How have you been working through that grief? Well, I’m [just] one more guy [grieving them], right? There’s family members of those people. Zomi [Frankcom] I was very close with. We’ve been on many missions together. She had such a big smile and she was so beloved everywhere. She’s the one that told me—because I’m the one that has no patience for things—“José, there are other ways we can say things or do things.” She’ll be the one that will always do it with a beautiful smile and keeping everybody around her calm. I’m still coping with it myself, personally. That’s why, maybe, I didn’t address it more, because I wanted it to be a book about hope. One day I feel I’ll be like Bilbo Baggins, writing your memoirs before you go to the land of the elves. One day I’ll write this bigger book about my life moments. Obviously it’s a bleak thing, but out of that we keep going. And when that happened, some humanitarian aid was allowed to go in again, more countries put pressure onNetanyahu,stopping the massive blockade. I know great people in Israel trying to do the best they could to bring humanitarian aid. This has to be told too. [The World Central Kitchen workers] didn’t have to be there. They decided to go there. We are not going to change the world without taking some risks. At the end, the only way that any of these people were to be protected is if we were not there. The same in Ukraine. If the Ukrainians that perished feeding others, if they were not there feeding, they wouldn’t be attacked by drones or bombs. Humanitarians should not be targeted. Civilians should not be targeted. Ambulances should not be targeted. Hospitals should not be targeted. Press should not be targeted. I think that’s something everybody should be agreeing on. What happened happened. Obviously life must go on, but in that moment I thought, Let me move away from everything and just retire from the world. But if anything, it’s like, I think Zomi will be saying, “Are you kidding?Nowyou’re going to quit?” When that happened we were trying to bring food by boat. First time in almost 20 years that anybody arrives by boat to Gaza. And that cost the lives of the seven, but I thought [it] was [a] worthy effort [in providing aid to Gaza]. The truth is that those kitchens don’t belong to me, don’t belong to World Central Kitchen. They belong to the people of Gaza. To talk about a very different project: You’re cohostingYes, Chef!,which is about chefs with hot tempers? Can you tell me a little bit about the show? Yes, Chef!is great. Partnering with Martha Stewart is amazing. This is exactly what you see in many of the reality-type of shows, competition or not: these tempers…things happen. I guess it’s because it’s good for ratings, but sometimes it just happens, right? Humans, we’ve all had that moment. This show was this opportunity of bringing chefs, talented chefs, but instead of putting aside the imperfections that all humans [have], it’s just recognizing them and bringing them front and center. [There was more than one] time I raised my hand in the show and said, “Well, I’m guilty of that.” But this is about that, about becoming the better person you can be. Bringing out the best angels you have within you and putting inside those little demons we all have sometimes, that in some people explode bigger than others. Martha and I, we’re hosts, we’re judges, we are life coaches, sometimes sharing our own experiences, learning from moments we lived before. In an interview, Martha said that you’re a little bit of a prankster on set; that you hid rubber ducks. Listen, you spend a lot of hours on set for a few weeks. They become your family, everybody there. This is not just Martha and I and the 12 chefs. It’s 170 people in the production. You don’t have time to meet everybody. But it’s to make everybody feel more at ease. I always was the little boy that was the troublemaker. A good troublemaker. Do you ever have downtime? What do you do to relax? Oh, yeah. I’m a very blessed guy. You can look to the other side and go play golf, which I do, or go scuba dive, which I do. Or test the new kitchen that will allow humans to cook in the space station or on the surface of the moon. For me, everything is downtime. I find my time to collect cookbooks, to read, to listen to music, to watch movies with my wife, to play darts with my daughter. Now that I’m finishing with you, I’m going to go plant radishes, because my wife loves radishes and it’s the best gift I can give her. I’m going to plant them so in 40 days I can give her fresh radishes. So I find my time. But everything I do always is connected with food, believe it or not. It sounds like it. When I go scuba diving, I love to hunt for lionfish. It’s a great way to fight an invasive species. But then I do photography, and then I can tell the stories of why we need to preserve the ocean. [There’s] always a reason to be out there in the world and involved with the world, because again, everything is connected. And for me, that’s the fun. That comes through in the book. Did you enjoy it? It’s inspiring to see the infinite ways to help other people. I wrote this book in a little dark hole, and even still, it’s very upbeat. Probably I needed to write something like that. I’m glad I did it—because I think it’s a moment to be opening yourself to others, right? This interview has been edited and condensed.

    "title": "RFK Jr.’s Autism Quackery is Harrowing",
    "article_text": "April is Autism Acceptance Month. So how is our nation’s top health official marking the occasion? By setting the movement for autism acceptance back by…oh, just several decades. On Wednesday, Department of Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.held a news conference about a newreportby the Centers for Disease Control, whichshoweda continued rise in childhood autism diagnoses in the United States in 2022. The researchers behind the report found that growth is due in large part to increased screening for and greater identification of “previously underidentified groups.” But rather than cosigning those findings, Kennedy undermined them entirely. Casting autism as an “epidemic,” he dismissed the notion that increased diagnosis plays a role in these trends as a “myth of epidemic denial.” Kennedy called research into autism’s genetic origins “a dead end,” and instead vowed to get to the bottom of its alleged environmental cause by—you heard it here, folks!—September. To back up his point (which scientists involved in the CDC’s report immediatelyrefuted), Kennedy pointed to only the latest cutting-edge research…of the 1960s. In one study conducted between 1959 and 1965, Kennedy said, scientists found rates of autism as low as 4.7 in every 10,000 kids. As of 2022, the CDC’s new report showed the rate of autism in kids under 8 was 1 in 31. “Autism condition characterized by profound impairments in social communication and behavior would have stood out like a neon sign,” Kennedy said as if pointing to a smoking gun. But the point Kennedy is so obviously eliding is that, in the 1960s, autismwascharacterized by “profound impairments,” and now, it’s, well, not—hence the CDC’s findings. The definition of autism has changed several times over since the 1980s and now includes kids with Asperger’s Syndrome, a social disorder thatElon Muskhimself has said he was diagnosed with, and ADHD. “The more you look for it, the more you find,” Dr. Maureen Durkin, one of the authors of the CDC report, toldThe New York Times. There are also other known factors that contribute to rising autism rates, like the fact that people are having kidslater in life. Beyond his ideas about the origins of autism, Kennedy also appears to hold a dangerously archaic view of autistic people themselves. On Wednesday, he said autism “destroys” children, who he argued would grow up to “never pay taxes, never hold a job, never play baseball, never write a poem, never go out on a date.” (Tell that toDarryl Hannah) In one particularly harrowing moment, he described autistic kids as a strain on the country’s ballooning healthcare costs. Kennedy’s darkly antiquated address Wednesday was received as a setback not just for medical research, but also for autistic people themselves. “It's like saying, ‘You're not good enough and we’re going to change you for our own comfort.’ And we find that it’s a message that is very detrimental to the self-concept, self-esteem of young autistic people,”Zoe Gross, director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network,toldAxios. This, of course, was always where Kennedy’s journey as HHS secretary was going to lead. The man whose vaccine quackery oncegothis non-profit banned from Facebook tried tosanewashhis own views during confirmation hearings in January. But as one of his fellow anti-vaccine crusaderstoldStat News, “He’s the same Bobby Kennedy.” Just now, with a lot more power.

Though the king’s treatment is still ongoing, this year he and the queen traveled together to Durham Cathedral to hand out the annual Royal Maundy money to 76 men and women, a number chosen to reflect the king’s age. This year’s gift also includeda special £5 coincommemorating the Queen Mother, with a message about World War II. The ceremony, which takes place during Holy Week in the run-up to Easter Sunday, honors recipients for outstanding Christian service in a different Church of England cathedral every year. On Thursday morning, the king also releasedhis annual Easter message, where he praised humanitarians who respond to the atrocities of war. “There are three virtues that the world still needs — faith, hope and love. And the greatest of these is love,” he wrote. “It is with these timeless truths in my mind, and my heart, that I wish you all a blessed and peaceful Easter.”’ The statement also mentioned the personal significance of the day’s event, emphasizing the connections between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. “On Maundy Thursday, Jesus knelt and washed the feet of many of those who would abandon Him. His humble action was a token of His love that knew no bounds or boundaries and is central to Christian belief,” the king continued. ”The love He showed when he walked the Earth reflected the Jewish ethic of caring for the stranger and those in need, a deep human instinct echoed in Islam and other religious traditions, and in the hearts of all who seek the good of others. The special outing comes just one week after the king, who also serves as the head of the Church of England, and queen met withPope Francisduring their royal tour to Italy.According to the palace, Charles and Camilla were “delighted” see the pope, who is recovering from a lengthy hospital stay for double pneumonia, and “to have had the opportunity to share their best wishes in person.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle TheResurrectionofDexter An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Natalie Portman Says She Was “Very Scared” by Childhood Fame, While Drew Barrymore Says She “Lost Everything”",
    "article_text": "Natalie PortmanandDrew Barrymoremay have survived childhood stardom, but it certainly wasn’t easy. This week, in two separate interviews, the Oscar winner and the talk show host opened up about their struggles as former childhood stars, with Portman discussing the “long Lolita phase” she experienced as a child actor, and Barrymore describing growing up in the spotlight as “a real car crash of a life.\" Portman was just 12 years old when she filmed her breakthrough role as Mathilda Lando, the young protégée of a hitman in 1994’sLéon: The Professional.In a conversation withJenna OrtegaforInterview,Portman described her experience being “really sexualized” as a child actor. “There’s a public understanding of me that’s different from who I am,” Portman, now 43, told Ortega. “I’ve talked about it a little before—about how, as a kid, I was really sexualized, which I think happens to a lot of young girls who are onscreen. I felt very scared by it. Obviously, sexuality is a huge part of being a kid, but I wanted it to be inside of me, not directed towards me.” Portman, who studied psychology from 1999 to 2003 atHarvardbefore returning to the entertainment industry, said that she actively tried to project a studious and bookish image to combat the unwanted attention. “I felt like my way of protecting myself was to be, like, ‘I’m so serious. I’m so studious. I’m smart,’ and that’s not the kind of girl you attack,’” she said. “It shouldn’t be a thing, but it worked.” Portman also shared that she felt that she’s had to navigate various “tropes” as an actress to avoid being pigeonholed. “At each phase in my career, there was a different one that I was, like, ‘Oh, I’ve got to avoid this,’” she told Ortega, whom she stars opposite in the forthcoming film,The Gallerist. “Obviously, there was a long Lolita phase. Then, there was the long ‘chick who helps the guy realize his emotional thing’ phase for about a decade… There’s a lot of the same tropes.” While Portman discussed navigating unwanted sexual attention as a child actor, Barrymore recalled her experience of trying to survive a tumultuous childhood in the spotlight. Born into a historic acting family, Barrymore cemented her place in the family business with her scene-stealing performance inSteven Spielberg’sE.T. The Extra-terrestrialas a seven-year-old. After the role launched her into stardom, Barrymore’s childhood was marked by turbulence, with Barrymore spending 18 months in a rehabilitation facility for drug and alcohol addictionwhen she was 13. “When I was 13, I truly lost everything. From my own doing,” she said on Wednesday’s episode ofThe Drew Barrymore Show.While she didn’t go into specifics, she described how difficult growing up in the public eye was. “I was never unprofessional, but I had a real car crash of a life, and I genuinely… Nobody wanted to work with me,” she said. “And I understood why, and I took responsibility for myself, but it was a great lesson.” While both Portman and Barrymore had their ups and downs as child actors, they both have taken lessons from the experience. Although she describes herself as being “stupid and silly” among friends, Portman says that she learned early on to keep her private life private. “I’m not a particularly private person in real life—I’ll tell you anything—but in public, it was so clear early on that, if you tell people how private you are, your privacy gets respected a lot more,” she said. “I set up a little bit of a barrier to be, like, ‘I’m not going to do photo shoots with my kids.’” Barrymore’s big takeaway? “To always be grateful.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle TheResurrectionofDexter An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "George Clooney Isn’t Sorry He Urged Dems to Dump Joe Biden—and Says Maryland’s Wes Moore Is His New Fave",
    "article_text": "George Clooneydoesn’t know if it was “brave” to write aNew York Timesop-edurgingJoe Bidento drop outof the presidential race, but he maintains it was his “civic duty” to break from the Democratic Party and make his stance clear. “I found that people on my side of the street—you know, I’m a Democrat in Kentucky, so I get it. When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that it was time” to go public, Clooney told CNN’sJake Tapperon Wednesday. Titled“I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,”Clooney’s piece was published in July, followingBiden’s catastrophic TV debate performanceagainstDonald Trump.After witnessing Biden’s demeanor at astarry Hollywood fundraiserattended byJulia RobertsandBarbra Streisand,Clooney concluded that he was no longer “the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” he wrote. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The actor added, “This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president.” The op-ed prompted derision from both sides, with some on the left resisting calls for a new Democratic presidential candidate and others attacking Clooney for speaking out in the first place as a Hollywood celebrity. EvenTrump bizarrely dunked on Clooney, calling him a “fake movie actor” for criticizing his then opponent. “I’m okay with that. I’m okay with criticism for where I stand,” said Clooney, who is currently starring as veteran journalist Edward R. Murrow in a Broadway adaptation of 2005’sGood Night, and Good Luck,a film he starred in, cowrote, and directed. “I defend their right to criticize me as much as I defend my right to criticize them.” Just less than two weeks after Clooney published his remarks, Biden diddrop outof the race. “President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He’s saving democracy once again,” Clooney said in a statement toCNNat the time, alsoexpressing support forKamala Harrisas his replacement on the ticket. In line with what he wrote in his original op-ed, Clooney believes there should have been a “quick primary” involving top Democrats likeAndy Beshear,the governor of Clooney’s home state of Kentucky, and Michigan governorGretchen Whitmer.“I think we have some really good governors,” Clooney told Tapper. “I think we would have sustained it, and [Harris] may have come out on top. I don’t know.” When asked to name his current favorite Democrats, Clooney said Maryland governorWes Mooreis “levitating above” the pack. He cited Moore’s response to the fatal March 2024collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, his combat service, and his tenure at aGeorge Soros–backed venture philanthropy organization. “He’s a proper leader,” he said. “I like him a lot. I think he could be someone we could all join in behind.” Clooney also stressed the importance of anointing a new star Democrat. “We have to find somebody—rather soon,” he said on CNN. “It’s our job now to put together a proper team to stand up.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle TheResurrectionofDexter An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Tina Fey, Hater of Celebrity Side Hustles, Says Her Impulse to Hide and Retire Is “Very Strong”",
    "article_text": "Tina Fey,whoonce declaredthat “authenticity is dangerous and expensive” when you’re in the public eye, nevertheless got candid about her plans to retreat from the spotlight in aHollywood Reporterinterview published Wednesday. “The impulse to hide and retire is very strong because I do think it’s time to help new voices get in the mix,” the 54-year-old said. “It’s something I’m already doing, but I want to do more. Even on the walk over here, I was like, I am so tired of hearing from me. Surely everyone else is tired of hearing from the same people over and over again.” Throughout the course of her career, Fey has helped create a slew of films and TV shows, includingMean Girls, 30 Rock, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,and the upcoming Netflix seriesThe Four Seasons,debuting on May 1. Now Fey straddles the line between championing fresher talent and being tapped to succeed a comedy giant. Case in point: In the interview, Fey dismissed the idea that she’d return tohost the Golden Globes, instead praising the awards show’s newest emcee, who will take on the role for the second year in a row: “Nikki Glaserkilled itat the Globes, and she should keep that job forever.” But when asked aboutSaturday Night Livecreator and producerLorne Michaels’s comment that Fey, a former head writer for the NBC sketch series, “could easily” take over for him, she replied, “It was nice of him to say that, and I love him very much,” but “he’s irreplaceable,” adding, “His set of gifts and skills are entirely unique. His eye for talent! He’s one of the last three people in show business who actually understand everything. I’ll leave it at that.” Recently, Fey has proven to be a voice of reason, notably publicizing her “problem with rich people having a side hustle” during an appearance on friendAmy Poehler’s podcast. Fey said that all she needed was to feel “safe” and to have “enough money to live,” explaining her objection to securing another source of income—like, say, a hair care or eyewear line—outside of showbiz. And when the time comes to step out of the spotlight, Fey will be happy to do so. “People who know me have said, ‘You wouldn’t be able to retire. You’d be so unhappy,’” she toldThe Hollywood Reporter.“Wrong! I’d still be busy all the time.

    "title": "Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star",
    "article_text": "About an hour into our flight, Joe Anoa’i tells me a secret: Roman Reigns isn’t going to win the Royal Rumble. As far as spoilers go, this is akin to finding out who was getting whacked onThe Sopranosthe night before an episode aired—and if James Gandolfini was tipping you off. Anoa’i, after all, knows Reigns the same way Gandolfini knew Tony Soprano. Or like Terry Bollea knows Hulk Hogan. Since 2012, Anoa’i has performed as Roman Reigns in the great American soap opera that is World Wrestling Entertainment. He has sculpted the character, tinkered with his look and mannerisms, ultimately transforming Reigns from an awkward “babyface” (good guy) to a commanding “heel” (bad guy). “I’m very passionate about being a storyteller, being able to dive into a character and wear a different skin,” Anoa’i says. “That’s the beauty of wrestling and what we do every single week. I can become this Roman Reigns guy.” They aren’t the same guy, not entirely anyway. Anoa’i is laid-back, a self-described introvert who says he’s most comfortable as part of a team; Reigns is domineering and megalomaniacal, qualities that he channels in his two-word catchphrase: “Acknowledge me.” Anoa’i is a father of five who performs morning drop-off duty; Reigns is known as the Tribal Chief, a Mob-style boss who rules over his family with an iron fist. But in professional wrestling, the best characters are often amplified versions of the performer. “We just turn the dial up,” he says. “My normal level is a 5 or a 4, but when it’s time to work, we turn it up to a 10 or an 11.” At this moment, somewhere above the southeastern United States, Reigns is nowhere to be found. It’s just Anoa’i and an entourage that includes his on- and off-screen collaborator Paul Heyman. We’re heading to Indianapolis for the Royal Rumble, one of WWE’s tentpole events. The winner of the rumble traditionally gets a title shot at WrestleMania, WWE’s equivalent of the Super Bowl, which for Reigns would mean yet another match against Cody Rhodes. They squared off at the previous two ’Manias, with Reigns losing the undisputed WWE universal champion title in last year’s main event. “Three in a row seems a bit much,” Anoa’i admits. “To keep different trajectories right now between Cody and I, keep us a little bit separate, isn’t a bad thing.” Anoa’i can stomach a loss as long as the best storyline wins. And like any member of an ensemble, he knows that even the star must occasionally step to the periphery in order to make way for other characters and arcs. “We have a nice cast of guys and superstars who can fill that role,” he says. Reigns has been the unquestioned headliner of that cast, holding the universal championship for three and a half years and appearing in a record nine main events at WrestleMania. (He will main event his 10th WrestleManiaon Saturday, the first of a two-night spectacle at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.) Those credentials have also made Reigns the face of WWE, a designation once bestowed upon the likes of “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and John Cena. What distinguishes Reigns is that he has been the marquee draw during the company’s most prosperous era. In 2023, WWE was acquired by Endeavor and merged with the Dana White–led Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), forming a publicly traded company called TKO Group Holdings that reportedly has a market cap of around $24.3 billion. Meanwhile, WWE’s flagship weekly program,Raw,is now on Netflix as part ofa $5 billion dealinked last year, making it just a click away from the likes ofStranger ThingsandSquid Game. In the Trump era, wrestling has been held up as a Rosetta stone for understanding modern politics. “To be honest,” Anoa’i says, “the world seems to be more like wrestling than any other form of entertainment.” Beyond pop culture, WWE’s sphere of influence has extended to politics, never more so than in our current epoch. Donald Trump himself was inducted in WWE’s hall of fame for his memorable cameo at WrestleMania in 2007, where he participated in the Battle of the Billionaires against Vince McMahon, the charismatic former WWE boss whose rise and fall was chronicled last year in a six-part Netflix documentary. Linda McMahon, Vince’s wife, served in Trump’s first administration and has been appointed secretary of education. (The couple are now separated.) WWE’s clout is such that someone like Anoa’i could conceivably land in WashingtonorHollywood, following the likes of Cena and Johnson from the ring to the silver screen. He had a small part inHobbs & Shaw,the 2019Fast & Furiousspin-off starring Johnson and Jason Statham. And inThe Pickup,a forthcoming heist comedy, Anoa’i will appear in a scene with Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer. “He probably shows as much charisma that I’ve ever seen from a celebrity or nonactor,” says Tim Story, who directedThe Pickup.“I think his future in front of the camera will be ridiculous.” Anoa’i will turn 40 in May, as evidenced by the faint streaks of gray in his long dark hair and beard. He is wary of his “bump card,” the number of knocks a wrestler absorbs before he can no longer step in the ring. There are, it seems, only so many times a guy can take a metal chair to the back. Anoa’i’s current deal with WWE expires after WrestleMania next year, and he admits that he is closer to the end than the beginning. “After I finish the contract that I’m in, we probably got another year or two max,” he says. “Then it’s time to take on a less physical form of entertainment.” Hours before we depart for Indianapolis, Anoa’i is in his personal gym for a preflight workout. He says he’ll keep it light this afternoon—just enough to give him a nice pump before the following night’s match, where he will go shirtless before a television audience of millions. As Anoa’i tells it, the quality of his physique can be gauged by the amount of clothing he’s wearing. “You can go through my history and see when I was in good shape or when I was covered up,” he says. Of course, what Anoa’i considers bad shape would be aspirational for most of us. And what he describes as a light workout spans three hours, leaving his black Jordan-brand T-shirt drenched in sweat. He and his trainer, Miguel Molina, take turns using various machines and dumbbells in a fully stocked gym located in the backyard of Anoa’i’s Miami-area mansion, which sits in a gated community that includes entertainers and professional athletes. Molina works with various NBA and NFL players, but Anoa’i is the rare client who is actually stronger. “I’m trying to keep up with him,” Molina says. Anoa’i’s intense fitness regimen, working out five to six days a week and adhering to a strict meal plan, is necessary to maintain his Adonis-like build. But he says it is also about giving him a sense of control—something today’s travel schedule threatens to rupture. “This flight will kind of fuck shit up a bit and make me hold a little bit of water,” he explains. That won’t do. If his look isn’t right, then his performance will suffer. And if his performance suffers—well, you get the idea. Anoa’i is a homebody, living with his wife, Galina, and their five children: two sets of twin boys, ages five and eight, and a daughter who will be a senior in high school in the fall. “My kids used to think I just work out for a living,” Anoa’i says. After the workout, both sets of twins wander into the gym, aimlessly exploring the equipment. As Anoa’i looks on, he predicts that at least one of the boys will follow his path to WWE. “They’re going to be nurtured to think, like, Well, everybody’s just living a wrestling life,” he says. “That’s what you’re supposed to do, just train and eat.” For Anoa’i, wrestling is as much a birthright as a family business. Dubbed the Samoan Dynasty, the Anoa’i clan is widely considered pro wrestling’s greatest family—although not every member is related biologically. “High Chief” Peter Maivia, who was the grandfather of Johnson, or The Rock, is considered the patriarch of the family. Maivia forged the connection with the family by taking a “blood oath” with Anoa’i’s grandfather Reverend Amituana’i Anoa’i. His father, Sika, formed a tag team duo with his uncle, Afa, known as the Wild Samoans, that rose to prominence in the 1980s. (Sika and Afa passed away within two months of each other last summer.) His brother Matt, who died unexpectedly in 2017, had performed in WWE under the name Rosey. Growing up in Pensacola, Florida, Anoa’i was nearly inseparable from his twin cousins, Joshua and Jonathan Fatu, who now perform in WWE as Jey and Jimmy Uso. Their father, Solofa Fatu, performed in WWE for years as Rikishi. Anoa’i’s parents separated when he was young, and while he lived with his “superhero” mother, Patricia, he recalls bonding with his father over wrestling. They followed the “Monday night wars” between WWE (then known as WWF) and World Championship Wrestling and would quiz each other about the matches. It was also an education for Sika, who was watching the wrestling business change in real time. Back then, WWE was pivoting toward more adult-oriented programming as it entered what is known as the Attitude Era—a far cry from the more campy heyday of the Wild Samoans. For a time, the gridiron, rather than the ring, looked like Anoa’i’s gateway. He was a standout high school football player and earned a scholarship to Georgia Tech, where he was teammates with future NFL Hall of Fame receiver Calvin Johnson. He starred on the defensive line at Tech, being selected as a team captain and earning first-team All–Atlantic Coast Conference honors his senior year. It was there where he met Galina, who was a member of the school’s track-and-field team. Anoa’i gave the NFL a go, first attending rookie minicamp with the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2007. The experience was both brief and traumatic. After Anoa’i’s physical, team trainers spotted something amiss with his bloodwork that turned out to be chronic myeloid leukemia. “It was the biggest mental fuck that I’ve ever had in my life,” he recalls. The diagnosis brought Anoa’i’s time with the Vikings to an abrupt end as he began a period of oral chemotherapy. After the disease was treated, Anoa’i signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars at the tail end of training camp, ultimately getting released in the team’s final round of cuts. He spent a season in the Canadian Football League with the Edmonton Eskimos before being released. By then, Anoa’i and his wife had welcomed their daughter, and the newly minted dad needed a job. He returned to Pensacola and worked for his older sister Vanessa’s office furniture installation company, alongside his twin cousins. The three spent their days assembling task chairs and their nights closing down a local bar. “That was the bit of normalcy I needed to teach me: This isn’t what I want,” he says. A visit from his dad to the warehouse proved clarifying. As Anoa’i put together an office chair, Sika looked on with bemusement. “He just told me in a very condescending, belittling way, ‘How long are you going to build your sister’s chairs?’ ” recalls Anoa’i, who responded with a well-executed reversal. “I said, ‘Well, I guess I’ll be doing this until you teach me how to wrestle.’ ” Sika beamed. Then he made some calls. Soon, Anoa’i was off to Tampa, where he began his tutelage at Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE’s developmental promotion that has since been rebranded as NXT. Debuting under the name Leakee, Anoa’i was almost immediately pegged for stardom. Paul Levesque, WWE’s chief content officer who was then overseeing the developmental territory, left a meeting with Anoa’i convinced that he had found the next face of the company. Levesque turned to Dusty Rhodes, the late father of Cody who was training Anoa’i at FCW, and laid down a marker. “I remember walking out to Dusty and saying, ‘God, if that fucking Leakee kid is not a top guy here in 10 years, I don’t know what the fuck we’re doing,’ ” says Levesque, who is perhaps better known by his ring name, Triple H. “It’s not just a look. It’s an intangible factor,” he adds. “I get asked this all the time when we do tryouts: What is it we’re looking for? I’m looking for that.” The American flag that flies above WWE’s headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, is 76 feet wide and 40 feet tall. It was raised there just before Veterans Day in 2023 because, as Vince McMahon put it at the time, “not too many flags fly these days.” McMahon’s claim that it is “one of the largest flags in the country” also seems like a stretch, given that it’s the same type of oversized Old Glory found at car dealership lots across the country. But then, McMahon was always known for puffery, which might have been the least of his sins. The longtime WWE patriarch has been gone from the company for more than a year now, following a lawsuit from a former employee, Janel Grant, who accused McMahon of sexual assault and trafficking, as well as physical and emotional abuse. (McMahon has denied the allegations. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.) McMahon had survived lawsuits and scandals before. In 2022, following allegations that he made hush-money payments to former employees to conceal alleged sexual misconduct, McMahon retired as CEO of WWE. But he returned six months later in January 2023 as a board member in an effort to engineer a sale of the company, ultimately leading to WWE’s merger with UFC. McMahon was tapped to serve as executive chairman of the conglomerate, but with new stakeholders and board members to answer to, he no longer had impunity. That became clear on January 26, 2024, when McMahon resigned from his role at TKO one day after Grant’s lawsuit was filed. (McMahonagreed to pay$1.7 million to settle SEC charges in January after failing to disclose two alleged hush-money payments. In a statement at the time, McMahon characterized the payments as “minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments.”) Anoa’i tells me that the allegations from Grant are a stain on WWE. “She’s got to live with all these situations that happened and hopefully she’s in a place where she feels comfortable and she’s secure in her own place,” he says of Grant. “It’s embarrassing. That’s stuff you don’t want to hear about. You don’t want your family to hear about.” Anoa’i says McMahon reached out last year to wish him a happy birthday, but the former CEO and chairman has, by all accounts, completely removed himself from WWE affairs. Last spring he sold the last of his remaining shares in TKO Group Holdings. But McMahon’s legacy still looms over the company. He built WWE into a juggernaut by tapping into the power of television, bringing wrestling to a national audience in the 1980s withSaturday Night’s Main Eventon NBC. The company evolved with the medium, launching its own over-the-top network in 2014 before phasing it out and migrating its content to the NBC-owned streamer Peacock in 2021. McMahon’s legacy is also evident in WWE stars such as Roman Reigns. The company’s consistent ability to refill its talent pool and tailor its programming to multiple generations is reminiscent of another institution of American television,Saturday Night Live. “Roman Reigns is a massive star and completely unique. We often say at WWE that the next star never looks like the last star. As John Cena winds down his career, it has been great to see our current perennial WrestleMania main eventer, Roman Reigns, look, sound, and act in a completely different way than anyone you have seen previously at WWE,” says Nick Khan, the president of WWE. McMahon’s eye for talent eventually landed on Anoa’i, who was elevated from FCW to WWE’s main roster in 2012. Reigns was originally part of a faction known as the Shield, which included the wrestlers Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. The trio was well-received by fans, but it was clear that Reigns was the one being fast-tracked to the main-event tier. By 2014, the Shield disbanded and Reigns embarked on a singles career. He was presented as a babyface who called himself “the Big Dog,” but the audience booed him as if he were a heel. WWE fans can be ruthless and unforgiving, especially to a performer they believe is being foisted upon them by the company. “They’re an educated fan base, and they’re just not going to have someone who’s not 100 percent ready pushed onto them because those flaws are apparent. They were able to see the holes in my game, the inexperience that was still lingering over me,” Anoa’i says. “It was very simple. They were honest and I wasn’t.” In 2018 Reigns appeared onRawand introduced himself by his real name, revealing to the crowd that his leukemia had returned. The announcement led to an outpouring of support for Anoa’i, but it didn’t put Reigns completely over with fans. “I thought, Okay, you really can’t boo a guy who came back from leukemia and there’s going to be sympathy,” says Dave Meltzer, a journalist who has been covering pro wrestling for more than 50 years. “There was [sympathy], but it didn’t have the reaction that I thought, It kind of told me the fan base doesn’t care about the person, but they sure care about the character.” The breakthrough for Anoa’i and his character came during the pandemic. While the NBA and other leagues suspended their seasons, WWE plowed ahead, broadcasting from its empty training facility in Orlando. Anoa’i, however, initially stayed home due to his immunocompromised status. He even considered hanging it up over his frustrations with the character. “I was prepared to walk away if we weren’t going to be able to do what I felt was right for me creatively at the time,” he says. “Roman has a profound presence in person at the WWE live events” and “a seriousness and patience rarely seen in a performer,” says record producer and pro-wrestling diehard Rick Rubin. McMahon went to Anoa’i with a proposal: What would he think about teaming up with Paul Heyman? A cinephile with a Hitchcockian look, Heyman has worn just about every hat in the wrestling business. He was the owner of a renegade promotion called Extreme Championship Wrestling and a commentator for WWE, while also serving as onscreen manager for a host of different wrestlers. Behind the scenes, Heyman is known as a sounding board for WWE talent and executives alike, drawing from his repository of pop culture knowledge to help develop characters and storylines. If pro wrestling is an art form—and it is—then Heyman is an auteur, willing to do whatever it takes to summon the best performance. “If you want me to play Scorsese to your De Niro or DiCaprio, if you want me to be David Chase to your Gandolfini, I’m going to have to say things to you and find vulnerability and sensitivity and trigger points in you that no other human being on the face of this planet would dare explore,” Heyman recalls telling Anoa’i. “Not your wife, not your parents, not your children.” Heyman and Anoa’i gave Reigns an edge. They changed the character’s look, ditching the blue contact lenses and swapping out the black vest for a wardrobe of athleisure, and leaned into the wrestler’s lineage, creating a sinister stable known as the Bloodline that included Jey and Jimmy Uso. Heyman, meanwhile, was introduced as Reigns’s obsequious onscreen manager who goes by “The Wiseman.” When the new Roman Reigns returned as a heel in August 2020, wrestling fans were finally ready to embrace him. The Big Dog was put down. In his place came “the Tribal Chief.” Reigns had, seemingly overnight, become WWE’s most compelling character—just as the company was about to go through its own radical transformation. And as the Tribal Chief drove some of the richest storylines on WWE’s weekly morality play, its business experienced its most lucrative period ever. Anoa’i doesn’t think that’s a coincidence, and he believes he deserves credit for being a reliable headliner amid all the upheaval at the company and through the COVID pandemic. To put it another way: Anoa’i is ready for you to acknowledge him. “I was the top guy. The business did all that it did, and I was the one that was the marquee of it all,” he says. Soon, WWE will have to turn to a new top guy to put people in the seats, as Anoa’i begins to eye his post-WWE career. It is not difficult to envision Anoa’i, who is jacked and bears a resemblance to Jason Momoa, carving out a movie career as an action star or superhero. “He’s a physical specimen,” says David Leitch, the director ofHobbs & Shaw,who is reportedly in talks to directOcean’s 14,with George Clooney and Brad Pitt. “The camera loves him, the audience loves him, and the only thing standing in his way is his own ambition.” Anoa’i receives a lot of scripts, but his WWE responsibilities have precluded him from taking many roles. When the time comes for him to fully pursue acting, Anoa’i plans on being selective. “I almost want to model it after Tarantino, where we’re not just doing anything and everything. I want to really plot out: I want this one, I want that one,” Anoa’i says. As our flight makes its descent for Indianapolis, I make the half serious suggestion that he might someday run for governor of Florida. “You never know,” he says with a smile. “You just never know.” He’s joking, I think, but he’s also right. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura made it to the statehouse, and a WWE hall of famer currently occupies the White House. Plus, Anoa’i boasts the profile—a football player turned wrestler who loves lifting weights—of someone who could flourish in an electoral climate currently defined by expressions of raw masculinity. Anoa’i is a registered Democrat, but he considers himself a centrist. In the most recent election, however, he says the choice was “very clear.” “One person was giving us information. One person was answering questions, so it wasn’t that hard,” he says. When I ask if that means that he backed Trump, Anoa’i pauses for a few seconds. “I support our president. Trump is one of those guys where he’s got a vast history and a huge background. He’s been in entertainment. He’s been in big business, politics,” Anoa’i says. “At this point, I’m supporting a bright future for our country. Positive and competent leadership. For us to be what we’re supposed to be—to be a world leader and carry that respect and do what a world power like us should be doing.” Anoa’i doesn’t back everything the president does, like his penchant for nursing grievances against political rivals. “It’s like he needs that adversary,” he says. “He needs that opposition to bounce off of. He needs that competitive motivation or something.” Trump’s pugilistic approach, of course, is not unlike WWE’s own template. It’s why, in the Trump era, wrestling has been held up as a Rosetta stone for understanding modern politics. “To be honest,” Anoa’i says, “the world seems to be more like wrestling than any other form of entertainment.” We land in Indianapolis on a cold, wet night, the sort of bleak, wintry conditions that compel you to stay inside and hunker down. And yet a smattering of WWE fans, young and old, are here, gathered outside the private airport. They hold replica WWE championship belts over their shoulders and hoist their index fingers in the air—a nod to Reigns’s signature gesture. Anoa’i is hungry, so we pile into a pair of Escalades and zoom along the dampened streets to a steakhouse downtown. Four men in their 20s, each with replica title belts of their own, loiter outside and look curiously toward our SUVs. With the assistance of his personal security guard, Anoa’i and Heyman give the autograph hounds the slip and enter the restaurant through the back. “You have to, at all times, consider this could be a Mark David Chapman type of thing,” Heyman says after we take our seats in a private room. “This could be a real fucking knucklehead.” Anoa’i is a little spooked about the group at the airport, but he decides to accentuate the positive. “Good problems,” he declares. “We call them ‘blessed men problems.’ ” “The time to worry is not when they’re outside looking for you,” Heyman replies. “The time to worry is when they’re not.” That time isn’t now. According to Levesque, Reigns is “the biggest needle mover on the ticket sales side” and a top merchandise seller. And he’s got some famous fans. “Roman has a profound presence in person at the WWE live events” and “a seriousness and patience rarely seen in a performer,” says Rick Rubin, the record producer and a pro-wrestling diehard since childhood. “It has been an historic run,” Rubin adds, “and I hope it continues for a long, long time.” Being so highly in demand has left Anoa’i with an exhausting amount of corporate responsibilities. On the morning of the Royal Rumble, he and Heyman arrive at an Indianapolis barbershop to record promotional material forWWE 2K25, a new video game that features Reigns on the cover. Anoa’i is quickly briefed on the concept for each promo before he seamlessly shifts into character once the cameras start rolling. In one video, Anoa’i (as Reigns) and Heyman heckle a developer for the video game while he plays. “Can somebody tell me why we have a developer without a cheat code?” Heyman says in a moment of improvisation. After about 10 minutes the videographers get the footage they need and Reigns goes back to being Anoa’i. “Well done,” he tells the developer. WWE stars spend their entire careers flipping that switch, constantly toggling between self and alter ego. For the uninitiated it is not always easy to draw the distinction. At the barbershop I overhear a woman involved with the video game ask a colleague how to address Anoa’i. “Best practice is to call them by their character name,” he tells her. “Especially at an event like this.” We head to Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts and the site ofthis year’s Royal Rumble. As I stroll around hours before the gates open, it feels like I have stumbled upon a traveling circus company. There are muscular men and women in brightly colored attire and a small army of production personnel, all hurtling from the locker rooms to craft services. Inside the bowl of the stadium, rehearsal plays out in the ring. Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens walk through a maneuver they will pull off in their ladder match. Meanwhile, Cena and Jey Uso pantomime the moves that will end the night’s main event (and crown Uso the winner of the rumble). Outside the ring, Levesque talks to the YouTube personality IShowSpeed, who will make a surprise appearance at the event, while WWE luminaries such as Ric Flair meander about the premises. Anoa’i calmly strolls up and down the entrance ramp, his head bowed meditatively. Backstage, closer to showtime, Heyman discusses a forthcoming storyline with the Scottish wrestler Drew McIntyre (real name: Andrew McLean Galloway IV). Heyman grabs his phone and pulls up a clip fromPeaky Blindersin which the character played by Tom Hardy profanely berates a crew of bootleggers. Channel that, he tells McIntyre, who nods approvingly before walking out of the room. “Another satisfied customer,” Heyman says. By 6 p.m. local time, there are around 70,000 customers inside the stadium, making it the largest gate ever for a single-night WWE event. The next four and a half hours will be filled with pyrotechnics, acrobatics, and blood, all culminating with the eponymous main event. A spin on the traditional battle royale, the Royal Rumble is a glorious clusterfuck involving 30 wrestlers, with a new performer entering the ring every 90 seconds. This year’s cavalcade builds toward the final entrant, the online influencer Logan Paul, who has a contract with WWE. The inclusion of Paul and IShowSpeed shows how the company has managed to stay current, adapting its output to appeal to each new generation. It’s also a window into the WWE business model, which is dependent on kids. There are plenty of adult fans here at the Royal Rumble, but the majority of them almost certainly started watching in their youth. It is comparatively more lighthearted than a UFC event, where the brutality is on full display and the vibe is similar to a Trump rally. Khan, citing Nielsen data, told me there is only about a 13 percent overlap between WWE and UFC viewers, which tracks with my own experience attending both. At the Royal Rumble, where there are at least two adult fans cosplaying as ’80s icon “Macho Man” Randy Savage, the atmosphere is more Comic-Con than MAGA. When Roman Reigns’s entrance music plays midway through, the crowd roars as thousands of index fingers are pointed to the sky. A short time later, after entering the ring, Reigns engages in a stare-down with several rivals, including Cena, prompting the thousands in attendance to chant, “This is awesome.” It is easy to understand why so many wrestlers struggle to walk away from the ring and continue to put their bodies through torture. The pop from the crowd is euphoric and addictive. Anoa’i could well become a box office star—or, hell, even a politician—but he may never get the ovation that he has here at the Royal Rumble. As Roman Reigns stands in the ring, basking in the ovation, I keep thinking about what Joe Anoa’i told me the night before on the plane. “There’s nothing like it. I do this, they do that,” he said. “There’s nothing like that control.” GROOMING, YANCARLOS “YANKEE” SANCHEZ; TAILOR, OLGA MEVERDEN.PRODUCED ON LOCATION BY SELECT SERVICES.

    "title": "Michelle Trachtenberg’s Cause of Death Revealed",
    "article_text": "Nearly two months afterMichelle Trachtenberg’s deathat age 39, we’re starting to get clarity on what caused it. According to lab results from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, Trachtenberg died from complications of diabetes mellitus, as reported byDeadline.Her manner of death was subsequently ruled to have been natural, perPeople.(Vanity Fairhas also reached out to reps for Trachtenberg and the medical examiner’s office for confirmation.) Trachtenberg, best known for her roles in ’90s and early-2000s projects such asBuffy the Vampire Slayer,Gossip Girl,Ice Princess,andHarriet the Spy,was found dead on the morning of February 26 in her New York City apartment, a spokesperson for the NYPD previously confirmed toVF.Criminality was not suspected in her death. The following day,ABC Newsreported that Trachtenberg’s cause of death would remain undetermined because her family had requested that no autopsy be conducted for religious reasons. Since no foul play was suspected, the medical examiner’s office did not overrule the family’s decision, insteadlimiting the scope of its investigationto an external examination and lab testing. According to theMayo Clinic, diabetes mellitus refers to a “group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar,” otherwise known as glucose—the brain’s central source of fuel and a key source of energy for cells in the human body. Sources close to Trachtenberg toldUs Weeklythat the actor had undergone a liver transplant and suffered multiple health ailments. “She had back issues, and then bone problems and she also fell a few times,” a friend told the publication. Trachtenberg, whoused a cane on a 2020 red carpet, was “thrown a lot of curveballs with her health,” a source said, “but she did her best not to let it get her down.” The New York native’s final onscreen role was a reprisal of her villainous Georgina for two episodes of theshort-livedGossip Girlrebooton Max. In the final year of Trachtenberg’s life, her social media presence raised concerns among those who noted an apparent change in her physicality. “I’ve received several comments recently about my appearance,” she wrote in a January 2024Instagram post. “I have never had plastic surgery I am happy and healthy. Check yourself haters.” Former costars and friends, includingRosie O’Donnell,Blake Lively,Sarah Michelle Gellar,andPrincess Eugenie,paid tribute to Trachtenberg after her death. DirectorCasey Tebohassaid on Xthat he’s “doing everything I can” to get a script written by Trachtenberg made into a film, calling it “one of the best screenplays I’ve ever read.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle TheResurrectionofDexter An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "The 132-year record Sutton is desperate to keep",
    "article_text": "Newcastle have won five Premier League games in a row to surge into third place, but can they continue that run when they visit in-form Aston Villa on Saturday? \"The race for a Champions League spot is well and truly on,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"Aston Villa are right in the mix for the top five too, but the thing that stands out for me about Newcastle is that they look like they have got loads of energy.\" Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. For week 33, he takes onDJ & producer Sherelle, who is an Arsenal fan. Her debut album, With A Vengeance, is out now. Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below. The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. Sherelle has a weekly show on BBC Radio 6 Music every Saturday night. She also has a club night, Sherelleland, and played her biggest show to date at the London Roundhouse last week It has been another memorable week for Arsenal fans, with Mikel Arteta's side clinching an impressive late win at the Bernabeu to complete their comfortable Champions League quarter-final victory over holders Real Madrid. \"I was always really confident we would not just pull through but do really well against them,\" Sherelle told BBC Sport. \"We'd scored the goals in the first leg so all we really had to do was keep them out. It meant it was a slower game and not as exciting, but that didn't matter. \"It's exciting to be in the semi-finals but there is still work to do. \"Growing up as an Arsenal fan, it was always when we fell at the last hurdle to claim these bigger cups that hit me hardest. \"I had to have a bit of time out and stop watching Arsenal for a while after the 2006 final against Barcelona because of the shock of how that loss happened, with everything unravelling for us in the final few minutes. \"We had a few years after that when we struggled a bit and I couldn't deal with what I was seeing because I was born in the 1990s and my era was the time of Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires. \"I was in primary school for the 'Invincibles' season when you could not really argue with how amazing Arsenal were. \"I'd be playing football in the playground and say I wanted Henry's spot. If someone else said, 'no I am Henry', then I would just think fine, and go and pretend to be Freddie Ljungberg. We had such an amazing team, so there were lots of players to choose from.\" Sherelle's DJ set closed Glastonbury in 2023. She played at the 2024 BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Manchester and returned to the festival again this year Whatever happens in the semi-final against Paris St-Germain, or the final in Munich should the Gunners get there, Sherelle feels Mikel Arteta's team have a bright future. \"I saw us do such incredible things when I was growing up so it was hard to see our level come down so much, although I am very happy to have seen it go back up again,\" she added. \"Look, it would be really nice to win the Premier League again at some point, but people have to remember that we are still finishing high up the table - we've been second for the past couple of years - which was not the case for a few seasons. \"I am very happy with where we are at the moment, and I can see big things on the horizon. If we do win the Champions League, it could be the start of something very special, but if we don't then this team is not going away. Chris Sutton and Sherelle were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00 BST Brighton have had a bit of a dip in form and started conceding a few goals, so their hopes of breaking into the top five are probably gone now. Even so, the 10th-placed Seagulls are one of those teams where just when you think about writing them off, they will come up with a performance and wallop someone. I don't expect that to happen on Saturday, however. Brentford are only one place below them in the table and although they are not on a great run either, the Bees are always hard to beat. The more I think about it, the more it smells of a draw. I am pretty sure the BBC readers are going to go for a draw too, so we all agree on this one. Sutton's prediction:1-1 Sherelle's prediction:It was annoying to draw with Brentford last week but they are always a tricky team to play against. In regards to this game I have a feeling it might turn out to be a bit of a snore-fest because they will cancel each other out. 1-1 Selhurst Park, 15:00 BST I was at St James' Park on Wednesday and Newcastle were brilliant in their 5-0 win over Crystal Palace, especially on the break. The Eagles should really have levelled after going 1-0 down, but Eberechi Eze made a mess of his penalty and the game was over by half-time. It has been a bad week for Palace, who also conceded five goals against Manchester City on Saturday, and how can I back them after they have shipped 10 goals in two games? I am not exactly convinced by Bournemouth either, though. They ended a poor run by beating Fulham on Monday but they have looked a little tired of late, and don't have as much firepower as Newcastle or Manchester City. My concern about Palace is how passive they looked against the Magpies. They need a response to that poor performance, and I think we might get one from them at Selhurst Park. Surely Eze can't play as badly again. Sutton's prediction:1-1 Sherelle's prediction:I've got a friend who is a Palace fan so I was enjoying their good run, well until this week anyhow. Bournemouth won at Selhurst Park last season but I am going for Palace to bounce back here. 2-1 Goodison Park, 15:00 BST I am at this game for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to it. It is so hard to call, because of where both teams are at. Everton will work hard, of course, but they are also very capable of winning this if they are as 'in your face' as they can be, and upset City's rhythm. If Pep Guardiola's side play like they did against Nottingham Forest a few weeks ago, and don't really get going, then they are going to get turned over. On the other hand, City really caught fire after almost going 3-0 down against Palace last week. If they play like that, they will win - but you are never quite sure what you are going to get from them in each half at the moment, let alone game to game. So, it is hard to know how the game will pan out. Everton will not be overly expansive or bothered about possession and will pick their moments when they throw Abdoulaye Doucoure forward. They will be direct and Beto will run in behind, and I definitely see them scoring, but I am still going with City to edge this, somehow. They have to, really, because they are under pressure to make the top five. I held the record for the fastest goal scored at Goodison in its 132-year history until Doucoure scored after 10.18 seconds against Leicester in February, beating my effort for Blackburn after 12.94 seconds in 1995. That's still the fastest goal scored there by an away player, though, so hopefully no-one manages a quicker one before the end of the season - especially when I am there to talk about it as co-commentator. Sutton's prediction:1-2 Sherelle's prediction:Everton are quite annoying in that they are difficult to break down. I actually think they will score first, but City are on a relatively good run and they have shown recently they can respond if they go behind. 1-3 London Stadium, 15:00 BST Speaking of records, already-relegated Southampton are still trying to avoid taking one away from Robbie Savage's Derby for the lowest Premier League points tally. They need a point from their final six games to make it to 11 points and equal the Rams' total from 2007-08, but they are not going to get it here. West Ham are not in any danger of going down but they will still certainly not want to finish 17th, which is where they are right now. They were decent against Liverpool last time out, and still lost, but they won't have to play as well as they did at Anfield to take three points this time. Hammers boss Graham Potter could really do with a win, because their fans will want to finish a forgettable season with a bit of optimism, and they should have something to smile about on Saturday. As for the loyal and long-suffering Southampton fans, well I've said before how miserable this season has been for them. I think I'd have switched to supporting Bournemouth, Brighton or even Portsmouth by now. Being serious, I've got a lot of admiration for the travelling fans that have stuck with them through this, and I guess the consolation here is that they won't have a long journey back from London to the south coast. Sutton's prediction:2-0 Sherelle's prediction:This might be another snooze-fest, because both teams have nothing to play for. 0-0 Villa Park, 17:30 BST Newcastle are the Premier League's momentum monsters, especially since winning the Carabao Cup, but their excellent form goes back further than that. Seventh-placed Aston Villa are also in great shape, on a run of four successive league wins, and although they lost the tie overall, they were sensational in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Paris St-Germain. Villa's comeback on the night, to win 3-2 after falling 2-0 down, took me by surprise but they really showed what they are made of. I think PSG will win this season's Champions League, but Villa pushed them all the way. This is going to be a cracking game, and also a feisty one with what is at stake in the top-five race. Who or what decides it might come down to fine margins, and who makes the most of their chances, because both teams are going to get opportunities. Villa will score, whoever they play up top, although maybe they should take Marco Asensio off penalties. He missed two spot-kicks last weekend against Southampton after I told everyone to watch out for him on the Fantasy 606 pod, which sums up my FPL season and predicting ability in one fell swoop. You could make an argument for both teams here, but I am going with Newcastle, because of how good they were when I watched them at St James' Park on Wednesday to beat Palace 5-0. Harvey Barnes was electric, just unbelievably good down the left, and the same goes for Jacob Murphy on the other flank - his opening goal was absolutely amazing, because who shoots from there? With those two playing the way they are, Newcastle are going to keep on winning. Sutton's prediction:1-2 Sherelle's prediction:Villa put in a really big stretch against PSG and Newcastle are in such amazing form. There will be goals in this one, and I fancy Newcastle to edge it. 2-3 Craven Cottage, 14:00 BST There is something not right at Chelsea. They drew at home to Ipswich last week, for example. I laughed when I saw my guest, Yizzy, had put the Tractor Boys down to get a point but that ended up being the result that killed me. From what boss Enzo Maresca has said since then,by asking the fans to trust himand saying the players are affected by the crowd, everyone seems to be feeling the pressure. He was questioning the fans, but also his players' temperament. If you think about how many millions have been spent on that squad, then if they don't have the strength of character to play the way their manager wants,  then heaven help them in the long run. This is probably going to be another score draw but I seem to get Fulham wrong whatever I say. They deserved to get something from their defeat at Bournemouth on Monday, and I am going with them to get a repeat of their win at Stamford Bridge in December. Sutton's prediction:2-1 Sherelle's prediction:Chelsea should win this one but they are so inconsistent. I find it fascinating, to be honest, because they have got so many good players. 1-0 Portman Road, 14:00 BST Arsenal will be on such a high after their Champions League win over Real Madrid. I am covering this game and while Arteta will probably rest a few players and freshen things up, the Gunners will still have too much nous for Ipswich. It probably summed up Ipswich's season that they went 2-0 up against Chelsea last time out and could not see out the win, but they deserve credit for giving it a good go. Ipswich were pretty stubborn when they lost 1-0 at Emirates Stadium in December and I am expecting them to show some resilience this time too, even if they end up with the same result. Sutton's prediction:0-2 Sherelle's prediction:We are probably going to rest players and my gut feeling is we might actually draw this - I am not going to say that though! 0-1 Sherelle on Arsenal's Premier League campaign:It's been quite humbling for us to mix beating Real with drawing with Everton and Brentford in the past couple of weeks, but I get why we have rested players in those games to prioritise that tie. This season has been really difficult in the Premier League full-stop though, partly because of the injuries we have had. It is frustrating because there is so much that is so good about us at the moment. Our defence, for example is the best in the Premier League. There is something missing, though, and maybe it is very specific like a specialist striker, or the mentality you need to get over the line. Old Trafford, 14:00 BST Wolves have alreadybeaten Manchester Unitedonce this season and, on current form, they are favourites this time too. Vitor Pereira's side are flying with four straight wins, and we know how inconsistent United are. I am going to give Bruno Fernandes a goal, because he has been one of the few United players who can hold their head up high with their performances this season, but at the moment Wolves look well-balanced, and they are the better team. United's whole campaign is still hanging on what happens in the Europa League and we will have to wait and see whether their incredible late comeback to beat Lyon on Thursday to reach the semi-finals changes anything about their awful Premier League form. I am sorry to say this but I am expecting their fans to have another miserable afternoon at Old Trafford, where they have already lost more league games (seven) than they have won (six) this season. Sutton's prediction:1-3 Sherelle's prediction:I still don't get why United are having such a bad time. They should be doing much better with the players they have got, but they are very up and down. Wolves will be confident of beating them again. 0-1 King Power Stadium, 16:30 BST Leicester ended their long losing run with a draw at Brighton last weekend, but I'm afraid another defeat is on its way for the Foxes here. Liverpool were as limp as anything against West Ham last time out, but they still got over the line. They could be even limper against Leicester, and they will still win to move even closer to the title. Sutton's prediction:0-3 Sherelle's prediction:This should be easy for Liverpool and they are probably going to win but, from an Arsenal perspective, I'd love this to be a draw. 2-2 Tottenham Stadium, 20:00 BST Tottenham getting past Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League to reach the semi-finals means their stadium will be absolutely buzzing with relief and jubilation. But Nottingham Forest are the counter-attack kings and they have the tools to get another win like the one they got over Spurs at the City Ground in December, where they had 30% of possession and still won 1-0. Forest have hit a bit of a blip of late, though, and they don't appear to be quite the same force they were a few weeks ago. They are desperate for a win to get their top-five bid back on track and Nuno Espirito Santo's would love to get it on his return to Tottenham, where he did not last long as manager, but a draw feels more likely to me. Sutton's prediction:1-1 Sherelle's prediction:Tottenham can be a really good team but there are some sides that have a winning mentality, and Spurs just don't. 0-0 Chris got five correct results, with no exact scores, from the 10 games in week 32, giving him50 points.

Sutton picked up 10 more points after going for a 2-1 Newcastle win, leaving him with a total of80 pointsthat week. That means he ties with his guest, Divorce singer Felix, who went for a Palace win, but the weekly win stays with the BBC readers.
