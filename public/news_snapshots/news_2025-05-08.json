She joined Fox News Channel in 2006 and hosted \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" for 11 years before joining \"The Five,\" which has emerged as the most-watched show on cable news. FOX NEWS CHANNEL FINISHES HIGHEST-RATED FIRST 100 DAYS IN CABLE NEWS HISTORY WITH DOMINANT APRIL Pirro joined \"The Five\" in 2022 and the program since became the most-watched show in cable news.(Fox News Media) Trump also announced on Truth Social that Ed Martin, who was the previous interim U.S. attorney in D.C., will be moving to the Department of Justice as its \"Director of the Weaponization Working Group, Associate Deputy Attorney General, and Pardon Attorney.\" \"In these highly important roles, Ed will make sure we finally investigate the Weaponization of our Government under the Biden Regime, and provide much needed Justice for its victims.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS President Donald Trump announced appointments for Jeanine Pirro and Ed Martin on Truth Social.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump pulled Martin's nomination for U.S. attorney in D.C. following resistance on Capitol Hill signaling he did not have the votes to be confirmed. \"He wasn't getting the support from people that I thought,\" Trump told reporters at the White House earlier in the day. \"You know, he's done a very good job. Crime is down 25% in DC during this period of time… I can only lift that little phone so many times of the day. But we have somebody else.\" Trump's decision to replace Martin came amid a May 20 deadline to confirm the former defense attorney and \"Stop the Steal\" organizer. That's because if the Senate fails to confirm a U.S. attorney nominee within 120 days, federal district court judges may select an interim U.S. attorney, according to the Department of Justice.

Pence is urging PresidentDonald Trump,under whom he served as vice president in Trump's first administration, not to raise the tax rate on wealthy Americans. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the signature domestic achievement of his first White House term, is scheduled to expire this year if it's not extended by Congress. The Trump White House and some congressional Republicans for weeks have mulled letting the tax reductions on the wealthy sunset as a way to pay for the rest of thetax cutsas well as Trump's other pricey second-term priorities. WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ASKING SPEAKER JOHNSON TO DO President Donald Trump has urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to be open to some tax increases on the wealthiest Americans as part of an overall budget reconciliation package.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) And the president, during a Wednesday phone call, pushed House SpeakerMike Johnsonto raise taxes on the highest income earners and close the carried interest loophole in the reconciliation process, Fox News Digital confirmed. The development was first reported Thursday by Punchbowl News. A source familiar with Trump's thinking said Trump is considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more to increase by 2.6%, from 37% to 39.6%. But Pence, a fiscal conservative and budget hawk during his long political career in the House of Representatives, as Indiana governor and as vice president, strongly cautioned against upping the rates on the highest earners. \"Any suggestion that I've heard among some in and around the administration that we raise the top margin rate, the so-called millionaires tax, would be an enormous tax increase on small business owners across America,\" Pence said. \"It needs to be opposed.\" WHAT MIKE PENCE TOLD FOX NEWS IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW THIS WEEK Former Vice President Mike Pence, seen receiving the John F.

If you raise that top margin, it would be an enormous tax increase on small business America.\" \"Let’s make all the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent. That’s a way to really lay a foundation to grow the economy in the days ahead,\" Pence urged. WHY TRUMP'S FIRST VICE PRESIDENT WAS HONORED BY THE KENNEDY FAMILY Pence, who was interviewed in Boston after receiving the John F.

    "title": "White House highlights over $2B in savings from DEI cuts during Trump administration's first 100 days",
    "article_text": "This Department of Housing and Urban Development DEI training video shows some of the DEI-related lessons for staff the Trump administration is eliminating. An analysis of the Trump administration's efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the federal government during the president's first 100 days in office revealed that nearly 750 DEI employees have been placed on leave or fired for a savings of more than $2 billion. The analysis provided by theWhite Houseshowed that the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Education and the Department of Labor saw some of the biggest savings. The trio of agencies fired or placed on leave 256 DEI employees, saving taxpayers over $1.3 billion, the analysis noted. Overall, the Trump administration let go of 745 employees working in DEI offices or on DEI-related programs throughout the government and saved taxpayers roughly $2.33 billion. \"President Trump ordered the end of radical and racist DEI propaganda in government, and the administration is swiftly enacting the president's order,\" White House principal deputy communications director Alex Pfeiffer told Fox News Digital. \"Common sense has returned to government.\" ‘NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN’: STATE FINANCE LEADER RALLIES AROUND KEY TRUMP VICTORY SAVING ‘TAXPAYER DOLLARS’ President Donald Trump and a DEI book(Getty Images) In addition to savings and staff cuts, the White House's analysis highlighted the various grants that were slashed and other changes made as a result of the Trump administration's efforts to rid the federal government of DEI. Those programs included race-based grants or quota programs at multiple agencies and race-based promotion commitments. Multimillion-dollar grants for DEI training and DEI-focused activist groups were also among the cuts at most agencies. At the State Department, a $5 million grant to \"strengthen organizational capacity leadership and impact for mid-sized autonomous intersex and trans human rights organizations\" was cut. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) saved $1.7 million by eliminating four years of DEI staff training on topics ranging from \"microaggressions\" to \"identifying and preventing racism in your marketing.\" \"You must accept what has happened and what you have done,\" a narrator of one of the LinkedIn training sessions funded through these grants stated. \"If you can’t accept what the marketplace is telling you, that this piece of content is sexist, racist, homophobic … you can’t move forward as a leader.\" DEI IS DEAD. HERE'S WHAT SHOULD COME NEXT DEI-focused training, including some that was mandatory, was commonplace under the Biden administration, according to the White House's analysis.(Istock; Getty Images) Other USDA grants, according to the White House's analysis, spent money on staff training aimed at \"cultivat[ing] an Eye for Inequity,\" while Trump administration staff also found \"DEI Bingo\" cards left over from the Biden administration. The bingo cards included spaces to be checked off, like, \"I know what the ‘I’ in LGBTQIA+ means\" and \"I have pronouns in my signature line.\" USDA also dispersed race-based grants, such as money for \"LATINX Growers\" and \"Black Women's Regenerative Farming,\" according to the White House analysis. The analysis also indicated that the USDA spent $600,000 on research into the menstruation of biological males and $361,000 to support queer and trans farmers. Similar DEI-related materials were found at the Department of Education, including a white board with bullet points about race-centric priorities.

According to the analysis, staffers in the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights were also told by the last administration to \"sit on\" a civil rights complaint against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. The Biden administration also reportedly neglected Freedom of Information Act requests about its DEI efforts. The White House's analysis recorded as many as 4,000 outstanding requests sent to the Department of Labor, which, under PresidentJoe Biden,promoted DEI-based hiring and mandatory training programs for staff. TheHealth and Human Services Departmentalso saw steep cuts to DEI programs during Trump's first 100 days. At the National Institutes of Health alone,over $350 million in DEI projects were slashed,including grants for studying \"multilevel and multidimensional structural racism\" and \"gender-affirming hormone therapy in mice,\" among others. ‘WOKE’ HOSPITAL COULD BE IN CROSSHAIRS OF TRUMP ADMIN AFTER SCATHING COMPLAINT ALLEGES DEI DISCRIMINATION The Health and Human Services Department saw steep cuts to DEI programs during Trump's first 100 days.

It ended DEI-related training courses within the DOT online learning management system and disabled an internal email feature at the Department of Transportation that let users list their pronouns. The administration did the same with other pronoun policies at other agencies. The administration has also taken proactive steps at other agencies, such as removing DEI criteria from more than 2,900 supervisory performance standards at the Energy Department.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Blake Livelyplans to speak under oath against Justin Baldoni. Lively, 37, will take the stand in the sexual harassment trial involving her \"It Ends With Us\" co-star and director,People magazinereported. The legal conflict, which first took shape in December withLively's filed complaint, will reach a New York court for trial in March 2026. BLAKE LIVELY'S ‘ANOTHER SIMPLE FAVOR’ DIRECTOR SLAMS ‘OUTRAGE’ AGAINST ACTRESS OVER DIVA RUMORS Blake Lively will testify against Justin Baldoni when their cases are heard at trial in March 2026.(Getty Images) Lively's lawyer, Mike Gottlieb, confirmed Thursday that his client would provide testimony. \"The ultimate moment for a plaintiff's story to be told is at trial,\" he said. \"We expect that to be the case here [with Lively]. So we would, of course, expect her to be a witness at her trial. Of course she’s going to testify.\" He added, \"There are individuals that were witnesses to or experienced misconduct that is relevant to Ms. Lively's claims. We expect their testimony, particularly about what took place on set, will come out through live witness testimony.\" BLAKE LIVELY VS. JUSTIN BALDONI: EVERYTHING TO KNOW Gottlieb noted that both parties will have \"an opportunity to ask Ms. Lively questions\" during the discovery process. \"We think there have been a lot of distractions put up to deflect attention from the retaliation campaign that was launched against her,\" he said. \"And we expect and hope that in discovery we'll have an opportunity to really focus on what we believe to be the core part of the case, which is that this retaliation campaign was launched against Ms. Lively for her having raised concerns about sexual harassment.\" Baldoni's legal team stood firm in their defense, and noted in a statement provided to Fox News Digital, \"Although obviously uncomfortable for the Lively parties, the truth is not a distraction.\" Baldoni starred as Ryle Kincaid in \"It Ends With Us.\"(Gotham/GC Images) Lively starred as Lily Bloom in the film.(Gotham) \"The truth has been clearly shown through unedited receipts, documents and real life footage. More to come,\" his attorney, Bryan Freedman, said. \"Blake was the one who brought her high profile friends into this situation without concern for their own personal or public backlash. As the truth shows, she used her Dragons to manipulate Justin at every turn.\" He continued of Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds: \"Ryan’s involvement is very well documented and we continue to discover more intentional misconduct. Was Disney actually complicit in Ryan using shareholder revenues to further a personal grudge? I would be surprised to learn that this type of corporate waste would not lead to much more exposure for those that have been complicit in affecting shareholder revenue.\" BLAKE LIVELY LANDING ON TIME100 ‘TITAN’ LIST SPARKS BACKLASH, CALLED AN ‘INSULT’ Baldoni mentioned Taylor Swift in his lawsuit by sharing texts exchanged between him and Lively. The \"Jane the Virgin\" star claimed Lively used her friendship with Swift to threaten him into changing the \"It Ends With Us\" script. While working on the film, Lively insisted on rewriting the rooftop scene. Baldoni had been hesitant about the idea but told Lively he would \"take a look at what she put together,\" according to the complaint. Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni in December after rumors of an on-set feud on \"It Ends With Us.\"(Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) Afterward, Lively invited Baldoni to herNew York Cityhome, where the actor-director said he felt Swift and Reynolds pressured him into using Lively's rewrite of the scene. \"Later, Baldoni felt obliged to text Lively to say that he had liked her pages and hadn’t needed Reynolds and her megacelebrity friend to pressure him,\" the complaint said. \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor [emoji] You really are a talent across the board. Really excited nd (sic) grateful to do this together,\" Baldoni's text said, according to the complaint. Lively shared a lengthy response in which she referred toSwift and Reynoldsas \"dragons\" who protect her. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Lively detailed allegations of sexual harassment, retaliation, intentional affliction of emotional distress, negligence and more made by Baldoni and lead producer Jamie Heath in a complaint first filed with the California Civil Rights department on Dec. 20 and later in federal court on Dec. 31. Lively recently earned a spot on the Time 100 \"Titan\" list.(Dimitrios Kambouris) The same day Lively filed her federal suit, Baldoni filed a $250 million suit against The New York Times for a December article about the alleged smear campaign he attempted to run against his co-star. Weeks later, Baldoni then named Lively and Reynolds in a separate$400 million defamation lawsuitin which he accused the Hollywood power couple of attempting to hijack \"It Ends With Us\" and create their own narrative.

    "article_text": "Kathryn Smerling, a psychologist and therapist in New York City, spoke to Fox News Digital about the impact Jeffrey Epstein had on his victims. Federal prosecutors have filed a superseding indictment against the Alexander brothers, three luxury Miami businessmen previously arrested in December for running ahighly sophisticated sextrafficking ring. The new indictment adds charges and victims, alleging Alon, Oren, and Tal Alexander conspired to exploit vulnerable women and minors for commercial sex through force, fraud, and coercion. The charges include conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, multiple counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and inducement to travel for unlawful sexual activity. All three brothers are accused of participating in trafficking at least five adult victims, while two of the brothers, Tal and Alon Alexander, face additional charges of trafficking a minor. HIGH-PROFILE REAL ESTATE BROTHER MISSES HEARING AFTER MIX-UP IN IDENTICAL TWINS' SEX TRAFFICKING CASE Oren Alexander and his twin brother, Alon, attend a bond hearing after being charged with multiple state and federal crimes, including sex trafficking and rape, at the Richard E.

    "title": "Cop killer dies after ‘botched’ firing squad execution; witness in the room reveals how it happened",
    "article_text": "Texas death row inmate William Speer was set to receive a lethal injection Oct. 26, but Texas’ top criminal appeals court stopped it. FOX 26 Houston reports. An inmate put to death last month in South Carolina's secondfiring squad executionwas conscious and likely in extreme pain for up to a minute after the bullets missed their target, attorneys allege. Dr. Jonathan Arden, a forensic pathologist hired by Mikal Mahdi's attorneys, alleged that the execution on April 11 was a \"massive botch\" after he completed an analysis of the autopsy findings, according to the pathologist's report, which was filed Thursday with a letter to the state Supreme Court. The lawsuit challenges the legal precedent set inOwens v. Stirling—that firing squads are humane if properly carried out—by alleging that Mahdi's execution amounted to \"cruel and unusual punishment\" in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Mahdi, 42, was convicted in the 2004 killings of an off-dutypolice officer inCalhoun County, South Carolina, and a convenience store clerk in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was sentenced to death for the murder of the officer and life in prison for the clerk's murder. MIKAL MAHDI, SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE CONVICTED IN TWO SEPERATE 2004 MURDERS, EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD Mikal Mahdi, 41, was executed on April 11 at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia.(South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP) Arden's analysis alleged that only two bullets struck Mahdi, both low in the torso and well below the heart, contradicting protocol which requires three shots to the heart for rapid death. \"The shooters missed the intended target area and the evidence indicates that he was struck by only two bullets, not the prescribed three. Consequently, the nature of the internal injuries from the gunshot wounds resulted in a more prolonged death process,\" Arden said. The partial damage to Mahdi’s heart allowed continued circulation, leading Arden to determine that Mahdi likely remained conscious for up to 60 seconds after being shot. Witnesses to the execution, according to The AP, heard Mahdi cry out as theshots were fired, groan again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at 75 seconds. Arden also criticized the autopsy for lacking essential documentation, such as x-rays, clothing examination and adequate photographs. CONDEMNED SC MAN'S CASE ABOUT 'APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT' AS HE AWAITS 'INHUMANE' FIRING SQUAD EXECUTION: LAWYER He said that Mahdi's execution failed to meet medical and constitutional standards for a humane death. In contrast, the autopsy on Brad Sigmon, the first man killed by firing squad in the Palmetto State, showed three distinct bullet wounds and his heart was obliterated, Arden said. He added that the autopsy report in that case included X-rays, adequate photos and a cursory examination of his clothes. Prison officials have given no indication that there were problems with Mahdi's execution. A shield law keeps many details private, including the training and methods used by the firing squad. This photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, S.C., including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left.(South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP) In the official autopsy report, pathologist Dr. Bradley Marcus wrote that the reason there were only two wounds is that one could have been caused by two bullets entering the body at the same spot. Marcus said he spoke to an unnamed prison official who reported that when the three volunteer firing squad members practice, sometimes their targets end up with just one or two holes from three live rounds. SECOND SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE CHOOSES EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD Arden called that virtually unheard of in his 40 years of examining bodies and said Marcus told him in a conversation that the possibility was remote. The autopsy found damage in only one of the four chambers of Mahdi's heart — the right ventricle. There was extensive damage to his liver and pancreas as the bullets continued down. \"The entrance wounds were at the lowest area of the chest, just above the border with the abdomen, which is an area not largely overlying the heart,\" Arden wrote. Orangeburg Department of Public Safety Capt. James Myers, 56, was violently murdered by Mikal Mahdi on July 18, 2004, at a shed on his property.(SC Law Enforcement Officers Hall of Fame) Mahdi was sentenced to death in 2006 after he admitted to killing off-dutyOrangeburg Department of Public SafetyCapt. James Myers, 56, on his property on July 18, 2004. Myers had been shot at least eight times and his body was burned when his wife found him in their shed, which was near a gas station where Mahdi attempted to purchase gas with a stolen credit card. He left a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia at the gas station and was later arrested in Florida while driving Myers' unmarked police truck. Mahdi also admitted to murdering convenience clerk Christopher Boggs three days before he killed Myers. Boggs was shot in the head twice while checking Mahdi's ID, according to The AP.

The Celtics blew a 20-point lead in Game 1, falling tothe Knicksin overtime in Boston. But Pierce, sticking with his former squad, made a bold prediction before Game 2's tipoff. \"If the Celtics lose Game 2 at home, I promise you, I’m walking here tomorrow,\" he said. \"I’m walking here. I’m walking here 15 miles. I’m walking here in my robe, no shoes on, barefeet. If the Celtics lose,\" Pierce said on FS1’s \"Speak,\" referring to a Fox studio in Los Angeles.

After watching the Celtics crumble, Pierce took to X to post just how far his walk would be to get to work on time. And Pierce appeared to make good on his promise, appearing on Instagram Live to capture himself walking to the studio, robe and all. \"This is crazy, dog. I can’t believe this. C’s got me out here like this,\" Pierce said. \"I’m sweating. So, I’m about four miles in right now.

However, they were ice-cold from the field yet again, shooting 25% from 3-point range. Even worse, the Celtics didn’t convert a basket from the field for the final 8:40 of the fourth quarter, allowing the Knicks to get right back into it like they did Monday night. Jalen Brunson made two clutch free throws that gave New York a one-point lead, and Mikal Bridges, who scored 14 points in the fourth quarter alone to aid the Knicks’ comeback, blocked a Jayson Tatum pass to seal the victory like he did Monday night when he ripped the ball out of Jaylen Brown’s hands.

Pope Leo XIV, 69, was elected to take up the papal seat on Thursday, on the second day of the papal conclave’s deliberations. Born Robert Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955 in Chicago, Ill., he was a suspected front-runner to succeedPope Francisafter his passing late last month, though some reporting suggested his being an American could actually count against him due to concerns that the U.S. could further exert its geopolitical prowess through the religious leader. Leo XIV was first brought to the Vatican by Francis to serve as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in January 2023, which is one of the most important positions in the Catholic Church as it vets bishop nominations issued globally.

Leo was reported to be closely aligned to Francis's teachings as leader of the Catholic Church, particularly when it came to his positions regarding the environment, outreach to the poor and migrants, and opening theCatholic Churchto embrace more followers. Before making it to the highest position afforded in the Catholic Church, he first entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine in Saint Louis, in 1977, which essentially marked his period of training before he took his \"holy orders.\" In August 1981, he gave his solemn vows, and by 1982 he was ordained as a priest. By 1985 he joined theAugustinian mission in Peru, where he served as chancellor of the Territorial Prélature of Chulucanas for one year.

Eventually, he made his way back to his hometown, where, in 1999, he was elected provincial prior of the \"Mother of Good Counsel\" in Chicago. Leo would go on to be elected twiceas leader of the Augustinian religious order, a 13th century order founded by St. Augustine. He had caught the attention of Francis, who, after becoming pope in 2013, moved Leo back to Peru in 2014 to serve as the administrator and eventually archbishop of Chiclayo.

(Vatican Media) The Vatican announced the election ofPope Leo XIV, the first American pope in the history of the Catholic Church, shortly after white smoke began pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on Thursday. Cardinal Protodeacon Dominique Mamberti announcedCardinal Robert Francis Prevost's electionas pope to the thousands of faithful who descended on St. Peter's Square after the 133 voting cardinals deliberated in the Sistine Chapel for roughly 24 hours. Prevost, a 69-year-old Augustinian, appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica wearing the traditional red cape of the papacy — a cape that Pope Francis had chosen not to wear after his election in 2013. His first words as pope were \"Peace be with you,\" which he said in Italian, and delivered a message to the faithful building bridges, peace and dialogue \"without fear.\" Prevost then switched to Spanish to recall his years as a missionary and later archbishop of Chiclayo, Peru. He did not deliver any words in English.

As a result, Prevost had a prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals have. Prevost was born on Sept. 14, 1955, in Chicago. He is also a citizen of Peru, where he lived for years as a missionary and later as an archbishop.

    "article_text": "Former Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue was sworn in as U.S. ambassador to China May 7, 2025, with President Donald Trump remarking on the timing of the ceremony as trade talks between the two nations are set to kick off. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for formal talks on Thursday for the first time since PresidentDonald Trumpexacerbated the U.S.-China trade war last month. In a statement at the top of the meeting,Xi pledged to standby his anti-Western ally against \"power politics\" and \"bullying on the international stage.\" \"Eighty years ago, the peoples of China and Russia made tremendous sacrifices to secure a great victory, contributing an indelible chapter to the cause of world peace and human progress,\" Xi said, according to areportby the South China Morning Post.

Security Council,\" he added. The pair met on what is considered Victory Day in Europe, which marks the beginning of the end of World War II, when the Allied nations accepted the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, though Russia celebrates the anniversary one day later. Japan did not surrender until September 1945, thoughXi and Putin convenedfor a joint celebration which will take place in Moscow’s Red Square on Friday and will include a large contingent of Chinese troops. Leaders from 20 nations, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula de Silva, will also reportedly be in attendance. While Xi appeared to take direct aim at the U.S., which under Trump has slapped 145% tariffs on all Chinese exports, Putin’s language was more toned down when he said, \"We are developing our ties in the interests of both our peoples and not aimed against anyone.\" Putin and Xi firstexpanded their relationshipjust ahead of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in the West’s attempt to isolate Moscow in retaliation for the deadly war.

Unlike uranium enrichment, tritium has virtually no peaceful or commercial applications, casting further doubt on Iran’s longstanding claims that its nuclear ambitions are solely for energy or civilian use. The revelations come as the Trump administration navigates sensitive negotiations with Tehran.

    "article_text": "Tova Friedman recalls what she endured in Auschwitz and is joined by her grandson Aron Goodman to discuss the ‘frightening’ surge in antisemitism in America. Eighty years afterthe Holocaust, far too many people are either downplaying its severity or denying it altogether, warned Merrill Eisenhower Atwater, great-grandson of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His remarks came as nations around the world on Thursday commemorated the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. On May 8, 1945, Nazi Germany formally surrendered to the Allied powers, bringing an end to the war in Europe—a conflict that claimed the lives of approximately 40 million people, including the extermination of 6 million Jews. Last month, Eisenhower Atwater took part in the March of the Living on Holocaust Remembrance Day, walking alongside survivors and thousands of participants from around the world. The march traces the path from Auschwitz to Birkenau, the Nazi death camps in occupied Poland, in a solemn tribute to the victims and in honor of the survivors and their liberators. \"When you’re sitting with80 Holocaust survivorsand both you and they are crying because of how special the moment is—and they tell you, ‘Without your great-grandfather, this never would have happened’—I say, without your bravery, this never would have happened,\" Eisenhower Atwater told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, ISRAEL PAUSES AS THE JEWISH STATE HONORS AND REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST The Ohrdruf concentration camp near Buchewald, Germany.

It wasn’t just the liberation of the camps—it was saving generations,\" he added. Among the march’s participants was Israel Meir Lau, former chief rabbi of Israel and a child survivor of Buchenwald, who personally metGen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who led the Allied offensive against the Nazis in Europe, during the camp’s liberation. Also remembered was Chaim Herzog, father of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who was on hand for the march. A British army officer during World War II, Chaim Herzog played a role in liberating the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. His father, Yitzhak Isaac Halevi Herzog—who would also become a chief rabbi of Israel—met with Gen. Eisenhower in 1946 as part of a mission to aid Jewish survivors across postwar Europe. Eisenhower Atwatercalled his inclusion \"humbling\" and said the march allowed him to \"sit and talk with unsung heroes.\" Merrill Eisenhower Atwater and Eva Clarke in Auschwitz on April 23, 2025.(Photo by Chen Schimmel /International March of the Living) One survivor in particular, Eva Clarke, left a deep impression. \"She’s one of the kindest souls I’ve ever met. Finding out that the gas ran out just a couple days before she was born—that’s divine intervention,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"She led the way. Just an incredible woman with an incredible story. She should inspire everyone.\" Clarke was born on April 29, 1945 at the gates of Mauthausen concentration camp, one of only three known babies to have survived birth there. Clarke’s mother, Anka Kauderova, endured three and a half years in concentration camps: Theresienstadt in then-Czechoslovakia, Auschwitz, and the Freiberg slave labor camp and armament factory in Germany. She was eventually transported in open coal wagons, along with 2,000 other prisoners, on a grueling 17-day journey without food and with minimal water to Mauthausen. ISRAELI PRESIDENT HERZOG HIGHLIGHTS ANTISEMITISM IN UN SPEECH AS NEW REPORT SHOWS SHOCKING TREND \"My parents were in Theresienstadt for three years, which was unusually long. They were young, strong, and able to work. To some extent, it was a transit camp to a death camp,\" Clarke told Fox News Digital. \"At the end of September 1944, their luck ran out. My father was sent toAuschwitz, and incredibly, my mother volunteered to follow him the next day. She didn’t know where he was going and, ever the optimist, believed it couldn’t get worse and they’d survive,\" she said. Anka never saw her husband again. An eyewitness later told her that he was shot and killed in the death march near Auschwitz on Jan. 18, 1945. Auschwitz was liberated by the Russian army on Jan. 27. In 1943, Anka became pregnant. \"It was dangerous, but she met my father secretly. Becoming pregnant in a concentration camp was considered a crime punishable by death,\" Clarke said.

Nobody knew she was pregnant again—with me.\" In April 1945, Anka was sent to Mauthausen. \"It’s a beautiful village on the Danube in Austria, but the camp sits on a steep hill behind it. When my mother saw the name at the train station, she was shocked—she had heard how horrific it was. That shock likely triggered her labor, and she began giving birth to me,\" Clarke said. She credits her survival to timing. \"On April 28,the Nazisran out of gas. I was born on April 29. Hitler committed suicide on April 30. On May 5, the American 11th Armored Division liberated the camp.\" When the Americans arrived, they brought food and medicine—though many, weakened, died upon receiving them. Three weeks later, once Anka regained strength, U.S. forces repatriated her to Prague. There, Anka met her second husband, and the two left to avoid living under communism, eventually settling in the U.K. Eva Clarke, a Holocaust survivor born in the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1945, meets Merrill Eisenhower, great-grandson of President Dwight Eisenhower, in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 26, 2025.(Photo by Yossi May/International March of the Living) \"I feel Merrill is my new best friend,\" Clarke said of Eisenhower Atwater. \"It was overwhelming to meet someone whose great-grandfather played such an important role in ending the war. I was delighted to reconnect with him again in Auschwitz a few weeks ago. Everyone wanted to thank him for what his great-grandfather did.\" Clarke will return to Mauthausen this Sunday to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation by U.S. forces. \"I’ll be there with two other babies who were born under similar circumstances. We are so grateful, I can’t even express it,\" she told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reflecting on the moral clarity his great-grandfather exemplified, Eisenhower Atwater underscored that we are all human beings first. \"We all know right from wrong. It is wrong to kill people, wrong to put babies in ovens, wrong to put people in gas chambers. That’s clear,\" he said. He acknowledged thatHolocaust denialoften stems from disbelief. \"It’s easy to say something didn’t happen because it’s hard to comprehend the death of that many people. I get that. But it did happen. Nazi Germans killed 10,000 people a day—it’s well-documented. They documented it themselves, and the Allied forces saw it first-hand. \"Nobody really wants to talk about the death of six million people over a five-to-six-year period,\" he added. \"But it’s the truth.\" Amelie Botbol is a freelance journalist based in Tel Aviv.

In Trump’s Tuesday announcement from the Oval Office, he claimed the Houthis \"just don't want to fight…and we will honor that. We will stop the bombings.\" The president would not say who provided him with this confirmation by the terrorist network, which for years has attacked U.S. and allied ships in the Red Sea in amajor threat to freedom of navigation, but in a laugh following the question, he replied that it came from a \"very good source.\" Less than two hours later, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, the foreign minister ofOman, took to Xto say, \"Following recent discussions and contacts conducted by the Sultanate of Oman with the United States and the relevant authorities in Sana'a, in the Republic of Yemen, with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.\" TRUMP CLAIMS HOUTHIS 'DON'T WANT TO FIGHT' AND SAYS US WILL STOP BOMBING CAMPAIGN U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a news conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on December 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"In the future,neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,\" he added. The post suggests that Oman, which has also played an intermediary in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, was heavily involved in securing the ceasefire. However, a new report obtained by Fox News Digital ahead of the president’s surprise announcement warns that the Trump administration must remain vigilant against major security threats posed by the Houthis and the international actors supporting theterrorist network. Thereport,dubbed \"The Houthi Challenge: Forging a Strategy to Defeat the Iran-Backed Terror Group in Yemen\" by Ari Heistein for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, highlighted that it is not only Iran that have helped facilitate the Houthi operational capabilities. While Tehran has backed the Houthis since at least 2014 – and possibly as early as 2009 during thewar in Yemen– through training and advanced weapons like ballistic missiles, Oman has also played a role by allowing the group to operate from its territory and serving as a key smuggling route for Iranian arms.

The report found that Iranian arms are smuggled into Yemen through the port of Hodeidah – which was targeted in aseries of Israeli strikeson major infrastructure in and around the Houthi-controlled capital of Sana’a this week – but also through smaller ports or overland through Oman. Omani private banking institutions and businesses are also reportedly known to be \"servicing the Houthi economy and even supplying the group with arms.\" \"More must be done to prevent bulk cash smuggling across the border between Oman and Yemen,\" Heistein found. \"Muscat must begin to feel pressure from the international community to address a threat finance challenge that has gone unchecked for too long.\" The report breaks down the varied steps that need to be taken to effectively undermine and counter the Houthis as repeated military strikes by first,Saudi Arabia starting in 2015, then recently by the U.S. and Israel, have not significantly degraded the terrorist group.

But military action alone isn’t enough; economic, diplomatic, and other soft power strategies are also needed to weaken the group, according to the report. The report also highlighted that the Houthis have utilized previous lulls in fighting with nations like Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Israel to regroup and rebuild. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Compelling the Houthis to halt attacks on shipping is a meaningful achievement only if it is part of a broader, long-term strategy,\" Heistein told Fox News Digital. \"However, if a Red Sea ceasefire becomes the centerpiece and endpoint of U.S. policy toward the Houthis, it risks empowering an increasingly dangerous regime to escalate and de-escalate at will. \"Without a comprehensive approach to addressing the Houthi threat, the U.S. and its allies could soon be confronting a more dangerous, better-armed terrorist group,\" Heinstein warned.

    "article_text": "During a press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump said relations with North Korea will happen. North Korealaunched several short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern sea Thursday in what South Korea is calling a \"clear act of provocation.\" Lee Sung Joon, a spokesperson forSouth Korea’sJoint Chiefs of Staff, said the launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons that North Korea plans to export as it continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia’s warfighting against Ukraine. The agency said multiple missiles were launched from an area around North Korea’s eastern port city of Wonsan from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m. local time Thursday, with the farthest traveling about 497 miles. Lee said the tests likely involved a short-range ballistic missile system launched from vehicles — possibly modeled after Russia’s Iskander missile -- and also large-caliber rocket artillery systems. 600 NORTH KOREAN TROOPS KILLED WHILE FIGHTING UKRAINE, SOUTH KOREA SAYS A TV screen shows a file image of North Korea's missile launch during a news program at Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, May 8.(AP/Ahn Young-joon) The Joint Chiefs said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities detected the launch preparations in advance and tracked the missiles after they were launched. It issued a statement denouncing the launches as a \"clear act of provocation\" that threatens peace and stability in the region, according to the Associated Press. South Korean military officials are now analyzing whether the tests were linked to the North’s weapons exports to Russia. In early March, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea just hours after South Korea and the United States kicked off their first major joint military exercise of President Donald Trump’s second term. \"We are aware of the DPRK’s multiple ballistic missile launches and are consulting closely with the Republic of Korea and Japan, as well as other regional allies and partners. The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,\" the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement at the time.

After denying its war involvement for months, North Korea last month confirmed for the first time that it had sent combat troops to help Russia in recapturing parts of the Kursk region, which had fallen to a surprise Ukrainian incursion last year.

    "article_text": "Marc Short, former top aide to ex-Vice President Mike Pence, spoke with Fox News Digital about Republicans' tax negotiations. A former top aide in PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst administration is arguing that Republicans raising taxes on wealthy Americans \"makes no sense.\" Marc Short, the former chief of staff to ex-Vice President Mike Pence, was an integral part of negotiations for Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). He also served in Trump's first White House as director of legislative affairs from 2017 to 2018. \"Raising taxes on America's highest earners and biggest job creators makes no sense. I don't understand why there are some inside the current administration who are pushing Congress to raise the top rate, because again, these are America's job creators,\" Short said. \"So many small businesses file taxes as individuals. And so you're actually going to be raising taxes on many small businesses, not just individuals.\" SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL President Donald Trump wants to lower taxes for middle- and working-class Americans.(Getty) Congressional Republicans are working on a massive piece of legislation that Trump has dubbed his \"big, beautiful bill,\" aimed at advancing his policies on tax, border security, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. The tax policy portion is expected to be the costliest, and House negotiators are working on identifying a number of areas to cut a total of at least $1.5 trillion to offset the new spending. A source familiar with Trump's thinking told Fox News Digital he's consideringallowing the rateon individuals making $2.5 million or more to revert from 37% to the pre-2017 39.6%. It will help pay for massive middle- and working-class tax cuts as well as protect Medicaid, the source said. The TCJA lowered the tax rate for the top income bracket — currently $609,350 for single filers — to 37%, a cut that's expiring at the end of this year. Marc Short, who was chief of staff for ex-Vice President Mike Pence, spoke with Fox News Digital about tax hikes.(Getty Images) Creating a new, higher tax bracket for people earning significantly more than that would help pay for extending the 2017 tax cuts as well as implementing Trump's new priorities: eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees'Social Securitychecks. But Short, who helped get the 2017 package passed, dismissed those new Trump priorities as short-sighted political sweeteners. \"I feel like some of the administration's new requirements are somewhat gimmicky. I'm not sure many Americans who earn their income based on tips are even paying taxes on those tips right now. And I think we should begin to extend that to say no tax on overtime,\" he said. Short said those changes would create \"a lot of additional hurdles for businesses to comply with.\" \"I think the no tax on Social Security, it seems like what we're trying to do is different from 2017, when we passed the Tax Cuts and Job Act,\" he said. \"We tried to simplify the tax code, make it flatter and fair for all Americans, as opposed to creating carve-outs for certain constituencies.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for a response to Short's remarks. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., is ushering House Republicans through reconciliation.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) Some conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity are also wary of a potential tax hike for the wealthy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Richard Stern, director of the Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at the Heritage Foundation, said the group is opposed to efforts to raise tax rates to 40% or higher. \"Congress needs to get its fiscal house in order, but it must do so by tightening its own belt, not by forcing American taxpayers to tighten theirs. A higher top tax rate would be counterproductive, discouraging hard work and entrepreneurship,\" Stern said.

    "article_text": "UCLA student Eli Tsives comments on ongoing antisemitic rhetoric on college campuses and how he believes the problem should be resolved. The University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, medical school was hit with a class-action lawsuit on Thursday for reportedly still employing a race-based admissions process despite a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that race-based programs for college admissions are unconstitutional, Fox News Digital has learned. \"UCLA’s Geffen School of Medicine has continually treated the Students for Fair Admissions ruling as a recommendation, rather than a binding law handed down by the highest court in the land,\" Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, chair of Do No Harm, told Fox News Digital. \"Do No Harm is fighting for all the students who have been racially discriminated against by UCLA under the guise of political progress. All medical schools must abide by the law of the land and prioritize merit, not immutable characteristics, in admissions.\" Do No Harm, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting against \"radical progressive ideology\" in the health industry, and nonprofit legal advocacy organization Students for Fair Admissions filed the class-action lawsuit Thursday afternoon on behalf of applicants who allegedly faced \"intentional discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity in the admissions process\" at UCLA's medical school, according to the lawsuit. WATCH: UNEARTHED FOOTAGE EXPOSES MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS PLEDGING TO RESIST TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDERS Royce Hall on the campus of UCLA.(iStock) \"The numbers show that UCLA is engaged in intentional racial balancing. Between 2020 and 2023, the percentage of white and Asian applicants to Geffen was consistently around 73% of the total applicant pool. Yet, the percentage of matriculants to Geffen who are white and Asian plummeted: 65.7% in 2020, 57.1% in 2021, 57.8% in 2022, and 53.7% in 2023,\" the lawsuit alleges. UCLA's medical school is highly competitive with an acceptance rate of about 3.3%, according toU.S. News and World Report's college rankings.

The Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that it is unconstitutional to use race-based affirmative action programs.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The suit alleges that the medical school's admissions process violates theSupreme Court'sruling in the 2023 case, Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. The nation's highest court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use race-based affirmative action programs in college admissions processes as it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. PresidentDonald Trumpadditionally signed an executive order on Jan. 21, one day after his inauguration, that restored \"merit-based opportunity\" and charged federal agencies with enforcing civil rights laws and \"combat\" DEI practices. AG BONDI LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO DEI ADMISSIONS POLICIES AT STANFORD, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS The lawsuit alleges that whistleblowers \"with first-hand knowledge\" of the school's dean of admissions rolled out an admissions process plan that requires Geffen \"applicants to submit responses that are intended to allow the Committee to glean the applicant’s race, which the medical school later confirms via interviews.\" The admission committee, according to the suit, additionally \"routinely and openly discuss race (and racial proxies) and use race as a factor to make admission decisions.\" LIBERAL IDEOLOGY ‘QUITE DANGEROUS’ IN HEALTH CARE, DO NO HARM FOUNDER SAYS: 'POISONS THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE' The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA is already facing investigation by the Department ofHealth and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights over allegations it discriminates against applicants on the basis of race, color or national origin.

    "title": "GOP senators: Congress should vote on Trump's potential Iran nuclear deal",
    "article_text": "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said that in order for an Iran deal to be \"durable\" and not undone by a future administration, it would need to be negotiated as a treaty for Senate ratification. A pair of hawkish, Trump-supporting Senate Republicans say that any \"lasting\"Iran nuclear dealwould need to be approved by Congress, ideally through a two-thirds majority treaty vote. But scoring a two-thirds majority in the Senate for treaty ratification would require Iran to fulfill a series of steep demands. In addition to getting rid of all of its enriched uranium and centrifuges, GOP lawmakers say it would need to dismantle its ballistic missile program and cease all support for terrorist groupsacross the Middle East. \"If they want the most durable and lasting kind of deal, then they want to bring it to the Senate and have it voted on as a treaty,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in response to a question from Fox News Digital. \"That was one reason why President Obama's deal was so weak,\" Cotton went on. \"An agreement between the American president, whoever he or she may be, and a foreign leader, can be reversed by future presidents, which President Trump rightly did seven years ago today.\" TRUMP TARGETS IRANIAN OIL WITH SANCTIONS, INCREASING PRESSURE ON ISLAMIC REPUBLIC TO MAKE DEAL ON NUKES Sen. Tom Cotton said, \"If they want the most durable and lasting kind of deal, then they want to bring it to the Senate and have it voted on as a treaty.\"(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) In 2015, Cotton led an open letter signed by Senate Republicans to Iranian leaders warning that any nuclear agreement not approved by Congress could be undone by a future administration. The move was widely viewed as a direct effort to undermine President Barack Obama’s ongoing negotiations. Sen.Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., echoed the call for congressional oversight, saying that \"at a minimum\" any deal must go through the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), which passed Congress in 2015 with resounding bipartisan support and guarantees lawmakers a chance to review any accord reached with Tehran. Graham said he had told Secretary of State Marco Rubio there was \"no way\" to get 67 votes to ratify a treaty agreement without Iran totally dismantling its nuclear and missile programs and support for terrorism.

Lindsey Graham before a vote on Feb. 20, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The senators also drew a parallel with the so-called 123 agreements – the legal frameworks that govern U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with foreign nations. These agreements require strict safeguards to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. \"It's also customary in some cases for the Congress, not just the Senate, to pass ordinary legislation that supports the so-called 123 agreements,\" Cotton noted, suggesting that any comprehensive deal with Iran should be treated with similar legislative rigor. Cotton and Graham spoke to reporters after introducing a resolution outlining \"acceptable\" terms of an Iran deal, including total cessation of uranium enrichment. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has amassed enough highly enriched uranium to potentially build several nuclear weapons if it chose to do so – though U.S. intelligence assessments maintain that Tehran has not yet made a decision to weaponize. Both U.S. and Israeli officials have ramped up their threats against the regime. Trump has made clear that if talks go south, the U.S. will engage in direct military action to thwart Iran’s nuclear program.

Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts used a public appearance Wednesday to stress the importance of an independent judiciary, doubling down on defense of the courts under fire by PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies, who have accused so-called \"activist judges\" of overstepping their bounds. Asked during a fireside chat event in Buffalo, New York, about judicial independence, Roberts responded in no uncertain terms that the role of the federal courts is to \"decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive.\" That role, he added, \"does require a degree of independence.\" BOASBERG GRILLS DOJ OVER REMARKS FROM TRUMP AND NOEM, FLOATS MOVING MIGRANTS TO GITMO IN ACTION-PACKED HEARING President Donald Trump shakes hands with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump and family look on at the U.S. Capitol Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Chip Somodevilla/Pool via Reuters) Roberts' remarks are not new. But they comeas Trump and his allies haverailed against federal judges who have paused or halted key parts of the president's agenda. (Some of the rulings they've taken issue with came from judges appointed by Trump in his first term.) The Supreme Court is slated to hear a number of high-profile cases and emergency appeals filed by the Trump administration in the next few months, cases that are all but certain to keep the high court in the spotlight for the foreseeable future. Among them are Trump's executive orders banning transgender service members from serving in the U.S. military, restoring fired federal employees to their jobs and a case about whether children whose parents illegally entered the U.S. and were born here should be granted citizenship. Oral arguments for that last case kick off next week.

    "title": "Trump considers tax hike on Americans making $2.5 million or more per year",
    "article_text": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports the latest on the effort to pass the reconciliation bill from Capitol Hill. PresidentDonald Trumpis considering a small tax increase for wealthy Americans to help pay for his priorities to boost the middle and working classes. A source familiar with Trump's thinking told Fox News Digital that Trump is considering allowing the rate on individuals making $2.5 million or more to increase by 2.6%, from 37% to 39.6%. He quietly pushed Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the idea in a phone call on Wednesday, two people familiar with conversations told Fox News Digital. It comes as Republicans work on a massive piece of legislation advancing Trump's priorities on taxes, border security, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt, which the president has dubbed his \"big, beautiful bill.\" MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE President Donald Trump is helping get House Republicans' budget bill over the line.(Getty Images) Differing projections show the bill is likely to add trillions of dollars to the country's deficit over the next 10 years, so fiscal hawks are looking for ways to mitigate that and set up America for a less bloated government down the line by pairing the new priorities with deep spending cuts elsewhere. The tax portion of the bill is expected to be the costliest portion. Republicans are hoping to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as pay for newer Trump priorities like eliminating taxes on tips, overtime wages and retirees' Social Security. TCJA previously lowered taxes for the highest bracket from 39.6% to 37%, but that's set to expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to restore that top bracket, albeit for people making significantly more money than the current threshold. The current top tax bracket is $609,350 for single income earners. The source familiar with Trump's thinking said doing so would help pay for his \"massive\" tax cuts for the middle and working classes, as well as protect Medicaid coverage for millions of Americans. Punchbowl Newsfirst reported details of the Trump-Johnson phone call. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY President Donald Trump wants Republicans to cut taxes on tipped and overtime wages.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) It's not clear yet what Republicans will decide, or even if they will ultimately decide to raise taxes on the highest earners – but details are expected to emerge in the coming days. The Ways & Means Committee, the House's tax-writing panel, is expected to meet on Tuesday afternoon to advance that portion of Trump's bill. Talks about potential tax hikes on the wealthy have triggered a deep rift within the Republican Party. Mainstream conservatives have balked at discussions of raising rates on anyone, arguing it would have a negative impact on job creators, while populist and more moderate Republicans have floated such ideas in order to pay for Trump's priorities to benefit the middle and working classes. \"Raising taxes on America's highest earners and biggest job creators makes no sense,\" Marc Short, a former chief of staff to ex-Vice President Mike Pence and a key part of TCJA negotiations, told Fox News Digital. \"I don't understand why there are some inside the current administration who are pushing Congress to raise the top rate, because again, these are America's job creators.\" Former Vice President Mike Pence and his allies are against raising taxes on the wealthy.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Other Republicans told Fox News Digital in recent weeks that they believe the idea could be popular, however. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I'm open-minded to what the president or the treasury secretary may have in mind. And I would want to seesome numbersbehind it and how it would have an effect on the economy,\" conservative Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital in late April. \"What I've heard from people in the upper tax brackets is, you know, they're willing to pay more as long as they know that it's paying the debt down. They don't want to see it go toward more spending.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and Johnson's office for comment.

    "article_text": "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel explains how the Democrats' fight for deported El Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia is causing messaging confusion amid newly surfaced allegations. The lawyers representingKilmar Abrego Garciahave asked a federal judge for permission to take three additional depositions – from representatives of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the State Department and the Department of Justice (DOJ) – regarding what steps, if any, the Trump administration has taken to facilitate the illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member's release from custody in El Salvador. In a motion filed Wednesday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland to order the government to designate individuals from DHS,the State Departmentand the DOJ \"who can testify about information known or reasonably available to each Department.\" They cited a federal rule to prevent \"bandying\" of organizations, saying this way would be \"the most efficient and least intrusive approach to obtain the necessary discovery.\" \"By allowing the Government to identify its own Rule 30(b)(6) representatives, Plaintiffs hope to avoid imposing the burden on the heads of the Departments to testify, while properly putting the onus on the Government to prepare their chosen representatives with the Departments’ complete knowledge of the narrow issues at stake in this case,\" they wrote. They noted the court has already approved four depositions, three of which have already taken place, yet \"plaintiffs are still in the dark about the government’s efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody and return to the United States.\" DEPORTATION FLIGHTS TO LIBYA WOULD VIOLATE COURT ORDER WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS This undated photo provided by Murray Osorio PLLC shows Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(Murray Osorio PLLC via AP) Abrego Garcia's lawyers said they also might request that someone from the White House testify. \"In fact, as seems apparent from its public statements, this case also involves decisionmakingat the White Housein addition to the three Departments,\" they wrote. \"Accordingly, depending on the testimony obtained in any authorized Department depositions, Plaintiffs may need to seek additional testimony from an appropriately knowledgeable representative of the White House.\" Fox News Digital reached out to DHS, the State Department, the DOJ, and the White House for comment, but none immediately responded.

However, for a president aiming to pass a sweeping agenda through Congress, it is the political reaction that may be of upmost importance. Trump's approval ratings have been sliding since he returned to power in the White House three and a half months ago and are now underwater in most national polling.

Front and center is Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement a month ago, which sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession. Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House. An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around six points.

NEWARK AIRPORT HIT WITH NEW DELAYS, OUTAGE HEARD ON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AUDIO Officials say the current system was built \"for the past,\" but the new proposal is to build a system \"for the future.\" The plan would ensure facilities are equipped with better technologies to reduce outages, improve efficiency and reinforce safety. \"We're going to be buying a brand-new, state of the art system that will cover the entire world,\" Trump said earlier Thursday. The plan consists of four infrastructure components: communications, surveillance, automation and facilities, according to the Transportation Department. A Southwest plane lands at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Dec. 30, 2022.(Carolyn Kaster, File/The Associated Press) Officials plan, by 2028, to replace current telecommunications systems with new fiber, wireless and satellite technologies at more than 4,600 sites, 25,000 new radios and 475 new voice switches. By 2027, 618 radars will also be replaced. The plan also would address runway safety by increasing the number of airports with Surface Awareness Initiative to 200. Officials expect this to be complete by 2027. DUFFY BLASTS BIDEN, BUTTIGIEG FOR IGNORING REPORT ABOUT FAILING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM: 'DID NOTHING!' The Transportation Department also proposed building six new air traffic control centers for the first time since the 1960s. It also proposes replacing 15 towers and 15 co-located TRACONs, or Terminal Radar Approach Controls, which are facilities that manage air traffic in the airspace surrounding busy airports. Officials also proposed the installation of new modern hardware and software for all air traffic facilities, which would create a common platform system throughout all towers, TRACONs and centers. The proposal also includes the deployment of additional technologies to the Caribbean and Alaska to provide accurate, real-time surveillance and weather information for air traffic control and pilots to ensure \"safe and efficient flights for these critical locations.\" Officials stressed the need for a new air traffic control system, saying the FAA is grappling with a \"rapidly growing, complex and demanding aviation sector,\" as commercial air travel returns to pre-COVID levels. Officials also pointed to novel challenges, including drones and advanced air mobility. Officials said the FAA's current systems \"are showing their age,\" which leads to \"delays and inefficiencies.\" The Department of Transportation stressed that the current National Airspace System is \"safe,\" but stressed that maintaining safety is necessary. The proposal is based on a three-year framework to reinvest in the National Airspace System, and called for an \"emergency supplemental funding increase.\" ASTOUNDING NEW AUDIO SHOWS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS REACTING TO FAA TECH OUTAGE: 'THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE' \"Modernization of the NAS can no longer take 10+ years to complete; it must be done now,\" the proposal states. \"We need an immediate infusion of funding to address critical infrastructure needs.\" Duffy, on Thursday, said the project would take three to four years. \"I need help, I can't do it by myself. And it's going to take the help of the Congress to make that happen,\" Duffy said. \"We need all of the money up front.\" Duffy said requesting the money in \"small tranches\" over the course of several years would extend the project. \"Politics change, leadership changes, presidents change, interest changes, and it never gets built,\" Duffy said. \"So I'm going to ask the Congress for upfront appropriations to give us all the money. I'll come before the Congress every, every quarter and give them an update of how far we've built, how much money we've spent.\" Duffy added that if the Department of Transportation is not given the money, it would take \"10 to 15 years to build this.\" \"And by the time we get done with it, what we're going to build is already going to be old technology,\" Duffy said. \"So we want to build this in three to four years, and we can do it with the help of Congress.\" A report issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in March shows that the Trump administration inherited an outdated FAA system from the Biden administration with \"severe shortcomings\" that resulted in dangerous travel conditions across the country.

    "title": "Age-old seniority question divides Democrats as Biden returns to national spotlight",
    "article_text": "Former President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden joined the hosts of \"The View\" on Thursday morning. Former PresidentJoe Bidenis easing back into the public eye, as he delivered his first speech since leaving office last month and sat for his first post-presidency interviews. The 82-year-old former party leader reflected on the Democrats' November losses and discussed the future of the party on \"The View\" Thursday morning. While the Biden administration relentlessly defended the first octogenarian president's mental acuity throughout his one and only term, his disastrous debate performance against PresidentDonald Trumpand his subsequent suspension of his re-election campaign revealed a different reality. \"The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party,\" Biden maintained to the hosts of \"The View.\" However, as Democrats grapple with the fallout of losing the White House, Senate and failing to regain the House in November, the age-old seniority question has returned to the fold of theDemocratic Party, as Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the 35-year-old progressive making waves as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, said she will not seek the top Democrat position on the House Oversight Committee. DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR GETS ULTIMATUM: STAY NEUTRAL IN PRIMARIES OR STEP DOWN FROM PARTY LEADERSHIP Former President Joe Biden appeared on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday.(ABC/Getty) \"It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,\" Ocasio-Cortez's spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital in a statementfirst reported by NBC. WATCH: AOC LEAVES DOOR OPEN FOR 2028 PRESIDENTIAL BID AS CAMPAIGN BUZZ SOARS Ocasio-Cortez lost her House Oversight bid to 74-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., late last year. Connollyannounced last monthhis plan to step back as ranking member of the Oversight Committee after just four months on the job, due to a resurgence of esophageal cancer, adding that it would be his final term in Congress. Connolly's decision opened the door for Ocasio-Cortez to consider another attempt to lead the committee, which is best positioned to investigate the Trump administration if Democrats manage to regain the House in 2026. Ocasio-Cortez, citing the Democratic Party's \"underlying dynamics\" that prioritize seniority in party leadership, renewed a conversation started by Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice ChairDavid Hogg'splan to primary challenge older incumbent Democrats. Hogg's Super PAC, Leaders We Deserve, announced a plan last month to spend $20 million to help elect younger Democrats in deep-blue districts, which the 25-year-old party leader said are \"asleep at the wheel.\" Former President Joe Biden appeared on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday.(ABC/Screenshot) The unprecedented move was ridiculed by many, including veteran Democrat strategistJames Carville, who called it \"the most insane thing I ever heard.\" \"Aren't we supposed to run against Republicans?\" Carville asked in an interview with CNN. While the two Democrats seemed to bury the hatchet in arecent and rare joint interviewon \"The Tara Palmeri Show,\" Hogg's move prompted DNC Chair Ken Martin to announce a neutrality pledge for DNC officials and an ultimatum for the young progressive – either resign as vice chair or forego his involvement in Leaders We Deserve, his group leading the multimillion-dollar plight to challenge senior Democrats. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is interviewed by Fox News Digital at Yale University on April 15, 2025 in New Haven, Connecticut.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Rep.Ro Khanna, D-Calif, one of several younger Democrats leading the resistance to Trump's second term and a name floated as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, told Fox News Digital in a recent interview that \"we have to have a whole rebrand of the Democratic Party with a coherent platform and a future-oriented platform, and many leaders need to do that, new leaders, not the old guard. And I hope to be part of that.\" Ocasio-Cortez's decision not to seek a House Oversight leadership position comes as rumors about her 2028 presidential or 2026 senatorial ambitions swirl following aviral campaign-style video, filmed on the road with Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. Those rumors followed the progressive Democrat's record-breaking fundraising haul, one of the biggest ever for a House lawmaker, raising $9.6 million in the past three months. A Siena College poll also found Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer'sfavorability is down, at 39% among New York state voters questioned in the poll, which was conducted April 14-16. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez's favorability soared to 47%.

The White House will unveil a new nominee to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, following resistance to the administration's current pick, according to PresidentDonald Trump. Trump had nominated Ed Martin, a former defense attorney who represented Americans charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, for the role. Martin has taken on the responsibilities of the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., since January. However, the Senate has held up confirming Martin, amid concerns from lawmakers.

And we have somebody else that will be announcing over the next two days who's going to be great.\" But Trump signaled later in the day that Martin's career with the Trump administration wasn't completely shot.

    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance previewed the next round of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks happening next week during a Munich Security Conference event in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. The Trump administration on Thursday targeted Iranian oil with a new slate of sanctions — a move that increases pressure on the Islamic Republic amid talks between U.S. and Iranian officials to make a deal to preventnuclearproliferation, Fox News Digital has learned. TheTreasury Department’sOffice of Foreign Assets Control increased pressure on Iran’s export of oil on Thursday, designating the \"teapot\" refinery Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group Co., Ltd., and three port terminal operators in Shandong province, China, for their role in purchasing or facilitating the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil. VANCE PREVIEWS US-IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS, SAYS TRUMP 'OPEN' TO SITTING DOWN WITH RUSSIANS, CHINESE IN FUTURE The \"teapot\" refineries purchase the majority of Iranian crude oil exports, according to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department on Thursday is also imposing sanctions on several companies, vessels and captains they say are responsible for facilitating Iranian oil shipments as part of Iran’s so-called \"shadow fleet.\" The companies and vessels are all China-based.

The Treasury Department, led by Scott Bessent, is also imposing sanctions on several companies, vessels and captains they say are responsible for facilitating Iranian oil shipments as part of Iran’s so-called \"shadow fleet.\"(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Thursday’s sanctions are the latest round targeting Iranian oil sales since the president, in early February, issued a national security memorandum that instituted a campaign of \"maximum economic pressure on Iran.\" As for Iran’s \"shadow fleet,\" Tehran relies on obscure ship management companies to manage its fleet of tankers that \"mask\" Iran’s petroleum shipments to China using ship-to-ship transfers with sanctioned vessels. The Treasury Department on Thursday took action to increase pressure on that \"shadow fleet\" of actors by designating ships as \"blocked property.\" Any violation of U.S. sanctions may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties on U.S. or foreign persons, the Treasury Department said.

    "title": "One-man Cabinet: Marco Rubio went from rival to Trump's point man, but can he handle it?",
    "article_text": "Former NSC and State Department official Andrew Tabler told Fox News Digital he believes Sec. of State Marco Rubio is ‘quite energetic’ and can handle the demands of both State and the National Security Council. In a surprising twist of fate,Marco Rubiohas gone from bitter presidential rival to President Donald Trump’s go-to guy. At the start of the new administration, current and former officials speculated Rubio would be one of the firstCabinet officialsshown the door, as his America First credentials were called into question given his previously hawkish foreign policy views. Instead, Rubio has only continued to find favor with the president – so much so that he now holds an unprecedented four different roles within the administration. \"When I have a problem, I call up Marco. He gets it solved,\" Trump quipped earlier this month. TRUMP TO TAP NEW NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR IN 6 MONTHS; CALLS WALTZ MOVE ‘UPGRADE’ In a turn of events that has shocked many, Marco Rubio has increasingly become President Donald Trump’s go-to guy.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) First, Rubio glided into the secretary of state role with a 99-0 Senate confirmation. Then, Trump and his team dismantled USAID and merged it under Rubio's State Department leadership, naming him acting director. The secretary was subsequently tapped to lead the National Archives in an acting capacity, and as of last week, he’s also replaced Mike Waltz as acting national security advisor. \"This is an expression of trust,\" said Andrew Tabler, a former senior official at State and the National Security Council (NSC). \"It's a sign that the president likes Secretary Rubio, despite the odds.\" Trump has suggested the interim arrangement could last up to six months, and while that may be an expression of the president's confidence in Rubio, some are questioning whether one person can effectively juggle four high-profile roles. \"Marco Rubio is very talented but no one can do that,\" said Joel Rubin, former senior State Department official. Henry Kissinger was the last person to serve as both secretary of state and national security advisor, holding both roles for over two years from 1975 to 1977. But that was half a century ago, and threats facing the nation have only multiplied. MIKE WALTZ, OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFFERS OUT IN LATEST TRUMP PURGE FOLLOWING SIGNAL CHAT LEAK Rubio has continued to find favor with the president – so much so that he now holds an unprecedented four different roles within the administration.(Reuters/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) Rubin, who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, called the workload \"not fair to the individual, not fair to the taxpayer, and not fair to President Trump, who needs strong, independent advice from a national security advisor.\" \"The president has assembled an incredibly talented team that is fully committed to putting America and Americans first,\" a senior State Department official said in response to an inquiry on Rubio's many duties. \"Secretary Rubio looks forward to serving as his interim national security advisor while ensuring the mission-critical work at the State Department continues uninterrupted.\" The national security advisor is traditionally the president’s closest aide on matters of war, peace and global crisis – physically located near the Oval Office and ready to brief the president at any moment. That proximity is hard to maintain when the same person is flying overseas for diplomatic missions. \"If he has tofly off to Pakistanto stop a nuclear war, then the president's national security advisor, who usually is sitting right next to him, is not there.\" The reshuffling follows a broader shake-up inside the National Security Council, which lost Waltz, deputy advisor Alex Wong, and a number of staffers in early April. That thinning of personnel, several sources said, has only compounded the stakes. \"There are major national security issues in three different theaters. Europe, Middle East and Asia. One's a hot war, one is a half-hot war, and it's really getting tense in Asia,\" said one former NSC official. \"The president's national security team needs to be filled out, and many people at State and DOD still need to be confirmed.\" TRUMP TO TAP NEW NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR IN 6 MONTHS; CALLS WALTZ MOVE ‘UPGRADE’ National security advisor \"is one of the president’s closest relationships,\" said Michael Allen, former special assistant to the president and senior director at NSC. \"The national security advisor needs to be near the president all the time. Or at least able to brief the president all the time. So this is more duties for Rubio and they’re already short-handed.\" Still, Allen said the president’s personal comfort with his top national security aide may outweigh structural concerns – for now. \"If the president feels like he needs Rubio there, then this is a good solution,\" Allen said. \"At least for the short to medium term.\" Yet others say Rubio’s promotion might be more symbolic than operational, particularly in a White House where influence doesn’t always match job titles. Michael Waltz was replaced as national security advisor by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.(Reuters/Evelyn Hockstein) \"I think it's not, ‘Can Marco Rubio do four jobs?’ It’s, ‘Is he allowed to do his one job – which is Secretary of State?’\" said Mark Feierstein, a former senior official at USAID. \"Foreign counterparts may see him as pleasant in meetings, but they don't necessarily believe he can deliver.\" Feierstein pointed to the dismantling of USAID, the rise of informal advisors like Stephen Miller, and the proliferation of special envoys like Steve Witkoff who bypass Rubio entirely. \"You've got loads of people who report directly to Trump or others. So now it's just chaos,\" he said. Even Rubio’s ideological positioning raises questions. A staunch foreign policy hawk during his time in the Senate, Rubio has in recent months presided over a foreign policy apparatus that includes outreach to Russia and dramatic State Department budget cuts – moves he may once have opposed. \"He’s decided to accommodate,\" Feierstein said. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Rubio's ability to meet voters where they are – and serve as the president's happy warrior – may be the key to his longevity. Sparring with voices like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Vice President JD Vance on foreign policy would only cause further headaches for the president. Tabler, for his part, remained optimistic. \"Rubio is energetic, he knows the issues. He's been working on foreign policy for years,\" he said. \"It’s a positive sign. But how long one person can do that job – and under what circumstances – is up to him.\"",

Tossing in a load of wash at home sounds ordinary and harmless. Buthealthcare professionalswho wash their work uniforms at home may be unknowingly spreading superbugs, according to a new study. Professor Katie Laird of De Montfort University Leicester, a public university in England, testedhome washing machinesin a study and found the machines failed to remove potentially harmful material, even after running a hot water setting at the equivalent of 140 degrees Fahrenheit. SHAMPOO RECALLED FOR BACTERIA CONTAMINATION THAT COULD CAUSE INFECTION \"Our research highlights that domestic laundering of healthcare textiles may not consistently eliminate harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria,\" Laird told Fox News Digital. The team tested six different models of washing machines to see how well they cleaned fabric contaminated with bacteria that can cause a variety of health conditions. Healthcare professionals who wash their work uniforms at home may be unknowingly spreading superbugs, according to a new study.(iStock) Half of the machines did not disinfect the clothing during a rapid cycle — while a third of them failed to clean sufficiently during the standard cycle. Laird, aprofessor of microbiologyin the School of Pharmacy and head of the university's Infectious Disease Research Group, said the finding \"highlights potential risks associated with laundering healthcare uniforms at home, particularly concerning the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within community and hospital settings.\" A COMMON KILLER BUG IS ENDANGERING AMERICANS: ‘PANDEMIC IN PLAIN SIGHT’ In addition, this could mean home washing machines are a hub forantibiotic-resistant bacteria. Domestic detergents could even potentially create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, according to Laird. Even if healthcare workers followed all washing guidelines, half the machines in the study didn’t reach the correct temperature, the study found. Healthcare professionals and their institutions should consider re-evaluating policies that allow workers to wash their work clothing at home, said a professor of microbiology who oversaw a new study.(iStock) \"What this means is that even if healthcare workers are following all the guidelines to domestically wash their uniforms, they will still not be reaching the disinfection level required to remove all pathogenic bacteria,\" the professor said. The study was conducted with non-healthcare personnel, so the bacteria on that clothing may differ from the clothing of those who work in healthcare settings. NEW CLASS OF ANTIBIOTICS DISCOVERED: 'PROMISING ANSWER' Potentially, however, the latter would see higher levels of \"pathogenic andantibiotic resistantstrains in healthcare workers’ domestic washing machines,\" the professor said.

    "title": "Maine Democrats respond to SCOTUS appeal over Rep Laurel Libby's censure for trans athlete post",
    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby talks to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. Maine state Rep.Laurel Libbyis seeking U.S. Supreme Court intervention in her lawsuit to overturn her censure for a social media post that identified a minor trans athlete. Now, the Democrat defendants have filed their response to the high court. The defendants, Maine House SpeakerRyan Fecteauand House Clerk Robert Hunt, represented by Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, defended the decision to censure Libby for the February post in their response on Thursday afternoon. \"Like other censures of Maine House members, the censure resolution required Rep. Libby to apologize for her conduct—not recant her views. Rep. Libby has steadfastly refused to comply with this modest punishment, which is designed to restore the integrity and reputation of the body,\" the response read. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Her refusal places her in breach of a centuries-old rule of the Maine House, Rule 401(11), that Rep. Libby previously agreed, along with all of her House colleagues, would govern House proceedings. Rule 401(11) provides that a member found by the body to be in breach of its rules may not participate in floor debates or vote on matters before the full House until they have 'made satisfaction,' i.e., here, apologized for their breach.\" Libby provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the response. \"I was elected to represent the people of my district and defend their rights. I spoke up to defend the rights of women and girls—who are being discriminated against and silenced under policies that allow biological males to compete in female sports. For that, I’ve been targeted and punished, not for misconduct, but for refusing to issue a forced apology. The First Amendment protects my right to speak—and just as importantly, my right not to be compelled to say something I do not believe,\" she said. When the Democrat majority in Maine's House of Representatives voted to censure Libby on Feb. 25, it originally offered to restore her voting and speaking rights if she apologized for the post. But Libby told them she wouldn't apologize. Libby previously told Fox News Digital that Fecteau called her the day after she made the social media post, which identified a trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition, on Feb. 18. \"He found it objectionable and asked me to take it down. At the same time, I asked him if he would support Maine girls and support policy that stopped discrimination against Maine young women in sports, and he declined to answer,\" Libby said. \"The main criticism all along from the Democrats is that it was a picture of a minor.\" Libby added that no one from the trans athlete's family or high school reached out to her about the post. She has also argued the athlete was already publicized in other media. The Portland Press Herald published a recap of the event, mentioning the athlete. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Libby filed her lawsuit against Fecteau to have the censure overturned on March 11. But Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose ruledagainst Libbyin her case on April 22. DuBose, appointed by former President Joe Biden in January, ended up presiding over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Judges John C. Nivison, John A. Woodcock, Lance E. Walker, Karen F. Wolf, Stacey D. Neumann and Nancy Torresen signed recusal orders shortly after the case was initially filed. No reason was given. DuBose ended up with the case and ruled in favor of Fecteau. Then the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled against Libby. So now Libby is seeking U.S. Supreme Court intervention. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department announced a lawsuit against the State of Maine for its continued defiance ofTrump’sexecutive order to keep biological males out of girls’ and women’s sports and for violations of Title IX. Libby attended the press conference alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon. Two school districts in Maine, Maine's Regional School Unit No. 24 and MSAD No. 70, have taken matters into their own hands and amended their local sports gender eligibility policies to ban transgender athletes from girls' competitions, aligning with Libby and Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Attention to the issue was magnified this past week after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls' track meet. A trans-identifying athlete who competed for North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine, in the Poland-NYA-Yarmouth-Seacoast meet, won the 1600-meter race with a time of 5:57.27, blowing away the second-place runner who finished with a time of 6:16.32. In the 800-meter event, the trans athlete had a closer first-place finish with a time of 2:43.31, just around a second better than the second-place finisher with a time of 2:44.87. Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls' sports tobiological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18. Fox News' Shannon Bream and William Mears contributed to this report.

He then details Bill Belichick's most notable pregame Super B... For more than a decade, Julian Edelman was coached by Bill Belichick. But, in recent weeks, the former New England Patriots coach's accomplishments during his storied football career have largely taken a back seat to his romance withJordon Hudson. Hudson, Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend, was accused of attempting to assert her control during the former NFL coach's sit-down with \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\"The interviewwas part of a promotional tour for Belichick's new book, \"The Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football.\" Amid the fallout, Edelman is encouraging his former coach to return to his no-nonsense, football-first persona.

So, I don’t like to be too judgey on this stuff,\" Cowherd cautioned. While Edelman seemed to agree with Cowherd's approach, he also highlighted how long Belichick's personal life has remained a focal point. \"I dont either, but once again were talking about this three weeks later… it’s on this, it’s on that,\" Edelman said. \"It’s getting to a point where we gotta start worrying about the ACC, (and Clemson coach) Dabo Swinney.

    "title": "Stephanie Turner, Payton McNabb open up on chaotic DOGE hearing on trans athletes",
    "article_text": "Women's fencer Stephanie Turner and former girls' volleyball player Payton McNabb were witnesses in Wednesday's heated DOGE subcommittee hearing on trans athletes in women's sports and were faced with several shocking moments by Democrats. Female athletes Stephanie Turner and Payton McNabb testified to members of Congress at theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) Subcommittee's \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" hearing on Wednesday. At one point during the hearing, the two women were approached by Rep.Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. \"'You're both very courageous. You're very courageous being here, and I want to say thank you for all of this,'\" Crockett said to the two women, Turner told Fox News Digital. \"And I said ‘Payton and I both took time out of our day to be there, and I find it very disrespectful that you would co-opt this hearing that is about me and Payton and make it about your own politics.’\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, center, speaks to Stephanie Turner, left, a fencer who refused to compete against a transgender athlete, and Payton McNabb, a former North Carolina high school volleyball player who was injured by a transgender opponent, during the hearing on \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" held by the DOGE Subcommittee on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Crockett had just used her turn during the hearing to divert the conversation away from protecting women's sports, the main purpose of the hearing, to condemn PresidentDonald Trumpfor other issues. Crockett previously attempted to speak out of turn earlier in the hearing. Then Crockett even made light of the issue of trans athlete inclusion by turning her monologue into a game she called \"Trump or Trans.\" The game featured Crockett asking another witness whether to blame Trump or trans people for a series of unsubstantiated issues that included \"increasing the price of everything\" and \"ignoring the constitution.\" The witness responded \"Trump\" all 12 times. Crockett has been outspokenly opposed to Republican efforts to keep trans athletes out of women's and girls' sports, even previously mocking Americans who claim to have been impacted. Yet, she tried to be complimentary with McNabb and Turner, according to them. \"I think she was lying,\" McNabb, an Independent Women Ambassador, told Fox News Digital. \"I did not believe one word she said, because literally the theatrics, and just how she acted literally the whole time and then trying to come over and whisper and be nice girl to us. I don't know what happened, it was like a whole other person than what we all saw 10 seconds before she got over there.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Crockett for further comment. Crockett's antics were one of just several incidents that highlighted a hearing of chaos that involved multiple shouting matches between committee members and witnesses, as well as plainly questionable comments. Many such comments confused, frustrated and offended Turner and McNabb. McNabb suffered permanent brain injuries in high school after getting spiked in the head by a trans opponent during a volleyball match. She then had to watch opposing witness Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, suggest that the way to prevent other women from facing similar injuries is to prevent spiking in volleyball altogether. \"I would argue that the answer is to ensure people can't spike volleyballs into other people's heads,\" Goss Graves said during the hearing when responding McNabb's story. WOMEN'S SWIMMERS SPEAK OUT AFTER UNKNOWINGLY FACING TRANS COMPETITOR, FILING COMPLAINT: 'I FEEL BETRAYED' Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene holds up maps of the U.S. in front of an alleged screenshot from USA Fencing board director Damien Lehfeldt's Instagram during the hearing on \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" held by the Department of Government Efficiency Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) For McNabb, Goss Graves' answer was startling. \"That was just absolutely ridiculous,\" McNabb said. \"The fact of the matter is, that day and that injury was unlike anything else I've ever experienced, and it's because it was a man who hit me in the face, it's really just that simple.\" What came as an even bigger shock to McNabb was when Goss Graves offered to work with the former volleyball player to help her recover from her brain damage, during the hearing. \"That's not happening. This woman is obviously not sane, and I don't know why she would think I would ever want some medical advice or advice in general from her,\" McNabb said. Turner, who went viral in April for refusing to face a trans opponent at a fencing match and getting punished by USA Fencing, took particular offense to comments made by Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Cal. During Simon's turn, she suggested that protecting women's sports would lead to bringing back racial segregation and that Black women would be disproportionately targeted by trans athlete restriction laws. \"I find that, as a Black woman myself, to be quite offensive,\" Turner said. \"I find it offensive because they lead with this statement ‘as a Black woman, I’m a Black woman.' Well, I'm a Black woman, I was born in Washington D.C., I was raised in one of the bluest parts of America in Montgomery County, Maryland, and no, I don't agree with you, that's wrong.\" Wednesday also marked the first time Turner came face-to-face with USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed to the hearing, since her viral kneel protest. Turner was given a black card for refusing to face the trans opponent, disqualified and escorted out of the venue, and then given a 12-month probation. Lehfeldt was aggressively pressed by Republican committee members throughout the hearing about his organization's pro-trans policies and punishment of Turner.

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., used her time to ask Lehfeldt to apologize to Turner. Lefheldt did not apologize upon the request, and in response, Mace suggested Lehfeldt was \"not\" a man. \"Real men protect women, you're not one,\" Mace said. Turner said she was not surprised by Lehfeldt's refusal to apologize and would not have accepted it even if he did. \"An apology is just empty words without actions,\" Turner said. Turner added that after Wednesday's hearing, she sees the next big goal in the movement to protect women's sports is to push USA Fencing to make concrete changes to its gender eligibility policy to protect women competitors. The organization said it is preparing to amendits current policiesthat allow biological males to compete with women and girls in the event that it is \"forced\" to change it. Education Secretary Linda McMahon previously announced that the newly formedTitle IX investigationsteam will be probing the incident involving Turner and trans competitor Redmond Sullivan.

    "article_text": "GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells told Fox News Digital that his company will be investigating a campaign on his site involving a Temple student in a feud with Barstool founder Dave Portnoy after an incident involving an antisemitic sign. A fundraising campaign on the crowd-sourcing site GiveSendGo has raised over $15,000 for aTemple University studentintending to wage a legal battle amid his feud with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. The student, Mo Khan, was thrust into national controversy after Portnoy accused Khan of posting a video to his Instagram story showing a waitress inside the Barstool Sansom Street bar holding upa signthat read \"F--- the Jews.\" Portnoy initially offered to send the student on a trip to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust in response to his alleged role in the incident, but Khan declined. Instead, the 21-year-old is raising money for legal defense on GiveSendGo. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM However, a video that Khan posted on X advertising the campaign received a community note after Portnoy disputed the student's account of what happened. GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells has told Fox News Digital the company will be \"looking into\" the validity of the campaign. \"We want to make sure campaigns are as truthful as possible so we take reports of disputes seriously, we have our verification team that can take a look, and we'd be happy to take a look at this as well,\" Wells said, admitting he did not previously know of Portnoy's dispute and the community note on Khan's post. \"It's not our responsibility or job necessarily to fact-find around every single campaign unto the nth degree, so there's a balance there, but we'll commit to doing our verification process… We will definitely commit to looking into the campaign as we would any other campaign and go after making sure it is truthful as can be placed in a platform like ours.\" Wells added that if Khan misrepresented the events leading up to his fundraiser in the campaign summary, it \"could be\" grounds for removal of the campaign. \"It could be. I hate doing hypotheticals because there are so many variables in these situations,\" Wells said. \"If there are egregious examples of outright lies in campaign stories, for sure, that would definitely be a terms of service violation and something we would seriously consider for removal.\" KARMELO ANTHONY'S FAMILY'S PLANS FOR $500K DONATIONS AFTER TRACK MEET STABBING REVEALED BY FUNDRAISING EXEC Dave Portnoy reacts as Philly bar brought out an antisemitic sign.(X) Khan claimed in his video that he had nothing to do with bringing the sign to the bar and was simply \"reporting\" on it. Khan also expressed anti-Israel beliefs in the rant. \"Although I had nothing to do with the sign coming out, nor do I know who did it, I know that the sign was provocative because it reminds people a lot of the unjust things that Israel is doing around the world, thus leading me to report on it,\" Khan said, later adding, \"Israel kills thousands of people on a daily basis!\" Portnoy re-posted Khan's video disputing Khan and calling the student \"a liar.\" \"This dude is a flat liar. I talked to him on the phone with his buddy and they both owned up to it and cried about it. He then lawyered up after speaking with his family,\" Portnoy wrote in response to Khan's post on X. Khan has since responded to Portnoy on X, disputing the founder's claim that the student has retained a lawyer and cried over the phone. The initial community note on Khan's post read, \"The story is different from the story that he originally told Dave Portnoy, to the point where Portnoy called him a ‘liar,'\" and included links to Portnoy's response and a New York Post article covering the exchange. However, the post appears to have a new community note that points out a different factor in Khan's history as it relates to the incident. The new community note now reads, \"Several incidents of Mo Khan committing antisemitic acts have surfaced online, including him throwing quarters at Jewish students at Temple University.\" The new note includes links to an NBC Philadelphia story about the incident, but that article does not mention any of Khan's past antisemitic behavior. Still, the new note also points out that Khan did an interview on a podcast run by Stew Peters, who is known to harbor and spread antisemitic beliefs, including operating the website \"dontbeajew.com.

    "article_text": "Seattle Seahawks new quarterback Sam Darnold has been around a few teams in the NFL, so he knows just the right advice to give Shedeur Sanders as he heads into the Cleveland Browns' QB battle this summer. One of the NFL's biggest storylines this preseason will be in Berea, Ohio, as theCleveland Brownswill have an intriguing quarterback competition featuring their fifth-round pick, Shedeur Sanders. Sanders, Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and third-round pick Dillon Gabriel will all be vying for the same job, but the spotlight will be bright on the Colorado signal caller after his NFL Draft slide to the fifth round made national headlines. Sanders wentfrom being a first-round lock to a fifth-round selection that had many scratching their heads, debating about his fit in Cleveland after they just selected Gabriel to make him the third quarterback on the depth chart, next to Flacco and Pickett.

A quarterback competition is somethingSam Darnold,the Seattle Seahawks' new quarterback, has been through in his career. He had a bit of advice for the young Sanders, who is getting his first taste of a training camp battle. \"I think the biggest thing is having respect,\" Darnold told Fox News Digital, while discussing his time with the Lowe's Foundation at SkillsUSA National Signing Day in Seattle. \"Having respect for the teammates that you’re competing with.\" TRUMP DETAILS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN SHEDEUR SANDERS' CLOSELY-WATCHED FALL IN NFL DRAFT While it is a competition, it is important to remember these are also teammates chasing the same goal: winning a Super Bowl. After his failed stint with the New York Jets, who took him third overall in the 2018 NFL Draft, Darnold bounced around multiple teams and had to fight his way into the position he was with the Minnesota Vikings last season. Even there, Darnold fought to win the starting quarterback role, and he earned his place to choose his next team in free agency this offseason. Darnold specifically looked back at his time with the Carolina Panthers, where the player who went two picks before him in that 2018 draft, Baker Mayfield, was his main competition in 2022. Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, #14, looks to throw against the Atlanta Falcons during the second quarter at U.S. Bank Stadium.(Matt Krohn-Imagn Images) \"I was in a quarterback competition in my second year in Carolina with Baker. Me and Baker are still really close to this day, and we both had such a genuine respect for one another,\" Darnold explained. \"Sometimes, it wasn’t exactly clear who was getting the 1’s reps or 2’s reps that day. But when our number was called, whether it was me or Bake going out there with the 1’s, it was just like, ‘All right, go out there.’ \"Then, in the individual drills that day, if I was getting the 1’s reps, Bake would let me take like Christian [McCaffrey] on a route or D.J. Moore on a route. It was always that respect. Then, if it was flipped, if Bake was taking the 1’s reps, I would let him take all the guys he was going to be running with that day. \"I think whether it’s Shedeur or anyone else, I think just having respect for those guys in the quarterbacks room and helping everybody get better. That’s the biggest thing at this point in the season, helping everybody get better. When you do that, you get better yourself, more than you even know.\" As of now, there is a good chance Sanders is not the one under center in Week 1 to begin the Browns' 2025 campaign. How he handles waiting in the wings for his time to shine will also be in the national spotlight.

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) If that moment comes, Darnold wants Sanders to think team first. \"When Bake got the nod for Week 1, I was like, ‘I’m here for you. Anything you need, if you want me to watch tape of certain third-down looks or any blitz packages the defense might have, I’m here for you,'\" Darnold said. \"It’s that kind of way in the quarterbacks room, and there’s nothing that simulates that in the real world.\" CELEBRATING NEXT GENERATION OF TRADE WORKERS While Darnold is getting his bearings in his new city, he made sure to stop by Lowe’s Seattle store ceremony for SkillsUSA National Signing Day, which is a celebration mirroring the excitement of athletic signings but for future electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs and builders. Lowe’s rolled out the blue carpet and all for students, who were surprised by Seattle’s newest football star, and this initiative is one that hits close to home for Darnold.

    "article_text": "StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez talks to Fox News Digital about an anti-Israel campaign taking place in lead up to FIFA World Cup. Stop Antisemitism founder Liora Rez called on FIFA and the White House'sFIFA World Cup2026 Task Force to put a stop to the \"Show Israel the Red Card\" campaign ahead of the global soccer tournament. The campaign began in February at a UEFA Champions League match in Scotland. Celtic FC fans unfurled a banner that called onFIFA and UEFA, the confederation that Israel is a part of, to punish the country’s national team over its response in Gaza to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks. There was no penalty against Celtic FC or its fans for the banner. Since then,CBC reportedthat the campaign has spread across other European countries, including Italy, Spain and Belgium, along with Brazil, Chile, Malaysia and Tunisia.

We’ve seen none of the fans be penalized or removed from the games holding up these signs. So again, we want the task force that President Trump set up to step in ahead of time and be proactive and say, no, this isn’t welcome in the United States. This isn’t gonna fly here.\" Rez added that FIFA President Gianni Infantino should take a \"strong stand\" against the campaign. \"I think it has to be eradicated immediately,\" she said. \"Gianni Infantino needs to take a strong stand and say, ‘Bigotry and bias against the world’s only Jewish country is not welcome in any type of organization I’m heading.’ He has yet to do that. \"And because he hasn’t, we’re calling on President Trump’s task force to step in and demand that this kind of, again, bias and isolation and vilification of Israel is just not welcome in the United States.

    "article_text": "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with. Cybercriminals aren't just goingafter big targets anymore. They're going after everyone, and they're doing it with infostealer malware. These small, sneaky programs are quietly stealing passwords, browser data and login tokens from everyday devices. A new report shows just how out of control the problem has become, with infostealer activity jumping 500% in just one year, harvesting more than 1.7 billion fresh credentials. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed astaggering surge in stolen login databeing traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users’ devices. At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extractsensitive informationlike usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don’t break into a company’s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing. These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing. Fortinet’s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Reportidentified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon. A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins. Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually. Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim’s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A man working on his personal and work laptops(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe. 1. Use a password manager:Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a built-inData Breach Scannerthat lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. 2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):Even if your credentials are stolen,2FAadds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins. 3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE 4. Keep software updated:Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to dateensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system. 5. Consider a personal data removal service:These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY The 1.7 billion passwords leaked in 2024 are not a relic of past breaches. They’re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices. The tools are cheap, the scale is massive and the impact is personal. If you’ve ever saved a password in a browser, downloaded an unofficial app or clicked a link in a sketchy email, your credentials may already be in circulation.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Pope Leo XIV's greatest challenge is already changing the world",
    "article_text": "Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected as the new Pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. He made his first public appearance at the Vatican to greet the faithful and deliver his inaugural prayer. In Herman Hesse’s novel \"The Glass Bead Game,\" published in 1943, a future Europe is controlled by only two powers, the players of that mysterious game that uses math and musicology to utilize all of human historical knowledge, and theRoman CatholicChurch. Though the actual rules and playing of the glass bead game are vague in the book, to the modern reader its use of prompts to generate truth from the archive of history looks incredibly similar to artificial intelligence, arguably the greatest challenge the non-fictional Pope Leo, the Roman Catholic Church’s new pope, Pope Leo XIV, must navigate. In the course ofEuropean history, popes have had enormous influence on the development of science, sometimes in conflict, such as with Galileo and Pope Paul V, but also in vital partnership by creating all of the continent's first universities. CARDINAL ROBERT PREVOST ANNOUNCED AS FIRST AMERICAN POPE, TAKING NAME LEO XIV Indeed, today’s Catholic catechism pronounces that science and faith are complementary not in conflict, it reads in part, \"…methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God.\" Newly elected Pope Leo XIV appears at the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican on Thursday.(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) But, if the acceptance of science is settled Catholic theology, the acceptance of artificial intelligence most assuredly is not, and in fact, this God-like act of attempting to create a conscious being opens enormous moral pitfalls. The obvious ethical implications of AI have long been explored ad nauseum, from \"Blade Runner\" to \"Star Trek\": what moral obligations does a human being have to a machine? But the deeper religious question is not whether a human can sin against a machine, it is whether a machine itself is capable of sin, or even confession or salvation. From the beginning of modern computing the question of whether a machine could truly be intelligent was percolating, mid-20th century trailblazer Alan Turing created a set of tests, including whether a computer could trick a person into thinking it was human. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost (prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops) attends a mass on the third of nine days of mourning for late Pope Francis in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. We have certainly blown by that mile marker, but still the question lingers as to whether a machine can ever truly be intelligent in the same way a human being is, and for the Catholic Church, Pope Leo XIV, fighting to define intelligence is a mission of the highest order. We are already seeing the harm done by AI’s simulation of a real person as Meta’s ChatGPT flaunts itself as a virtual friend, even for children who can ask it questions on sexual themes, something the world of Big Tech seems just fine with. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The deep danger here is that in a rush to declare victory, to prove that they have created intelligence, big tech will simply dumb down what intelligence is, reduce it to a set of repeatable tests that completely ignore the possibility of the soul. This is why, unlike in regard to science writ large,artificial intelligenceas an equal of human capacity is completely at odds with Catholic teaching and can never be compatible with it. The capability of the collection of systems we refer to as artificial intelligence to help human beings is enormous, something thatPope Francisemphasized during his pontificate, but a machine can never be a child of God. Just as Hesse predicted in his novel almost a century ago, the only institution on the face of the earth that has the power to fight back against Big Tech’s redefinition of human intelligence is the Catholic Church with its billion members across the globe. Very smart people tell us that in the next 10 years, AI is going to fundamentally change the world, that nothing will be the same after, and that just happens to be more or less exactly the amount of time we would expect our new pope to serve. Arguably, the deepest question mankind has ever known is \"what are we?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Today, there are two completely incompatible answers competing. Proponents of AI say we are simply a set of electrical connections in our brain, little different from a computer, but to the Church, we are a soul, created andbeloved by God. This argument, this fight over what a human being is, may well define the future of humanity in the coming decades. It may even define if humanity has a future at all. TheCatholic Churchneeds a pope who is ready for this battle, and who will lead the faithful to reject any definition of human intelligence that lacks the spark of Divine creation.

    "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: The only solution to the crisis of radical district judges",
    "article_text": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich discusses Americans' faith in the media and judges issuing national injunctions on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' The fight over whether unelected federal district court judges should be able to unilaterally halt an elected president of the United States’ agenda has reached a critical point. For the last three months, the American people’s effort to profoundly change the Washington establishment has been blocked by radical district judges, who have wildly exceeded their authority. In the first 100 days of PresidentDonald Trump’ssecond administration, lower court judges have issued 37 nationwide injunctions against various administration actions. That is more than one every three days. This is not an issue of judges against President Trump. It is an issue of judges against the American people. NUMBER OF INJUNCTIONS HALTING TRUMP POLICIES TROUNCES PREDECESSORS BY DOUBLE In the 2024 election, the American people elected a Republican House, Senate, and President. President Trump carried all seven swing states. He received 77.3 million votes – 2.3 million more than Vice President Kamala Harris. We must protect the American people’s right to elect those who manage the federal government. There are 677 district judges on the federal bench. If any of them can issue nationwide injunctions to override the decisions of the elected president, we are in a real crisis. Remember, these judges have never been elected by the American people. They face no consequence if their rulings result in ruined lives orwasted taxpayer dollars. Not all of them are overreaching, but some certainly are. And some of the nationwide injunctions which have been passed verge on insanity. One injunction asserted that the executive cannot pause or terminate fugitive admissions into the United States and had to  accept hundreds of thousands of refugees – never mind the humanitarian or financial cost of the decision. SPEAKER JOHNSON GIVES VERDICT ON HOUSE PLAN TO IMPEACH JUDGES BLOCKING TRUMP Another injunction blocked the removal of men from women’s prisons despite the risk of physical harm to female prisoners. A third injunction blocked the executive branch from doing anything about so-called sanctuary cities. It went wildly overboard and asserted theWhite Housecannot even have conversations about sanctuary cities. These are just a few examples of the absurd judicial micro-management we are witnessing. SENATOR WARNS OF 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' JUDICIAL OVERREACH AHEAD OF SCOTUS SHOWDOWN When President Thomas Jefferson was working to build and protect our new nation, he warned that government ultimately controlled by judges would be a road to despotism. In aletter to William Jarvis on Sept. 28, 1820, Jefferson wrote: \"You seem ... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions: a very dangerous doctrine indee[d] and one which would place us under the despotism of an Oligarchy.\" As I testified at a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, the Founding Fathers all believed that the three branches of government should be co-equal. If anything, the judiciary would be the weakest of the three branches. They were clear that the two elected branches could correct the judicial branch if it tried to impose its will on the American people. Alexander Hamilton warned in the Federalist Papers that the legislative and executive branches could powerfully respond to judges – and judges would have no means of defending themselves. As president, Jefferson and theDemocratseliminated 14 of 34 federal judges in the Judiciary Act of 1802. They did not impeach anyone (a lengthy and difficult task). Jefferson simply abolished the judgeships and the judges no longer had jobs. We do not have to eliminate district courts in the Jeffersonian tradition – unless we are forced to. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Hopefully, the U.S. Supreme Court will recognize that judicial tyranny by lower courts is intolerable and unsustainable. The High Court could take decisive steps to eliminate nationwide injunctions by local judges – or make a rule that they are immediately adjudicated by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the House andSenatehave begun work to correct absurd overreach by the most radical district court judges. The introduction on March 31 of the Judicial Relief Clarification Act of 2025 by Senate Judiciary Committee ChairChuck Grassleyand 20 senators is a powerful signal that the Senate can defend itself against tyrannical judges. When this is combined with Congressman Darrell Issa’s No Rogue Rulings Act of 2025 (which passed in the House by 219-213) it’s clear the district judges are forcing a constitutional crisis. We must protect the American people’s right to elect those who manage the federal government. Lower court judges who think they can micromanage and override the elected president and Congress have a simple path: Resign and run for office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Hopefully, theSupreme Courtwill end this absurdity. If not, the Congress and the president will have to exercise their constitutional authority and eliminate nationwide injunctions by district judges. There is no alternative if we are to retain government of, by, and for the people.

    "title": "SEN RICK SCOTT: Red Square goes global as the world's worst regimes gather on May 9",
    "article_text": "Former State Department deputy special envoy Ellie Cohanim discusses the Trump administration's efforts to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine on 'Fox News @ Night.' Forty-two years ago, Ronald Reagan stood in a ballroom in Orlando, Florida, calling for countries to unite against an evil empire and encouraging them to \"not remove themselves from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.\" Much has changed in four decades - yet the threat to freedom-loving countries has only grown. We still exist in a world ofgood versus evil- freedom-loving countries like ours that support democracy, human rights, and economic freedom against countries like Russia, Communist China, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, and others who control and abuse the will and God-given rights of their citizens. On May 9th, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping will stand together inRed Square, celebrating Russia's military and commemorating its victory in World War II. Pay attention to those who attend, as no country that supports democracy, freedom, or free trade should stand with Putin and Xi. TRUMP SAYS HE HAD ‘PRODUCTIVE’ CALL WITH TURKEY'S ERDOGAN ABOUT RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR, GAZA Putin’s Russiais one of a host of evil powers plotting to exploit their citizens and the world. It's no secret Putin is actively working to restructure global power to what we saw in the Soviet era. Xi Jinping and Communist China pursue global domination through economic control that turns profit and influence into espionage and genocide. Iran seeks power by openly supporting terrorist groups like Hamas and the Houthis in the killing of innocents, attacking Israel, targeting U.S. ships, and disrupting trade. There is North Korea, who recently supplied troops for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, and the regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua, who share their view of the world. There are also countries like Hungary that feign alignment with the U.S. but act to support Putin and stay on his good side by protecting Russia from EU sanctions. All of these powers cooperate against the U.S. and our partners, and the ones in our hemisphere serve as proxies for Russia, China, Iran, and others. Then there are the freedom-loving nations of the world who stand together against Putin, Xi, and these evil regimes as we defend freedom and our way of life. There is a clear line of distinction between these groups:good vs. evil. Years ago, I warned that Communist China had started a new Cold War with the United States. I spoke of the dangers of thinking that China and our enemies would ever operate within the modern world order. I called on our allies to recognize this threat because there would come a day of reckoning. I also called for our government to demonstrate America's strength and resolve and a renewed commitment to our allies in freedom as we worked to contain the increasing reach of Communist China, Russia, Iran, and others. Under President Trump's first administration, we did so. I was never optimistic that the Biden administration had the courage or desire to combat the encroaching dangers; what resulted during his presidency proved me right. Our enemies saw theweaknessesof Joe Biden and his administration, and they took full advantage. These evil nations seized every opportunity to tear down the interests and security of the U.S. and our allies, fueling terror and evil around the world, including the invasion of a sovereign nation. President Trump inherited a mess, but he is working diligently to reverse Biden's disastrous course and reestablish the U.S. as a beacon of strength in the world, sending a clear message: the U.S. is back. We stand for liberty, democracy, and fair play, and to stand opposed to that is to stand opposed to us. President Trump is already moving to crack down on Communist China's abuses. He and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have acted to strip Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro of every resource he's using to cling to power, and they've exerted maximum pressure on Iran to stop them from getting a nuclear weapon. They've also reversed the Biden administration's dangerous appeasement and enablement of the Cuban regime, which funded evil and instability throughout our hemisphere for decades. We've seen President Trump work to bring peace to Ukraine and put pressure on Putin by maintaining and threatening increased sanctions while getting our European allies on board to ensure Putin is a global pariah if he refuses to come to the negotiation table. He has also opened the door to future military aid for Ukraine, which could and should be underwritten financially by our European allies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On my recent trip to Finland, Estonia, and Denmark, I met with our allies on the front lines defending us against Russian aggression, and I saw the benefit of President Trump pushing our NATO allies to step up and contribute more to their own defenses. These three countries are leaders in responding to President Trump's calls, meeting and surpassing NATO minimum defense standards. Even Germany has activated its military by sending troops to help protect the border in Lithuania, though it has only just met its 2% GDP goal for the first time in almost 35 years. Unfortunately, they are not alone in this. While the U.S. is willing and able to protect our allies, we cannot do so if they are not willing and able to defend themselves. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This showdown of good versus evil will not be decided solely through traditional military actions but through economic battles as well. We must enforce strategic sanctions and work to end policies that supply our enemies with the money and economic power to fund their atrocities. We must make our enemies global pariahs and cripple their economies, otherwise the United States and our allies will not be safe. The United States will always stand on the side of freedom and democracy; it is not only a noble fight, but an essential one. And we will always stand against those who wish us destroyed. I, for one, will be watching as every nation makes clear which side they're on come May 9th in Red Square. Republican Rick Scott represents Florida in the United States Senate.

    "title": "You might not like the solution to the debt crisis, but here's how to fix America's spending problem",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers working to reduce government spending despite criticism from Democrats on ‘Special Report.’ Let’s not sugarcoat this: thenational debtis out of control. We all know it, but nobody wants to budget on how to really fix it. We’re staring down the barrel of almost $37 trillion dollars in debt and an annual deficit projected to be north of $2 trillion dollars a year. Interest payments alone are projected to exceed $1 trillion a year—more than we spend on the defense budget right now. And that means one thing: the American house is on fire, and we can’t keep pretending it's just a warm fireplace. As a proudfiscally responsiblemoney guy for the past thirty years, I believe in free markets, personal responsibility, and limited government. But I also believe in arithmetic—and the math is telling us something must give. If we want to preserve American capitalism, keep Social Security and Medicare solvent, and avoid a full-blown fiscal crisis, then yes—we’re going to need morerevenue. The question is, where do we get it from every year? REPUBLICANS SQUABBLE OVER TRUMP SPENDING PLAN AS FISCAL YEAR 2026 LOOMS: ‘STAY UNTIL WE PASS IT’ Do I Like Tax Increases? No. Do We Need One? Probably. Let’s get something straight. I don’t want to raise taxes. I’d rather see waste cut like we are beginning to do with DOGE, agencies streamlined, and spending brought under control. But after decades of kicking the can down the road, we've run out of fresh pavement unless we increase the debt ceiling even more. And that could be even more problematic than we realize if our debt gets downgraded around the world. If we slashed every discretionary program tomorrow—even if we defunded the IRS, the Department of Education, and every so-called \"pork project\" in Washington—we’d still be in the red. That’s because the real cost drivers are entitlements and interest. And those aren't optional—they're locked in. So, unless we’re ready to tell our seniors that Social Security checks are getting cut by 20% in ten years (which is what's coming if nothing changes), we’ve got to increase revenue. Not across the board since half of Americans don’t even payfederal taxes. Not on the middle class because they are maxed out. But at the top. It’s painful to say it out loud, but it must happen. That 37% Tax Rate? It Needs to Go Back to 39.6% As it stands, the top individual tax rate is now 37%, on annual incomes above $611,000 for single filers and $767,000 for married couples. If Congress fails to act, that rate is set to revert to what it was before the 2017 tax law, 39.6%, on top filers. It was 39.6% under both Clinton and Obama—and let’s be honest, the economy didn’t collapse back then. In fact, we had booming markets, solid growth, and budget surpluses. Bumping that rate back up by 2.6% isn’t socialism—it’s reality. What would you rather have, a smalltax hikeon ordinary income or your back against the wall and capital gain tax rates back to 39.6% which would be devastating on so many levels. The 39.6% is a return to something that worked without destroying the dreams of future entrepreneurs that want to build wealth through building a business. And it’s a way to ask those who have benefitted most from the American system to do what’s necessary to preserve it. Tariffs aren’t going to solve the annual deficit and certainly they aren’t going to make taxes go away. Let me put it this way: if you’re a conservative millionaire who believes in law, order, national defense, capitalism, and protecting the dollar, what exactly do you think happens when the U.S. defaults on its obligations or interest rates skyrocket? This isn’t about punishment—it’s about preservation. Time to Fix the Social Security Tax Too Here’s another one most people don’t like to talk about: the cap on Social Security taxes. Right now, Social Security tax stops at $176,100 of income. That means a guy making $60,000 pays the full tax on every dime, while a family making $6 million pays on less than 3% of their income. That’s not free market. That’s a broken system. Medicare taxes apply to all income—what about raising Social Security wage base from $176,000 to even $1,000,000 of income? If we simply applied the Social Security tax to a higher level of wages (not investments, just wages), it would help keep the program solvent for generations. That’s good for America and good for helping those at the bottom and the top do even better. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Conservatives Fix Problems—We Don’t Ignore Them The Republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility, right? They are the ones who say, \"You can’t spend what you don’t have.\" So how can we ignore the massive the debt crisis staring us in the face? If Republicans hide from the truth today, Democrats will eventually win back control and push through much more aggressive tax hikes with all the political ammo to do it. But if Republicans lead with common sense reforms now—like restoring the 39.6% rate and raising the Social Security wage cap—they will protect the middle class, stabilize our fiscal future, and keep the economy humming. Final Thought: This Is How You Save Capitalism If you really love this country—and I know you do—then you must ask: what’s the plan? Because \"cut taxes and grow our way out\" hasn’t worked in 40 years. We’ve tried it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Preserving the American Dream means making some smart, targeted moves now—so we don’t lose everything later. Slightly higher taxes on the ultra-rich, and fairer contributions to Social Security, may be the medicine we don’t like (and trust me I’ll be paying and not liking it)—but we’ve got to take it before the patient dies. And this is not a liberal idea. That’s common sense. Ted Jenkin is president ofExit Stage Left Advisorsand partner atExit Wealth.",

    "article_text": "Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall discusses the process of the papal conclave vote on ‘The Story.’ Who expected Pope Francis's pontificate to last until 2025 when it began in 2013? Born in 1936, ordained a priest in 1969, installed as archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and elevated to the College of Cardinals three years later, when the Conclave was summoned by the unexpected resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was on few of any lists of \"papabile\" when the proceeding commenced. His election was an even bigger surprisefor a Catholic Churchunused to papal resignations much less a pope from far away South America. Pope Francis was an older man with one lung and neither he nor his fellow cardinals thought in 2013 of the first ever Jesuit pope as naming two-thirds of the cardinals voting in the next Conclave. Such is the working of the Holy Spirit, Catholics very much believe, that surprises should never really surprise. So who knows what to expect? Or when? Expectations are foolish. But \"hopes\" are not heresy, and I am hoping for a younger man from among the cardinals. My very simple reason is that the older the cardinal the less likely he is to be well versed in the speed of events and communication in this decade. The successor to Saint Peter will be arriving in his office aware of the unrelenting, indeed ferocious, speed of the world’s crises. But only a handful of the older men will genuinely understand and be prepared for how very different 2025 is from 2013. How the world has accelerated in those years. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION America has seen its last Boomer elected president, I suspect, and much as we like to hang around and offer our opinions, there are jobs which cry out for either energy at a level that is extraordinary in an older man —President Trump has that— or for a generational shift in leadership. It is hard to imagine the cardinals electing anyone with the zeal for the job that would-be presidents must possess when they declare their candidacies, so the temptation must be strong among the 133 voting cardinals present for the conclave to compromise on a new pontiff who won’t be in the job for more than a decade. They will take their missions very seriously, but there is a very great diversity of \"mission ambitions\" among the 133. There is no easy correlation to American politics or politics of any sort. The Roman Catholic Church is 2,000 years old, after all, and it is presumptuous for evenscholars of church historyto make predictions about what lays ahead of the new pontiff. THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS MEET TO ELECT THE NEXT POPE. WHO WILL IT BE? It is very easy to guess, however, that whatever lies ahead will come at the new pope all at once and perhaps far faster than any of his predecessors save Pius XII on whom fell the awful obligations and choices of a pope surrounded by a world run in large part by Hitler and Mussolini for the critical first six years of his reign. Pius XII’s record in those years of total war is often debated and will never be resolved, but no one could have foreseen when he was elevated in March of 1939that his Vaticanwould be ringed by monsters of the sort before then unimaginable. Rome Conclave for the election of a new Pope St. Peter's Basilica Holy Mass Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice 07 May 2025(Stefano Carofei /IPA/Sipa/IMAGN) They are very imaginable now, with genocides and massacres marking the years since the Holocaust with a regularity that silences even the most optimistic of forecasters of the future. A pope must prepare to confront evil in its many disguises and to stand with victims of evil even as he avoids making bad situations worse.

Much of Raffaelli’s complaint concerns how Brookfield covered pandemic-related real estate losses and alleges the company fired him after he filed a whistleblower complaint at the SEC. His suit makes allegations like fraud and bribery, while Brookfield vehemently denies any wrongdoing, it told The Times. In February, Brookfield quietly shuttered the venture capital unit run by Raffaelli and rolled some assets into another unit,Bloomberg reported at the time. One of Raffaelli’s complaints in the suit is that Brookfield didn’t buy as much stock in Musk-owned companies as he had secured the ability to buy. Raffaelli had deals to buy into Musk companies like SpaceX, xAI, and the Boring Company, the suit alleges. And his Brookfield fund was a big backer of Musk’s takeover of Twitter, Bloomberg reported. The lawsuit is a very public battle for Raffaelli, who previously worked as a partner at the VC firm then known as Draper Fisher Jurvetson. (Today, it’s a collection of funds.) While at DFJ,  Brookfield helped that firm make investments into Musk companies like SolarCity (acquired by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla.

Smith said Microsoft hasn’t put DeepSeek in its app store over those concerns, either. Althoughlots of organizations and even countries have imposed restrictions on DeepSeek, this is the first time Microsoft has gone public about such a ban. Smith said the restriction stems from the risk that data will be stored in China and that DeepSeek’s answers could be influenced by “Chinese propaganda.” DeepSeek’s privacy policystatesit stores user data on Chinese servers. Such data is subject to Chinese law, whichmandatescooperation with the country’s intelligence agencies. DeepSeek alsoheavily censorstopics considered sensitive by the Chinese government. Despite Smith’s critical comments about DeepSeek, Microsoftoffered up DeepSeek’sR1 model on its Azure cloud service shortly after it went viral earlier this year. But that’s a bit different from offering DeepSeek’s chatbot app itself. Since DeepSeek is open source, anybody can download the model, store it on their own servers, and offer it to their clients without sending the data back to China. That, however, doesn’t remove other risks like the model spreading propaganda or generating insecure code. During the Senate hearing, Smith said that Microsoft had managed to go inside DeepSeek’s AI model and “change” it to remove “harmful side effects.” Microsoft did not elaborate on exactly what it did to DeepSeek’s model, referring TechCrunch to Smith’s remarks. In its initial launch of DeepSeek on Azure, Microsoftwrotethat DeepSeek underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before it was put on Azure. While we can’t help pointing out that DeepSeek’s app is also a direct competitor to Microsoft’s own Copilot internet search chat app, Microsoft doesn’t ban all such chat competitors from its Windows app store.

At a National Assembly hearing in Seoul on Thursday, SKT chief executive Young-sang Ryu said about 250,000 users have switched to a different telecom provider following the data breach. He said he expects this number to reach 2.5 million, more than tenfold the current amount, if the company waives cancellation fees. The company could lose up to $5 billion (around ₩7 trillion) over the next three years if it decides not to charge cancellation fees for users who want to cancel their contract early, Ryu said at the hearing. “SK Telecom considers this incident the most severe security breach in the company’s history and is putting forth our utmost effort to minimize any damage to our customers,” a spokesperson at SKT told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “The number of customers affected and the entity responsible for the hacking is under investigation,” the spokesperson added. A joint investigation involving both public and private entities is currently underway to identify the specific cause of the incident. The Personal Information Protection Committee (PIPC)of South Koreaannouncedon Thursdaythat 25 different types of personal information, including mobile phone numbers and unique identifiers (IMSI numbers), as well as USIM authentication keys and other USIM data, had been exfiltrated from its central database, known as its home subscriber server. The compromised data can put customers at greater risk ofSIM swapping attacksand government surveillance. Afterits official announcement of the incident on April 22, SKT has been offering SIM card protection and free SIM card replacements to prevent further damage to its customers. “We detected possible information leakage regarding SIM on April 19,” the spokesperson at SKT told TechCrunch. “Following the identification of the breach, we immediately isolated the affected device while thoroughly investigating the entire system.” “To further safeguard our customers, we are currently developing a system that can protect users’ information through the SIM protection service while allowing them to use roaming services seamlessly outside of Korea by May 14,” the spokesperson said. To date, SKT has not received any reports of secondary damage and no verified instances of customer information being distributed or misused on the dark web or other platforms, the company told TechCrunch. SKT detected abnormal activitieson April 18 at 11:20 p.m.local time. SKT found unusual logs and signs of files having been deleted on equipment that the company uses for monitoring and managing billing information for its customers, including data usage and call durations. The company identified a data breach on April 19 in its home subscriber server in Seoul, which typically houses subscriber information, including authentication, authorization, location, and mobility details. SKT reported the cyberattack incident toKorea’s cybersecurity agency. SKTconfirmed on its websitethat it detected suspicious activity, indicating a “potential” data breach involving some information related to users’ USIMs data. SKT began replacing mobile SIM cards of 23 million users, but the company hasfaced shortages in obtaining sufficient USIM cardsto fulfill its promise to provide free SIM card replacements. South Korean policebegan investigatingSKT’s suspected cyberattack on April 18. According to local media reports, many South Korean companies, including SKT, use Ivanti VPN equipment, and that the recent data breach may be connected to China-backed hackers. Pera local media report, SKT said it received a cybersecurity notice fromKISAinstructing the company to turn off and replace the Ivanti VPN. TeamT5, a cybersecurity company based in Taiwan,alerted the public to the worldwide threats posedby agovernment-backed grouplinked to China, which allegedly took advantage of vulnerabilities in Ivanti’s Connect Secure VPN systems to gain access to multiple organizations globally. Some 20 industries have been affected, including automotive, chemical, financial institutions, law firms, media, research institutes, and telecommunications, across 12 countries, including Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. A team of public and private investigatorsdiscovered an additional eight types of malwarein SKT’s hacking case. The team is currently investigating whether the new malware was installed on the same home subscriber server as the original four strains or if they are located on separate server equipment. Tae-won Chey, the chairman of SK Group, which operates SKT,publicly apologized for the first timefor the data breach, some three weeks after the breach occurred. As of May 7, all eligible users have been signed up for the SIM protection service, except those living abroad using roaming services and temporarily suspended, the spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that its fraud detection system has already been set up for all customers to prevent unauthorized login attempts using cloned SIM cards. SKT is currently assessing how to handle the cancellation fees for users affected by the data breach incident. About 250,000 users have switched to another telecom provider following the breach, according to the company’s chief executive at a National Assembly hearing. South Korean authorities, meanwhile,announcedthat 25 types of personal information were leaked from the company’s databases during the cyberattack.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Autonomous vehicle technology company Aurora Innovation plans to expand on the success of its firstdriverless commercial launchand add night driving to its operations. Aurora said Thursday that in the second half of 2025, it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind. The company, which provided the update in its first-quarter shareholder letter, also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix. “We’d like to have a high return on asset for every truck that we have, and so we’ll try to drive efficiency to get as many miles on as many trucks as fast as possible,” Aurora CFO Dave Maday said Thursday during the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “We should be able to double our drive time as soon as we unlock night. And that’s our next key milestone.” Aurora already runs freight with self-driving trucks in those conditions, but with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The company said it has completed more than 4,000 miles in a single self-driving truck without a driver running freight for its launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight. In the week since Aurora’s commercial launch, the company has already expanded to two driverless trucks operating on a daily basis and says it expects to operate “tens of trucks” by the end of 2025. The milestone and future plans come alongside another major shift at the company: theresignation of co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson. Aurora shared new details Thursday in its first-quarter shareholder letter about plans to grow its autonomous freight service, signaling it will offer more specific timelines for key milestones as it expands. Aurora realized $871,000 in pilot revenue from its drivered commercial freight runs, which was up 22% on a quarterly basis and 54% compared to the same time last year, per Maday. “At commercial launch, we will begin recognizing revenue,” he said Thursday during Aurora’s first-quarter earnings call. “This will include driverless revenue, as well as continued pilot revenue … With our deliberate approach to launch, we expect our 2025 revenue to be modest, in the mid-single-digit millions. For modeling purposes, we expect revenue to build sequentially throughout the year.” The company reported $211 million in operating expenses, including $153 million for R&D. It used $142 million in operating cash and $8 million in capex in the first quarter, ending with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Aurora expects to spend $175 million to $185 million per quarter for the rest of this year. In the short-term, Aurora plans to own, operate, maintain, and insure its own trucks — madeavailable on the Uber Freight network— for customers. The company is working with partners Paccar and Volvo Trucks to build self-driving trucks at scale. Starting in 2027 or earlier, Aurora expects customers to buy those trucks directly from manufacturers so it can shift to a driver-as-a-service model and achieve “high gross margins,” per Maday.

Anderson held the chief product officer position at Aurora. The resignation wasposted in a regulatory filingalong with the company’s first-quarter earnings report. His resignation will go into effect June 1. He will leave the board August 31. The company said in the filing that his resignation from the board “did not result from any disagreement with the Company concerning any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices. The Company and the entire Board are deeply grateful for Mr. Anderson’s service and his immense contributions to the Company over the years in his role as founder, Chief Product Officer and a member of the Board.” Anderson is headed to an external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company, according to information shared during the company’s earnings call. Anderson could not be reached for comment. He did make comments, however, during the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said during Thursday’s call. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time. Aurora has reached a critical inflection point; product Strategy is firmly established. The technology is on the road, the team is in place to scale it, and the momentum we’ve created in the industry is palpable.” Anderson was director of Tesla’s Autopilot program when he left to co-found Aurora in 2017 alongside CEO Chris Urmson, the former head of the Google self-driving project, and Drew Bagnell, who was leading Uber’s autonomy and perception team. The trio, considered pioneers of the autonomous vehicle industry, gave Aurora immediate buzz, helping it attract high-profile investors like Sequoia Capital, Amazon, and T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as a slew of partnerships.Aurora gained more cachet in December 2020 when it reached an agreement with Uber tobuy the ride-hailing firm’s self-driving unitin a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion. Under the terms of that acquisition, Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber received a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Within four years the company went from buzzy startup topublicly traded companyvia a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y. The SPAC was launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and managing partner Michael Thompson. Aurora, a deep tech company still in development and years from steady revenue, has faced headwinds since it went public in 2021. The company focused its efforts on self-driving trucks, putting other projects like robotaxis to the side. Late last month, Aurora announced it successfully launched a self-driving truck service in Texas, just squeaking in under its own deadline.

    "title": "Appfigures: Apple made over $10B from US App Store commissions last year",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Over $10 billion — that’s how much revenue Apple’s U.S. App Store raked in last year, according to a new analysis by app intelligence providerAppfigures. The firm’s estimates indicate that U.S. App Store revenue from commissions more than doubled between 2020 and 2024. In 2020, Apple’s share of App Store commissions was approximately $4.76 billion, growing to over $10.1 billion by 2024. Based on Appfigures’ data, U.S. App Store developers generated $33.68 billion in gross revenue from their apps and games using Apple’s payments system in 2024, and took home $23.57 billion after Apple’s cut. Though Apple doesn’t typically break out its App Store revenue during earnings,it did publish a report in May 2023where it said the App Store globally generated $104 billion in estimated billings for digital goods and services in 2022. However, Appfigures’ analysis found the App Store made $61.5 billion globally in 2022, which grew to $91.3 billion in 2024. From this, Apple made more than $27.39 billion in commissions globally last year, Appfigures also said. That leads to a discrepancy between Appfigures’ analysis and Apple’s own. This can be explained by an important caveat found in Apple’s report. Under Apple’s chart, it states that its “billings and sales” figures are“not the same as App Store billings.”That’s important here. When Apple wrote its report, the company was trying to show how big the App Store is and how key it is to the overall economy, so it merged App Store revenue with revenue generated outside the App Store to generate its total for the “Billings and Sales” category. In the report, Apple calculated the portion of an app’s total revenue that is facilitated by the App Store, even if the purchase was made elsewhere. For instance, if a user buys a subscription to Hulu on the web, but then spends 60% of their time streaming Hulu on Apple devices, Apple credits itself with facilitating 60% of that user’s spend. (To determine usage, the report relied on third-party sources, like market research firms, to estimate how much usage occurred on smartphones versus tablets, desktops, or TVs.) Apple also allows enterprises to distribute apps with in-app purchases, but these aren’t visible in the App Store. Examining the numbers around U.S. Apple App Store revenue is more relevant than ever in the wake of the recent court ruling that now prevents Apple from charging a 27% commission on transactions that take place outside the App Store. Apple initially attempted to comply with the court’s injunction resulting fromits antitrust battle with Fortnite maker Epic Gamesby making changes that wouldn’t harm App Store profits. To do so,Apple last year gave developersa way to apply for an exception to its App Store rules so they could add web links inside their apps that directed customers to external purchases. However, Apple continued to charge a 27% commission on those purchases and dictated how the website links should appear. (This even included the use of “scare screens” to warn consumers of the dangers of making purchases outside the App Store.) Last week, a judgeruled that Applewas in “willful violation” of the 2021 injunction by continuing to collect fees on purchases made outside apps and by creating new anticompetitive barriers. This decision forced Apple toupdate its U.S. App Store rules, which now allow developers to link out to other ways for consumers to make purchases, without obstacles or commissions. Since then, several apps have taken advantage of the ability to introduce web payments, includingSpotify,Amazon Kindle, andPatreon. One small game emulator calledDelta is now supporting itself via Patreonmemberships, too. Apple is appealing the decision,arguing in its most recent filingthat the ruling causes Apple “grave irreparable harm.” “These restrictions, which will cost Apple substantial sums annually, are based on conduct that has never been adjudicated to be (and is not) unlawful,” Apple’sfiling stated. “Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law injunction that is itself invalid.” This argument won’t likely go over well with developers, as many believe Apple should have lowered commissions for everyone years ago, not just forsmall business developers. Appfigures’ analysis also broke down U.S. App Store revenue by apps and games, which generated Apple approximately $6.28 billion and $3.83 billion, respectively, in 2024. Together, these figures highlight how critical App Store revenue remains to Apple’s bottom line, and why it’s fighting so hard to retain control.

On Thursday, OpenAI announced what it’s calling the first “connector” forChatGPT deep research, the company’s tool that searches across the web and other sources to compile thorough research reports on a topic. Now, ChatGPT deep research can link to GitHub (in beta), allowing developers to ask questions about a codebase and engineering documents. The connector will be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users over the next few days, with Enterprise and Edu support coming soon, according to an OpenAI spokesperson. The GitHub connector for ChatGPT deep research arrives as AI companies look to make their AI-powered chatbots more useful by building ways to link them to outside platforms and services. Anthropic, for example, recently debutedIntegrations, which gives apps a pipeline into its AI chatbot Claude. OpenAIyears agooffered a plug-in capability for ChatGPT, but deprecated it in favor of custom chatbots calledGPTs. “I often hear that users find ChatGPT’s deep research agent so valuable that they want it to connect to their internal sources, in addition to the web,” OpenAI Head of Business Products Nate Gonzalez wrote in ablog poston LinkedIn. “[That’s why] today we’re introducing our first connector.” In addition to answering questions about codebases, the new ChatGPT deep research GitHub connector lets ChatGPT users break down product specs into technical tasks and dependencies, summarize code structure and patterns, and understand how to implement new APIs using real code examples. There’s a risk that ChatGPT deep research hallucinates, of course — no AI model in existence doesn’tconfidently make things up sometimes. But OpenAI is pitching the new capability as a potential time saver, not a replacement for experts. An OpenAI spokesperson said ChatGPT will respect an organization’s settings so users only see GitHub content they’re already allowed to view and codebases that’ve been explicitly shared with ChatGPT. OpenAI has beeninvestingin itstoolingfor assistive coding, recently unveiling an open source coding tool for terminals called Codex CLI and upgrading the ChatGPT desktop app to read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps. The company sees programming as a top use case for its models.Case in point, OpenAI has reportedly reached an agreement to buy AI-powered coding assistant Windsurf for $3 billion. In other OpenAI news on Thursday, the company launched fine-tuning options for developers looking to customize its newer models for particular applications. Devs can now fine-tune OpenAI’s o4-mini “reasoning” model via a technique OpenAI calls reinforcement fine-tuning, which uses task-specific grading to improve the model’s performance. Fine-tuning has also rolled out for the company’s GPT-4.1 nano model. Only verified organizations can fine-tune o4-mini, according to OpenAI. GPT-4.1 nano fine-tuning, meanwhile, is available for all paying developers. OpenAIbegan gatingcertain models and developer features behind verification, which requires organizations to submit an ID and other identity documents, in April. The company claims that it’s necessary to prevent abuse.

Earlier this week, Instacart launcheda new drinks and snack delivery app for parties called Fizzand announced that Partiful had integrated Fizz directly into its platform. Founded in 2020, Fizz is a Gen Z-focused social networking app available on more than 400 college campuses. The suit, filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks a jury trial, injunctive relief, damages, and a court order barring Instacart and Partiful from using the “FIZZ” name in connection with social or event planning services. Instacart and Partiful did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. In the lawsuit, Fizz states that it has been using the “FIZZ” trademark since January 2022 and filed for trademark registration in December 2021. The startup is accusing Instacart and Partiful of common law trademark infringement, federal trademark infringement, cybersquatting, and violating California’s unfair competition laws. “This new Fizz App by Instacart and Partiful is a blatant attempt to misappropriate the goodwill that Plaintiff has painstakingly developed through its continuous use of the FIZZ Marks among the Gen-Z demographic,” the lawsuit reads. “Together, Instacart and Partiful are competing head-on with Plaintiff in its core market of event planning for the Gen-Z demographic. Instacart and Partiful could have chosen any name for their new venture, but rather than compete on an even playing field, they are using FIZZ.” Fizz alleges that Instacart and Partiful knowingly launched the new app with the identical name for the same Gen Z demographic, creating a likelihood of confusion among customers who may believe that the new ordering service is affiliated with or endorsed by Fizz. The startup also alleges that Instacart and Partiful are exploiting its brand recognition as a known social platform for Gen Z. “Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that Defendant Instacart had a bad faith intent to profit from the FIZZ Marks when it registered the domain name <FIZZ.COM>,” the lawsuit states. “Specifically, Defendant Instacart knew or should have known of the FIZZ Marks and incorporated Plaintiff’s trademark and trade name in its domain name. In doing so, Defendant Instacart intended to divert consumers from the Fizz Platform’s online location <FIZZ.SOCIAL> to the Fizz App online location for Defendant’s own commercial gain.” Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that Partiful competes with Fizz directly in the events planning space, and that the company is now using Fizz’s name to confuse the Gen Z demographic after failing “to win the Gen Z market through fair competition.” The lawsuit announced today isn’t Fizz’s first brush with legal action, as the startupsued rival Sidechat in 2023over unfair competition practices.

Meta’s FAIR, which has been around since 2013, has faced challenges in recent years, according to a report fromFortune. FAIR led research on the company’s early AI models, including Llama 1 and Llama 2. However, researchers have reportedly departed the unit en masse for other startups, companies, and even Meta’s newer GenAI group, which led the development of Llama 4. Meta’s previous VP of AI Research, Joelle Pineau, announced in Aprilshe’d be leaving the companyfor a new opportunity.

    "title": "Google launches ‘implicit caching’ to make accessing its latest AI models cheaper",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google is rolling out a feature in its Gemini API that the company claims will make its latest AI models cheaper for third-party developers. Google calls the feature “implicit caching” and says it can deliver 75% savings on “repetitive context” passed to models via the Gemini API. It supports Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash models. That’s likely to be welcome news to developers as the cost of using frontier modelscontinuestogrow. We just shipped implicit caching in the Gemini API, automatically enabling a 75% cost savings with the Gemini 2.5 models when your request hits a cache 🚢We also lowered the min token required to hit caches to 1K on 2.5 Flash and 2K on 2.5 Pro! Caching, a widely adopted practice in the AI industry, reuses frequently accessed or pre-computed data from models to cut down on computing requirements and cost. For example, caches can store answers to questions users often ask of a model, eliminating the need for the model to re-create answers to the same request. Google previously offered model prompt caching, but onlyexplicitprompt caching, meaning devs had to define their highest-frequency prompts. While cost savings were supposed to be guaranteed, explicit prompt caching typically involved a lot of manual work. Some developers weren’t pleased with how Google’s explicit caching implementation worked for Gemini 2.5 Pro, which they said could cause surprisingly large API bills. Complaints reached a fever pitch in the past week,prompting the Gemini team to apologizeand pledge to make changes. In contrast to explicit caching, implicit caching is automatic. Enabled by default for Gemini 2.5 models, it passes on cost savings if a Gemini API request to a model hits a cache. “[W]hen you send a request to one of the Gemini 2.5 models, if the request shares a common prefix as one of previous requests, then it’s eligible for a cache hit,” explained Google in ablog post. “We will dynamically pass cost savings back to you.” The minimum prompt token count for implicit caching is 1,024 for 2.5 Flash and 2,048 for 2.5 Pro,according to Google’s developer documentation, which is not a terribly big amount, meaning it shouldn’t take much to trigger these automatic savings. Tokens are the raw bits of data models work with, with a thousand tokens equivalent to about 750 words. Given that Google’s last claims of cost savings from caching ran afoul, there are some buyer-beware areas in this new feature. For one, Google recommends that developers keep repetitive context at the beginning of requests to increase the chances of implicit cache hits. Context that might change from request to request should be appended at the end, the company says. For another, Google didn’t offer any third-party verification that the new implicit caching system would deliver the promised automatic savings. So we’ll have to see what early adopters say.

The test, which will make Threads look more like its competitor X, is an expansion of Threads’ advertising initiatives, which began last monthwith the opening up of adsto global advertisers. The news was announced at Meta’s presentation at the IAB NewFronts, where a number of social media companies pitch themselves to advertisers. On Threads, Meta says a “small number” of advertisers will test 19:9 or 1:1 video ad creatives that will appear in between pieces of organic content in the Threads feed. The company didn’t share other details around pricing or frequency of those ads, however. The update follows Meta’s recent announcement that Threads now reachesover 350 million monthly active users. The app has also seen a 35% increase in the time spent on Threads as a result of improvements to the app’s recommendation systems, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also told investors on Meta’s earnings call in April. Meta announced the news around Threads, among other updates to its ad products, at the NewFronts. The company says it’s also testing a new short-form video solution, Reels trending ads, that will be shown next to the most trending Reels from creators. Rival TikTok this week had also introduced an expansion of its similar offering, called Pulse Suite, which will now let advertisers market themselves next to trending content by category, holiday, tentpole moments, cultural events, and evergreen, always-on content from sports, entertainment, and lifestyle publishers. Meta will also begin to test Trends in Instagram’s Creator Marketplace to help advertisers find popular trends, and it will test the Creator Marketplace API to help businesses find and connect with quality creators at scale.

PowerSchool, which provides its K-12 software to thousands of schools to support 60 million students across North America, was hacked in December 2024 using a single stolen credential, whichallowed a hacker broad accessto PowerSchool’s stores of personally identifiable student and teacher data, including Social Security numbers and health data. The company said at the time that ithad paid the hacker a ransom to allegedly delete the stolen data, but it has repeatedly refused to disclose the sum it paid. Now, Toronto’s district school board, which serves around 240,000 students each year, saidin a statementthat earlier this week it had “received a communication from a threat actor demanding a ransom using data from the previously reported incident.” Several other schools in North America received extortion notes, including across North Carolina,per local media. PowerSchool confirmed that it had paid the ransom at the time, saying the company “thought it was the best option for preventing the data from being made public.” Some cybersecurity professionals and law enforcement have long discouraged victims from paying a ransom, as there are no guarantees that the hackers will stick to their word when claiming to delete stolen data. As evidenced by pastransomwareandextortionincidents, some gangs were later found to have retained huge amounts of stolen victim data, often torevictimize affected individuals with additional extortion attempts. In a statement shared with customers this week, seen by TechCrunch, PowerSchool said it “recently became aware that a threat actor has reached out to some PowerSchool SIS customers in an attempt to extort them using data” from the December 2024 breach. Beth Keebler, a spokesperson for PowerSchool, told TechCrunch that the company does not think this is a new incident because “samples of data match the data previously stolen in December.” PowerSchool has not yet said how many individuals are affected by its data breach. Several school districts that used PowerSchool at the time of the breach told TechCrunch that “all” of their historical student and teacher data was compromised In the case of Toronto’s school district, the stolen records date back to at least 2009 and are likely to affect millions of people.

The tech giant will begin usingGemini Nano, its on-device large language model (LLM), on desktop to protect users against online scams. It’s also launching new AI-powered warnings for Chrome on Android to help users be aware of spammy notifications. According to Google, Chrome’s Enhanced Protection mode of Safe Browsing on Chrome offers the highest level of protection, providing twice the protection against phishing and other online threats compared to the browser’s Standard Protection mode. Now, Google will use Gemini Nano to provide Enhanced Protection users with an additional layer of defense against online scams. Google says this on-device approach will provide immediate insight into risky websites to protect users against scams, including those that haven’t been seen before. “Gemini Nano’s LLM is perfect for this use because of its ability to distill the varied, complex nature of websites, helping us adapt to new scam tactics more quickly,” Google said in a blog post. The company is already using this AI-powered defense to protect users from remote tech support claims. Google plans to expand this defense to Android devices and even more types of scams in the future. As for the new AI-powered warnings, Google notes that the risk from scammy sites can extend beyond the site itself through notifications if you have them enabled. Malicious websites can use notifications to try to scam you, which is why Chrome will now help you be aware of malicious, spammy, or misleading notifications on Android. Now, when Chrome’s on-device machine learning model flags a notification as possibly being a scam, you will receive a warning. You can choose to either unsubscribe or view the content that was blocked. If you think the warning was shown incorrectly, you can allow all future notifications from that site. As part of today’s announcement, Google shared that it has been using AI to stop scams in Search by detecting and blocking hundreds of millions of scammy results every day. Its AI-powered scam detection systems have helped to catch 20 times more scammy pages, Google says. For example, Google has seen an increase in bad actors impersonating airline customer service agents and scamming people looking for help. The company says it has reduced these scams by over 80%, decreasing the risk of users coming across a scammy phone number on Search.

The take-private offer comes as the Trump administrationexplores kicking Chinese companies offAmerican stock exchanges, part of a broader trade war that includes what has become a tariff quagmire between the U.S. and China. On Tuesday, Geely offered to pay $25.66 per Zeekr American Depository Receipt (ADS), or $2.566 per ordinary share, which was about 14% higher than Zeekr’s Monday afternoon closing price, in a deal that values the company at $6.5 billion. ADS holders can also opt to receive 12.3 newly issued Geely shares per ADS. Aside from skirting potential geopolitical awkwardness, Geely has a lot to gain from taking Zeekr private and not much to lose. Geely already owns 65.7% of Zeekr through its founder Li Shufu. That means Geely would only need to pay out roughly $2.2 billion to acquire the rest. For that price, Geely could help Zeekr absorb the market blows that come with being an EV startup in a competitive market and protect its investment. Zeekr has yet to report first-quarter results, but the company delivered a total of 125,250 vehicles across its two brands — Zeekr and Lynk & Co — in the first four months of 2025. Zeekr is working with autonomous vehicle company Waymo to build apurpose-built robotaxifor large-scale deployment in the U.S. Neither company has confirmed if it would affect their working relationship if Geely were to take the company private, though Waymo earlier this week shared plans to integrate its self-driving system into the Zeekr vehicle at itsnew Arizona facilitylater this year.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Elon Musk’s Starlink has received anticipated state approval in India, opening the door to enter the world’s second-biggest internet market after China — over three years after SpaceX’sprevious attemptto launch its satellite-based broadband in the country eventually failed. On Wednesday, India’s Department of Telecommunications gave its nod to Starlink to start working toward its compliance in the South Asian nation, a senior official confirmed to TechCrunch. Starlink will now have to submit documentation showing it complies with the licensing requirements. Earlier this week, New Delhi published itsrules(PDF) for Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) operators to set clear security guidelines for companies, including Starlink, Amazon’s Kuiper, and others. Some of those rules will help the Indian government censor content and intercept traffic, just as it could do with terrestrial network operators, and restrict user terminal access “from outside the geo-fenced coverage area and/or through gateway situated outside India.” Satellite companies need to comply with them to operate in the country. SpaceX will also need clearance from India’s space regulator, Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN–SPACe), to enable its satellite-based communication services. The official rollout of Starlink’s connectivity in India would take six to nine months, per people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the latest move is a welcoming gesture from the Indian government to Musk, who has been looking to launch Starlink in the country for quite some time to expand its user base. India has a population of over 1.4 billion people, but onlyaround 950 million internet subscribers, making a tantalizing market for Starlink or any other company selling internet connectivity with a different approach. The approval comes about two months after the Indian telcosAirtelandReliance Jioannounced their partnerships with SpaceX to launch Starlink’s high-speed internet service in the country. However, the rollout plan was not straightforward through those partnerships, as Starlink needed stand-alone regulatory approvals. In 2022, SpaceX was reprimanded for launching Starlink services in India without obtaining the necessary licenses. The companyhad to refund preorders of its equipmentafter the government called it out for “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” before getting the necessary licenses. However, the environment has changed for Starlink now, thanks to Musk’s close-enough relations with Trump. Starlink has also reportedly beenused as an instrument of leverage over countries preparing for trade talkswith the U.S. Last month, Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyalmet with Starlink executives, including its India spearhead Parnil Urdhwareshe, at his office in New Delhi. This was two months after a meeting between the Indian prime ministerNarendra Modi and Musk in the U.S.Musk also recentlyannounced plans to visit Indiathis year. The visit could be an opportunity for the billionaire to oversee the progress ofTesla’s India operations, as the EV carmaker is also eyeing the world’s most populous country — in addition to Starlink’s rollout. Having said that, Starlink is likely to face both local and international competition in the satellite internet space in the country, asOneWeb, which is in partnership with Airtel, already has an approval from IN-SPACe, andJio SpaceFiber, which is a joint venture between Reliance Jio and SES, has approvals from both DoT and IN-SPACe. Amazon’s Kuiper is also looking to get the approvals tostart its servicewhen ready. The Indian government has also yet to share details on the spectrum it will allocate to satellite internet companies. In late 2023, the government enabled spectrum allocation for satellite services through a specific fee byintroducing a new telecom bill. However, the exact requirements and fee it will charge are yet to be announced. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.

Since then, the startup has experienced explosive growth, reached a valuation exceeding a billion dollars, and expanded its employee count from low double digits to over 150. Despite the team’s average short tenure at the company, Amin made a rare decision: Clay is allowing employees who have at least a year of tenure to sell some of their shares at a relatively high share price to one of its existing investors, Sequoia. It’s a win for everyone. The employee tender offer values the company at $1.5 billion, up from the $1.25 billion it secured in itsSeries B fundingin January. Sequoia, an investor in Clay since its 2019 Series A, has agreed to purchase up to $20 million in employee stock. Startup employees often trade lower pay for a bet on the company’s future, Amin told TechCrunch. “Most of the startups don’t work out, but Clay is working out, and so we wanted to make sure that they have the option of liquidity.” According to Amin, both current employees and former employees are eligible to sell a specific portion of their equity, typically equivalent to about one year’s salary. Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia and Clay board member, sees Amin’s and co-founder Varun Anand’s decision to offer company-wide participation in the startup’s financial success as another sign of Clay’s uniqueness. “Clay is a very creative place,” Lin said. The startup’s technology helps salespeople and marketers find the right data and automate their go-to-market strategy with AI. Clay’s tools are used by thousands of customers, who range from large companies like OpenAI, HubSpot, and Canva, to over 100 small consulting agencies that help other businesses use Clay for their go-to-market efforts. The company hasn’t taken its loyal community of customers for granted. In February, Clay gave the option to its direct users to participate in its growth by allowing its community members around the world toinvest in the startupat the same valuation offered to its Series B investors. Clay raised about $1 million in a community round so its customers could directly share in its growth, Amin said. Amin views the tender offer and the community round as a demonstration for Clay’s employees and direct customers that building the company is a collective effort: a way, as he put it, to ensure “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.” While the tender will help current and former employees cash out some of their shares, allowing them a degree of financial freedom, Amin and Anand don’t plan to sell any of their shares in the offering. For Sequoia, the tender is an opportunity to increase its stake in Clay, reflecting the firm’s confidence in the company’s potential. However, Lin believes that many Clay employees won’t be too eager to sell a lot of their stock now because they expect their shares to be worth much more in the future. “There is probably going to be less than $20 million in demand, which is sad for Sequoia because we’d like to buy more.” And if employees don’t sell some of their shares now, there will likely be another opportunity in the future. Amin said Clay is growing so quickly that he would like to launch tender offers annually. Amin hopes the company’s tender will set a trend, inspiring other startups to offer employee liquidity as well.

Microsoft co-founder turned billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates said today that his foundation will havejust 20 yearsto exhaust its coffers and wind down operations. He has pledged to donate 99% of his fortune, which today is worth an estimated $107 billion, to the foundation. Over the next 20 years of donations, he expects the foundation to spend more than $200 billion. “This decision comes at a moment of reflection for me,” Gates wrote on his website, Gates Notes. “In addition to celebrating the foundation’s 25th anniversary, this year also marks several other milestones: It would have been the year my dad, who helped me start the foundation, turned 100; Microsoft is turning 50; and I turn 70 in October.” The total of Gates’ donation is expected to be the second-largest philanthropic gift in U.S. history, adjusted for inflation. Warren Buffett, whose net wealth is estimated at $160 billion, is anticipated to be the largest. Previously, the Gates Foundation was directed to close 20 years after Gates’ death. The 69-year-old Microsoft founder appears to be in good health, so this marks a significant shift in the foundation’s timeline. The 25-year-old Gates Foundation has already spent more than $100 billion on a range of causes centered mostly around health, education, global development, and gender equality. Many of the Gates Foundation’s beneficiaries have been people in low-income countries with endemic and frequently deadly diseases like malaria. The news arrives as the Trump administration has moved toslash foreign aid. USAID, one of the agencies hit by Trump’s cuts, managed more than $35 billion of congressional appropriations annually. The Gates Foundation said it expects to spend around $9 billion per year through 2045.

    "title": "US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals",
    "article_text": "The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK. The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January. But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK. Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details. Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\". \"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\". At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance. \"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said. The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year. That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs. \"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\" Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously. The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country without tariffs, according todocuments released by the US Trade Representative. The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes. Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (£3.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products. \"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said. UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector. \"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said. Other business groups expressed more uncertainty. \"It's better than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade. \"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\" While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US. \"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\" The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say. Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail. \"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\" Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\". He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development. \"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\" The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time. But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK. It was not clear how much those issues had advanced. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes. The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports. While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement. Other issues loom. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines. The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\". But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\". In Trump's new trade pact with the UK, we got a glimpse of the types of agreements he may seek across the globe. The government's diplomatic achievement in sorting this deal before anyone else delivers reprieve to carmakers. The UK says it will maintain food standards which lock out some types of American beef and chicken. The West Midlands-based car manufacturer welcomed the news of reduced tariffs on exports to the US. Economically this US deal is relatively small, although important to very specific sectors.",

    "title": "Chris Mason: Starmer can claim limited win with America deal",
    "article_text": "It is turning out to be quite the month for trade deals of various complexions. There was the one with India earlier this week, now the pact with the US, and a new deal with the European Union is expected the week after next at a UK-EU summit in London. All sorts of arrangements, varying significantly, can huddle under the umbrella vocabulary of a trade deal and this trio of agreements is very different. Let's unpick a little of what we have learnt about this deal with America. Firstly, ministers are determined to project these deals in real world terms, surrounding themselves by workers and industry, not charts and percentages. And there was a particular reason that went beyond the symmetry of the Prime Minister returning to the same production line he visited a month ago, Jaguar Land Rover's in Solihull in the West Midlands. Yes, he had taken us there shortly after President Trump hammered the British car industry with huge tariffs and JLR had suspended exports to America. But there was also a keen awareness in government of how bleak things looked for this company, and others, if this wasn't sorted and sorted sharp-ish. Chatting to the Mayor of the West Midlands, Labour's Richard Parker, his sense of relief was palpable. The tariffs on the car industry haven't disappeared or even returned to where they were, but they have fallen significantly – and that matters hugely to the viability of the sector and so the wider economy of the region. And this is where speed matters too – the government's diplomatic achievement in sorting this deal before anyone else delivers that reprieve sooner and that matters for companies' bottom lines and budgets. But some others among the Prime Minister's political opponents accuse him of over claiming - adopting the bombast and hyperbole of President Trump in how he has decided to describe this deal. They argue too it is primarily about mitigating the recent cranking up of tariffs, rather than a deep and broad free trade agreement – and there is something in that critique. I put this to Sir Keir Starmer: that while his deal may offer better trading conditions for some than were available a few days ago, they aren't necessarily better than six months ago. He tacitly acknowledged that, arguing instead that our focus should be comparing with the very recent past. In truth, American might garnished with Trumpian brute force has hurried along these negotiations and this is far from the deal some talked about during President Trump's first term. But that does cut both ways – the UK hasn't had to dilute its Digital Services Tax, which generates the best part of a billion pounds a year from some of the big US tech giants, for instance. Neither is it sufficiently deep that questions about the NHS or food standards have become embroiled in the arrangement. Discussions, we are told, are ongoing about trying to cut the ten per cent tariff America has imposed on most products the UK sells there and which remains in place. Next, let's see what America arranges with others and let's see what President Trump says next – talk of tariffs on the film industry still loiter, for instance. As ever with deals like this, particularly where there is still quite a bit of work to be done on them, detail is key. Industries and businesses around the UK will pore over the specifics as they emerge to determine the implications for them. For the Prime Minister, walking towards political headwinds international and domestic, he can chalk this up as good news, if limited good news – but good news he will bank.

    "title": "Trauma and survivors’ guilt: First interview with two injured in Nottingham attacks",
    "article_text": "For Wayne Birkett and Sharon Miller, the morning of 13 June 2023 started like any other. They both, separately, got ready for work and caught buses into Nottingham city centre, but what happened shortly after would change their lives forever. They - along with Marcin Gawronski - were struck by a van driven by Valdo Calocane, leaving all three pedestrians seriously injured. Earlier in the day, Calocane had fatally stabbed Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and caretaker Ian Coates, 65. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sharon and Wayne have told their stories for the first time and explained how they feel a strong sense of survivor's guilt. Sharon's day started at home with her partner Martin, who she was looking forward to marrying after more than 30 happy years together. After finishing her morning cup of tea, the mother-of-one made her way to the bus stop, ready to catch her daily ride to her job as a cleaner. It was early in the morning - shortly before 05:00 BST - and her bus was delayed, leaving her worried she would be late for her shift. Sharon made her way into the city centre and got off the bus as normal, but her journey to work ended as she crossed Market Street. \"I saw the van, and the next minute I'm in the air,\" she said. \"I thought I was dying - all I could see was white.\" Sharon was rushed to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre with life-changing injuries. \"I broke my toe, five ribs, I lacerated my spleen, and I've got a big hole in the back of my leg that got badly infected,\" she said. Sharon, 46, now uses a walking stick and, given the physical demands of her job, has been unable to return to work after suffering serious orthopaedic and psychological trauma. \"I'm still in a lot of pain with my leg and my back, but I'm getting there,\" she said. Once a happy and sociable person who enjoyed trips out with friends and family, Sharon now only feels safe in the comfort of her own home. \"Martin and my family, and my grandkids make me happy, but I don't like going out,\" Sharon explained. \"I was never like that before.\" Wayne had been on his way to his job as a forklift driver in the city centre when Calocane deliberately swerved across the road and drove into the back of him. He spent more than six weeks in hospital with complex brain and physical injuries and, unlike Sharon, has no recollection of what happened. In fact, the 61-year-old struggles to recall any part of his life prior to 13 June 2023. His injuries were so severe that he has had to re-learn basic skills such as reading, cleaning his teeth, and holding his knife and fork. Even a tattoo on his arm - a tribute to his beloved Leeds United - was unfamiliar, and when he looked at it, he had to ask his family what it represented. \"My legs hurt all the time, my back hurts, I get headaches all the time and it's horrible not having any memory and not remembering people you've known and worked for,\" said Wayne, whose partner Tracey has cared for him since the attacks. One thing Sharon and Wayne have in common is the survivor's guilt they have both lived with since the attacks. \"Tracey tells me off for saying this, but I would have swapped my life for one of those poor students - without a doubt,\" Wayne said. \"It was awful hearing what happened to them [in the court case]. What happened to me was nothing compared to that.\" Sharon added: \"When I heard what had happened to Barnaby or Grace, I thought, 'I wish he'd took me instead of them'. \"They were so young and still had their lives ahead of them - you just feel so guilty. \"You should be able to go to work, and they should be able to walk around; Ian should have been able to get into his van and go to work. \"It's just so wrong.\" Calocane, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before the attacks, wassentenced to a hospital orderin January 2024 after admitting three counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and three counts of attempted murder. The BBC has taken the decision not to publish a picture of Calocane in this feature at the request of the surviving victims. Sharon said: \"It's constantly on the news all the time, and I'm constantly seeing his face on the news. \"Why keep showing his face?\" The case has prompted a number of reviews, includinga mental health homicide reviewcommissioned by NHS England. And earlier this year, Sharon and Wayne, alongside the families of Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, were invited to Downing Street to discuss plans for a judge-led public inquiry. They both plan to engage fully with the inquiry, set to bechaired by Her Honour Deborah Taylor, and hope it will provide answers that lead to meaningful changes to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Greg Almond, partner and solicitor at Rothera Bray, representing both Sharon and Wayne, said it was \"crucial for the survivors to be central to the inquiry\". \"They want to put their story across and make sure they're not forgotten survivors,\" he added.

    "title": "NHS plans 'unthinkable' cuts to balance books",
    "article_text": "The NHS in England is planning \"previously unthinkable\" cuts to try to balance the books, health bosses say. Services including diabetes care for young people, rehab centres and talking therapies are in the firing line, according to NHS Providers, which represents health managers. Staff, including doctors and nurses, also face the axe - and some NHS trusts are stopping overtime for doctors, putting the drive to cut the hospital waiting lists at risk. NHS Providers said some of the savings were \"eye-watering\", but the Department of Health and Social Care said NHS services should focus on cutting bureaucracy and driving up productivity. The figures come after initial accounts for 2025-26 suggested frontline NHS organisations were going to go nearly £7bn over budget, an overspend nearly 5% above what they have been given by government, despite ministers increasing funding by £22bn over two years. One chief executive of a large hospital trust said it was looking to shed 1,500 jobs, some 5% of its workforce, including doctors and nurses. Meanwhile, a boss of a mental health trust told the BBC they had had to stop accepting referrals for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), while waits for psychological therapies exceeded a year. They said morale had \"never been lower\" among staff. Other services at risk include stop smoking services and palliative care. The closure of some maternity units is also being considered, although part of that is down to the falling birth rate which has seen a number of services being under-used. NHS Providers received evidence from 114 trusts, more than half of the total in England. Nearly all said they were cutting or planning to cut jobs which in many cases would affect clinical staff such as doctors and nurses too. A majority also reported they were looking at closing services or at least scaling them back. NHS Providers interim chief executive Saffron Cordery said NHS managers were having to think the \"previously unthinkable\". And she said while they would do their best to protect patient care, she added: \"Let's be clear. Cuts have consequences.\" She said pay rises for resident doctors - previously known as junior doctors - and inflation had eaten into the extra money the health service had been given. But the Department of Health and Social Care said the extra funding being provided should be enough. A spokeswoman said: \"We have underlined the need for trusts to cut bureaucracy to invest even further in the front line so we can support hard-working staff and deliver a better service for patients and taxpayers' money.\" NHS says no decision has been made on the possible relocation of services from Torbay to Exeter. Bosses say the hospital's current performance was not what it wanted for patients. Workers are on site shoring up crumbling ceilings and walls as part of a £34m repair project. Staff have been assaulted and patients have been injured on the wards, CQC inspectors say. Claims of \"chaos\" and financial hardship are heard in a meeting not intended for public viewing.",

    "title": "UK must 'do everything' to rebuild trade with EU, says Bank boss",
    "article_text": "The Governor of the Bank of England has said the UK now needs to \"rebuild\" Britain's trade relationship with the European Union and do \"everything we can\" to improve long term trade, after yesterday's US deal. Andrew Bailey told the BBC that as a public official he did not take a view on Brexit, but that reversing the post Brexit hit to UK-EU trade would be \"beneficial\". The Government is currently in talks with the EU on its plan to reset its trade and security relationship ahead of a summit later this month. The US deal agreed on Thursday left space for the UK to pursue a veterinary agreement with the EU, including alignment on standards in order to lower post Brexit red tape on food, farm and fish exports. As part of a new agreement between the US and UK, the US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free. But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK. Pushed on what impact a closer relationship between the UK and the EU would have on the economy and inflation, Mr Bailey said: \"It would be beneficial. Having a more open economy to trade with the European Union. Because there has been a fall-off in goods trade with the EU over recent years.\" He added that it's important because the EU is the UK's largest trading partner. \"It is important we do everything we can to ensure that whatever decisions are taken on the Brexit front do not damage the long-term trade position. So I hope that we can use this to start to rebuild that relationship,\" Mr Bailey said. The Governor also said that the UK's dealmaking across the world was setting an important example to other countries. \"It demonstrates that trade deals are important. Trade deals can be done, and the trade is important…honestly, it seems an unpromising landscape at times. But I hope that we can use these deals to rebuild the world trading system,\" he said. Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions. There is greater competition among mortgage firms but no guarantee that rates will keep falling, brokers say. The government gets most of its money from tax but also borrows when it wants to boost spending. It is the biggest lender so far to offer cheaper deals as the Bank of England is forecast to make more interest rate cuts this year. The Office for National Statistics is under review after criticism about the reliability of its data.",

    "title": "Moon dust 'rarer than gold' arrives in UK from China",
    "article_text": "The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China. The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as \"more precious than gold dust\". \"Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,\" he says. After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago. China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons Rümker. A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia. It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race. Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers samples to make new discoveries. The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe. \"It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,\" he said. He returned to the UK with the precious cargo in the safest place he could think of - his hand luggage. At his lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, we step onto sticky mats to clean our shoes and put on plastic gloves, gowns, hair nets and hoods. The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination. If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specs, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do. We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace. Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom. That is the Moon dust. It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey. And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total. \"Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,\" he adds. In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened. She's been cutting and grindings pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface. \"I'm extremely excited,\" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade. \"But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,\" she adds. After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs. In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires. Technician Sasha Verchovskyhas been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400 Celsius. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and nobel gases. This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples. James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust. He shows us a test run of what he will do. \"I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,\" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen. \"It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,\" he says. The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples. But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission. In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows. \"I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,\" says Prof Anand. \"A lot of us built our careers working on samples returned by Apollo missions, and I think this is a fantastic tradition to follow. I hope that other countries will follow suit,\" he adds. Prof Mahesh Anand is the first UK scientist chosen to receive samples from the 2020 Chang'e-5 probe. Tony Harnett says the shot, taken from six miles away, has taken years to capture perfectly. Proponents say space-based data centres will be more secure, but sceptics say big hurdles remain.

    "title": "Bill Gates plans to give away most of his fortune by 2045",
    "article_text": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he intends to give away 99% of his vast fortune over the next 20 years. Gates said he would accelerate his giving via his foundation, with plans to end its operations in 2045. \"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,\" he wrote in a blog post on Thursday. Mr Gates, 69, said his eponymous foundation has already given $100bn (£75bn) towards health and development projects, and that he expects it will spend another $200bn, depending on markets and inflation, over the next two decades. In hisblog post, Mr Gates cited a 1889 essay by tycoon Andrew Carnegie called The Gospel of Wealth, which argues that wealthy people have a duty to return their fortunes to society. Mr Gates quoted Mr Carnegie, who wrote: \"The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\" His latest pledge represents an acceleration in charitable giving. Initially, he and his ex-wife Melinda had planned for the Gates Foundation to continue working for several decades after their deaths. When asked about this shift, Mr Gates told the BBC's Newshour on Thursday that there will be other wealthy people in 20 years who can better tackle future challenges. \"It's really about the urgency,\" he said. \"We can spend a lot more if we're not trying to be perpetual, and I know that the spending will be in line with my values.\" Giving away 99% of his fortune could still leave Mr Gates a billionaire – according to Bloomberg, the Microsoft founder is the fifth-richest person in the world. In the blog post, he shared a timeline of his wealth that showed his current net worth at $108bn and a large hand-drawn arrow going down to close to zero in 2045. Mr Gates also said the foundation would draw from its endowment to give away $200bn. Along with Paul Allen, Mr Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, and the company became a dominant force in computer software and other tech industries. Mr Gates has gradually stepped back from the company this century, resigning as chief executive in 2000 and as chairman in 2014. He said he has been inspired to give away money by investor Warren Buffett and other philanthropists, however critics of his foundation say Mr Gates uses its charitable status to avoid tax and that it has undue influence over the global health system. In his blog post, he outlined three main goals for his foundation: eliminating preventable diseases which kill mothers and children; eliminating infectious diseases including malaria and measles; and eliminating poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Mr Gates criticised the US, UK and France for cutting their foreign aid budgets. \"It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people,\" he wrote. \"But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty.\" He was more pointed in the interview with Newshour, where he was asked about comments he had made accusing tech billionaire Elon Musk of killing children through cuts to US aid made by Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge. \"These cuts will kill not just children, but millions of children,\" Mr Gates replied. \"You wouldn't have expected the world's richest person to do it.\" In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gates raised the issue of cancelled grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, which Donald Trump erroneously claimed was funding condoms \"for Hamas\" in the Gaza Strip. Mr Musk later acknowledged the claim was wrong and said \"we will make mistakes\", however the cost-cutting continued. \"I'd love for [Musk] to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,\" Mr Gates told the FT. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk for comment. The Gates Foundation is a donor to BBC Media Action, the BBC's charitable arm which is separate from the Corporation's news operations.

It says a new chip it has created could end up being as important a breakthrough as the semiconductor.

The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",

    "title": "Inside the secretive world of Zara",
    "article_text": "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll. That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion. Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear. It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries. Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates. It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs. But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market. \"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me. The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna. It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries. \"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season. He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema  as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created. In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting. Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production. \"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says. Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop. In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later. Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week. Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns. As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks. More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands. \"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras. \"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\" In other words, getting the right products to the right shops. At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and – crucially – feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand. Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales. But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year? \"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein. Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu. Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex. Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price. \"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\" Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business. The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group. Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras. \"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\" The work in Abingdon Street and Fish Street will be complete by the end of the month, council says. The owners say Atria Watford will revert to the old Harlequin name as a result of public feedback. It comes after criminals hack the UK-based Co-op Group and claim to have stolen customer data. Shoppers respond to a Douglas City Centre Management plea to understand a drop in footfall. The retailer says \"sustained malicious attempts by hackers\" is affecting its IT systems.",

    "title": "Hong Kong pro-China informer: 'Why I've reported dozens of people to police'",
    "article_text": "From a woman waving a colonial-era flag in a shopping mall, to bakery staff selling cakes with protest symbols on them - dozens of Hongkongers have been reported to the police by one man for what he believes were national security violations. \"We're in every corner of society, watching, to see if there is anything suspicious which could infringe on the national security law,\" former banker Innes Tang tells the BBC World Service. \"If we find these things, we go and report it to the police.\" When the UK returned Hong Kong to China 28 years ago, internationally binding treaties guaranteed the city's rights and freedoms for 50 years. But the national security law (NSL), imposed by Beijing a year after Hong Kong's 2019 mass pro-democracy protests, has been criticised for scuttling free speech and press, and for ushering in a new culture of informing. The lawcriminalises activities considered to be calls for \"secession\" (breaking away from China), \"subversion\" (undermining the power or authority of the government), and collusion with foreign forces. An additional security law called Article 23, voted in last year, has further tightened restrictions. With new laws and arrests, there has been limited reporting onHong Kong's pro-China \"patriots\"- the people who are now running and policing the city, as well as the ordinary citizens who openly support them. But the BBC has spent weeks interviewing Innes Tang, 60, a prominent self-described patriot. He and his volunteers have taken screen grabs from social media of any activities or comments they believe could be in breach of the NSL. He also established a hotline for tip-offs from the public and encouraged his online followers to share information on the people around them. Nearly 100 individuals and organisations have been reported to the authorities by him and his followers, he says. \"Does reporting work? We wouldn't do it if it didn't,\" Mr Tang says. \"Many had cases opened by the police… with some resulting in jail terms.\" Mr Tang says he hasn't investigated alleged law breakers himself, but simply reported incidents he thinks warrant scrutiny - describing it as \"proper community-police co-operation\". Mr Tang is not the only so-called patriot to engage in this kind of surveillance. Hong Kong's authorities have set up their own national security hotline, receiving 890,000 tip-offs from November 2020 to February this year - the city's security bureau told the BBC. For those who are reported to the authorities, pressure can be relentless. Since the NSL was enacted in 2020, up until February this year, more than 300 people had been arrested for national security offences. And an estimated 300,000 or more Hongkongers have permanently left the city in recent years. Pong Yat-ming, the owner of an independent bookshop that hosts public talks, says he often receives inspections from government departments which cite \"anonymous complaints\". He received 10 visits in one 15-day period, he says. Kenneth Chan, political scientist and university lecturer, who has been involved in the city's pro-democracy movement since the 1990s, jokes he has \"become a bit radioactive these days\". Some friends, students and colleagues now keep their distance because of his outspoken views, he says. \"But I would be the last person to blame the victims. It's the system.\" In response, Hong Kong's government said it \"attaches great importance to upholding academic freedom and institutional autonomy\". But it adds that academic institutions \"have the responsibility to ensure their operations are in compliance with the law and meet the interests of the community at large\". Innes Tang says he is motivated to report people by a love of Hong Kong, and that his views on China were cultivated when he was young, when the city was still a British colony. \"The colonial policies weren't really that great,\" he says. \"The best opportunities were always given to the British and we [the locals] did not really have access.\" Like many of his generation, he nursed a longing to be united with China and taken out of colonial governance. But he says many other Hongkongers at the time were more concerned with their livelihoods than their rights. \"Democracy or freedom. These were all very abstract ideas which we didn't really understand,\" he says. An average citizen should not become too involved in politics, he says, explaining he only became politically active to restore what he calls \"balance\" to Hong Kong society following the turbulence of 2019. He is giving a voice, he says, to what he calls \"the silent majority\" of Hongkongers who do not support independence from China, nor the disruption created by the protests. Outside of the UK -watch on YouTube But other Hongkongers consider rallies and demonstrations a longstanding tradition, and one of the only ways to voice public opinion in a city that now does not have a fully democratically elected leadership. \"We are no longer a city of protests,\" says Kenneth Chan, who specialises in Eastern European politics. \"So what are we? I don't have the answer yet.\" And patriotism isn't inherently a negative thing, he says. It is \"a value, maybe even a virtue\", he argues, although it needs to allow citizens to keep \"a critical distance\" - something that is not happening in Hong Kong. Electoral reform was pushed through in 2021 - stating that only \"patriots\" who \"swore loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party\" could hold important positions in government or the Legislative Council [LegCo] - Hong Kong's parliament. As a result, the council struggles to function, believes Hong Kong-based China commentator Lew Mon-hung, a former member of the Chinese government advisory body, the CPPCC. \"The public think a lot of these patriots are 'verbal revolutionaries' or political opportunists - they don't really represent the people,\" he says. \"That's why ridiculous policies still pass with a huge majority. There is no-one to constrain or oppose, no-one to scrutinise.\" Even patriot Innes Tang says he wants to see the current system challenged. \"I don't want to see every policy passing with 90% of the vote,\" he tells the BBC. There is a danger the National Security Law will be weaponised, he says, with people saying: \"If you don't agree with me, I accuse you of infringement of the national security law.\" \"I don't agree with this type of stuff,\" says Mr Tang. Hong Kong's government said: \"The improved LegCo is now rid of extremists who wish to obstruct and even paralyse the operation of the government without any intention of entering into constructive dialogue to represent the interests of all Hong Kong people.\" For now, says Mr Tang, he has stopped reporting on people. Balance and stability, he believes, has returned to Hong Kong. The number of large-scale protests has dwindled to none at all. In academia, fear of surveillance - and how life might change for someone who infringes the laws - means self-censorship and censorship have become the \"order of the day\", says Kenneth Chan. Pro-democracy parties are no longer represented in the Legislative Council and many have disbanded - including the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, once the most powerful party. Innes Tang has now set his sights overseas. \"There aren't any particular issues in Hong Kong now, so I asked myself - shouldn't I have a look at how I can continue to serve my community and my country?\" he says. \"For a non-politician and civilian like me, this is an invaluable opportunity.\" He now works as a representative for one of several pro-Beijing non-profit groups, regularly visiting the UN in Geneva to speak at conventions giving China's perspective on Hong Kong, human rights and other issues. Mr Tang is also in the process of establishing a media company in Switzerland, and registering as a member of the press. For Kenneth Chan in Hong Kong, his future hangs in the balance. \"One third of my friends and students are now in exile, another third of my friends and students are in jail, and I'm sort of… in limbo,\" he says. \"Today I'm speaking freely with you… no-one would promise me that I would continue doing it for the rest of my life.\" In a written reply to the BBC, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said that national security is a top priority and inherent right for any country. It \"only targets an extremely small minority of people and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public\". Anna Kwok's father and brother have been accused of helping the US-based pro-democracy activist with her finances, local media report. Party leader Sir Ed Davey urges the foreign secretary to summon the Chinese ambassador for an explanation. The city's leader says Lee made \"significant contributions\" to Hong Kong's prosperity. Once Hong Kong's largest opposition party, the Democratic Party has suffered since China's crackdown. Huge crowds gathered in Hong Kong to get a glimpse of Elder Sister and Little Brother",

    "title": "The 2000s indie heroes who are back and bigger than ever",
    "article_text": "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\" Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer. Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur. \"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie. \"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\" The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom – a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump. Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts. Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day. By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkey's incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out. But the party couldn't last forever. In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves. Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"? Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal). \"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer. \"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\" \"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\" In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld. But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes. \"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer. The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album. The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences. But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Naïve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok. Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience. How do they explain this sudden revival? \"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes. \"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\" But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse. \"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff. \"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\" Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\". But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs. \"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer. A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry. The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 – making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies. Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up. The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise. \"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer. \"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\" Are there any reviews seared into their memories? \"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\" \"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\" While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music. \"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\" \"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests. \"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\" But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman. Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world. \"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\" \"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now. \"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\" With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records. Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week. \"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says. \"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\" The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves. Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year. So, have the bands got a five-year plan? \"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\" \"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown. \"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\" In Take A Sexy Picture Me, CMAT responds to online abuse after her 2024 set at Radio 1 Big Weekend. Brad Arnold says he believes one of the rock band's hits, It's Not My Time, is now \"really my song\". St Mary's School pupils perform Make Do and Mend to mark the 80 anniversary of Liberation Day. In a statement, the singer's lawyer says the abuse allegations are an attempt to \"extract money\".

    "article_text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping is in Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin. The pair have met more than 40 times and look like the best of friends, but there's a lot more to this relationship than meets the eye. The BBC's China Correspondent Laura Bicker explains three things to look out for during the state visit. Social media users captured the huge vortex that formed near the town of Puerto Peñasco. The BBC's analysis editor looks at what has been agreed in the much-anticipated agreement. Mahdawi was among multiple international students and graduates detained after their involvement in the protest movement against the war in Gaza. Organisers of the festival where a car ramming attack killed 11 people say they are \"heartbroken\". Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Holocaust survivors were part of the crowds taking part in the annual 'March of the Living', 80 years after the camp was liberated. From mourners outside the Vatican to world leaders, tributes poured for Pope Francis who died aged 88. The meeting comes after the Trump administration mistakenly deported a Maryland resident due to an 'administrative error.' EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has vowed a united response to US tariffs, warning of further countermeasures if negotiations fail. Carney described Canada as the \"most European of non-European countries\". The demonstrators were demanding the release of detained activist Mahmoud Khalil, who is facing deportation. Quentin Sommerville gains access to a cartel's operation as the US grapples with hundreds of thousands of opioid deaths. US President Donald Trump has raised a \"massive\" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US \"very badly\". BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg explores how Moscow has warmed to Trump's America. The video apparently satirising a proposal to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip was shared by the US president on social media. The BBC's analysis editor takes a look at President Trump's history with Ukraine - and how it set the stage for this week's events. America has withdrawn its military support for Ukraine, how big of a hole does it leave? Speaking to reporters after a summit of European leaders in London, Ukrainian President Zelensky reflects on the public White House showdown. The US president says his Ukrainian counterpart wants to \"keep fighting\" against Russia when a ceasefire could happen immediately. The US president accused the Ukrainian leader of being disrespectful in a tense meeting in the Oval Office.",

    "title": "Enforced skort rule in camogie 'screams sexism'",
    "article_text": "Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams has said the enforcement of skort wearing in camogie \"screams sexism\" and has urged the Camogie Association to \"be transformational\" and change the rule. County and club teams have been mounting pressure on the Camogie Association to relax the rule and give women and girls the choice between wearing skorts or shorts in camogie matches. It comes after theKilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before their Leinster Championship semi-finalcould go ahead last Saturday. On Thursday The Camogie Associationcalled a Special Congress for 22 May to vote on the issue. The current rules governing playing gear for camogie state that it must include a skirt, skort (a pair of shorts with an overlapping fabric panel which resembles a skirt) or a divided skirt. This is in contrast to women's gaelic football where shorts are allowed. Camogie is governed by the Camogie Association of Ireland, which is closely linked to the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and alongside the Ladies Gaelic Football Association which is scheduled to formally integrate into the wider GAA in 2027. Ms Adams told BBC News NI that throughout her \"20-year career, this has always been an issue for players\". She retired in 2016 and said she \"can't understand or believe that in 2025, this is still a debate and not a choice.\" \"Personally, it does scream sexism - girls shouldn't be being told what they have to wear. Skorts and shorts look similar, but it's all about comfort.\" Ms Adams described the issue as \"a no-brainer\" and \"should have been changed a long time ago\". \"I guarantee that one of the reasons why girls are dropping out of camogie is because of this issue. \"So let's look at a solution instead of turning it into a fight.\" She said during her career, there was a lot of things she \"didn't agree with in the camogie association\", which \"retired me quicker than it should have done\". A recentGaelic Players Association surveyhighlighted how 70% of players  experienced discomfort while wearing the skort, and that 83% of players wanted an option to choose to wear shorts. Speaking toRTÉ News on Wednesday, Cork camogie player Ashling Thompson said Cork will wear shorts in Saturday's Munster senior camogie final and if they are asked to change to skorts they will refuse to do so, even if it risks the game being abandoned or forfeiting the Munster title to Waterford. Aislín Ní Choinn from St John's in west Belfast told BBC News NI that skorts \"aren't fit for purpose\" and that \"it would always be the talk in the changing rooms\". \"It would always be something that would annoy everybody but we just never challenged it,\" she told BBC News NI. \"No one would ever come to training in a skort, all training is done in shorts because it's the most convenient and comfortable,\" she said. She said that player welfare should be the focus, and the skort causes a problem for player welfare. \"If you're on your period, if you're having a week like that and you're bloated, the skorts are very uncomfortable, they're very tight. \"When you're playing and you're bending down to go for the ball, you're worrying: 'Am I exposed here, are people going to be able to see?' when your skort comes up. \"You're very, very vulnerable, and if you're worrying about that, you're not focused on the game,\" she added. However, the captain of Ballycastle's senior camogie team, Elen McIntosh, said she does not \"feel that strongly about players having to wear skorts or shorts\". \"There are much bigger issues facing women's sports, like access to facilities, funding and media coverage. \"I don't think skorts should overshadow these bigger issues,\" she added. However, she added that the choice should come from the players and it should not \"imposed. Caoimh Mallon is the club secretary for Fullen Gaels, the only senior camogie team in the north of England. The Manchester club was set up in the early 2000s, and Caoimh said the same rules apply in England. \"I play both Gaelic football and camogie, and I don't understand the need for women to have to wear skorts for camogie and not football. \"It's not the issue that we have to wear them, it's the fact we have no choice,\" she said. \"We are playing Gaelic games in Britain, we are making a name for ourselves here. \"Why does it matter what we wear? It matters what game we play and how we perform,\" she added.",

The King and Queen, as well as the prime minister and other senior royals, attended a service of thanksgiving and remembrance at Westminster Abbey. The service was preceded by a two-minute national silence to remember those who served in World War Two. King Charles and the Prince of Wales laid wreaths at the Grave of the Unknown Soldier. The Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle, the dean of Westminster, led the service with a tribute to those \"who have died the death of honour\". Alexander Churchill, the 10-year-old great-great-grandson of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill lit a Candle of Peace, whilst young members of the congregation handed out flowers to veterans. Artefacts from the Second World War were processed through Westminster Abbey by members of the Armed Services. The Princess of Wales placed flowers at the Innocent Victims' Memorial, following a Service of Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. MPs and peers walked in procession from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey, re-enacting the historic walk MPs did from Parliament on VE Day in 1945. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was towards the front of the procession, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, a little way behind. Some 1,800 guests attended the service including many veterans. Among the politicians attending today's service, were several former PMs, including Lord David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Sir John Major. Members of the public observed the two-minute national silence. Earlier, Scotland's National Piper, Louise Marshall, played a lament at dawn to the fallen on Portobello Beach in Edinburgh.",

    "title": "After-work drinks in decline outside London, peers told",
    "article_text": "Home working appears to have led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centres outside London, a Lords committee has heard. Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday. But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend. He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres. Mr Swinney, director of the Centre for Cities think tank, was among various experts giving evidence to a special House of Lords committee set up earlier this year to examine the impact of remote and hybrid working in the UK. Last month, the think tank publishedresearchon the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024. The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week. But a similar pattern was not seen in the data for nine other large British cities, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield. Surveys have shown Friday has become the most popular day for office workers to work from home, with attendance during the middle of the week returning to more similar levels to before the Covid pandemic. Explaining the spending data to peers on Thursday, Mr Swinney said that in London \"the Friday night drink hasn't so much gone away, it's just shifted to a Thursday\". \"But when we looked at other large cities, that wasn't the case,\" he added. \"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places. \"Actually the shift seems to go into the weekend, which seems to be workers coming in from a leisure perspective, rather than going out after work\". The data analysed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialise than in the capital. Elsewhere in the session, Mr Swinney said a decline in city-centre spending since the rise in remote and hybrid working had not been matched by an equivalent rise in spending on \"local High Streets\". \"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee. He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid. He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility. But he added it could be \"two, three, ten years down the line\" before the long-term impact on economic productivity could be properly assessed. Roger and Anthea Cawdron call time at the Ribs of Beef as \"community hotspot\" is sold to pub chain. Hazel Smith says Upton-on-Severn's festivals led to them starting one of the smallest local pubs.

    "title": "Woman found not guilty of having illegal abortion in UK lockdown",
    "article_text": "A woman accused of having an illegal abortion has been cleared by a jury. Nicola Packer, 45, cried as she was acquitted of \"unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing\" with the \"intent to procure a miscarriage\". Isleworth Crown Court heard she took abortion medicine at home during a coronavirus lockdown, in November 2020, when she was about 26 weeks pregnant. Ms Packer then delivered the baby and took her the next day to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in a backpack. The legal limit for taking medication at home to terminate a pregnancy is 10 weeks, while the outer limit for abortions in England, Scotland and Wales is 24 weeks, apart from in certain circumstances. Ms Packer, who was 41 at the time, took the medications mifepristone and misoprostol, which were prescribed over the phone due to Covid restrictions. Prosecutors alleged that she knew she had been pregnant for more than 10 weeks, which she denied. Giving evidence during her trial, Ms Packer spoke of her \"shock\" and \"surprise\" at being pregnant. She told the jury: \"If I had known I was that far along I wouldn't have done it.\" She added: \"I wouldn't have put the baby or myself through it.\" Jurors heard Ms Packer spent the night of 7 November in hospital and was arrested by police the next day. Ms Packer was supported by friends in the public gallery, who hugged one another as the verdict was delivered. Jurors deliberated for more than six hours to reach their unanimous verdict. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the trial demonstrated \"just how outdated and harmful\" current abortion law was and called for reform. The college's president, Dr Ranee Thakar, said: \"As a doctor, I am acutely aware of how vital it is that women can access essential healthcare in a safe and supportive environment. \"Restrictive abortion laws in England and Wales nurture an environment of fear, stigmatisation and criminalisation. Abortion reform is urgently needed, and now is the time for change.\" The college said it had joined with healthcare professionals and experts \"from over 30 other medical, legal and public health bodies\" to call on Parliament to \"take urgent action to protect women's essential reproductive rights and stop these criminal proceedings\".

    "article_text": "A man accused of crashing his car through the gates of actor Jennifer Aniston's home has been charged with stalking and vandalism. Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, of New Albany, Mississippi, is accused of repeatedly sending the Friends star unwanted voicemail, email and social media messages since March 2023. The 48-year-old is alleged to have crashed his grey Chrysler PT Cruiser through the front gate of Aniston's home in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Monday afternoon. Prosecutors said the collision caused major damage and Aniston, 56, was at home at the time of the incident. According to the LA Police Department, a security guard stopped Carwyle on Aniston's driveway before police arrived and arrested him. Carwyle has been charged with felony stalking and vandalism, prosecutors said on Thursday. He also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. Carwyle is accused of harassing the Friends actor since 1 March 2023 by sending her unwanted communications. He is due to appear in court on Thursday. If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison, according to the LA Police Department. District Attorney Nathan Hochman said: \"Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions. \"My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorise others.\" Aniston has not yet commented on the incident and there have been no reports of injuries. This is not the first time Aniston has encountered stalking, having previouslyobtained a restraining orderagainst a man who believed he was in a relationship with her in 2010.",

    "title": "'Man Utd know how to win trophies. Tottenham don't'",
    "article_text": "Ruben Amorim, left, and Ange Postecolgou can both salvage something from poor domestic seasons for their clubs by winning the Europa League Manchester United and Tottenham will meet in an all-English Europa League final on 21 May. Ruben Amorim's United saw off Spanish side Athletic Bilbao7-1 on aggregatein their semi-final to progress, while Spurs got the better of Norwegians Bodo/Glimt5-1 on aggregate. United are looking to win the Europa League for the second time in eight years, while Tottenham are bidding to end a 41-year wait for European success. It is the sixth all-English final in any major European competition - with half of them involving Spurs. It also means there are six English teams in next season's Champions League. Tottenham are looking to win a first trophy of any kind in 17 years and they will fancy themselves as favourites for the game in Bilbao, having beaten United three times already this season. Spurs won 3-0 at Old Trafford and 1-0 at home in the Premier League and also triumphed 4-3 in the League Cup. \"If you think in the odds it's hard for the club to lose four times in a row,\" United boss Ruben Amorim said. \"We can think that way.\" Former Tottenham midfielder Glenn Hoddle agreed that it would be difficult for Spurs to win again. \"To beat a team four times also from the Premier League in one season is really tough,\" Hoddle said on TNT Sports. He added: \"It will be a titanic battle. Spurs have had the upper hand at the moment but United will be looking for revenge.\" United last won the Europa League in 2016-17, when Jose Mourinho was manager. Despite the club's poor season domestically, ex-Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes is confident his former side will rise to the occasion in the final. He said: \"For some reason, the history of this club is almost like Real Madrid at times - when they aren't playing that well they can still go on and win European cups. \"Manchester United's history tells me they will win it, they know how to win trophies, Tottenham don't.\" It's going to upset a lot of people - Postecoglou Belief more important than prize money - Amorim How much would it cost to go to the Europa League final? Tottenham won 3-0 at Manchester United in September Manchester United and Tottenham have struggled domestically this season as they sit 15th and 16th respectively in the Premier League. However, a European trophy will ensure the campaign will ultimately be viewed as a successful one. \"It's going to upset a lot of people isn't it?\" said Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou. \"Neither us will get a trophy if we win, we're just going to take a team picture. \"Who cares if we're struggling in the league? \"This club and others have finished first, second and third in the Premier League and haven't made finals. I couldn't care less who is struggling and who's not. \"Both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there. I'm looking forward to it and it should be a great game.\" Spurs' impressive record over United extends further back than just this season. They have won four of the past six meetings in all competitions, with United last beating them 2-0 in the Premier League in October 2022. But data analysts Opta have made United slight favourites to triumph in the final. Their supercomputer gives the Red Devils a 50.7% chance of lifting the Europa League trophy, with Tottenham at 49.3%. \"I think the final is poised to be absolutely brilliant,\" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen said on TNT Sports. \"Both teams have a point to prove and have many parallels in the Premier League this season and I can't wait.\" Neither Manchester United nor Tottenham have any hope of finishing anywhere near the domestic European places The winners of the Europa League go into the following season's Champions League, regardless of where they finish domestically. So a United v Spurs final guarantees one of them a return to the mega-riches of European football's top table. That rule is handy for United and Spurs, who are both more than 20 points behind fifth place. Without winning the Europa League, neither of them will be in any European competition next season. It would not have any knock-on effect on any other English teams - with the top five guaranteed a Champions League spot through the league. That fifth spot came as a result of English clubs' performances in Europe this season. United and Tottenham's unusually poor domestic seasons mean that if both teams reach the Europa League final next week and stay in their current Premier League positions, the winner would be the lowest-ranked domestic side to win the competition in the past 15 years. Opta data shows that since the Europa League was rebranded in 2009-10, no team finishing lower than 12th in their domestic league has competed in the final or won it. Sevilla (12th) won the tournament in 2023, while Fulham (12th) lost the final in 2010. And this is also the first season with new league phase formats in Europe - previously teams who finished third in their Champions League groups would drop into the Europa League, in theory making the competition harder to win. When West Ham won the Conference League in 2023, they finished 14th in the Premier League that same season. In previous years, teams who were eliminated from the first phase of the Champions League dropped into the Europa League. But that changed from this season after Uefa club competitions underwent their biggest changes for more than a decade. That likely boosted United and Tottenham's chances of reaching the final because in the past 15 seasons 10 finalists were sides who dropped from the Champions League. In addition a third of the past 15 winners of the Europa League were teams who started that season in the Champions League. Tottenham won the 1972 Uefa Cup and lost the 2019 Champions League final against English teams The first Uefa Cup in 1971-72 was between Tottenham and Wolves in a two-legged final. Spurs won the first leg 2-1 at Molineux, with Martin Chivers scoring twice, and drew 1-1 at White Hart Lane two weeks later. It would take 36 years for the next all-English final, which was in the 2007-08 Champions League as Manchester United beat Chelsea on penalties in Moscow. Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard traded goals before a shootout that is best remembered for John Terry's miss after slipping. There were two all-English finals in 2018-19. Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Champions League in Madrid, with goals from Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi. And Chelsea saw off Arsenal 4-1 in Baku in the Europa League, with Eden Hazard netting twice in his final game for the club. Two years later Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0 in the Champions League, with Kai Havertz scoring the only goal in Porto.

    "title": "'It's going to upset a lot of people' - Postecoglou hits back at critics",
    "article_text": "Against Bodo/Glimt, Tottenham recorded their biggest ever aggregate victory in a major European competition semi-final tie \"If it's so easy to get to a final, then why doesn't everyone who finishes in the top three do it?\" In Norway, boss Ange Postecoglou took aim at Tottenham's critics after they reached the Europa League final as he remained on course to continue his record of winning a trophy in his second season. Spurs eased past Bodo/Glimt2-0 in the second legof their semi-final in the Arctic Circle to complete a 5-1 aggregate victory on Thursday. Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro sent Spurs to the final, where they will face Manchester United in Bilbao on 21 May. Tottenham are 16th in the Premier League after a poor domestic season and are chasing their first major trophy since 2008. Postecoglou has come under huge criticism for Tottenham's form, despite losing a number of senior players to injury. They won in Norway without James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall - both out for the season - with Son Heung-min also missing. At times he has been mocked after stating, accurately,he wins trophies during his second season at a club. In the Aspmyra Stadion, minutes after seeing his team reach the final, he came out fighting again. \"It's going to upset a lot of people isn't it,\" Postecoglou said. \"The debate's now raging. The latest one is that neither of us will be able to get a trophy if we win, they're just going to take a team photo because we're not worthy. \"I mean, who cares if we're struggling in the league? It's a separate thing. It's got nothing to do with league form. \"I couldn't care less who's struggling and who's not. I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there.\" It is Tottenham's sixth European final - their last was in 2019 when they lost to Liverpool in the Champions League. Since winning the 2008 Carabao Cup Spurs have lost three finals and been beaten in three semi-finals. They have also reached four FA Cup semi finals without progressing. The club has not lifted the Europa League in 41 years, since beating Anderlecht to win what was the Uefa Cup at the time. \"I've said all along that this is important,\" Postecoglou continued. \"What's happening now is people are fearing that - that it actually might happen, and let's see how we can tear it down somehow and diminish it somehow by saying it's been a poor season and we don't deserve this or we don't deserve that, or somehow comparing us to Man United. \"Maybe if we had Man United's success then maybe I'd have a different view. So, of course it's massive. Of course it is, because you have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15 or 20 years and what the supporters have been through. \"We've given them some real hope and something to dream about that we can do something special this year.\" Solanke & Porro strike as Spurs seal all-English final 'Man Utd know how to win trophies. Tottenham don't' Quiz - How well can you remember other all-English European finals? Postecoglou's comments about winning a trophy in his second season looked like they might come back to haunt him at times, but he is now just one game away from delivering the goods. \"Be careful what you dream for,\" former Spurs midfielder Glenn Hoddle told TNT Sports. \"He has come out and said it and his players have come out and responded. He's saying 'I always win something in my second season' and he believes it, the players are believing it and now the fans are believing it. Anything can happen.\" Former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robison, part of the BBC 's commentary team in Norway, believes winning the Europa League is more important to Postecoglou than it is to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim. \"If Tottenham don't win he won't be in charge next season,\" Robinson said. \"Ange Postecoglou's whole season and Tottenham career depends on that one result. You cannot underestimate how big that game is for Tottenham to win the final. \"Champions League football, yes, and the finances that come with it, but not having to go through a whole restructure. If they don't win that final they are back to square one. It's massive for Tottenham.\"",

    "title": "12 from Leinster, two from Wales - the Lions squad in numbers",
    "article_text": "On the Lions' last trip to Australia back in 2013, head coach Warren Gatland picked 15 Wales players in his initial squad. By the decisive third Test, he had 10 Welshmen in his starting XV. A little over a decade on, things are markedly different. After 17 defeats on the spin, Welsh representation is provided by only two players: flanker Jac Morgan and scrum-half Tomos Williams. It is the lowest number of Welshmen picked for a Lions squad in the modern era. However, Wales can take comfort from the waxing and waning of other nations' fortunes. In 2017, just two Scotland players - Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg - were picked in the initial squad. Now, they can boast eight in the 2025 squad. Similarly Ireland had only two players in the 1993 squad selected to tour New Zealand and four for the 1997 trip to South Africa. In this newest squad, they provide the most players - with Andy Farrell opting for 15 of those he coaches in his usual role as Ireland head coach. The 38 players heading to Australia with the Lions Pollock makes Lions squad as Owen Farrell misses out Five talking points from Lions squad announcement There have been significantly more lopsided squads in the past. In 2005, Sir Clive Woodward opted for 20 players from the England set-up with which he had won the Rugby World Cup two years earlier, including luring Lawrence Dallaglio and Neil Back out of international retirement. Twenty years on the squad is lighter in experience with 26 first-time tourists. Nine players are on their second tour while captain Maro Itoje, his England and Saracens' team-mate Elliot Daly and Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong are pulling on the famous shirt for a third trip. Lions talking points - Irish record, Doris injury & Prendergast out Lions all I could think about this year - Tuipulotu Wales players must be ready if Lions call - Evans At club level, Leinster provide 12 players - nearly a quarter of the squad - and it could have been more. Fly-half Sam Prendergast was strongly fancied to go on the tour, but Finn Russell, Fin Smith and Marcus Smith were preferred at 10. Ryan Baird, Jamie Osborne and Robbie Henshaw were also outsiders for inclusion. Glasgow Warriors and Northampton, champions of last season's United Rugby Championship and Premiership respectively, supply four players each, while captain Itoje is joined by Saracens team-mates Ben Earl and Daly. There are 15 clubs represented in the 38-strong squad, including eight of the 10 Premiership teams, three of the four Irish provinces and both Scottish professional sides. Blair Kinghorn, who plays for French side Toulouse, is the only player who plays their club rugby outside Britain and Ireland. There is more than just pride at stake for those domestic club sides. They, like the players, are part of a newly-minted profit sharing agreement with the Lions. The more players they have on tour, they larger the pay cheque at the end. It has been estimated,externalthat Leinster's healthy dozen will earn their club in excess of Â£1m. Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate Listen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "article_text": "Manuel Pellegrini was the first person to tell Maresca he had the attributes to become a manager during his playing career Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca says he is excited to face his \"professional dad\"  after Manuel Pellegrini-managed Real Betis qualified for the Conference League final. Midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored asChelsea won 1-0 on the nightagainst Djurgarden and 5-1 on aggregate while Spanish club Betis needed extra time tobeat Fiorentina 4-3on aggregate over both legs. The results have led to Maresca facing a manager he has both played under and worked alongside having been a member of Pellegrini's squad at Malaga before later becoming his assistant at West Ham. Maresca admitted he was late for the press conference because he was watching Betis win in extra time and said of the result: \"I'm happy to face Betis, especially because of Manuel Pellegrini. He is like my professional dad. So we'll be very happy. \"I had him four years, two as a player and two I was his coach, assistant coach. So I know exactly how he thinks about players, but the most important thing is that he's honest, he's a good person, he always tries to be honest with the player. \"And I try, personally, I try to learn a lot about his way.\" Maresca also enjoyed the most successful part of his playing career at Betis's fierce rivals Sevilla, winning two Europa League trophies and a Super Cup, so expects to face crowd taunts. \"I played four years for Sevilla, that is a big derby against Betis,\" he said. \"We also won the derby 1-0, and I scored a goal. I know that they don't like me, they don't love me. \"I met my wife in Seville, she's from Seville. My first son born in Seville. I played for Seville, but no doubt that I want to win the final.\" Chelsea will want to finish the job in Wroclaw, Poland on 28 May, three days after the Premier League season finishes. Maresca continued: \"For me personally, it's very important, especially because we can give the chance to this club and these fans to be the first club in Europe to win all the competitions [having previously won the Champions League and Europa League]. \"The Conference League is a starting point to build a winner mentality, and then to try to win more things and more titles.\" Latest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views Get Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Humphries edges past Littler for 'extra-special' Leeds win",
    "article_text": "Luke Humphries beat Luke Littler 6-5 in the fourth Premier League final between the two in the 2025 season Luke Humphries ended his 10-week wait for a Premier League nightly victory with a tense 6-5 win over Luke Littler in Leeds. The 30-year-old, who had not won a final since beating Littler on night four in Exeter, came from 2-0 down to beat 'The Nuke' in a thriller. World number one Humphries averaged 100.96, with 18-year-old Littler at 99.89. Wearing a Leeds United-inspired yellow and blue shirt at the First Direct Arena - days after his footballing heroes won the Championship title to mark their Premier League return in style - 'Cool Hand Luke' made a sluggish start as Littler took charge. But Humphries, who was defending his Leeds crown from 12 months ago, then won three straight legs and edged 5-3 ahead. As both mixed errors with brilliance in their performances, Littler hit back to take the match to a final-leg decider. Both men missed bull finishes for 100-plus checkouts, but Humphries kept calm to hit double 10 and seal the success. \"When you know you're playing against Luke Littler you know you're not going to get away with mid-game performances, you need to be at your best to beat him,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We weren't at our best but it was a decent final and I do seem to raise my performance against him. \"It is extra special to win in Leeds, I feel at home here. I know it isn't my hometown but it does feel extra special. I won here last year and it gave me extra confidence for the finals night and hopefully it does again - and I can get that elusive Premier League crown that I've always dreamed of.\" Humphries had earlier overcome bottom-of-the-table Stephen Bunting 6-4 in the semi-finals to set up a fourth Premier League final of the season against Littler. A 6-4 win in the last eight over Michael van Gerwen also confirmed his place at finals night on 29 May at the O2 Arena, while Bunting's defeat ruled him out of the finals reckoning. Littler showed his quality in a convincing 6-3 semi-final victory over Gerwyn Price, where the defending Premier League champion came back from 2-0 down to dominate. Price's 6-5 quarter-final victory over Rob Cross, combined with future fixtures, saw him confirm his place in the top four. Relive all the action from night 14 in Leeds Premier League Darts schedule, results, prize money Anderson thrashes Gilding to retain European Grand Prix title Nathan Aspinall's quarter-final exit leaves him outside the play-off spots Littler's night win in Birminghamlast week booked his place for finals night, while quarter-final victories for both Humphries and Price sealed their spots in the O2 Arena showpiece. Dutchman Van Gerwen and Nathan Aspinall both missed the chance to close the gap on Price in third place following 6-4 defeats to Humphries and Littler respectively. A quarter-final exit for Cross also diminished his hopes. Van Gerwen and Aspinall will meet next week in Aberdeen and a run could go a long way to deciding their final position, but the pair could also face each other for fourth spot on night 16 in Sheffield when the fixtures are decided by league positions. As it stands, the duo occupy positions four and five and only a point separates them. With two points up for grabs in that quarter-final and fourth and fifth facing each other, that match could prove to be a winner-takes-all affair. In the final quarter-final of the evening, Bunting came from 5-2 down to pip Chris Dobey 6-5. The 'Bullet' sealed only his third quarter-final win of the season with a 121 checkout, but could not get past Humphries, who will face Littler again in the last eight in Aberdeen on 15 May.

Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line. Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night. The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows. If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

    "article_text": "Iga Swiatek has won the French Open in four of the past five years Defending champion Iga Swiatek cruised through to the Italian Open third round with a crushing straight-set win over Italian wildcard Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Swiatek won 28 of 35 service points and did not face a break point as she wrapped up a 6-0 6-1 victory in just 52 minutes. The Polish world number two is seeking a fourth title in five years in Rome, with 18 of her past 19 matches at the tournament being straight-set wins - the exception being when she retired from her 2023 quarter-final with Elena Rybakina. Swiatek will play Danielle Collins in the last 32 after the American beat Elena-Gabriela Ruse of Romania 6-3 6-3. The 23-year-old - who will bid for a fifth title in six years at the French Open later this month - has reached at least the quarter-finals of her previous eight tournaments, but is yet to win a trophy this season. Japan's Naomi Osaka continued her fine run of form on clay with a 2-6 7-5 6-1 win over Swiss lucky loser Viktorija Golubic. The 27-year-old has traditionally struggled on clay, failing to make it past the French Open third round, but has now won seven successive matches on the surface. Her victory at last week's L'Open 35 de Saint-Malo was her first clay-court title - and first WTA title on any surface since becoming a mother in July 2023. Osaka had been due to play ninth seed Paula Badosa, but the Spaniard was replaced by Golubic because of injury. The four-time Grand Slam champion will play Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic next, after she beat Brazilian 18th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia 6-0 6-3. Italian Jasmine Paolini is also through to the third round after she defeated New Zealander Lulu Sun in straight sets 6-4 6-3. Sixth seed Paolini will play Tunisian Ons Jabeur, who advanced via a walkover because Czech Petra Kvitova was forced to withdraw from their second-round tie through injury. Jessica Pegula won 6-4 6-2 against fellow American Ashlyn Krueger and will next meet Belgium's Elise Mertens, while Madison Keys beat Varvara Gracheva of France 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 and will face Peyton Stearns in an-all US tie next.

    "title": "Trump’s aid cuts blamed as food rations stopped for a million refugees in Uganda",
    "article_text": "Food rations for a million people in Uganda have been cut off completely this week amid a funding crisis at the United NationsWorld Food Programme, raising fears that refugees will now be pushed back into countries at war. The WFP inUgandawarned two weeks agothat $50m (£37m) was urgently needed to help refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan. Uganda hosts Africa’s largest refugee population of1.8 million, with60,000 new arrivals in the last three months. Malnutrition rates had reached a crisis point, said the UN agency. “Due to severe funding shortages, @WFP_Uganda has cut 1 million refugees entirely off from food assistance,” the agency announced via social media. “Malnutrition has reached critical levels (15% +) in refugee reception centres, and general food rations have been cut by up to 80%,” it said. In March, the WFP slashed food relief, introducing rationing for new arrivals to the east African country. Hillary Onek, Uganda’s minister for refugees, said it was a direct result of the radical aid cuts by the US and European countries. Donald Trump’sfreeze on US aid spendingin January and theUK’s cut in aid spendingthe following month from 0.58% of gross national income to 0.3% have badly hit Uganda’s ability to look after refugees. “The problem is beyond and outside our control. The global funding to support refugees has dwindled. The money given to the World Food Programme to buy food was cut off. The refugees are going to suffer the consequences,” Onek said. “Aid can’t be depended on any more. Trump came and radically cut off funds to support refugee programmes. Other countries who have been contributing, most of them are not honouring their small contributions. WFP and UNHCR are in a total crisis because of lack of funding,” he said. Just 46% of the $858mrequired in the multi-agency Uganda Country Refugee Response Planwas funded in 2024. “It’s impossible for us now to shoulder the burden of refugee challenge alone. I see there is going to be impending confusion, increased violence and war,” said Onek. “These people [refugees] will be looking for something to survive. They want to be alive. They will go into people’s cassava gardens, uproot them and that is war and confusion. We don’t know how we shall overcome that impending confusion,” he said. UNHCR launched anappealfor $44m last month to support 55,000 new Congolese refugees and an additional 25,000 expected to arrive over the next six months. “This rapid influx has placed considerable pressure on basic social services, including education, food, shelter, health and nutrition services, and WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] infrastructure,” the UNHCR said. “These conditions have strained the already limited resources, further worsened by the surge in new arrivals, lengthy processing times and the strain on transportation services for refugees.” Simon Okello, a South Sudanese refugee inBidi Bidi refugee camp, one of Africa’s largest, said the cuts would cause starvation and malnutrition. “We are totally messed up. This has complicated our lives totally,” he said. “We have been surviving on food rations and coupons. How are we going to get food to eat now? People will starve and die.” “Without food now, people might be forced to go back to their home countries where we fled from or engage in illegal activities to get something to eat,” he said. Activists fear Uganda may now begin forced repatriations, something Onek said Uganda’s cabinet would shortly be discussing. “The other option available is that those refugees whose countries are peaceful, we should change our policies and make sure we force them to go back to their homes and leave us alone,” said Onek. “I will have to discuss it with my cabinet colleagues and then we see what direction to take.” Dismas Nkunda, director of Atrocities Watch Africa, said: “We saw this coming. It began with the self-reliance programme where UN bodies started to go slow on the provision of humanitarian assistance. “Matters were not helped by the coming of Trump as president and his cuts in funding for the UN. “My fear is that host countries such as Uganda may be forced to become radical and reverse their otherwise good policies in hosting refugees,” he said.",

    "title": "‘The pope is Peruvian’: elation in country where pontiff served as bishop",
    "article_text": "Theelection of Pope Leo XIVhas been celebrated across Latin America, where many hailed him as the second pontiff from the region, after his Argentinian predecessor,Francis. The news prompted particular elation inPeru, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years and was granted citizenship in 2015. In the capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang in celebration.In his first appearance from the Vatican balcony, Leo XIV briefly switched from Italian to Spanish to address the faithful “from my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru”, where he served as bishop for more than a decade. Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte,hailed the “historic” electionof Leo XIV, whom she described as a Peruvian “by choice and conviction” who had devoted more than 20 years of service to the country. She added that Prevost, 69, “chose to be one of us, to live among us and to carry in his heart the faith, culture and dreams of this country”. She added: “The pope is Peruvian; God lovesPeru.” Even so, Prevost has spoken out against Boluarte’s government in the past. In early 2023, he described his “sadness and pain” over the deaths of 49 protesters inanti-government demonstrationsthat erupted when President Boluarte took office in December 2022, replacing Pedro Castillo who was forced out forattempting to suspend congress. At the time Prevost said the unrest reflected the historic neglect of Peru’s poor, saying: “This conflict does not represent the best of the country.” Pope Leo also called on late former president Alberto Fujimori, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption to ask for forgiveness from each of his government’s victims in order to begin a process of reconciliation. His suggestion came just two days after Fujimori was given apresidential pardon as part of a political dealand released a video with a half-hearted apology. Prevost pointedly suggested “it would be more effective to ask for forgiveness, personally, for some of the great injustices that were committed and for which he was tried and sentenced”. Thecontroversial ex-leaderwas sent back to jail in 2018, only to bepardoned again in 2023amid street protests. He died in 2024 and was given a state funeral. Rosa María Vílchez, 49, who is originally from Chiclayo but now lives in Lima, met Prevost when attending a church service a few years ago. “We knew him by name,” she recalls. “Today I remembered that when I saw him and I really felt like crying because he moved me. He transmits a lot of peace,” said Vílchez, who was collecting her children from school in Villa El Salvador, in the south of the capital. “I hope that he brings a little peace, that he can stabilise the country in some way, because Peruvians are, mainly, very faithful and very Catholic. So, I think he is going to be a figure of political authority,” she added. Cecilia Durand, 55, a publisher in Lima, said: “I’m not Catholic, in fact, there are many things about the church that I am against, but I think this is a good thing for Peru. It’s like winning the World Cup!” As news of Leo’s election began to sink in, social media in Peru was flooded with memes of the pope eating ceviche, Peru’s flagship dish, and drinking Inca Kola, its bubblegum-flavoured soft drink. Others showed him in Peru’s red-and-white football shirt and another humorous image showed the popemobile refashioned as a three-wheeled motorcycle rickshaw, the principal mode of transport in much of the country. Colombia’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti,postedon social media that the years spent in Peru “mean the new pope is once again a Latin American”. Someposts on social media jokinglyclaimed that the new pope was “more Latino than the entire cast of Emilia Pérez”, referencing the French film thatsparked controversyover its portrayal of Mexico. Prevost first came to Peru in 1985, joining the Augustinian mission serving in the prelature in Chulucanas, near the border with Ecuador, until 1986. He returned in 1988, spending the following decade as head of the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo, the country’s third most populous city, also in the north, where he taught canon law and served as a judge on the regional ecclesiastical court. He returned to the US in 1998 and was elected provincial of the Augustinian province of Chicago. He did not return to Peru until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him as apostolic administrator of the diocese of Chiclayo. The following year, he was named bishop of the city. By 2023 he was promoted to archbishop, then he was made a cardinal in 2024. Janinna Sesa, who met Prevost when she worked for the Catholic charity Caritas, said he was the kind of person who would “put on boots and wade through the mud” to help those most in need – as he did in 2022, when torrential rains affected Chiclayo and nearby villages. He also delivered food and blankets to remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor, she told the Associated Press. Observers say Prevost had a difficult relationship with the Catholic right in Peru, particularlySodalitium, a far-right Peruvian lay Catholic sect, with a strong presence in the region where he worked. Just before his death, Pope Francisdissolved Sodalitium, after a 50-year history of sexual, psychological and physical abuse, and allegations of malfeasance and corruption.

    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationis invoking the “state secrets privilege ” in an apparent attempt to avoid answering a judge’s questions about its erroneous deportation ofKilmar Ábrego Garcíato El Salvador. US district judge Paula Xinis disclosed the government’s position in a two-page order on Wednesday. She set a Monday deadline for attorneys to file briefs on the issue and how it could affect Ábrego García’s case. Xinis also scheduled a 16 May hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, to address the matter. The Republican administration previously invoked the same legal authority to cut off a judge’s inquiry into whether it defied an order to turn around planes deporting Venezuelan migrants toEl Salvador. Ábrego García, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly two months. His mistaken deportation has become a flash point forDonald Trump’simmigrationpolicies and his increasing friction with the US courts. Trump has said he could call El Salvador’s president and have Ábrego García, who was living in Maryland, returned to the United States. Instead, Trump has doubled down on his claims that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang. Police in Maryland had identified Ábrego García as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But Ábrego García was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed Ábrego García was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where Ábrego García has never lived. The administration has balked at telling Xinis what, if anything, it has done to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US. The judge ruled that his lawyers can question severalTrump administrationofficials under oath about the government’s response to her orders. In a court filing on Wednesday, his lawyers said they already have conducted depositions of three officials and are “still in the dark” about the government’s efforts to free Ábrego García. They are asking for permission to depose more officials, possibly including one from the White House.",

    "title": "Canada medical mystery takes twist as study finds no evidence of brain illness",
    "article_text": "A new peer-reviewed scientific study has found no evidence of a mystery brain disease in theCanadianprovince of New Brunswick, suggesting instead a troubling combination of “misdiagnosis and misinformation”. The research comes as the Maritime province prepares its own assessment of more than 220 suspected cases in the hope of giving families some answers toa medical mystery that has gripped the region for years. The report published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, known as Jama, is an independent reassessment of 25 cases diagnosed by Moncton-based neurologist Alier Marrero from within the broader sample of 222 patients. The authors, affiliated with the University of Toronto, New Brunswick’s Horizon health network and other Canadian institutions, found that those within the cohort were misdiagnosed and had common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer. The findings, however, are unlikely to tamp down speculation from families that the report once again ignores their suspicions of environmental contamination in the region. Health officials in New Brunswick first warned in 2021 that more than 40 residents were suffering from a possible unknown neurological syndrome, with symptoms similar to those of the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Those cases were referred to Marrero after the initial physicians were initially stumped by the symptoms displayed by their parents. A year later, however, an independent oversight committee created by the provincedetermined that the group of patients had most likely been misdiagnosedand were suffering from known illnesses such as cancer and dementia. A final report from the committee, which concluded there was no “cluster” of people suffering from an unknown brain syndrome, signalled the end of the province’s investigation. But earlier that year, the Guardian reported that a top federal scientistworriedthere was “something real going on” in New Brunswick. Anothersaid the investigation“was shut down” and that caseloads were higher than officially acknowledged. “I don’t think it is helpful to suggest or point to who or why – suffice to say that we were prepared to marshal both financial and human scientific resources to tackle the mystery, but they were declined,” the scientist wrote. According to a February 2025 letter Marrero wrote to federal and provincial officials, seen by the Guardian, the number of patients suffering from unexplained neurological symptoms has since jumped to 507 across New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Several are under the age of 45. The new study found that “well-known conditions were identified in all 25 cases, including common neurodegenerative diseases, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer”, adding that a study of 11 autopsy cases led to the conclusion that “a new disease was extremely unlikely, with a probability less than .001”. Patient advocacy groups have rejected the idea of a new “mystery illness”, instead arguing that the cases are linked by environmental contaminants. But the researchers say they do not believe the patients were made ill by exposure to something in the environment, such as herbicides or heavy metals like mercury. They determined that “misdiagnosis and misinformation become inextricably entwined and amplify harm exponentially”, noting that more than half of the people eligible for the study declined to participate. They also blamed “inaccurate clinical assessments and an over-reliance on ancillary testing” for perpetuating the idea of a “mystery illness” and said they found “meaningful discrepancies” in case histories. Marrero said in a statement he is “in profound disagreement with the study conclusions” and has “many questions regarding the methods and the content”, adding that he was “appalled” that an investigation with a “small number” of patients has been conducted without his knowledge. Susan Holt, the province’s premier,pledged a fresh and “thorough” investigationafter taking office last last year. “I think we need to be doing everything we can to shed some light on this and find a way to stop what’s making people sick,” she said at the time. New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, Dr Yves Léger, said in a statement the Jama study doesn’t change his office’s intention to complete its own investigation into the 222 cases, which Marrero has officially referred to the province. Updates will be posted on the province’snew website, and a public report with recommendations is expected in the coming months.",

    "title": "Scorpions ‘taking over’ Brazilian cities with reported stings rising 155%",
    "article_text": "Scorpions are “taking over” Brazilian cities, researchers have warned in a paper that said rapid urbanisation and climate breakdown were driving an increase in the number of people being stung. More than 1.1m stings were reported between 2014 and 2023, according to data from the Brazilian notifiable diseases information system. There was a 155% increase in reports of stings from 2014 to 2023,according to researchpublished in the journal Frontiers in Public Health. The rise in cases has been driven by rapid, unplanned urbanisation–such as favelas – characterised by high-density housing and poor waste disposal, according to the research. Although urban areas are encroaching on wild habitats where scorpions already live, they are also creating new environments in which to thrive. “Urbanisation in Brazil has profoundly reshaped ecosystems,” said the lead researcher, Manuela Berto Pucca, an assistant professor at São Paulo State University. “Cities unintentionally offer everything scorpions need: plenty of shelter (in walls, drains, rubble and construction debris), consistent warmth, and a reliable food supply in the form of cockroaches and other urban invertebrates.” They particularly like sewers, which are warm year-round, home to almost no predators and provide plenty of food, especially cockroaches. Some species of scorpion can survive forup to 400 dayswithout food and are able to reproduce without mating, making them difficult to eradicate. Hotter summers, and periods of intense rainfall and drought, also help them thrive as they are adapted to warm and humid environments. Provisional datafor 2024 suggests scorpions were responsible for nearly 200,000 stings and 133 deaths in Brazil. In total, researchers projected 2m new cases between 2025 and 2033. “The real scale of this issue is likely far greater than the recorded statistics suggest,” researchers said, as many people choose to treat themselves at home, or forgo treatment. “I’ve been working in places where scorpion stings are a daily fear, especially in poor and crowded areas,” said Pucca. “The numbers showed us that in the future the problem will be bigger than it is now.” Researchers said that 0.1% of reported stings result in death, and children and elderly people are most vulnerable. Healthy people generally make a full recovery, but can suffer from pain and discomfort for several days. Symptoms include pain, burning, swelling, redness, tingling and nausea. Previous researchmodelling the distribution of scorpions in Brazil showed the potential to expand their habitats into urban areas driven by a warmer, wetter climate. Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, Mexico, Guyana and Venezuela have witnessed a “particularly alarming rise in scorpionism [the medical condition resulting from a sting]over recent decades, evolving into a significant public health crisis”, theresearchers of the new study said. In Europe there are believed to bemore than 35 native speciesof scorpion, although there is no comprehensive research on population trends. Researchers said prevention was key. “Scorpions thrive in cluttered, humid environments. Keep areas clean, seal cracks in walls, use screens on drains and always check shoes, towels and clothes before using them,” said Pucca. Dr Manuela González-Suárez, an ecologist at Reading University who was not involved in the research, said: “The numbers are much higher than I would expect, in the sense that this is a significant increase.” However, she said awareness of an issue could also result in more reporting. González-Suárez added that people should not be unduly alarmed by the research: “Many people who are stung do not have severe or lethal reactions and mortality rates are relatively low compared with, for example, those due to road accidents or violent crimes.” The Brazilian health system provides free treatment for scorpion stings, and anti-venom is available at some hospitals and emergency centres. “If someone is stung, don’t wait for symptoms to worsen – go to the nearest healthcare facility immediately,” said one of the paper’s authors, Prof Eliane Candiani Arantes from the University of São Paulo. “All people are vulnerable, especially children, because just one small sting can kill a child,” she said. Prof Nibedita Ray-Bennett, at the University of Leicester, who is president of theAvoidable Deaths Network, said the study underscored “the urgent need for action”. Pucca said one of the most widespread misconceptions about scorpions was that they were our enemies. “They are not. These animals act defensively, not offensively. They’re part of the natural world and play essential ecological roles, from controlling pest populations to maintaining biodiversity.” Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage This article was amended on 8 May 2025. Owing to an error in supplied information, an earlier version gave the percentage increase in the number of sting cases from 2014 to 2023 as 250%, rather than 155%. However, the figures cited – 66,986 cases in 2014; 170,616 in 2023 – were correct.",

    "title": "Taiwan faces similar threat to Europe in 1930s, president says",
    "article_text": "Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries heading for conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a punchy speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe. “Eighty years after the end of the European war, the message of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we share the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign dignitaries gathered in Taipei. Lai’s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure fromChina. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war in Europe. The conflict is a thorny topic incross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the banner of the Republic of China. During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing. In a veiled reference to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes. “Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new totalitarian group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that appeasement will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.” Thursday’s event opened with a short video featuring clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech. The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan. Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still interconnected, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait”. Lai is steering Taiwan through afraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itselfhas been unclear. China frequentlyrehearses blockades of Taiwan. So-called “grey zone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing. Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western largesse”. Lai’s speech came the day after China’s president, Xi Jinping,arrived in Moscowfor Russia’s commemoration of the end of the second world war, which will be marked with a military parade featuring Chinese troops on Friday. China’s continuing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine has alarmed western leaders and raised concerns that China could be learning lessons for an invasion of Taiwan. In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi devoted a lengthy section to the war’s implications for China’s claims on Taiwan. Xi described this week’s commemorations as “the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s recovery” to China. “No matter how the situation on the island of Taiwan changes, no matter how external forces disrupt it, the historical trend that China will eventually reunify and will definitely reunify is unstoppable,” Xi wrote. Xi expressed China’s appreciation for Russia’s support for “all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification”. Additional research by Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Xi hails ‘confident’ China-Russia ties as Putin welcomes ‘dear friend’ to Kremlin",
    "article_text": "Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin exchanged warm words in the Kremlin on Thursday during a grand ceremony welcoming the Chinese leader for his11th visit to Russia, ahead of a military parade to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. After nearly four hours of talks, Xi described his meeting with his Russian counterpart as “in-depth, friendly and fruitful”. Calling Xi a “dear friend”, Putin said the talks were “warm and substantive” and ties between Russia andChinawere stronger than ever before. Putin announced plans to visit China in the autumn to mark the anniversary of Japan’s defeat in the second world war. The two leaders presented a united front in opposition to a US-led global order they openly reject. Their display of solidarity comes as Donald Trump, the US president, wages a trade war against China and pushes Russia toward peace talks over Ukraine. In a lengthy joint statement, they said they would deepen relations in all areas, including military ties, and “strengthen coordination in order to decisively counter Washington’s course of ‘dual containment’ of Russia and China”. Ahead of the talks, Xi said: “History and reality have fully proven that the continued development and deepening of China-Russia relations is a natural continuation of the longstanding friendship between our peoples.” Xi’s visit is a welcome boost for Putin at a time when his relationship with the Trump administration appears to be facing some turbulence. While Russia has expressed a desire to repair relations with the US, seeing potential for lucrative business deals, significant differences remain between the two countries over how to end the war in Ukraine. Moscow continues to stand by its maximalist demands, showing little willingness to compromise. Earlier this week, JD Vance, the US vice-president, said Russia wasasking for “too much”in its negotiations with Ukraine, in the latest sign of mounting frustration in Washington. World leaders flying to Moscow for the Victory Day parade on Friday faced the threat of disruption from Ukrainian drone attacks, which forced most of the Russian capital’s airports to close on Wednesday. The flight of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, was rerouted. Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico – the only EU leader to attend – was forced to take a circuitous route to Moscow on Thursday after Baltic nations closed their airspace to his flight. The detour means his jet is expected to fly over Hungary, Romania, the Black Sea, Georgia, and finally into Russia via Dagestan. On Thursday, a three-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine declared by Russia came into effect, though Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of continuing hostilities. A Ukrainian military spokesperson reported Russian assaults along several points of the eastern front, while Moscow claimed Ukrainian forces had twice attempted to breach the border in its Kursk region. “Predictably, Putin’s ‘Parade ceasefire’ proves to be a farce,” wrote Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, on X. “According to our military data, despite Putin’s statements, Russian forces continue to attack across the entire frontline. From midnight to midday, Russia committed 734 ceasefire violations and 63 assault operations, 23 of which are ongoing,” Sybiha said. He added that Ukraine remained ready for “at least 30-day full ceasefire”. Xi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national anthems of Russia and China. In an article published in Russian media, Xi said China and Russia had fought side by side in the second world war. “Today, 80 years later, unilateralism, hegemony and bullying are extremely harmful,” Xi wrote. “We must learn from history … [and] resolutely oppose all forms of hegemony and power politics, and jointly create a better future for mankind.” On Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of hegemonic bullying in the international arena”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour. Hopes in some Washington circles that the Trump administration might have been able to perform a “reverse Nixon” and persuade Russia to decouple from China by bolstering the US-Russia relationship appear to have failed with Xi and Putin’s declaration that their countries are closer than ever before. China has been an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort. The comments from Xi and Putin came a few hours after Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan, gave aspeechin Taipei calling on European leaders to stand with Taiwan in the face of “a new totalitarian group”, a veiled reference to China and its allies. Lai compared Taiwan’s current predicament to that of European countries before the start of the second world war. Xi has used this visit to underscore Russia’s support for China’s claims on Taiwan. “Russia has repeatedly reiterated that it adheres to the one-China principle, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification,” Xi wrote on Wednesday. Western leaders are increasingly worried that China could launch some form of assault on Taiwan in the next few years, with the war in Ukraine providing a template for how such an attack may play out on the world stage.

    "title": "From snail slime to salmon sperm: the K-beauty boom hits UK high streets",
    "article_text": "Korean beauty products are moving from phone screens to UK high streets as social media drives sales of skincare with the help of eye-catching ingredients such as snail slime and salmon sperm. Retailers are looking to capitalise on the TikTok and Instagram trend for skincare and makeup ranges from South Korea –known as K-beauty– by opening physical stores and launching brands in a push to get consumers to pick up products that havegone viral online. While some of the ranges have been available on specialist beauty websites for some time, British shoppers are now getting the chance to try them out on their skin and assess their supposed wondrous effects. The trend is another example of South Korea’s growing cultural prominence where food, film, TV and K-pop, with its international stars such as theboyband BTS, are becoming big business as companies expand into large consumer markets such as Britain. K-beauty’s positive reputation stems in part from Korea’s tradition of using natural substances in products, making them gentle on the skin, and its strict rules around labelling. The industry is also known for novel formulations and unexpected packaging (sometimes animal-shaped), although many shoppers discover brands such asBeautyof Joseon and Laneige through reviews by influencers. Georgia Stafford, of the market research firm Mintel, says:“Social media is the driving force behind K-beauty’s popularity in the UK, where 34% of users have bought a beauty or grooming product after seeing it on social media, rising to 58% of Gen Z users.” A fifth (21%) of Gen Z consumers (aged 13-28) use K-beauty products, according to Mintel, compared with 8% overall. They are more likely to follow the complex 10-step skincare routines popular in South Korea, ortry to get the “glass skin” lookbeloved by the beauty industry, where your face is drenched in moisture to give a dewy, luminous look.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'. K-beauty products have previously had a “relatively limited audience”, according to Stafford, as they were unavailable on most high streets. However, online popularity could now translate to in-person purchases. Shoppers can now buy products such as Cosrx’s skin essence containing snail mucin – slime to the uninitiated – at Superdrug and Boots. The latter store also sells Anua’s face serum with PDRN (polydeoxyribonucleotide), which contains DNA fragments extracted from salmon sperm and is claimed to hydrate the skin deeply. K-beauty products are “typically a fraction of the cost” compared with those from established premium brands, says Stafford. “Experimenting with new products and ingredients is therefore accessible to consumers. PDRN is a standout example. The ingredient promotes collagen production and its source is a real conversation starter!” Boots, Britain’s biggest beauty retailer, sold a Korean skincare product almost every 15 seconds between December and the end of February and in recent months has expanded the range of products it stocks. While consumers may be tightening their belts in other areas, spending on pharmacy, health and beauty has emerged as an outlier. Figures from Barclays show spend in this area was on average 10.2% higher during the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2024. The Korean retailer Moida (which translates as “to gather” or “to collect”) launched its first UK store in west London’s Westfield shopping centre in December and opened its second in the capital this month. The new shop, fitted out in pink and red and located near Leicester Square, is close to its fellow Korean beauty retailer PureSeoul, which now has eight outlets across the UK – including Birmingham, Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge – and is opening a further two this year. Meanwhile, the Korean beauty rival Skin Cupid has signed a 10-year lease for a UK outlet in central London close to Tottenham Court Road after the success of a nearby fortnight-long pop-up during the festive season.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'. The electronics giantLGis best known for its smart TVs and washer dryers, but the company’s first product, launched in 1947, was a moisturiser called Lucky Cream. LG hopes to ridethe boom in interest in all things Koreanthrough the expansion of its beauty arm, LG Household & Health Care (LG H&H). It launched its K-beauty brand Belif in the UK at the start of May, initially at online retailers and two London branches of retailer GlamTouch. LG is also looking at opening physical stores, says Steven Jeong, the managing director of LG H&H UK. “While our initial strategy focuses on online channels, we believe that in-person experiences are an essential part of the skincare journey, especially when it comes to texture and personalised consultation.” The company hopes to “establish an offline presence” from June, he says. Many consumers are also drawn to K-beauty as part of the wider rise in interest in Korea’s cultural exports, known asthe Korean wave (hallyu). K-beauty is forecast to be a$18.3bn (£13.7bn) global business by 2030, according to a Straits Research report, growing at a rate of 9% each year from 2022 to the end of the decade. “I watch K-drama,” says Ike Lawson, 28, browsing the shelves of a central London PureSeoul store with two colleagues during her lunchbreak. “K-beauty products work for me, like the snail mucin serum. I went to Korea in 2023 to raid the skincare, but mostly for the food,” she says. Lining the shelves of PureSeoul are stylish tubes and bottles of products, many boasting ingredients unfamiliar to the British market, ranging from mung beans and mugwort to propolis, which is extracted from bees. Lawson’s colleague Georgia Spooner, 27, who has just bought a £22 sunscreen stick for her upcoming holiday, says she has noticed “more shops popping up”, after first discovering K-beauty on social media. “It’s more mainstream now.” This Charing Cross Road branch of PureSeoul is something of a Korean hub with grocery shops and restaurants. Such locations appeal to retailers when choosing a space, says Matt Peters, a specialist in retail in the London office of the property company Savills. “Whilst these brands are looking to focus and showcase their product to a western audience, a lot of them will like to align with other Asian-focused businesses within a location,” Peters says. K-beauty retailers are among those filling in gaps on British high streets, according to Savills, with some signing 10-year leases, signalling their intention to commit to a location for a considerable period. Peters says: “These retailers see this as a long-term movement, this isn’t a flash in the pan. K-beauty has been in the UK for over five years now. It’s a sector that is increasing in terms of product sold over different retailers.” As shoppers prioritise spending on wellness and cosmetics, property analysts expect K-beauty retailers will continue to eye up other areas outside London based on the location of their most loyal online shoppers. Moida is planning further expansion across the UK and intends to take a step outside London, taking its snail slime and other skincare novelties to Manchester in the summer.",

    "article_text": "A man was admitted to theWorld Expo in Japanusing a ticket to the 1940 Grand International Exposition of Japan, an event that was called off as war escalated, organisers said. Tickets for the Grand International Exposition ofJapanin Tokyo were released in 1938 but the event was postponed indefinitely as Japan became embroiled in the second world war. Organisers of Expo 2025 in the western city of Osaka, which opened in April and runs until mid-October, said in a statement they had decided to admit holders of tickets to the 1940 event. They exchanged one of the old tickets on Monday for two Expo 2025 passes, the statement said. Local media reported that the 1940 ticket-holder was 25-year-old Fumiya Takenawa, who lives in Tokyo but was visiting his parents’ home in Osaka. Takenawa is a collector of expo-related memorabilia and in March he bought the 1940 ticket online, the Mainichi Shimbun daily and other outlets reported. They published a photograph of him smiling and holding up the old ticket, which features an elaborate red and black design. The Expo or World’s Fair, which brought the Eiffel Tower to Paris, began with London’s 1851 Crystal Palace exhibition and is now held every five years in different locations. Previous Expos in Japan – in Osaka in 1970 and in Aichi region in 2005 – have had similar policies of giving “invitation tickets” to people holding passes for the 1940 event, the Expo 2025 organisers said Monday. Takenawa was reportedly a fan of the huge white and red Tower of the Sun, the symbol of the 1970 Osaka Expo that still stands in a park in the metropolis.",

    "title": "Robert Francis Prevost becomes Pope Leo XIV as cardinals elect first US pontiff",
    "article_text": "Robert Prevost, the first US cleric to lead the Roman Catholic church, has said “evil will not prevail” as he addressed a crowd of 100,000 pilgrims and tourists in his first speech as Pope Leo XIV from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica. The stunning election on Thursday of Prevost, who is 69 years old, as the church’s 267th pontiff, ended the Vatican’s longstanding opposition to the idea of a pontiff from the US. Observers said the Chicago-born cleric’s papal name historically symbolised strength during crisis, and could be taken as a sign that he would probably follow in the footsteps ofPope Francis, who died in April aged 88. Donald Trump, who on Saturday angered Catholics by posting an AI-generated picture of himself as pope on social media, was among the first world leaders to congratulate Prevost, even though the pair looked set to clash in a similar way that the US president did with Francis. “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!” Prevost, who in his first speech called for “peace” and “to build bridges”, has previously criticised the Trump administration’s treatment of refugees and migrants, saying in a recent post that the US government did not “see the suffering” in its policies. His first words to the raucous crowd celebrating in St Peter’s Square were “peace be with you all”. “I would like peace to reach your families, all peoples, all the earth,” he said, speaking in Italian, then switching to Spanish – and saying not a word in English. “Peace be with you. A disarmed, disarming, humble peace. God loves us all, unconditionally.” Referring to the final blessing that Francis gave from the same balcony on Easter Sunday, the day before his death, Leo added: “Evil will not prevail: we are all in God’s hands … The world needs his light … Help us build bridges, with dialogue, to always be at peace.” In response to news of his election, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he hoped the Vatican would maintain “moral and spiritual support” under the new pope’s leadership. “At this decisive moment for our country, we hope for the continued moral and spiritual support of the Vatican in Ukraine’s efforts to restore justice and achieve a lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Prevost was also lauded in rather more jocular fashion by the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, who wrote on X: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.” Prevost was elected as pontiff by at least two-thirds of the 133 cardinal voters who had been locked in the Sistine Chapel on the second day of the papal conclave, after the fourth ballot. The process was completed quickly, especially given the large number of cardinals taking part in the conclave. Prevost was made a cardinal by Francis in 2023 and presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms the Argentinian pope made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope. He was former leader of the Augustinian order and was also appointed by Francis to the powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of new bishops from around the world. It is believed those senior roles, combined with Prevost’s experience in Peru, where he lived for more than 20 years, serving as bishop of the northern city of Chiclayo and becoming a Peruvian citizen, may have redeemed him in the eyes of those who would not usually countenance the idea of a US pope. In his speech to the faithful on Thursday, he mostly spoke in Italian, but switched to Spanish to address the people of his former diocese of Chiclayo. His election prompted elation in Peru, where the bells of the cathedral in capital, Lima, rang out, and president Dina Boluarte declared: “The Pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru!” Politically, he has made no secret of his distaste for the US government’s policies. In February he also shared on X an op-ed published in the National Catholic Reporter titled “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” after comments the US vice-president made in an interview on Fox News. On Thursday, Vance wrote on X: “Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election! I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!” Christine Allen, the director of the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (Cafod) charity, said Leo would be “a voice of wisdom in a fractured and divided world as he continues the important work of leading the church in the world and providing spiritual and moral guidance to the global community”. She added: “Having spent years in Peru, Pope Leo XIV brings with him the vital perspective of the global south, elevating voices from the margins to centre stage. “Now more than ever, the world needs a strong and steadfast moral voice that can draw attention to the most important issues in our world: the crippling debt crisis – a key focus of this jubilee year – which prevents low-income countries from spending on health and education for their people; the climate crisis and the conflicts blighting our world.” Eric LeCompte, the executive director of the religious development group Jubilee USA Network, who advises Vatican and Catholic church leadership said he expected Leo to “follow the path that Francis set to build a more inclusive and transparent Church”. “The selection of the name of Leo XIV is a special acknowledgment of the need to support the poor and workers,” LeCompte added. The new pontiff will have many urgent issues to address. A priority will be to strengthen the church’s unity amid differing views and expectations within the institution and growing polarisation in the wider world. The pontiff plays an important role on the international stage, aiming to ensure that religion does not become a faultline. He takes on the role amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan plus the politically divisive issues of migration, the climate crisis, religious freedom and human rights. The legacy ofsexual abuse cast a long shadowover Francis’s papacy. He was slow to grasp the scale and systemic nature of the problem, and Pope Leo XIV’s approach will inevitably also come under intense scrutiny.",

    "title": "Stockholm rejects ‘bizarre’ US letter urging city to scrap diversity initiatives",
    "article_text": "A city official in Stockholm has said the municipality has no plans to comply after one of its offices received a letter seeking to imposeDonald Trump’s rollback of diversity measures, in what is believed to be the first such missive sent to a foreign government. “It’s so bizarre,” said Jan Valeskog, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for planning. “It’s our political priorities that count, not the ones from this embassy or any other embassies.” In March, European officialslambastedthe US after companies across the continent said they had received letters informing them that the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives also applied to foreign firms looking to do business with the US government. The letter – described by French officials as “a form of interference” – asked recipients to complete, sign and return a form certifying that they “do not operate any programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion”. The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.” In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday. “We were really surprised, because diversity, equality and inclusion are values that we strive for and stand up for in Stockholm,” he said. “It’s very important for us.” He presumed the letter was sent to the planning office because it was listed as a payee, given that it charges for building permits. Still, it was the first time he had heard of one of these letters being directed at a municipality or foreign government. “It’s quite unique,” he said. After Valeskog spoke to the Swedish newspaperDagens Nyheterabout the letter, emails and social media responses came pouring in from city residents and others across Sweden. “Thousands of people are really upset,” he said. “I guess most people are following the news about what is happening in the States. But suddenly it felt closer with these demands.” For months – despite researchshowingthat companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity are more likely to significantly outperform their peers – Trump’s administrationhas opposedefforts to ensure that people of all backgrounds, including historically marginalised groups such as women and people of colour, can gain a foothold and thrive at organisations. Valeskog said Stockholm had no intention of complying. “Of course, we’ll not sign it, we won’t return it, we’ll do nothing about it,” he said. “So now it’s up to the embassy to decide what happens next.” The spate of US letters comes at a delicate moment for the transatlantic relationship, which has been left rattled by threats ofescalating tariffs,security concernsand the Signal leaks thatlaid barethe Trump administration’s disdain for Europe. On Tuesday Valeskog called on the embassy, with whom they had traditionally had a good relationship, to withdraw the letter. Two days later, there had been no reaction. “They don’t have an ambassador, maybe that’s the reason – I don’t know,” he said. After describing the fallout over the letter as “their headache, not ours” earlier in the week, he again stressed that the US embassy stood to lose much more if it decided to break off its relationship with the municipality. “The embassy now and then needs our building permits, of course, so it’s in their interest to have a good contact and cooperation with the city of Stockholm,” he said. “And so this is really strange.” He said his office would continue to wait for some sort of response from the Americans. “I mean it’s quite big news, not only inSwedenbut also in other countries,” he said. “So we’ll see what happens.”",

    "title": "Netherlands museum rethinks lending works to US amid Trump arts cuts",
    "article_text": "A leading museum in theNetherlandshas said it is reconsidering lending works from its collection to museums in the US amid the uncertainty wreaked by Donald Trump’s funding cuts and ideological impositions. Martine Gosselink, the director of the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, whose collection includes Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, said the turmoil had left her team wary of lending pieces to the US. She said the Mauritshuis had for years worked in tandem with art historians and curators across the Atlantic in a constant conversation involving loans of artwork and research collaborations. However, in recent months, as the Trump administration sought tocut fundingandtarget exhibitsit viewed as “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology”, politicians had started increasingly to creep into these conversations. US-based colleagues had expressed fears of losing their jobs or having to toe the government line, she said. “We really feel for our colleagues in American institutions about what’s happening in archives, libraries and museums,” said Gosselink. “It’s a huge catastrophe.” In March, Trump issued anexecutive ordertargeting the Smithsonian in Washington DC, accusing the world’s biggest museum, education and research complex of presenting “divisive narratives that distort our shared history”. His administration has also sought to cut funding to leading agencies that support US museums and other arts initiatives. Gosselink declined to name names but said plans had been in the works to lend pieces to specific institutions in the US. “I’m not saying we won’t do it,” she said. “But we will be extra careful and we need guarantees. Because if you lend it out to a museum and there’s not enough staff to treat it in the way you want [it] to be treated, then we wonder whether it’s a good thing to be sending our collection.” Earlier this month, a federal judgetemporarily blockedthe Trump administration from further dismantling one of the agencies that provides funding to US libraries and museums in a move the American Alliance of Museumsdescribed as“the successful first step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process”. But the threat of funding cuts continued to loom, with the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC coming underdirect attackfrom the Trump administration. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The uncertainty needed to be taken into account, said Gosselink. “How do you know for sure that the museum will still be open and working and operating during the whole period of the loan?” She said the Mauritshuis museum had not yet made any concrete decisions. “For us, it’s not a huge thing if a piece cannot travel for a couple of years,” she said. Instead, she lamented the far-reaching shock waves of funding cuts in the US. “But scientifically, you would like to discuss, to write books together, to do research together. I do wonder, of course, if these things will proceed in the way we did in the last decades,” she said.",

King Charles,Queen Camillaand thePrince and Princess of Walesare in attendance, along with UK prime ministerKeir Starmer. There are 1,800 guests in attendance at today’s service, including royals, veterans, politicians, officials, guests and other public figures. A group of 78 veterans, many wearing the medals attesting to their second world war service, attended as King Charles led the UK in a two-minute silence.In workplaces, railway stations and shops people stood, heads bowed on the stroke of noon in remembrance. Services and ceremonies were held across the UK and Europe. Inside Westminster Abbey, it was the veterans who were honoured, by a congregation of royalty, politicians and military. Some in wheelchairs, others leaning heavily on sticks, they were presented with white roses, signifying peace, handed to them by six young people.It was a reminder that as time continues to claim first-hand witnesses to the war, the younger generation will shoulder responsibility for remembrance.

She told them it was the “most important day of your life and of the world”, and urged them “enjoy yourselves, shout, scream, sing, wave flags, eat, drink, lemon or barley water, and make it a day of rejoicing”. An excerpt from Winston Churchill’s 8 May radio broadcast from the Cabinet Office ricocheted off the abbey’s stone walls. His great-great-grandson Alexander Churchill, 10, was given the honour of lighting the VE Day candle and read a prayer for “peace in Europe and across the world”.It was left to the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, in his address, to remind the congregation that those hopes of VE Day, and all the good that had come as the result of peace, would be sorely tested. Stephen Cottrell,thearchbishop of York, has warned the “good” resulting from the second world war is “under threat” asKing Charlesled theUKin commemorating the80th anniversary of VE Day. Cottrell paid tribute to “those whose sacrifice made our victory possible” againstHitler’s Nazi regime, and said he is praying again for “peace in Europe” amidRussia’s three-year invasion ofUkraine, reports the PA news agency. Scotlandfell silent to remember its wartime heroes, with a series of events taking place around the country to mark the80th anniversary of VE Day. At theScottish parliamentand at public spaces including train stations, a national two-minute silence was observed at midday.

Forwestern Europe,including theUK,VE Daylargely heralded the return of liberty and the triumph of democracy, and marked the end of Nazi aggression and occupation, the slaughter of a generation of young men, and the horrors of the Holocaust.

This year, underlining Europe’s ever-present political faultlines,the Kremlinhas saidSlovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister,Robert Fico, andAleksandar Vučić,Serbia’s ultranationalist president, will attend, despite strongEUcriticism. A counter-parade, attended by EU foreign ministers, will be held inLviv,Ukraine. Some other former east bloc states, fromBelarustoBosnia and Herzegovina, continue to mark Victory Day on 9 May. Many, however, includingPoland, theCzech Republic,Estonia,LatviaandLithuania, have switched to the eighth since regaining their independence, choosing not to mark the date they fell underSovietcontrol. Eighty years ago, Westminster Abbey opened its doors all day and late into the night for short services as about 25,000 attended to give thanks and to remember those who had made the ultimate sacrifice asVE Daymarked the end of almost six years of war in Europe. On Thursday’s anniversary it was again the focal point of UK national commemorations, with a service of thanksgiving weaving poignant reminders of war’s deprivation and loss with the hopes for the future that historic day had promised. A group of 78 veterans, many wearing the medals attesting to their second world war service, attended as King Charles led the nation in a two-minute silence. In workplaces, railway stations and shops people stood, heads bowed on the stroke of noon in remembrance of a day when services and ceremonies were held across the UK andEurope. Inside the abbey, it was the veterans who were honoured, by a congregation of royalty, politicians and military. With some in wheelchairs, others leaning heavily on sticks, they were presented with white roses, signifying peace and handed to them by six young people. It was a reminder that as time continues to claim those first-hand witnesses to the war, the younger generation will now shoulder responsibility for remembrance. Echoes of those dark days of war were woven tightly into the order of service. In a Guardianfeature on eye witnesses of the second world war, Aasa Sarnik, 85, recalled her memories as a child living through the war, in a coastal village not far from Estonia’s border with Russia. She spoke of the tyranny her country experienced immediately after the war when Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union, and would spend more than four decades under Soviet control. Maris Hellrand, the Estonian journalist who carried out the interview with Sarnik, is currently in Narva, a city on the Estonia-Russia border, which is sometimes described as the EU’s most Russian city. Standing on the bridge over the River Narva, which flows into the Baltic Sea, and on the eastern bank of which sits Russia, she just sent us this short on-the-ground report as spectators gather, preparing, she says, “for the blast of Russian propaganda tomorrow from across the river”. She tells us: I’m standing on the bridge over the border river between Estonia and Russia in Narva. I can see the castle on the Russian side. A huge stage and screens are being set up to celebrate ‘Victory Day’ tomorrow. They are still working and checking the lights. There are huge posters saying: ‘we remember’ and ‘thank you’. As a reply the castle on the Estonian side has been decorated with EU and Estonian and Ukrainian flags, and tomorrow morning, by sunrise, it’s expected that they will erect a poster stating ‘Putin: war criminal’. This same poster has been put up there for the last two years. Pedestrians are crossing the bridge, mainly coming from Russia into Estonia. The border crossing has been closed for car traffic since February 2024 last year, because of construction work on the Russian side, so only pedestrians are able to cross the border right now. The stage area next to the Russian castle, Maris explains, was only erected three years ago. Where it stands, there used to be a thick forest. She adds: It’s been constructed as a stage or platform, specifically in order to blast this propaganda across the river to Narva and Europe. I can also see some Russian border guards controlling along the path. What’s new this year is that they’ve set up two huge screens around hundred metres long each side of the bridge, increasing the space on which they can project their messages. Mariia Sinhayevska was 11 when the Germans occupied her village, near Zaporizhzhia in south-easternUkraine, then part of the Soviet Union. She can still remember some German words from the year she spent in school under occupation. The soldiers were friendly, she said, though not if you were suspected of being a Communist or a Jew. “There was a place about three kilometres away where people used to say the ground was breathing; it was where the Germans put the bodies of all the people they had shot,” she said. When the war ended, Sinhayevska trained as a welder in a Zaporizhzhia factory, and worked in various jobs until her retirement in 1980. Now, at 95, war has come again, with the frontline just half an hour away from Zaporizhzhia and regular incoming fire not far from the home where she has lived since 1954. “I hardly go out now, this war is so scary, maybe even more scary than that war,” she said. A granddaughter who lived with her until three years ago left at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, to the safety of westernEuropewith her children, leaving behind rooms filled with religious icons, teddy bears and memories. Lonely and frightened, though with the stoicism of someone for whom life has never been easy, Sinhayevska does her own cooking and cleaning, and hopes for the war to end. Here are some more images from today in theUK,FranceandGermany: Here are some images of reenactors inParis,France, pictured before a parade as part of ceremonies marking the80th anniversary of VE Day: Copenhagen, 7 May Germany’s last two seaworthy big warships, the cruisers the Prinz Eugen and the Nuremberg, are lying in the north port here with their German crews aboard, having apparently made no attempt to flee whenDenmarkwas liberated. With them are various anti-submarine craft and 54 German merchant ships aggregating some 150,000 tons. The entrance to the docks where the ships lie is still guarded by German soldiers armed with tommy guns and rifles, and in streets around the dock area German soldiers come and go pretty much as they please, brushing shoulders with British paratroops; the Germans ostentatiously ignore their ex-enemy’s presence, but the British and Danes are in a position to find the whole situation ridiculous. Meanwhile discipline in some of the German warships has suffered in a fashion reminiscent in a small way of what happened in October 1918. On the deck of a minesweeper I saw a crowd of German sailors gathered drinking, singing, and playing an accordion. When they caught sight of me they started cheering and yelling “Hullo, Tommy,” “Good old Tommy, come and have a drink.” I walked over to their ship and started to talk to them from the quayside when a petty officer appeared on deck with a tommy-gun in his hand which he pointed at me whilst ordering the men below. A small, pale, harassed-looking German naval commander had driven up to the Hotel Angleterre in a Volkswagen and announced to the hall porter and to me that he had come to discuss the surrender of the German warships with the competent British officer. No interest in shipThis officer was not in the hotel at the time, so that for a while there was to be observed the ridiculous spectacle of a German officer roaming through the corridors of the hotel from room to room trying to find someone competent to receive him. For five years the British Navy and the R.A.F. had been hunting the Prinz Eugen, and under and above the seas hundreds of lives had been lost. Now suddenly there was just no interest in the ship at all. All this business of the German crews remaining in the ships and the German troops in Denmark retaining their arms is part of a very complicated situation rising out of the fact that there are 300,000 German troops in the country and very few British to whom they can surrender. Considerations of prestige, they say, forbid them to surrender to the Danes though when they leave the country they have agreed to leave behind their heavy weapons. Neither the Danes nor the British are much interested in German ideas of prestige and have only one concern – to get the Germans put out of the country as quickly as possible. If this can be done by allowing the Germans to march out armed until they reach the British lines where the weapons can be collected they are willing to agree.

Thornton’s grandsonColin Vallance-Owenwas in the abbey to hear his grandmother’s words. He told the BBC: My grandmother wrote the letter on VE Day itself. She was away from her daughters. They were in Sherbourne, so she wrote it on VE Day. She seemed to have got the moment. She felt very very seriously that this was a very, very important day for all of us. He described Thornton, who died in 1986, as “absolutely tiny with a huge personality”, adding: “It’s a bit of history really.” UkrainianpresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas criticisedRussia, saying “victory and true remembrance are not with those who hold ‘parades’ but with those on whose side the truth is”. Russia commemoratesVE Daywith a huge military parade on 9 May, because when the ceasefire that ended the second world war came into force at 11.01pm inBerlinon 8 May 1945, it was already the following day inMoscow. In a post on X, Zelenskyy wrote on Thursday: In attempting to appropriate Ukraine, Russia is appropriating another nation’s memory and distorting history. That is why not only today, on the Day of Remembrance and Victory over nazism, but always, it is worth remembering: Ukrainians made their great contribution to that victory. They stopped a global evil with their own blood. Because more than 8 million Ukrainians fought against nazism – not only as part of the Soviet army. Tens of thousands served in the Allied armies. Hundreds of thousands fought in partisan units and resistance movements. In that war, we had no rear – all our land was one continuous frontline, a staging ground, an open wound. Every city, every village suffered. Every home and every family. And we will not surrender this memory to a new, Russian nazism – just as we will not surrender our present to it. Victory and true remembrance are not with those who hold ‘parades’ but with those on whose side the truth is. Let us honor our contribution to the fight against evil. And our present, in which we are fighting it once again. Here are some more images from today coming in via the newswires: Scotlandfell silent to remember its wartime heroes, with a series of events taking place around the country to mark the80th anniversary of VE Day. At theScottish parliamentand at public spaces including train stations, a national two-minute silence was observed at midday. Holyroodpresiding officer,Alison Johnson, said: We honour the generation that gave so much to secure our peace and freedoms. We owe it to them to strive for that peace, to remember and to encourage future generations to remember. Party leaders also marked the anniversary in a series of tributes before first minister’s questions. John Swinneypaid tribute to his uncleCpl Tom Hunterof43 Royal Marine Commando, who died on 3 April 1945 inComacchio,Italy. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for offering himself as a target toGermanguns in order to save his own troop during the battle. According to the PA news agenvy, the first minister said: I think of my uncle, Thomas Hunter, killed in Italy protecting his comrades 35 days before the end of the war. Scottish Conservative leaderRussell Findlaysaid: None of us here can truly appreciate the selfless sacrifice, duty and bravery of the greatest generation who fought and died for our freedom. Scottish Labour leaderAnas Sarwarsaid: We remember those who gave everything for the fight against fascism, the greatest tyranny we have ever faced. Scottish Green co-leaderLorna Slatersaid: “We cannot be complacent in the face of growing threats of fascism, international violence, hatred and oppression,” while Liberal Democrat leaderAlex Cole-Hamiltonadded: We must rededicate ourselves to the promise of that peace and its furtherance for our children and theirs to come. A service of thanksgiving took place atGlasgow Cathedralat 1pm, with guests including representatives from the military, veterans’ organisations, emergency services and religious groups. Members of theRoyal British Legion, theRoyal Air Forces Association, and the armed forces charity theSSAFAtook part in the service, along with their families. Stephen Cottrell,thearchbishop of York, has warned the “good” resulting from the second world war is “under threat” asKing Charlesled theUKin commemorating the80th anniversary of VE Day. Cottrell paid tribute to “those whose sacrifice made our victory possible” againstHitler’s Nazi regime, and said he is praying again for “peace in Europe” amidRussia’s three-year invasion ofUkraine, reports the PA news agency. He spoke during a service of thanksgiving to mark the80th anniversary of VE Day, with a number of veterans among theWestminster Abbeycongregation featuring the king,Queen Camilla,Prince and Princess of Walesand prime ministerKeir Starmer, who read the lesson. In his address, the Cottrell said: Today, on this 80th anniversary, we give hearty and mighty thanks for those whose sacrifice made our victory possible. We pray again for peace in Europe. We salute those who were so committed to the ideas and ideals they fought to uphold, that in the postwar era rebuilt the world to reflect those beliefs. From the National Health Service to the United Nations itself, we strove to build a world that shows how we belong to one another and have responsibilities to each other across boundaries of class, race and nation. Those first outpourings of joy on the first VE Day led to something good, because in our opposition of what was worst in us, we discovered what was best. All this good is under threat again in our world today. Europe’s major nations including the UK are planning on stepping up spending on their armed forces in response to the changing world order ushered in byUSpresidentDonald Trump.Russiais seen as a growing threat in eastern Europe and there is economic uncertainty for many nations coming to terms with the US’s new tariffs. Berlin for the first time observed a public holiday on VE Day, as Germany’s political leaders gathered in the Bundestag lower house of parliament for the central ceremony marking what many Germans call a day of “liberation” from the Nazi dictatorship. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the chamber Germany must never heed the call of extremists trying to shake off the burden of responsibility for the second world war and the Holocaust. “It was Germans that unleashed this criminal war and dragged Europe with it into the abyss,” he told the assembled guests including newly elected chancellorFriedrich Merz,who earlier laid a wreath at a memorial for victims of war. “It was Germans who committed the crimes against humanity of the Shoah. And it was Germans who were unwilling and unable to throw off the yoke of the Nazi regime.” It was the first major ceremony on VE Day in the Reichstag building,its walls still covered in graffiti left by Red Army soldiers during the Battle of Berlin, since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The ambassadors of both Russia and Belarus were barred from participating. “Tomorrow we will see the victory parades in Moscow in the name of liberators from back, supposedly justifying a war against Ukraine today,” the speaker of the Bundestag, Julia Klöckner, said. “What an abuse of history! Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol. And again girls and women fall victim to sexual violence, used as a weapon of war.” Steinmeier acknowledged the role of Soviet forces in defeating Nazi Germany, noting that at least 13 million Red Army soldiers, including Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others, lost their lives in the fight, and as many civilians. “But the liberators of Auschwitz have become new aggressors,” he said. “With the war against Ukraine, Putin left our European security order in rubble. It was the source of our hope that we had learned the lesson from the horrors of war once and for all.” King Charles, the queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales and other members of the royal family met veterans in the nave at the end of the service. William was seen placing his hand on one veteran’s shoulder as he chatted to the former serviceman who stood to speak with the prince and Kate. The princess crouched down to meet one woman, holding her hand as she chatted to the veteran, who was wearing medals and sat in her wheelchair. King Charles was seen deep in conversation with a number of veterans, bending close to speak to them.",

    "title": "EU targets US aircraft and car exports in new list of potential tariffs",
    "article_text": "The EU is considering imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in a fresh attempt to persuade Donald Trump to drop his current and proposed tariffs against the EU. If acted on they will hit Boeing hard but also include further categories of US exports including chemicals, electrical equipment including cameras, health-related products and some foods such as sweet potato and nuts. At the same time Brussels has launched a consultation with member states on potential litigation against the US over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs the US president announced last month. As the EU prepared for the possibility of a prolonged transatlantic trade war, Trumpreached an agreement with the UKand appeared to softened his position on China. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and Washington’s chief trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, aredue to meet China’s vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Switzerlandon Saturday for talks that could be the first step toward resolving the trade war between the two countries. Trump, speaking at the White House as he announced a deal with the UK, said the EU treated the US “extremely unfairly”, and claimed the trade deal between the US and UK was possible “because of Brexit”. “TheEuropean Uniontreated us extremely unfairly … and hurt themselves in doing so,” Trump said. “They very much want to make a deal. We’ll be dealing with them. We are dealing with them currently. This was separate because of Brexit in particular,” he said of the UK deal. The EU said its new list of potential tariff targets was designed as preparation for a scenario in which some or all US tariffs remained after July – Trump’s deadline for deals. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she believed there were “good deals to be made for the benefit of consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic”. But, she added, “at the same time, we continue preparing for all possibilities”. The fresh proposals came just hours beforeTrump unveiled a tariff deal with the UK, and days after the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, warned the EU would not be pushed into any unfair trade deal and was preparing “for any scenario” if current trade talks failed. They are in addition to a list of€21bn retaliatory tariffsannounced and then paused by the EU last month, including taxes on Harley-Davidsons, poultry and clothing. Boeing, the aircraft company based in Seattle, would be hit hard, but so too would Ireland, already bracing itself forpunitive tariffs on pharma exportsto the US and potential tax on US tech. The Irish budget airline Ryanair would face higher capital costs. It has placed about $30bn of orders for 330 aircraft to be delivered through to 2034. On Thursday it threatened to cancel orders and said it would look at alternative suppliers, including the Chinese plane maker Comac. Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, is also based in Dublin. If the new EU tariffs were imposed, they would come into force on the date of aircraft delivery, so would affect any advance orders, EU officials have confirmed. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion EU officials emphasised that they were not pursing a “dollar for dollar” retaliation against the current tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars, but needed to prepare for the prospect that some of Trump’s tariffs would remain in the long term. They also renewed threats to include services, which could include duties on US tech and social media companies from Microsoft to Meta. “It is still an option we have [to include services]. It could be part of the mix,” said one senior source. Brussels on Thursday launched a four-week consultation until 10 June, with a decision on the exact categories and the rate of potential tariffs to be determined “by the beginning of July”, just days before Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on his universal reciprocal 20% tariff expires. Officials emphasised they did not necessarily envisage like-for-like tariffs on sectors such as automotive, which has already been hit by a 25% Trump tariff. “We could do higher tariffs on less trade … or we can do lower tariffs on more trade, so there’s various ways to, let’s say, scoop a certain amount of water out of the lake: you can take the same amount of water out of a shallow lake as you can from a deep lake,” said an official. Previously the EU said it would pursue “smart tariffs” designed to hit where they hurt – in Republican-voting states and for products that are synonymous with America, such as bourbon. Aircraft and auto sectors are among the most valuable categories of exports in the new list, with about €10.5bn of US planes sold to EU airlines and aircraft leasing companies in 2024. The US car and car part exports to the EU were worth €12.5bn in the same year, while machinery exports were worth about €12bn. Also on Thursday’s list were electrical equipment including computer screens, cameras and jukeboxes, worth €7.2bn, and agrifood, worth €6.4bn a year.",

    "title": "Vance says US won’t intervene in India-Pakistan conflict: ‘None of our business’",
    "article_text": "JD Vancehas said that the US will not intervene in theconflictbetweenPakistanandIndia, calling fighting between the two nuclear powers “fundamentally none of our business”. The remarks came during an interview with Fox News, where the US vice-president said that the US would seek to de-escalate the conflict but could force neither side to “lay down their arms”. “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it,” Vance said during the interview. As the US could force neither side to lay down their arms, he continued, the country would “continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels”. “Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,” Vance said. “Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.” The remarks matchDonald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy of calling for a retreat from the US role as a mediator in foreign conflicts. Trump and Vance have both warned that theUnited States is willing to walk awayfrom an attempt to broker a ceasefire in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine if the two sides cannot be led to hold direct talks. India on Thursday evening said that it had thwarted missile and drone strikes launched by Pakistan in what would mark thelatest round of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. Indian missile strikes on Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday killed 31 people. India claimed that it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure”, while Pakistan denied that any terrorist groups had been operating in the areas hit by Indian missiles. As Vance signaled the US continued intent to take a diminished role in mediating conflicts abroad, secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke with leaders of both countries and called for an “immediate de-escalation” in the fighting. The Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers also flew into Delhi on Thursday. Vance, who has played a significant role in foreign policy in the new Trump administration,traveled to India last month, where he said that India could retaliate against “terrorists” in Pakistan but said the US did not want that to spiral into a broader regional conflict. “Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said, referring to a recent Islamist militant attack in Kashmir. “And we hope, frankly, thatPakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with.”",

Asif has denied Pakistan is responsible for any attack in Indian-administeredKashmir. He told the BBC: We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far. “We will not strike and then deny,” Asif said, adding that “it will be known all over the world” when Pakistan decides to attack. Here is a wrap-up of the day’s key events: Explosions were reported across the city of Jammu in Indian-administered Kashmir late on Thursday, plunging the city into a blackout.India’s military claimed it intercepted a Pakistani drone and missile attack targeting three military bases in Jammu and Udhampur in Indian-administered Kashmir, and Pathankot in India’s Punjab district.

Asif warned, however, of a “vivid and clear possibility” that Pakistan’s “confrontation will expand” with India.Earlier on Thursday he said Pakistani retaliation against Indian attacks “is increasingly becoming certain now” after both countries accused each other of launching drone attacks. Pakistan’s information minister also pushed back on reports thatPakistanattacked Indian-administered Kashmir.In a post on X on Thursday evening, Attaullah Tarar wrote: “Pakistan has not targeted any locations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, or across international border, so far. Neither has any loss been incurred by PAF.” India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, defended his nation’s recent actions and did not rule out further Indian military action.“We have always played the role of a responsible nation,” he said in a statement on Thursday. Pakistan’s military spokesperson accused India of “yet another blatant military act of aggression” in sending dozens of drones overnightover major citiesincluding Rawalpindi, where Pakistan’s military has its headquarters.Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s air defence systems had brought down 25 drones, and a confrontation with another airborne Indian device had left four Pakistani soldiers injured. India alleged that Pakistan had attempted to launch drones and missiles at 15 military targets in its north and west,including in the cities of Amritsar, Srinagar and Chandigarh.It said its air defence systems stopped all the attacks. Pakistan denied the allegations it had launched any strikes into India. A senior Pakistani security official told the Guardian that Pakistan had not yet begun its offensive retaliation against Indiafor the missile and drone attacks, but was clear that action would now be taken.“We have not fired any missiles or drone attacks inside India or any military installations,” said the official.

In a post on X on Thursday evening, Attaullah Tarar wrote: Pakistan has not targeted any locations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir, or across international border, so far.

International community may take note.” Earlier today, Pakistan’s defense minister Khawaja Asif told the BBC that Pakistan is not responsible for any attack in Indian-administeredKashmir, saying: “We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far.” Hannah Ellis-Petersen in New Delhi and Shah Meer Baloch in Islamabad: India claimed to have thwarted retaliatory missile and drone strikes launched byPakistanon Thursday evening, which attempted to hit sites in Indian-administered Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan. Residents in Jammu, in Indian-controlledKashmir, reported missiles and drones over the city and the noise of explosions, amid a city-wide blackout. The Indian army said its air defence systems had intercepted eight missiles fired byPakistanthat had attempted to target military stations in Jammu and the wider Indian-administered Kashmir region. According toIndia, there were also attempts by Pakistan to target its Pathankot airbase in Punjab, which is less than 20 miles from the volatile shared border, and it came under heavy artillery fire from Pakistan forces. Locals living in the border cities of Jaisalmer and Bikaner also reported missiles flying overhead and the sound of shelling. A statement by the Indian army said it had “neutralised” all the threats from Pakistan with missiles and drones. “No losses,” it said.

Speaking to Agence France-Presse, 50-year old Safeer Ahmad Awan in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administeredKashmir, said that his daughter was injured by shrapnel. “A missile struck the mosque nearby, and a piece of shrapnel from the blast pierced my daughter’s chest… It was only when her clothes were soaked in blood that we discovered the injury,” he said of his 15-year old daughter. Meanwhile, in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, 29-year old Madasar Choudhary said his sister saw two children killed. “She saw two children running out of her neighbour’s house and screamed for them to get back inside… But shrapnel hit the children - and they eventually died,” Choudhary said.

India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, defended his nation’s recent actions and did not rule out further Indian military action.“We have always played the role of a responsible nation,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “If anyone tries to take advantage of our patience, then they will have to be fully prepared to face action just like yesterday.” Pakistan and India accused each other of overnight drone and missile attacks,marking a stark escalation of the conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations after Indian missile strikes on Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday killed 31 people. Pakistan’s military spokesperson accused India of “yet another blatant military act of aggression” in sending dozens of drones overnightover major citiesincluding Rawalpindi, where Pakistan’s military has its headquarters. Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s air defence systems had brought down 25 drones, and a confrontation with another airborne Indian device had left four Pakistani soldiers injured. He said a civilian in the Miano area of Sindh died in an incident involving a drone. India alleged that Pakistan had attempted to launch drones and missiles at15 military targets in its north and west, including in the cities of Amritsar, Srinagar and Chandigarh.

The offensive response will come now.” The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “emphasised the need for immediate de-escalation”as he held separate calls with Pakistan’s prime minister,Shehbaz Sharif,and India’s external affairs minister,Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on Thursday. Here’s more fromPakistan’sdefence minister,Khawaja Asif,after reports of explosions in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir. Asif has denied Pakistan is responsible for any attack in Indian-administeredKashmir. He told the BBC: We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far. “We will not strike and then deny,” Asif said, adding that “it will be known all over the world” when Pakistan decides to attack. Pakistan’sdefence minister,Khawaja Asif,has warned that escalation is “imminent” as he blamedIndiafor continuing its “aggression”. Asif told Al Jazeera: I have no doubt in my mind now that escalation is imminent because of the continuation of aggression from the Indian side, both on the ground and by sending drones today all over Pakistan. Before that, they attacked us with almost 78 planes … and five planes were downed by our air force. So this has been going on for the last three to four days. “There is a very vivid and clear possibility that this confrontation will expand,” he added. As wereported,Asif said earlier on Thursday that Pakistani retaliation against Indian attacks “is increasingly becoming certain now”, adding: I will still refrain from saying it is 100%. But the situation has become very difficult. We have to respond. Here is an image from the city ofJammuin Indian-administeredKashmir, where a blackout is in place following earlier reports of explosions and sirens. The Indian armed forces said it neutralised missile and drone attacks byPakistanon military stations inJammuandUdhampurin Indian-administered Kashmir, andPathankotin India’s Punjab district. India’s defence unit said in a post on X: Military Stations of Jammu, Pathankot and Udhampur in proximity to the International Boundary, in Jammu & Kashmir targeted by Pakistan using missiles and drones. Protesters are expected to gather incentral Londonthis week to demonstrate against a potential war between India andPakistan. TheSouth Asia Solidarity Group(SASG) announced an “emergency peace demonstration” will take place in Parliament Square on Saturday to “say no to war in the region and stand in solidarity with the Kashmiri people both sides of the border bearing the brunt of the violence”. AMuslim Council of Britainspokesperson said in response to the protest announcement: Now more than ever, it’s vital that communities come together to build bridges, not barriers, and work towards a just and lasting peace in the region. The Metropolitan police said they would be engaging with organisers and would deploy officers if necessary, PA media reports. Wereported earlierthat there were reports of explosions, blackouts and sirens in the city ofJammuinIndian-administeredKashmir. Indian military sources told Reuters they suspected a Pakistani drone attack across the region, with several parts of Jammu and the surrounding towns ofAkhnoor, SambaandKathuaaffected. An Indian official told the news agency: Our army installations are under attack, it is happening in five districts of Jammu [region]. Pakistani security sources have described reports of attacks in Jammu as “fabricated, baseless and a deliberate attempt to mislead”, Geo News reports. They told the Pakistani news outlet that the claims were aimed at creating a “misleading narrative” that Pakistan is carrying out strikes inIndia. They said: These fake reports are designed to justify India’s ongoing aggression against Pakistan by creating a false pretext … There is no truth to these fabricated claims.",

    "article_text": "India claimed to have thwarted retaliatory missile and drone strikes launched byPakistanon Thursday evening, which attempted to hit sites in Indian-administered Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan.

A statement by the Indian army said it had “neutralised” all the threats from Pakistan with missiles and drones. “No losses,” it said. Thursday night’s attacks by Pakistan marked another escalation of the conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries, after Indian missile strikes on Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday killed 31 people. Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, called India’s attacks, the most extensive airstrike attack on Pakistan in decades, an“act of war”. Earlier on Thursday, Pakistan had accused India of “yet another blatant military act of aggression” after it claimed at least 25 Indian drones had been sent deep into Pakistani territory on Wednesday night, killing two civilians and injuring four soldiers. Military and government figures made it clear that Pakistan saw the drone strikes as a further “provocation” and felt compelled to retaliate. India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, warned that India would respond to any retaliatory aggression by Pakistan. “If there are military attacks on us, there should be no doubt that it will be met with a very, very firm response,” he told a visiting foreign delegation. India’s claims to have stopped all Pakistani missiles and drone attacks are likely to come as a major embarrassment to Pakistan’s military. There was no immediate official comment from the Pakistani military but state-run Pakistan Television denied reports of military strikes in Indian-controlled Kashmir, calling them “false, baseless, and fabricated”. India’s initial strikes on Wednesday were a direct retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed25 Hindu tourists and a guide. India had accused Pakistan of direct involvement in the attacks, through Islamist militant organisations it has long been accused of backing. India claimed Wednesday’s strikes targeted only “terrorist infrastructure” including training camps and homes belonging to well-known militant organisations that have been behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in India over the past two decades. It emphasised it had not hit any Pakistani military bases or equipment, and described the strikes as “measured, not escalatory, proportionate and responsible”. However, Pakistan denied that any terrorist groups had been operating in the areas hit by Indian missiles, and said the strikes had targeted only civilians. Throughout the day, the international community had made efforts to mediate between India and Pakistan and bring them back from the brink of all-out war. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he had spoken to Pakistan’s Sharif and India’s Jaishankar and urged “the need for immediate de-escalation”. The Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers flew into Delhi on Thursday. The two sides spent the day firing off escalatory allegations at each other. After Pakistan said India had “lost the plot” by sending dozens of drones into Pakistan, India alleged Pakistan had unsuccessfully attempted to launch drones and missiles at 15 military targets in its north and west, including in the cities of Amritsar, Srinagar and Chandigarh. It said its air defence systems stopped all the attacks. India’s defence ministry said it had “neutralised” the air defence system over the Pakistani city of Lahore and said: “Any attack on military targets in India will invite a suitable response.” Pakistan denied the allegations it had launched any strikes into India early on Thursday, with a military spokesperson referring to them as “phantom strikes”. Speaking to the Guardian, a senior Pakistani security official was clear that action would soon be taken. “The offensive response will come now,” he said. India’s border states of Rajasthan and Punjab were put on high alert for a reprisal attack by Pakistan, with all police leave cancelled and border security forces given shoot-on-sight orders for any suspicious activities. In Punjab, the Gurdaspur area was put under a complete blackout order on Thursday night while, in Rajasthan, schools near the border were shut, mock drills were conducted and evacuation plans were prepared. India said it had activated anti-drone systems near the border. Across both countries, flights were suspended and airports shut down. In Pakistan, all flights from Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports were suspended. More than 20 local airports across the north of India were closed until Saturday. In Pakistan’s Sindh region, which shares a border with India, a state of emergency was declared in all hospitals and health facilities, and all medical personnel and support staff leave was cancelled, according to a notice issued by the provincial health department. Tens of thousands of people living along the disputed border that divides the region of Kashmir continued to flee, as cross-border firing continued between India and Pakistan troops, leaving homes destroyed and civilians dead. Talib Hussain returned to his village of Salamabad, in Indian-administered Kashmir, on Thursday morning to find smoke still rising from the ruins of his two-storey house, destroyed by an artillery shell. His home was among several others levelled in the cross-border shelling between Indian and Pakistani troops in recent days. “I’ve lost everything,” Hussain said, staring at the devastation. “Nothing remains of my house. We live in constant fear of the next attack. We are completely helpless, with only God’s mercy to protect us.”",

A spokesperson for the tech giant directed Agence France-Presse to a company webpage outlining its policy for restricting content when governments believe material on its platforms goes “against local law”. The development, first reported by the US tech journalist Taylor Lorenz’s outlet User Magazine, comes in the wake of the worst violence between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in two decades. Both countries have exchanged heavy artillery fire along their contested frontier, after New Delhi launched deadly missile strikes on its arch-rival. At least 43 deaths were reported in the fighting, which came two weeks after New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing a deadly attack on tourists in the Indian-run side of the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir. Pakistan rejects the charge and has warned it will “avenge” those killed by Indian airstrikes. The @Muslim account is among the most followed Muslim news sources on Instagram. Khatahtbeh apologized to followers in India, adding: “When platforms and countries try to silence media, it tells us that we are doing our job in holding those in power accountable. “We will continue to document the truth and stand out firmly for justice,” he added, while calling on Meta to reinstate the account in India.

Pakistani Bollywood movie regulars Fawad Khan and Atif Aslam were also off limits in India, as well as a wide range of cricketers – including star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and retired players Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram. Rising hostilities between the south Asian neighbors have also unleashed an avalanche of online misinformation, with social media users circulating everything from deepfake videos to outdated images from unrelated conflicts, falsely linking them to the Indian strikes.

    "title": "Trump and Starmer confirm ‘breakthrough’ US-UK trade deal",
    "article_text": "The UK and US have agreed a “breakthrough” trade deal slashing some of Donald Trump’s tariffs on cars, aluminium and steel and that the prime minister said would save thousands of British jobs. Keir Starmer said it was a “fantastic, historic day” as he announced the agreement, the first by the White House since Trump announced sweeping global tariffs last month. Starmer, speaking to workers at the Jaguar Land Rover plant in Solihull, said the agreement had saved jobs in the car and steel industries that had been under threat. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the deal “takes us back from the brink and many workers will breathe easier as a result”. However critics said it had failed to address many of the high tariffs that remain in place between the two countries. John Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said: “The reality is that US tariffs on UK exports remain significantly higher than they were at the start of the year.” He said it was still unclear what would happen to industries not explicitly covered by the deal, such as pharmaceuticals. The US agreed to cut the 25% tariff rate on British steel and aluminium exports to zero. The concession will be seen as a lifeline to the steel industry, for which the US is an important export market and which has been on the verge of collapse. American tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars will also be reduced to 10%, down from the 27.5% rate Trump initially announced. The US is the main export market for British cars, worth more than £9bn last year. Washington promised to give “preferential treatment” to the UK’s pharmaceutical industry, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs, although none have been set yet, and American aerospace manufacturers will receive preferential access to high-quality UK aerospace components. A10% baseline tariffon most goods remains in place. There was relief, too, that British beef farmers will be allowed access to the US market, joining a small group of countries including Australia, while US farmers will be granted new access to the UK. Starmer said there would be no watering down of food standards with this measure, with imports of hormone-treated beef orchlorinated chicken remaining illegal. “I know people along the way were urging me to walk away, to descend in a different kind of relationship. We didn’t,” the prime minister said. “We did the hard yards. We stayed in the room. I’m really pleased to say to the workforce here and through them to the country, how important I think this deal is.” But he added it was “jobs won, not jobs done” and the UK would keep negotiating in areas including tech, where ministers want to improve cooperation with the US, and the film industry, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs. Peter Mandelson, the UK’s ambassador to the US, said a “technology partnership” would be negotiated “over the coming months”. JD Vance, the US vice-president, is expected to play a key role. The announcement was made in a choreographed phone call between Starmer and Trump, while the press gathered with the leaders on either end of the line. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, criticised the deal, claiming that the UK has been “shafted” by Trump. “When Labour negotiates, Britain loses. We cut our tariffs – America tripled theirs. Keir Starmer called this ‘historic.’ It’s not historic, we’ve just been shafted!” However Andrew Griffith, the shadow trade secretary, said the reduction in tariffs would “be welcomed by exporting businesses”. A trade group representing Detroit automakers also criticised the deal, claiming it unfairly penalises US automakers that have partnered with Canada and Mexico. In a sharply worded statement, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) said its members – including Ford, General Motors and Jeep-maker Stellantis – faced import tariffs of 25% on cars assembled in Canada and Mexico. “We are disappointed that the administration prioritised the UK ahead of our North American partners,” Blunt said. “Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts.” The final stages of negotiations were mired in chaos after UK officials scrambled to announce the deal when it became clear that Trump was ready to finalise it on Wednesday night. Industry figures were informed of it only in the early hours of Thursday. Starmer said he had “not at all” been bounced into the deal but “didn’t know the exact day” it would be completed. “I wouldn’t be having my phone call with President Trump halfway through the second half of the Arsenal v PSG game had I planned it better. That’s the way it turned out and that’s the discussion we were having late last night about how we proceeded with this deal,” he said. UK government officials said the deal was a starting point from which the two sides would keep negotiating. Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, told reporters that the UK would continue trying to reduce the 10% baseline tariff. He said the agreement did not include any concessions on thedigital services tax, online safety laws, or the NHS. Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told reporters later that negotiations about digital services tax were continuing. “The digital tax has spread like a bad virus around the world … and it basically targets American companies,” he said. The UK is the first country to strike an agreement with Trump since his announcement of global tariffs on what he called “liberation day”. That sent global stock markets plunging for days until Trump brought in a 90-day pause, which will expire in July. The US has been under pressure to strike tariff agreements to shore up its economy. For months, as economists warned Trump’s trade strategy risked triggering a recession, the president and his closest officials insisted it would set the stage for the White House to hammer out dozens of trade deals. US officials are in talks with other leading economies, including India and Japan, but agreements have yet to materialise. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said this week that talks were under way with 17 countries. In Westminster, the Liberal Democrats called for a vote on the agreement, saying it would show “complete disrespect to the public” if MPs were denied a say, especially with talks continuing and the potential for more details to emerge around contentious issues such as food safety. The US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, told reporters she hoped to expand the agreement to include all meats and that she would be visiting the UK next week to make this point, adding: “There is no industry that has been treated more unfairly than our agriculture industry.” Navarro later told reporters outside the White House that British consumers would like chicken and beef imported from the US despite the use of chlorine and hormones. He called sanitary standards a “phoney tool used to suppress what is very fine American agricultural product” and said the market should decide, adding: “We don’t believe that once [British people] taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.” Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said he welcomed reciprocal access to the US beef market, but was concerned imported American beef would be produced to a lower standard.",

    "title": "Hospitals in England reducing staff and services as part of NHS ‘financial reset’",
    "article_text": "Hospitals in England are cutting staff, closing services and planning to ration care in order to make “eye-watering” savings demanded by NHS bosses. Rehabilitation centres face being shut, talking therapies services cut and beds for end-of-life care reduced as part of efforts by England’s 215 NHS trusts to comply with a “financial reset”. Sir Jim Mackey,NHSEngland’s new chief executive, has ordered them to make unprecedented savings during 2025-26 to avoid a projected £6.6bn deficit becoming a reality. But trust bosses are warning that delivering what for some equates to 12% of their entire budget in “efficiency savings” will affect patients and waiting times. “These [savings targets] are at eye-wateringly high levels”, said Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts. “It’s going to be extremely challenging.” Trusts have to make, in some cases, deep cuts in order to stay in the black this year, despite the government having given the NHS an extra £22bn for last year and this one. A survey it conducted among trust leaders found that diabetes services for young people and hospital at-home-style “virtual wards” were among the areas of care likely to be scaled back. Trusts are planning to shrink their workforce by up to 1,500 posts each to save money, even though they fear that could damage the quality or safety of care provided. Cordery said the looming cuts were so significant that the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and health secretary, Wes Streeting, may not be able to fulfil promises to revive the NHS, such as pledges to improve waiting times for diagnostic tests, surgery and A&E care. “We’ve got the narrative of the ‘three shifts’ … and those are driving the decisions that the government is making, alongside the imminent delivery of the [NHS] 10-year plan and pressures on transforming the NHS for the future,” she said. “But we’ve got to question whether those are compatible with the needs of delivering the financial recovery and for trusts to really meet the operational challenges they face.” Ministers would have to explain to the public that trusts were having to make potentially unpopular decisions about staff numbers and what services they provided as a result of Mackey’s financial “reset”, and defend their decisions, Cordery added. “Politicians are going to have to give trusts air cover locally and nationally when they need to make some changes, because even if trusts aren’t cuttings services or closing services, they may well be moving services.” The survey of 160 senior figures from 114 trusts found that: 47% were cutting services and another 43% were considering doing so. 37% were cutting clinical posts and a further 40% may follow suit. 26% were closing some services and 55% more may do so. “These findings show that trust leaders are having to think the previously unthinkable in terms of cutting posts. These include clinical roles,” said Cordery. “We are already seeing cutbacks in temporary and ‘bank’ staff, including doctors, nurses, healthcare support workers and allied health professionals that could include physios and other types of therapists.” In a recent update to staff, the boss of the Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust in east London, Matthew Trainer, warned that making £61m of savings this year – double last year’s £30m total – would be “painful”, especially given the rising demand for care and need to improve waiting times. The trust is cutting 115 posts in corporate services to save £7.5m and slashing the number of shifts it gives “bank” and agency staff by more than a third as part of an attempt to cut its wage bill by £40m. Having fewer staff on duty could have “adverse effects on patients”, Trainer acknowledged. “We will mitigate any risks to patients as best we can and ensure we continue to have properly skilled clinical staff delivering good quality care to the patients that need it”, he said. A second trust chief executive, who has to save £16m this year, said: “At the moment I don’t know how I’m going to do it.” A third echoed Trainer’s concern that staff cuts could endanger patients. “Last year the [NHS’s] combined deficit was £200m. I recognise that this is unaffordable and cannot continue. But it’s really difficult to find a way to protect safe care to patients … and to [also] deliver the financial efficiencies.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We invested an extra £26bn to fix the broken health and care system we inherited, and through our plan for change, are determined to tackle inefficiencies and drive up productivity in the NHS. “We have underlined the need for trusts to cut bureaucracy to invest even further in the frontline, so we can support hard-working staff and deliver a better service for patients and taxpayers’ money.”",

    "title": "King calls for renewed ‘commitment to peace’ in VE Day message",
    "article_text": "King Charles called for a renewal of “global commitments to restoring a just peace where there is war, to diplomacy and to the prevention of conflict”, as the UK marked the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Westminster Abbey was the focal point for national commemorations with a service of thanksgiving weaving poignant reminders of wartime deprivation and loss with the hopes for the future that historic day had promised. Senior royalty, politicians and military personnel joined 78 second world war veterans as the king led the nation in a two-minute silence at the start of the service. Across the UK, people stood in remembrance on a day that saw ceremonies held throughout Europe. Later, speaking 80 years to the hour after his grandfather George VI’s 9pm address to the nation, Charles said the debt to those “whose firm resolve and fortitude helped destroy nazism and carry our allied nations through to VE Day” could “never truly be repaid”. Addressing the VE 80 concert in Horse Guards Parade, which brought four days of commemorations to a close, he said that as the second world war generation “sadly dwindles”, there was a duty “to carry their stories forward, to ensure their experiences are never to be forgotten”. Repeating Winston Churchill’s words that “meeting jaw to jaw is better than war”, he added we should “rededicate ourselves not only to the cause of freedom but to renewing global commitments to restoring a just peace where there is war, to diplomacy and to the prevention of conflict”. He added: “For, as my grandfather put it: ‘We shall have failed, and the blood of our dearest will have flowed in vain, if the victory which they died to win does not lead to a lasting peace, founded on justice and established in goodwill.’” Charles said: “It falls to us to protect and continue their precious legacy – so that one day hence generations yet unborn may say of us: ‘They too bequeathed a better world.’” Charles also shared a diary entry written by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the day after VE Day, which read: “Out in the crowd again. Embankment, Piccadilly. Rained, so fewer people. Conga-ed into House. Sang till 2am Bed at 3am!” He added, to laughter: “I do hope your celebrations tonight are almost as joyful, although I rather doubt I shall have the energy to sing until 2am, let alone lead you all in a giant conga from here back to Buckingham Palace!” Among veterans in the royal box was 107-year-old Harry Richardson, a bomber pilot in the war. Films of other veterans, evacuees and those working on the home front, speaking of their experiences were played. The concert included songs from the wartime era, a Dad’s Army sketch with Daniel Mays, Larry Lamb and Nigel Havers, Brian Cox as Churchill, rock bands The Darkness and Toploader, and singers Fleur East, Tom Walker and bass baritone Willard White. Filmed reminiscences came from a trio of dames in Mary Berry, Joan Collins and Sheila Hancock. Two Vera Lynn classics ended the show, with Calum Scott singing White Cliffs of Dover, and Samantha Barks with We’ll Meet Again. Earlier, inside the abbey, the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, used his address to say the hopes of VE Day and all the good that had come as the result of peace were being tested. “Those first outpourings of joy on the first VE Day led to something good, because in our opposition of what was worst in us, we discovered what was best,” he added. “All this good is under threat again in our world today.” But it was the veterans who were at the heart of the service. Some in wheelchairs, others leaning heavily on sticks, they were presented with white roses, signifying peace, handed to them by six young people. It was a reminder that as time continues to claim first-hand witnesses to the war, the younger generation will shoulder responsibility for remembrance. Echoes of the dark days of war were woven tightly into the order of service. A “procession of witness” saw wartime artefacts from the armed forces and home front carried through the abbey on velvet cushions and carefully placed on the high altar: a D-day map, a set of campaign medals, a naval ratings cap, an RAF flying helmet, an air raid warden’s helmet, a child’s gas mask and a book recording the names of all the civilians killed across the UK. Readings from wartime letters brought history alive. One was from a frontline soldier, Fredrick Burgess, to his seven-year-old son, Freddie. It was written just seven months before the lance corporal was killed in action. Another, from Janet Thornton to her teenage daughters on VE Day, urged them to remember the sacrifice and the importance of the day but also to “shout, scream, sing, wave flags, eat, drink – lemon or barley water – and make it a day of rejoicing”. Her grandson, Colin Vallance-Owens, was in the abbey to hear her words. “She felt very, very seriously that this was a very, very important day for all of us,” he told the BBC. An excerpt from Churchill’s 8 May radio broadcast from the Cabinet Office ricocheted off the abbey’s stone walls. His great-great-grandson, Alexander Churchill, 10, was given the honour of lighting the VE Day candle and read a prayer for “peace in Europe and across the world”.",

    "title": "Forgive and forget? Both sides must be accountable after a family fallout",
    "article_text": "For most families, fallouts and squabbles are a regular occurrence. But what happens when those rifts deepen to an estrangement, such as appears to have beset the royal family and the Beckhams, and how can relationships be rebuilt? According to the following psychologists and psychotherapists, family reconciliation requires both sides taking accountability for their behaviour and not letting past grievances and trauma block efforts to meaningfully re-engage with estranged relatives. Where an adult child is estranged – as in the case ofPrince Harry– parents and other relatives need to recognise whether the family narrative or culture is perpetuating this estrangement by portraying them as the troublesome rebel or outcast, say the experts. The behavioural psychologistJo Hemmingssaid the Duke of Sussex’srecent emotional interview with the BBC, in which he said there had been many disagreements with his family, some of whom would never forgive him, illustrated the importance of both sides accepting accountability for past behaviour. His comments about his family not liking him writinghis autobiography, Spare, did not appear to recognise it revealed “really private family confidences”, she said. This risked undermining Harry’s goal to reconcile with his father, King Charles, and the rest of the royal family. Susie Masterson, a Bacp-registeredpsychotherapist in Stockport, said she encouraged estranged relatives to devise a verbal contract as to how they would like to engage with one another. This included the issues they were willing to talk about, and those that were off the table to begin with. Estranged adults also needed to separate past grievances and trauma from their present desire for reconciliation, she said, and expressed concern that Harry may not have done this. “I am not dismissing the hurt and the hardship,” said Masterson. “But if we want to move towards post-traumatic growth and we want to have family members in our lives, then we have to be able to reframe or at least compartmentalise that and move towards what we want to achieve or engage with together.” Georgina Sturmer, another Bacp-registered counsellor, said it could be counter-productive for one party to seek a show of good faith from the other side, as Harry appeared to do by asking the king to intervene in his personal security provision. “I would probably be exploring with them what is the personal cost of the current situation and what would it be like for things to be different?” she said. “It’s those conversations that sometimes make us think, can I consider letting my guard down?” Nicola Saunders, another counsellor, said where an adult child was estranged it was important for relatives to understand the family dynamics that may have pushed them out. Fear among other relatives of also being ostracised could exacerbate existing family divisions, she said, such as brothers or sisters rejecting a sibling already alienated from their parents. “The family culture [can] create this narrative of ‘Yeah, that person’s lying, they’re dramatic, none of what they say is true,’” said Sturmer. “It absolutely has a ripple effect. That’s common within a family – I’ll just keep my head down and I’ll reject my sibling because the last thing I want to be is be in their position.” Parents should also be mindful if high expectations of adult children led to feelings of disappointment and contributed to the relationship breakdown, said Hemmings. Experts said the partners of estranged family members could play an important role in rebuilding bridges if they are seen as neutral in the dispute. In the case of the royal family, the Duchess of Sussex has been blamed in the media for Harry’s estrangement, and similar complaints have been reported about Brooklyn Beckham’s wife, Nicola Peltz. In such cases, the estranged family member might choose their partner over their family, which hinders the reconciliation process, said Hemmings. “The estranged person needs to have a secure person alongside them to support them in a way that is helpful rather than destructive,” Saunders added. “Sometimes there can be a lot of collusion from the partner, especially if it’s within their interest for that estrangement to be in place.” The counsellor added that maintaining reconciliation involved developing a new kind of relationship between both parties. In the case of parent-child estrangement, this meant re-engaging as equal adults. “With respect, boundaries and trust, you have to treat them like bone china because if any of them are broken then the relationship falls down again.”",

    "title": "Trump hails trade deal with ‘oldest ally’ UK – but what about the details?",
    "article_text": "There was plenty of congratulatory backslapping in the Oval Office asDonald Trumpunveiled his“major” trade deal with the United Kingdomon Thursday, but many of the details of that agreement have been left to later discussions. Trump’s rush to claim a win for his controversial tariffs policy left many grasping just what to call this: a deal, an agreement, a framework? Observers predict that the coming negotiations could take months. “Yes, we can finish ironing out some of the details, but there’s a fantastic platform here,”Keir Starmersaid by speakerphone as Trump revealed the results to journalists on Thursday. Trade deals are usually announced only once those details are ironed out. But in this case, Trump appeared keen to get the deal out in public to make an announcement to the world: America is ready to negotiate. Thursday’s announcement was most notable for Trump reversing course on his “extreme tariff policies”, said Gary Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a non-partisan thinktank based in Washington. That could increase expectations for further deals with other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia or even the European Union. “The big payoff to Trump is the market reaction today in a more favorable political reaction in the US on his overall [tariff] policy,” said Hufbauer. “Here we’re getting this pre-announcement, which is all for political purposes, both in the UK and the US, with the hope and aspiration that the details won’t kill the deal.” Lord Mandelson, the newly minted British ambassador, felt moved to paraphrase Winston Churchill in the Oval Office on Thursday. He called the deal “not the end … It’s the end of the beginning.” “There is yet more we can do in reducing tariffs and trade barriers to open up our markets to each other even more than we are agreeing to do today,” he said. Journalists in the Oval Office were more direct. “Clearly, there’s much more work still to do,” said a US correspondent for Sky News. “With respect, are you overstating the reach and significance of this deal because you’re a president who needs a result at a difficult time?” If Trump felt some of the air come out of his big announcement, he didn’t show it. “It’s a great thing that it came together,” Trump said. “Because we have many countries want to make a deal, and many countries are very unhappy that we happened to choose this one to be honest with you.” The UK was perhaps “our oldest ally”, he added. “I think it’s going to be something very special for UK and special for the United States.” Trump added it had been an “honour” working with British negotiators on the deal. US stock markets reacted enthusiastically to news of the deal. But the announcement was mainly an “agreement to negotiate”, said Hufbauer, and those negotiations could hit thorny issues such as UK restrictions on US agricultural and meat exports, as well as Trump’srecently announced tariffson foreign film shoots. “I think it’s unlikely Trump would want it to bust up, but the negotiations might go on for a while” if he pushes on sensitive issues, said Hufbauer. It appears there is the political will to move forward. During the Oval Office meeting, Mandelson said that Trump had calledKeir Starmerin a “very typical, 11th-hour intervention”. And in perhaps the highest compliment that one can pay the US president, Mandelson added that Trump drove a hard bargain, demanding “even more out of this deal than any of us expected”.",

    "article_text": "The internet exploded with humor andChicagopride on Thursday following the historic announcement that Robert Francis Prevost, a 69-year-old American clergyman from Chicago, has been named the new pope. Now known asPope Leo XIV, Prevost has become the first clergyman from the United States to lead the Roman Catholic church, ending the Vatican’s longstanding opposition to the idea of a US pontiff. Reactions quickly flooded social media platforms like X and Bluesky, with Chicagoans and Americans across the country chiming in, and sharing jokes. The Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson,celebrated the momenton social media, posting: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.” Other users asked for “photos of the new pope at the Bean” Chicago’s famous sculpture, while MSNBC’s Chris Hayeswonderedwhether the pope was a Chicago Cubs fan, as others asked if he was a White Sox fan. One Xuser joked: “In honor of Chicago’s own Pope Leo XIV, the White Sox announce the new ‘White Smoke Shake’ that will be served in a commemorative pope hat.” Another poked fun at theChicago Bears American Football team, writing: “Chicago produced a pope before a QB who throws for 4,000 yards.” Others referenced Chicago’s famous deep dish pizza, joking about the popeserving deep dish pizzaand toask whether the new pope thinks that Chicago or Rome have better pizza. “From now on, all communion wafersshall be deep dish,” one commenter wrote. Another added: “Deep dish eucharist” and another userjoked that“finally Rome will have good pizza”. A nod to the city’s notorious liqueur appeared, too, with some people asking whether the pope hadconsumed Malört, a liqueur once reserved for Chicago dive bars. “Cannot wait for holy water & wine to be replaced by Malort & Old Style,”one user wrote. There were alsoreferences to The Bear, the Emmy-winning Chicago-based drama, and to Second City, the city’s pioneering and legendary comedy club, with one userstatingthat “second City now only second to Vatican City”. Someone also jokedthat Pope Leo XIV“has probably eaten more hot dogs than all 266 previous popes combined”. A social media account associated with the New York Knicks also celebrated that the new pope was a graduate of Villanova University, writing: “What a week for Villanova graduates”with a photo of the Pope alongside images of the Knicks players Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges, who are also Villanova alums. The New York basketball teamwon the first two gamesagainst the Boston Celtics in the playoffs. Corporate accounts also joined in.

According to theHollywood Reporter, his death was confirmed by his representative who said he died “peacefully in his sleep earlier this week following a years-long struggle with brain cancer”. His career was marked by versatility, from music videos withMadonnato commercial multiplex thrillers to talky TV dramas to erotic romances. He made his directorial debut with the romantic drama Reckless in 1984, which starred Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. It was an acrimonious start to his big-screen career with the film receiving negative reviews and angering screenwriter Chris Columbus, who disowned it. He received better notices for his follow-up, crime drama At Close Range, which starred Sean Penn and Christopher Walken. In the same year, he also started working withMadonna, who was married to Penn at the time. Foley was the best man at their wedding. He directed the videos for Live to Tell, Papa Don’t Preach and True Blue as well as the 1987 screwball comedy Who’s That Girl, which starred the singer alongside Griffin Dunne. In the 1990s, he directed an episode of Twin Peaks before films such as David Mamet adaptation Glengarry Glen Ross, John Grisham drama The Chamber and Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon thriller Fear.

    "title": "Noaa to stop tracking cost of climate crisis-fueled disasters: ‘Major loss’",
    "article_text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will no longer track the cost ofclimate crisis-fueled weatherdisasters, including floods, heatwaves, wildfires and more. It is the latest example of changes to the agency and theTrump administrationlimiting federal government resources on climate change. Noaa falls under the US Department of Commerce and is tasked with daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring. It is also parent to the National Weather Service. The agency said its National Centers for Environmental Information would no longer update its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, and that its information – going as far back as 1980 – would be archived. For decades, it has tracked hundreds of major events across the country, including destructive hurricanes, hailstorms, droughts and freezes that have totaled trillions of dollars in damage. The database uniquely pulls information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) assistance data, insurance organizations, state agencies and more to estimate overall losses from individual disasters. Noaa’s communications director, Kim Doster, said in a statement that the change was “in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes”. In a separate development on Thursday, Fema’s acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton,was pushed outand replaced by another official from the Department of Homeland Security, a day after he testified on Capitol Hill that he did not agree with proposals to dismantle Fema, whichDonald Trumphasthreatenedto do. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly and severe with the climate crisis. Experts have attributed the growing intensity ofrecent debilitating heat,Hurricane Milton, the southernCalifornia wildfiresandblasts of coldto the climate crisis. Assessing the impact of weather events fueled by the planet’s warming is key as insurance premiums rise, particularly in communities more prone to flooding, storms and fires. The climate crisis haswreaked havoc on the insurance industry, and homeowners are at risk of soaring rates. One limitation is that the dataset estimated only the nation’s most costly weather events. The information is generally seen as standardized and unduplicable, given the agency’s access to non-public data, and other private databases would be more limited in scope and likely not shared as widespread for proprietary reasons. Other datasets, however, also track death estimates from these disasters. Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, pointed to substitutes from insurance brokers and the international disaster database as alternative sources of information. Still, “the Noaa database is the gold standard we use to evaluate the costs of extreme weather,” Masters said, “and it’s a major loss, since it comes at a time when we need to better understand how much climate change is increasing disaster losses.” These moves also do not “change the fact that these disasters are escalating year over year”, Kristina Dahl, the vice-president of science at non-profit climate organization Climate Central. “Extreme weather events that cause a lot of damage are one of the primary ways that the public sees that climate change is happening and is affecting people. “It’s critical that we highlight those events when they’re happening,” she added. “All of these changes will make Americans less safe in the face of climate change.” The move, reported on Thursday by CNN, is yet another of Trump’sefforts toremovereferencesto the climate crisis and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the weather from the federal government’s lexicon and documents. The presidenthas instead prioritized alliesin the polluting coal, oil and gas industries, which studies say are linked or traced to climate damage. The Trump administrationfired hundredsof weather forecasters and other federal Noaa employees on probationary status in February, part of Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” efforts to downsize the federal government workforce. It began asecond roundof more than 1,000cutsat the agency in March, more than 10% of its workforce at the time. At the time, insiders said mass firings and changes to the agency would risk lives and negatively affect the US economy. Experts also noted fewer vital weather balloon launches under Noaa would worsen US weather forecasts. More changes to the agency are expected, which could include some of those proposed in the president’s preliminary budget. The agency’s weather service also paused providing language translations of its products last month – though it resumed those translations just weeks later.",

    "title": "Federal prosecutors open criminal investigation into New York attorney general",
    "article_text": "Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation intoNew York’s attorney general,Letitia James, after theTrump administrationalleged last month in a referral that she may have falsified paperwork for properties she owns in Virginia and New York, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation marks a swift and notable escalation against James, a major political enemy ofDonald Trump, who was ordered to pay more than $450m in penalties as a result of a lawsuit brought by James’s office that accused him of inflating his net worth to secure financial benefits. In what appears to be the early stages of the FBI criminal investigation, prosecutors have impaneled a federal grand jury to hear evidence in the eastern district of Virginia after the head of the federal housing agency, William Pulte, last month made the referral to the justice department, the people said. The investigation appears to be multipronged, the people said, with involvement from the FBI inNew Yorkin addition to Virginia. The investigation appears to have gathered pace only in recent weeks with news of the grand jury filtering through Trump’s orbit in the last few days of April. The criminal referral rehashed claims touted online by Trump allies that James may have committed fraud byattesting in paperwork in 2023that she would make a house in Norfolk, Virginia, which she was helping a relative to buy, as her principal residence while she was New York’s attorney general. Whether the allegations are substantial enough to result in criminal charges remains unclear. But its existence, which has not been previously reported, regardless raises the legal stakes for James in what appears to be the first criminal inquiry into one of Trump’s foremost political adversaries. James has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated retribution. In a letter to the justice department last month, James’s lawyer argued the residency claim was a mistake and that she had told the mortgage broker the house would not be her main residence. “Director Pulte cherry-picked an August 17, 2023 power of attorney that mistakenly stated the property to be Ms James’ principal residence,” James’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote. “The broker understood this, and that Ms James was not a Virginia resident.” Spokespeople for the justice department and the federal housing finance agency declined to comment. In a statement, Lowell criticized the investigations as baseless, adding: “This appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.” Still, the allegations havegained traction in recent weeksamong Trump’s allies, who appear to see an opportunity to try to invalidate Trump’s $450m civil fraud trial verdict by challenging James’s eligibility to be the attorney general, and to advance the possibility of criminal charges. The power of attorney was signed by James in August 2023, weeks before the start of the civil fraud trial. New York state law requires public officeholders to be a resident of the state and Trump’s allies have argued when the case went to trial in October 2024, James should have been ineligible to be the attorney general. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Trump’s allies have also accused James of possibly obtaining improper financial benefits by attesting she would live in the Virginia house, therefore unlocking a lower interest rate for the mortgage because rates are lower for houses occupied by their owners. Real estate lawyers in Virginia suggested the paperwork was not likely to be an issue unless James had misrepresented her intentions with the house to a lender or insurer. James said in a separate loan application that she did not intend to live in Virginia. The criminal referral also accused James of buying a house in Brooklyn in 2001 that she characterized as a five-unit property with a loan that was only available for homes with four units, in order to receive better interest rates. The referral referenced a January 2001 certificate of occupancy that said the house had five units. In the letter back to the justice department, Lowell said the house had four floors, had been used by James as four units, and numerous other New York City records listed the building as four units.",

    "article_text": "Americans are celebrating and speaking out after the US cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who will be known as Pope Leo XIV, wasannounced as the next pope. “Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!” Donald Trumpwroteon Truth Social shortly after the pope, who was born in Chicago, appeared on the Vatican balcony in Rome on Thursday. JD Vance, the US vice-president, congratulated the pope andsaidhe was “sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!” The Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson,saidon X about Prevost’s appointment: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.” Illinois’s governor, JB Pritzker, called this pope’s appointment “a historic moment as we witness the first American leading the Catholic Church”. “Hailing from Chicago, Pope Leo XIV ushers in a new chapter that I join those in our state welcoming in at a time when we need compassion, unity, and peace,” hesaid. Meanwhile, at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Academy on Chicago’s North Side, screams of “Habemuspapam!” echoed throughout the cafeteria. Seventh-grader Vincent Wall and eighth-grader Ava Broz were in the cafeteria where students were waving US and Chicago flags. “It really feels like a 2016 Cubs World series,” said Wall, referring to the North Side baseball team that endured a long drought before a triumphant victory in 2016. “It’s just, like, a pope from Chicago is just global and so is the World Series. It’s crazy.” Allison Foerster, who teaches Spanish and religion at the school, found out the pope’s identity while monitoring recess. Earlier this week, she had students take part in a mock conclave, with younger students playing cardinals. “For our students now, they’re connecting it back to what they saw on Tuesday,” Foerster said. “They immediately knew what part of the process it was. So they knew it was a moment of joy and a moment of celebration.” For Broz and Wall, they are also hoping Pope Leo make a visit to his home town. “I feel like we’ll have a connection because we know what Chicago is, like what they strive to do and what their understanding of life is, and I feel like he’ll incorporate that as pope,” Broz said. The president of Villanova University, where the new pope graduated in 1977, the Rev Peter M Donohue,saidin a statement: “We celebrate this significant day for our University community and the global Church. Villanova, built on the teachings of St Augustine, has always been grounded in advancing a deeper understanding of the fundamental relationship between faith and reason – between spirituality and wisdom. “With today’s election of His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world. Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV’s leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.” Back on social media, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, who is a conservative Catholic, said in a statement: “The United States looks forward to deepening our enduring relationship with the Holy See with the first American pontiff.” The US embassy to the Holy See alsolaudedthe new pope on X: “With joy we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the first Pope from the United States of America.” The archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement on behalf of Archbishop Edward J Weisenburger toWXYZ, reading in part: “Pope Leo XIV’s election leaves me exceptionally joyful, and I must humbly acknowledge that I did not anticipate a United States citizen would be elected Pope. His lifetime of ministry includes many years of ministry as a bishop in Peru, giving him a thorough understanding of South America. Moreover, his close association with Pope Francis, history of charitable efforts for the poor and marginalized, extensive prior experience in the Vatican, and personal humility are all qualities that perhaps focused the light of Christ upon him for his brother Cardinals to see.” The official House Republicans account on X, which pointed out that the new pope is both “a native of Chicago, Illinois”, and the “first American Pope”,wrote: “May God bless you, and may He guide you.” Joaquin Castro, a Texas representative,calledPope Leo XIV “a Pope reflective of the late Pope Francis’ creed to be choose [sic] light over darkness, to be kind to our neighbor, and to work to uplift and unify all people in a divided world” on X. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul,posted on X: “The prayers of millions of Catholics around the globe are with you to guide the church forward and be a strong champion for compassion and dignity.” Around the world, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Ukraine deeply values the Holy See’s consistent position in upholding international law, condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, and protecting the rights of innocent civilians” in astatementon X. “At this decisive moment for our country, we hope for the continued moral and spiritual support of theVaticanin Ukraine’s efforts to restore justice and achieve a lasting peace,” he continued.",

    "title": "Who is Pope Leo XIV, the first US pontiff?",
    "article_text": "The white smoke has billowed, and the Catholic church has anew pope– and he’s American. Cardinals at the Vatican elected the Chicago-born Robert Prevost on Thursday to lead the church, succeedingPope Francis, who died last month. Prevost took the name Leo XIV as he became the first pontiff from the United States. “Peace be with you,” were his first words as pope. Here is a look at the new pope and his journey from the US Midwest to the top of the church of 1.4 billion people. Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of French, Italian and Spanish descent, Leo’s father was a school principal and his mother had degrees in library science and education and was deeply involved in the St Mary of the Assumption that the family attended. Last week, theChicago Sun-Timescited Leo’s friends and fellow church goers as saying that he was dedicated to his faith and path to priesthood from a young age. Leo graduated with a degree in mathematics from the University of Villanova in Pennsylvania in 1977. He also studied religion at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago. In 1982, he received a doctorate in church law from the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas in Rome before being sent to serve in a Catholic mission in Peru. In the subsequent decades, he rose through the ranks of the church as he bounced between Chicago and Peru. Pope Francis made him the Bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2015 before giving him greater responsibilities within the church. That same year, Prevost also became a Peruvian citizen. In 2023, he became prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, a key Catholic administrative body, based in Rome. In his first public remarks as pope, Leo introduced himself as an Augustinian – an order within the Catholic Church that follows the teachings of St Augustine of Hippo, which emphasise love, harmony, humility and dedication to the spiritual community of the church. The term also describes individuals who belong to religious orders, and Pope Leo is just one of 34 popes out of 266 to have done so. Such orders are a community of Catholics, which can include priests, nuns, monks and or lay people, dedicated to a particular type of mission and spirituality. Pope Francis was the first pope from the Jesuit religious order ever, and the first in more than a century and a half to come from any religious order. Leo suggested that he would follow in Francis’s footsteps. The late pope was largely seen as a transformational figure who took the church in a progressive direction and focused on promoting the rights of the poor and marginalised. “Let us keep in our ears the weak but always brave voice of Pope Francis, who blessed Rome – the pope who blessed Rome and the world that day on the morning of Easter,” Leo said. In his finalEaster message, days before he died, Francis called for peace and disarmament. When it comes to popes, names matter. New pontiffs often choose new names as tribute to a saint or predecessor. For example,Pope Francistook the name of St Francis of Assisi, who renounced material goods and dedicated his life to the poor. The last Leo to lead the church, Pope Leo XIII, championed the rights of workers. “Up until that time, the church’s hierarchy tended to be identified with the upper class, and so Leo XIII put a redirection on the church, and certainly many of the popes since that time have built on that,” Father James Bretzke, professor of theology at John Carroll University, told Al Jazeera. Church leaders are not politicians, but religion is intertwined with public affairs. Leo has given hints of his politics over the years, particularly in advocating for the rights of migrants. In 2015, Leo shared an article by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, criticising then-candidate Donald Trump’s anti-immigration proposals. The column was titled: Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic. In February, he again appeared to criticise the Trump administration’s immigration policies, taking aim at Vice PresidentJD Vance’sargument that people should love others close to them more than strangers. Leo shared an article proclaiming: “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.” The debate over allowing women to be priests has been raging within the Catholic Church, but Leo does not seem to be in favour of the change. “Something that needs to be said also is that ordaining women – and there’s been some women that have said this, interestingly enough – ‘clericalising women’ doesn’t necessarily solve a problem, it might make a new problem,” he told reporters in 2023. Leo’s Augustinian Order has faced criticism over transparency in dealing with sex abuse cases that have rocked the church. In 2023, Leo called for focusing on the victims when it comes to this issue. “There are places where good work has already been done for years, and the rules are being put into practice. At the same time, I believe that there is still much to learn,” he told Vatican News in 2023. “I am talking about the urgency and responsibility of accompanying victims.” At 69, Leo is younger than his past two predecessors when they became pontiffs. Francis was 76. Benedict XVI was 78. But he is older than John Paul II, who was 58 when he became pope – one of the youngest pontiffs in modern history. He likes tennis, spending time with friends and “meeting a broad range of different people”. “I consider myself quite the amateur tennis player. Since leaving Peru, I have had few occasions to practise, so I am looking forward to getting back on the court,” he told the Augustinian Orderwebsitein 2023.",

    "title": "Student protester Mohsen Mahdawi unveils legal defence fund for immigrants",
    "article_text": "Student protest leader Mohsen Mahdawi has appeared at the Vermont state house to help launch a legal defence fund to help immigrants like himself who are facing deportation hearings. His appearance on Thursday comes nearly a week after Mahdawi himselfwas releasedfrom immigration detention, after spending nearly16 days in custodyfor his pro-Palestinian advocacy. The administration of President Donald Trump has sought to deport Mahdawi and other student activists for their demonstrations, citing a Cold War-era law that allows the removal of foreign nationals deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. Though released on bail, Mahdawi continues to face deportation proceedings. He reflected on his time behind bars at a news conference where he and state officials announced the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund. “ I was unjustly kidnapped or detained, if you want to go by the legal term,” Mahdawi said with a wry smile. “And without the support and the love that I received from the people of Vermont – Vermonters and the representatives of the people in Vermont – I may not have been here today among you.” Mahdawi entered the national spotlight as a leader in the student protests at Columbia University, an Ivy League school in New York City that has been at the forefront of pro-Palestinian advocacy. A legal permanent resident of the US, Mahdawi himself is Palestinian and grew up in the Far’a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. He has publicly described the oppression he said he experienced there, including the deaths of family members and friends at the hands of the Israeli military. Since Israel launched its war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, Mahdawi has been outspoken in his opposition to the military campaign. As an undergraduate at Columbia, he helped found student groups like Dar: The Palestinian Student Society and Columbia University Apartheid Divest. The latter has taken a lead role in protesting ties between the school and organisations involved with Israel and its military activities. But President Trump has described such protests as “illegal” and pledged to crack down on non-citizen participants. On March 8, Mahdawi’s colleague at Dar, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first student protester to be taken into custody for his role in the nationwide student protest movement. Others have since been detained, including Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, who supporters say did little more than write an op-ed about the war in Gaza. Just over a month later, on April 14, Mahdawi arrived at an appointment in Colchester, Vermont, ostensibly for his US citizenship application. Immigration officers, however, were waiting on site to arrest him, and he was led away in handcuffs. Mahdawi was accused of no crime. The Trump administration, however, has accused him of harassing Jewish students and leading “pro-Hamas protests”, though it has not offered evidence to support those allegations. “His rhetoric on the war in Israel proves his terrorist sympathies,” a recentdocumentfrom the Department of Homeland Security said. Mahdawi’s detention galvanised Vermont politicians on both sides of the political spectrum. Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, called on the federal government to release any evidence it had that Mahdawi was a threat to national security and denounced the surreptitious manner of his arrest. “What cannot be justified is how this action was undertaken. Law enforcement officers in this country should not operate in the shadows or hide behind masks,” Scott wrote in apress release. “The power of the executive branch of the federal government is immense, but it is not infinite, and it is not absolute.” Meanwhile, Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat, visited Mahdawi behind bars at Vermont’s Northwest State Correctional Facility in an effort to raise awareness about his case. Ultimately, on April 30, a federal district court deemed that Mahdawi was no flight risk and released him on bail, warning that the government’s actions could be interpreted as an attempt to “shut down debate”. In his public appearance on Thursday, Mahdawi thanked his fellow Vermonters for showing him support and called on the state to act as an example to others. “Home is where you feel safe and loved. And those who surround you, they are your people, and you are my people,” he told the crowd. “This is a message of hope and light that our humanity is much larger than what divide us. Our humanity is much larger than unjust laws. Our humanity is much larger than being Democrat or Republican, Black or white, in a city or in rural area.” Mahdawi also described how, when he was in detention, he saw an undocumented farm worker praying on his knees each night before going to sleep. “ I think his prayers have been answered today by this initiative,” Mahdawi said of the legal defence fund. The fund’s organisers said they hope to raise $1m to “build a lasting safety net” for immigrant families in Vermont. That sum, they said, would fund training and hiring legal staff to respond to what they described as an immigration “crisis”. “Vermont is going to take action to ensure no one faces deportation, detention or family separation alone and unrepresented,” said State Senator Kesha Ram Hinsdale. “This will be embedded in our civic infrastructure in a way we have not achieved before and we hope will have long-term benefits beyond this immediate crisis.” Vermont State Treasurer Mike Pieciak added that the fund would ensure justice is not solely reserved for those who can afford it. “This effort is not about politics. This effort is about principle,” he said. “The fundamental right to due process means very little if somebody cannot access legal representation, especially when they’re navigating a system as complex and as high stakes as the US immigration law.”",

    "title": "Man Utd beat Athletic Club to set up Europa League final with Tottenham",
    "article_text": "Manchester United produced a dramatic late comeback to beat Athletic Club 4-1 in the Europa League andcomplete an emphatic 7-1 aggregate semifinal victory, setting up a mouthwatering showpiece against Tottenham. Fireworks crackled and red smoke filled an expectant Old Trafford on Thursday following an impressive 3-0 win against 10-man Athletic in northern Spain last week. But the air of excitement was tinged by the knowledge that Ruben Amorim’s United have shown a startling ability to implode during a horrendous Premier League season. Perhaps, little to anyone’s surprise, Amorim’s United, much like most of the club’s teams that preceded him, had to do it the hard way. Trailing with 18 minutes to play, the substitutes were thrown on – including Mason Mount, who produced two brilliant goals to illuminate the Theatre of Dreams and turn the game on the night. Amorim reverted to the team that started in the first leg, making eight changes following Sunday’s 4-3 defeat against Brentford. Dani Vivian was suspended after his red card last week, and coach Ernesto Valverde was also hamstrung by the absence of brothers Nico and Inaki Williams, as well as top-scorer Oihan Sancet. Mikel Jauregizar silenced the home fans and gave the visitors hope on the night with a stunning strike in the 31st minute. For long periods of the match, the visitors looked more dangerous, and the game needed substitute Mount to settle the home supporters’ nerves with his 72nd-minute strike. The match totally changed complexion as Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and Mount again scored. It means United have kept alive their hopes of eking something out of a terrible season. Winning Europe’s second-tier club trophy crucially guarantees a place in the Champions League, which would boost United’s chances of attracting top talent as Amorim attempts a monumental rebuild. United were heavy favourites to complete the job on home turf, but injury-hit Athletic nursed a grievance after defender Vivian was sent off in Spain. They enjoyed the bulk of the early possession but struggled to fashion clear-cut chances and looked nervous when the visitors attacked. Athletic midfielder Alex Berenguer had a good early opportunity after the home side failed to clear, but his curling shot sailed over the bar as he aimed for the top corner. The midfielder created another chance after a surging run midway through the half, but fired wide of Andre Onana’s post from just outside the area. But the visitors broke the deadlock in sensational style after half an hour to give themselves hope when Jauregizar picked his spot from outside the box and curled past Onana. The goal came after some sloppy work from United’s defence. Harry Maguire played a ball across the box and Alvaro Djalo smashed a shot against Leny Yoro. The ball fell to Jauregizar, who could not have hit the ball more sweetly. United struggled for attacking rhythm but should have been level shortly before half-time. The stadium held its breath as Alejandro Garnacho was put through by the lively Patrick Dorgu, but his attempted dink over the goalkeeper went wide. United offered little going forward in the early stages of the second half as Athletic made the running, forcing United to hack clear on multiple occasions. Both teams made a triple change just after the hour mark. Shortly afterwards, Unai Gomez headed the ball across the goal and it bounced just wide of the post. Injury-hit Mount has been a peripheral figure in his two seasons at Old Trafford, but produced a fine finish, swivelling and curling the ball into the far corner for his first. Casemiro scored a second with his head from a Bruno Fernandes cross as United’s earlier nerves were completely forgotten. Hojlund poked home in the 85th minute before Mount scored an outrageous second from near the halfway line after Athletic goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala came out of his box and made a poor clearance. United will face Tottenham in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",

    "article_text": "The announcement that US Cardinal Robert Prevost has been namedPope Leo XIVhas caused excitement tinged with hope around the world, with leaders from numerous countries offering their congratulations. The elevation of Prevost, the first person from the United States to ascend to the highest position in the Catholic Church, has also sparked discussion about what his tenure could mean for the church’s leadership on a host of issues, among them immigration, war, poverty and inequality. The new pope has previously posted social media criticisms of US Vice President JD Vance. JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for othershttps://t.co/hDKPKuMXmuvia@NCRonline — Robert Prevost (@drprevost)February 3, 2025 The late Pope Francis, in his final hours, had met Vance, and is said to have chastised him on the administration’s efforts against migrants and the poor. Pope Francis was also a staunch advocate for Palestinians and kept in regular contact with Catholics in Gaza amid Israel’s assault. Pope Leo XIV has not said much publicly about Gaza, making it unclear if he will emulate his predecessor. Gaza’s tiny Christian community told Reuters news agency that they were happy about the election of the new pope, adding they were also confident he would give importance to the war-ravaged enclave like Francis did. Here are a few of the reactions that world leaders have offered so far: President Javier Milei: “The forces of Heaven have clearly given their verdict. No more words, Mr. Judge. End.” President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva: “I would like to greet the American Cardinal Robert Prevost, chosen today to lead the destiny of the Catholic Church, with the name of Leo XIV. I hope he continues the legacy of Pope Francis, whose main virtues were the incessant search for peace and social justice, the defense of the environment, dialogue with all peoples and all religions, and respect for the diversity of human beings. We do not need wars, hatred and intolerance. We need more solidarity and more humanism. We need love for our neighbor, which is the basis of Christ’s teachings. May Pope Leo XIV bless us and inspire us in our ongoing quest to build a better and more just world.” President Gustavo Petro: “The new Pope, Leo XIV, is more than just an American. His immediate ancestors are Latin: Spanish and French, and he lived for forty years in our Latin America, in Peru. I hope he becomes a great leader for migrant peoples around the world, and I hope he encourages our Latin American migrant brothers and sisters, humiliated today in the U.S. It’s time for them to organize. May it help us build the great force of humanity that defends life and defeats the greed that has caused the climate crisis and the extinction of all living things. Chicago is the great working-class and progressive city of the United States. I feel hopeful.” President Emmanuel Macron: “A historic moment for the Catholic Church and its millions of faithful. To Pope Leo XIV, and to all Catholics in France and around the world, I extend a message of fraternity. On this May 8th, may this new pontificate be one of peace and hope.” Prime Minister Viktor Orban: “We have a pope! There is hope!” Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni: “I extend my most sincere wishes to Pope Leo XIV for the beginning of his pontificate. In a time marked by conflict and unrest, his words from the Loggia delle Benedizioni are a powerful call for peace, brotherhood and responsibility. A spiritual legacy that follows the path traced by Pope Francis, and that Italy looks at with respect and hope.” President Joseph Aoun: “We pray to God to grant him health, well-being, and wisdom to lead the Church during this important phase of its history.” President Claudia Sheinbaum: “We congratulate His Holiness Leo XIV, elected by the College of Cardinals as Head of Vatican City State and spiritual leader of the Catholic Church. I reaffirm our humanist convergence for world peace and prosperity.” President Dina Boluarte: “President Dina Boluarte, on behalf of the Government and people of Peru, fraternally greets His Holiness Leo XIV, the new Pope of the Catholic Church. His election fills our nation, which was his home, his mission and his faith, with pride and hope. May his pontificate be a guide of peace, justice and love for the world.” In a statement, the Qatari Diwan said the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, had sent a “cable of congratulations” to Pope Leo. President Vladimir Putin: “Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on your election as Pope. I am confident that the constructive dialogue and cooperation established between Russia and the Vatican will continue to develop on the basis of the Christian values that unite us. I wish you, Your Holiness, success in fulfilling the high mission entrusted to you, as well as good health and well-being.” President Cyril Ramaphosa: “The election of Pope Leo XIV is a profound moment for the Catholic Church as well as the global community who followed this solemn event with hopeful anticipation. May the ceremonial white smoke that signalled the consensus of the Conclave prevail over the dark plumes of military bombardments affecting various regions of the world today. Pope Leo XIV’s early emphasis on peace is a call that resonates with most of humanity and is one that honours the legacy of the late Pope Francis. South Africa wishes Pope Leo XIV a blessed and transformative papacy that will strengthen faith, unity and social solidarity in the world.” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez: “Congratulations to the whole Catholic Church on the election of the new Pope Leo XIV. May his pontificate contribute to strengthening dialogue and the defense of human rights in a world in need of hope and unity.” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: “In this decisive moment for our country, we hope for further moral and spiritual support from the Vatican for Ukraine’s efforts aimed at restoring justice and achieving a lasting peace.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer: “The election of Pope Leo XIV is a deeply profound moment of joy for Catholics in the United Kingdom and around globally, and begins a new chapter for the leadership of the church and in the world. Pope Leo is the first American Pope. This is a momentous moment. As Pope Francis’ papacy showed, the Holy See has a special role to play in bringing people and nations together to address the major issues of our time; especially on climate change, alleviating poverty and promoting peace and justice across the world.” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: “I extend my heartfelt congratulations to His Holiness Pope Leo XIV and Catholics around the world. The election of a new Pope is a moment of profound spiritual significance for millions of faithful around the world, and it comes at a time of great global challenges. Our world is in need of the strongest voices for peace, social justice, human dignity and compassion. I look forward to building on the long legacy of cooperation between the United Nations and the Holy See – nurtured most recently by Pope Francis – to advance solidarity, foster reconciliation, and build a just and sustainable world for all. It is rooted in the first words of Pope Leo. Despite the rich diversity of backgrounds and beliefs, people everywhere share a common goal: May peace be with all the world.” President Donald Trump: “Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!” Vice President JD Vance: “Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election! I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!” Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, US, Prevost’s place of birth: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.”",

    "title": "Inside Muridke: Did India hit a ‘terror base’ or a mosque?",
    "article_text": "Muridke, Pakistan– The roof of the building sagged dangerously, sunlight peeked through a hole, while the ground below was littered with debris, and the doors of the rooms had been blown in by the blast. This was India’s message to Pakistan, the outcome of one of a series of missile strikes launched in the early hours of May 7 as retribution for thedeadly attack on touristsin Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, on April 22, in which 26 people were killed. India blamed Pakistan for that attack, but Islamabad has denied any involvement. The Indian strike on Muridke was a part ofOperation Sindoor, the most expansive set of aerial attacks on Pakistan outside the four wars that the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought. And of all the sites targeted by India, it wasparticularly significant. Muridke has long been believed to be home to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) armed group, which India and other countries have blamed for carrying out deadly attacks on Indian soil, including the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai. But while Indian security officials and the country’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri insisted on Wednesday that they struck “terrorist infrastructure” and that Indian missiles only hit armed groups, Pakistan has said that 31 civilians, including at least two children, were killed. In Muridke, hours after the missile strike, the low-hanging roof belonged to the administrative block of a large compound called the Government Health and Educational Complex. The compound houses a hospital, two schools, a hostel, and a large seminary, with more than 3,000 students studying at various institutions, including the seminary. The compound also included 80 residences, homes to approximately 300 people, most of whom are government employees. On Wednesday, the administrative block was struck, as was a mosque separated by a large veranda. Three men, all between the ages of 20 and 30 and part of the clerical staff, died in the attack, and one person was injured. A rescue official at the site told Al Jazeera he had arrived within half an hour of the attack. “I was the one who discovered the first body,” he said, pointing to a room inside the administration block. A small city of just more than 250,000 people, Muridke is four hours away from Islamabad, and located roughly 30km (18 miles) from Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, which borders India. Tauseef Hasan, a government official, told Al Jazeera that Muridke was the first location struck by Indian missiles that night. “It was just a few minutes after midnight when I heard two massive booms, within two minutes. We had already been preparing for this, and I knew exactly what had happened,” Hasan said in a matter-of-fact tone. Across the veranda stood the mosque, Jamia Ummul Qurah, with a large prayer hall where part of the roof had collapsed. Two gaping holes in the ceiling marked the spots where missiles had struck. Hasan and his colleague Usman Jalees said that after the Pahalgam attack two weeks earlier, Pakistani authorities had assessed the risk of an attack on Muridke, given the rhetoric against the town and compound, which India has long argued was the headquarters of the LeT. “We had been informed that Muridke could be a target, and that is why we had instructed the staff and residents of the compound to vacate and leave the place,” Jalees told Al Jazeera, adding that those killed were part of the skeleton staff who had remained behind. On one side of the veranda, a large table displayed pieces of the missile that had struck the buildings. The smell of explosives and residual heat still clung to the metal fragments. While both Hasan and Jalees insisted that the seminary and educational institutions were fully under state control, the compound’s origins tell a more complex story. The compound was founded in 1988 by Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), a charity organisation widely considered to be a front for the LeT. The compound’s seminary, Jamia Dawa Islami, was also named after the group. India accuses Saeed and the LeT of orchestrating several attacks on its territory, most notably the 2008 Mumbai attacks that left more than 160 people dead over several days. Abid Hussain, a 51-year-old religious scholar who lives on the compound, vehemently denied Indian claims that the area served as a “training facility” or “headquarters of any terrorist outfit.” “This compound has always been an educational centre for children, both boys and girls. I have been teaching here myself, having lived here for the past three decades,” the short, stocky man with a forked beard told Al Jazeera. The religious teacher went on to challenge accusations that the area was used for training fighters. “If we have grounds and facilities to give opportunities to our students to learn swimming, or horse-riding, or physical training, how does this imply this is training the terrorists?” he asked. The Pakistani government took over the facility from the JuD in 2019, at a time when the country was under international pressure to crack down on Saeed and the LeT or be placed on a “grey list” of countries deemed as not doing enough to stop financing for banned armed groups. Behind the mosque is a street where two houses had been completely destroyed. Solar panels and broken bricks were strewn everywhere. Recalling the night of the attack, a resident, Ali Zafar, pointed to his residence behind one of the demolished buildings. He said the blast could be heard at least seven kilometres (four miles) away, near the house of a relative where he had moved with his family. “A few days ago, the authorities told us to vacate the place, so we had moved outside the complex. It was certain that India would attack this area, as their media kept highlighting Muridke,” said Zafar, bearded and wearing glasses. Hasan, the government official, said that, while the seminary and schools had closed for the academic year, the entire facility was under strict government supervision. “Once the government took over the administration of the institute in 2019, we have ensured that the curriculum and teaching is completely supervised,” he said. Hussain, the religious teacher, added that Saeed had stopped coming to the compound since the government took control. “He used to be a regular back in the late ’90s and early 2000s,” he said. Saeed, now in his late 70s, was arrested in 2019 and is currently serving a 31-year sentence handed down by a Pakistani court in 2022 in two “terror financing” cases. He was already serving a separate 15-year sentence, imposed in 2020, on similar charges.",

    "title": "Documentary sheds light on Biden’s reactions to Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing",
    "article_text": "A documentary film has shed new light on how the administration of United States President Joe Biden responded to the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, suggesting Washington had evidence indicating her shooting death was likely intentional. An Israeli sniper fatally shot Abu Akleh nearly three years ago while she reported from the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on May 11, 2022. The new film — a 40-minute investigative documentary from the Washington, DC-based media companyZeteo— was released on Thursday just ahead of the anniversary of her death. Under the title Who Killed Shireen?, the documentary explores not only who pulled the trigger but why justice has been so elusive in Abu Akleh’s case. It also offers the clearest picture yet of the Biden administration’s political manoeuvring as public pressure mounted for accountability. Abu Akleh was a US citizen, and during her final reporting assignment, she wore both a helmet and a blue vest clearly labelled with the word “press” to indicate her status as a journalist. In the aftermath of her killing, the Biden administration faced pressure to investigate the circumstances of her death and whether the shooting was intentional. But while the administration initially called for an “independent, credible investigation”, itshiftedits stance as the months progressed. It walked back calls for the killer to be “prosecuted” and eventually described the shooting as “the result of tragic circumstances”. It also eased its scrutiny of the Israeli military, calling for accountability only in the form of a review of its “rules of engagement”. The documentary Who Killed Shireen? features interviews from former Washington insiders about why the Biden administration made such a pivot. Its most damaging testimony comes from an anonymous official, who spoke with his face and voice obscured. In the film, the official claims the evidence available to the Biden administration indicated that Abu Akleh’s death “was an intentional killing”. He said that assessment was based on the “visual capabilities of that day” and the distance between the Israeli snipers and the journalists who were shot. Another journalist, Ali al-Samoudi, was also wounded at the same time as Abu Akleh, though he survived his gunshot. “Whether or not they knew it was her [Abu Akleh] or not can very well be debated, but they would have absolutely known it was a media person or a noncombatant at a minimum that [the Israeli soldier] shot and killed,” the anonymous Biden official said. He added that it was his “belief” that the shooter would have been able to see Abu Akleh’s blue “press” jacket. The official acknowledged the shift in the Biden administration’s position, from viewing the shooting as “an intentional killing” to describing it as “a tragic accident”. He linked that about-face to the historically close ties the US has shared with Israel. “Ultimately, I think what it came down to was different pressure within the administration to not try to anger the government of Israel too much, by trying to force their hand at saying they intentionally killed a US citizen,” the official said. Another former US official, Andrew Miller, also spoke to filmmakers as part of the documentary. Miller served as the deputy secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs from 2022 to 2024, and heindicated that the Biden administration had not been forthcoming about the stonewalling it faced from the Israeli government. He said the government of then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett refused to allow the US access to the soldier who fired the fatal shot, even for “informal” questioning. Miller also cast doubt on Israeli claims that Abu Akleh was shot during a crossfire with Palestinian fighters. He explained that the Biden administration had information from the start that contradicted those claims. “The fact that the official Israeli position remains that this was a case of crossfire … [that] the entire episode was a mistake — as opposed to potentially a mistake in identification or the deliberate targeting of this individual — points to, I think, a broader policy of seeking to manage the narrative,” Miller said. The Biden administration had never publicly contradicted Israel’s assessment. Instead, when the Israeli military released its final report on the killing in September 2022, it said it “welcomed” the assessment. That report asserted that Abu Akleh was “accidentally hit” by an Israeli bullet “during an exchange of fire in which life-risking, widespread and indiscriminate shots were fired toward” Israeli soldiers. To date, the US government has neverdeclassifieda State Department report on the killing or confirmed media reports that the Department of Justice was conducting a separate probe. Rights groups, press freedom organisations, and lawmakers have long called the Biden administration’s response inadequate, appealing for greater transparency and for the US to withhold aid to the military unit responsible. Advocates said the latest revelations underscore a continued cycle of impunity. “The US government has acted as an accomplice to Israeli war crimes, not only against Palestinians but Americans, too, trumping loyalty to its own laws and citizens,” said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the human rights organisation Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), in a statement responding to the documentary.",

But many of them are facing mountains of debt. Africa’s external debt climbed to more than $650bn last year. More than half of African countries are either in debt distress or teetering on the edge. But credit restructuring is painstakingly slow, and many governments end up spending more on servicing their debt than on healthcare or education.

    "title": "Key takeaways: Documentary names alleged killer of Al Jazeera’s Abu Akleh",
    "article_text": "A newdocumentaryclaiming to have uncovered the name of the Israeli soldier responsible for shooting Al Jazeera correspondentShireen Abu Aklehhas been released online. Abu Akleh, a Palestinian American who had been with Al Jazeera since 1997, was killed while reporting from Jenin in the occupied West Bank in May 2022. Shortly after her death, Israeli officials and media suggested she had been killed by Palestinian gunfire. However, subsequent reports from human rights organisations and news agencies showed that the Palestinian fighters initially accused by Israel were some distance from Abu Akleh’s killing and, in September, Israel conceded there was a“high probability” its forces had “accidentally”killed the correspondent. Contributors to the documentary, Who Killed Shireen? released on Thursday by Zeteo, suggested that Abu Akleh’s killing has helped further embolden a sense of impunity among Israeli soldiers, which has since contributed to the killing of more than 200 journalists by the Israeli military and settlers in the West Bank. Here are four of the key takeaways from the investigation: According to numerous testimonies featured in the film, officials within the Biden administration either knew or suspected that Abu Akleh had been shot by an Israeli soldier, but continued to support Israeli claims that she had been killed by Palestinians. The filmmakers also claim that US officials had been informed by an unnamed Israeli general responsible for the West Bank within hours of Abu Akleh’s killing that one of his soldiers had likely shot her. Despite this, US officials continued to support public Israeli accounts of Abu Akleh’s killing that attempted to shift the blame, and then, when Israel publicly admitted the likely culpability of one of its soldiers, that the killing was unintentional. US officials did not publicly dispute that narrative, and instead said they were unable to determine if a crime had been committed without access to the shooter, which Israel refused to allow. Speaking to reporter Dion Nissenbaum, one anonymous staffer within the former administration of President Joe Biden said that officials declined to press the Israeli administration on killing one of their citizens for fear of “anger[ing] the Israeli government”. This is despite officials having concluded, the same source said, that Abu Akleh’s killing had been an intentional act. Interviewed in the documentary, Eyal Hulata, who was Israel’s national security adviser at the time of the killing, defended Israel’s decision not to release the suspected soldier for questioning by the United States, saying that Israel had a “very good and trustworthy investigative mechanism”. Asked if he could ever remember the subject of the US journalist’s murder arising in discussions between President Biden and Naftali Bennett, who was Israeli prime minister at the time, Hulala replies, “This wasn’t a topic between the prime minister and the president.” Further requests from the Biden administration that Israel change the rules of engagement that some felt had led to Abu Akleh’s death met, according to one interviewee, “the brush off”. The failure of the Biden administration to hold Israel to account or bring about a change to its rules of engagement after Abu Akleh’s murder has, US Senator Chris Van Hollen told filmmakers, contributed towards “the deaths of … other Americans and other civilians”. The film reports that, according to soldiers active that day, Abu Akleh was killed by Alon Scagio, a sniper with the Israeli military’s elite “Duvdevan” unit. Speaking of his response to having killed the journalist, despite her identity as a member of the press being clear, a friend of Scagio says he didn’t “remember anything special” about Abu Akleh’s killing, “so it wasn’t, like, an issue. He wasn’t happy, like, ‘Hey, I killed a journalist,’ of course, but he wasn’t … eating himself from the inside.” Investigations by the filmmakers show Scagio was moved out of the Duvdevan to a commander position in a different unit, distancing him from any investigation, as a result, the filmmakers guess, of having killed Abu Akleh. Scagio was later killed in June 2024 by a roadside bomb in Jenin, the same West Bank city in which he is accused of killing Abu Akleh. As a result of the fallout from Abu Akleh’s killing, Scagio’s friend claims the Duvdevan unit took to using her image for target practice. The killing of Abu Akleh came during what at the time was considered an intense phase of Israeli raids on the occupied West Bank. She was one of at least 145 Palestinians killed during the raids in 2022. But since then, Israel has only ramped up its violence in both the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians since it launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, decimating the territory and refusing the entry of food since March, starving the local population. And in the West Bank, Israel has increased the severity of its attacks, using heavy weaponry and air strikes, and forcing Palestinians out of their homes. More than 900 Palestinians have been killed there. Despite that, the US – both under former President Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump – has maintained its support of Israel, even as much of the rest of the world has criticised its actions. At the United Nations, the US regularly votes alongside Israel, while the majority of member states seek to use the international body to pressure Israel to stop. And the US has threatened the International Criminal Court for seeking to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing war crimes. It is, therefore, perhaps no surprise that, even though Abu Akleh was a journalist doing her job when she was killed and an American citizen, the US has been willing to look the other way.",

    "title": "US strikes first trade agreement with UK in a ‘breakthrough deal’",
    "article_text": "The United States has announced a ‘breakthrough deal’ with the United Kingdom that would create an aluminium and steel trading zone and secure the pharmaceutical supply chain. The deal affirms that “reciprocity and fairness is a vital principle of international trade” and increases access for US agricultural products, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday, though he added that the final details were still being written up. “The final details are being written up,” Trump told reporters. “In the coming weeks, we’ll have it all very conclusive.” The deal, the first one struck by the US since Trump imposed his far-reaching tariffs, is also said to strip back paperwork for British companies looking to export to the US. The president said that the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the UK, which would also streamline the processing of US goods through customs. The White House said that the deal will bring in $6bn in external revenue from its 10-percent tariffs, which will stay in place, but that it would also bring in $5bn in new export opportunities. The UK agreed to lower its tariffs to 1.8 percent from 5.1 percent and provide greater access to US goods. The US already runs a trade surplus with the UK, making it a bit easier to find common ground, as Trump has staked his tariffs on specifically eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations that he says have taken advantage of the US. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined the president in the announcement over the phone. Starmer said the deal would boost trade and create jobs. Thursday’s announced agreement is the first agreement since theTrump administration starteda global trade war with universal levies of 10 percent. The US has also imposed 25-percent tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium, 25-percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145-percent tariffs on China. US and Chinese officials aredue to hold talksin Switzerland on Saturday. Starmer has struck up a warm relationship with Trump since his centre-left Labour Party was elected in July. Starmer’s government has been seeking to build new trading relationships post-Brexit with the US, China and the EU without moving so far towards one bloc that it angers the others. Economists and one chief executive of an FTSE 100 company — the highest capitalised blue chip companies on the London stock exchange—said the immediate economic impact of a tariff deal was likely to be limited but that trade agreements in general would help long-term growth. The UK struck afree trade agreementwith India this week. The US and the UK have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the EU, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the US as an incentive for Brexit. The US ran a $11.9bn trade surplus in goods with the UK last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68bn in goods that the US imported from the UK accounted for just 2 percent of all goods imported into the country. The US has been under pressure from investors to strike deals to de-escalate its tariff war after Trump’s often chaotic policymaking upended global trade with friends and foes alike, threatening to stoke inflation and start a recession. Top US officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10-percent tariff on most countries, along with higher rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days. On Wall Street, US markets were responding to the news amid hopes that this could be enough to ward off a recession. As of 11:30am ET in the US (15:30 GMT), the S&P 500 was up 0.97 percent and on track for an 11th gain in the last 13 days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.02 percent higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was 1.17 percent higher than market open. Stocks have been swinging for weeks with hopes that Trump could reach deals with other countries that would lower his tariffs, which many investors believe would cause a recession if left unchecked.",

    "title": "Cardinal Robert Prevost elected as Pope Leo XIV, first US pontiff",
    "article_text": "United States Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected the first US pontiff in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church and has taken the name Pope Leo XIV. Pope Leo made his first public appearance to impart a blessing from the roofed area of St Peter’s Basilica. In his first public words, Pope Leo told the faithful “peace be with all of you”. He emphasised the theme of peace throughout the address. “Evil will not prevail; we are in the hands of God,” he told the crowd and a global audience. “So without fear, united hand in hand with God and among ourselves, we go forward.” “Thank you, Pope Francis,” he added. The new church leader called for a “missionary church…that builds bridges, is always open to welcome everyone”. “He is clearly setting the tone for his papacy,” Al Jazeera Hoda Abdel-Hamid reported from Vatican City. “He also had a political tone there, calling for peace everywhere, calling for disarmament, calling for building bridges. So we do get an idea in which direction he will be heading,” she said. “The excitement level is like that of a World Cup final,” she noted earlier. The papal announcement has been generated excitement tinged with hopearound the world, with leaders from numerous countries offering their congratulations. Pope Leo spent his career ministering in Peru and also lead the Vatican’s powerful office of bishops, Earlier, white smoke emerged out of the Sistine Chapel chimney, signalling that anew popehad been elected. Bells rang out Thursday evening from the basilica after cardinals elected the 267th pope to lead the church on the second day of their conclave. The smoke signal meant the winner secured at least 89 of the votes from the 133 cardinals participating in the conclave to elect a successor toPope Francis. A top cardinal uttered the words “Habemus papam!” – Latin for “We have a pope!” – from the loggia or roofed area of the basilica and then read the winner’s birth name in Latin and revealed the name he has chosen to be called. Priests made the sign of the cross and nuns wept as the crowd shouted “Viva il papa!” (“Long live the pope!”) after the white smoke wafted into the late afternoon sky at 6:07pm (16:07 GMT). There had been a moment of hesitation in the vast crowd. “Is it white!?” one of the tens of thousands of people in St Peter’s Square asked. “It is!!” another said, shouting with joy. The crowd erupted in jubilation after waiting for hours to see the colour of the smoke coming out of the Sistine Chapel’s chimney. Some had bought chairs, books and food for what many believed would have been a long wait.“Habemus papam!” a group of people chanted with emotion. The choice of name – Pope Leo XIV – is significant as Pope Leo XIII was the first pope to create the idea of social ethics in the Catholic church, Father James Bretzke, professor of theology at John Carroll University, tells Al Jazeera. “Leo XIII, who ruled 1878 to 1903, wrote an encyclical which recognised how capitalism worked and the right of labour to organise and work for just living conditions and working conditions, which was really foundational in the church”, he said. “Up until that time, the church’s hierarchy tended to be identified with the upper class, and so Leo XIII put a redirection on the church, and certainly many of the popes since that time have built on that,” he added. “I think we can see a deepening of the church’s commitment to workers and the marginalised,” he said. Reporting from Santiago, Chile, Al Jazeera’s Lucia Newman, delves into Pope Leo’s many years in Latin America. “He has not just spent time in Peru. He is 69 years old, and he spent most of the last 40 years in the country. He is a binational, so you could say that he has spent more time in Latin America than in the United States, the country of his birth.” “He was named a cardinal in 2023; before that, he had been named the archbishop of Chiclayo. That is a very poor part of Peru with high unemployment and terrible infrastructure” she continued. “It really does represent all that’s wrong with many parts of Latin America and Peru, particularly countries with great natural wealth, with lots of minerals, but very bad distribution of wealth.” “This was something that the former Pope Francis believed very strongly had to be addressed, and so does the new pope. These are things that they agreed on. He was very close to ordinary people. He was known to have breakfast every day with just normal ordinary priests, a humble person like Francis, and someone very in tune with the needs of the poor”, Newman added.",

    "title": "Israel retrofitting DJI commercial drones to bomb and surveil Gaza",
    "article_text": "The Israeli military has been altering commercial drones to carry bombs and surveil people in Gaza, an investigation by Al Jazeera’s Sanad verification agency has found. According to Sanad, drones manufactured by the Chinese tech giant DJI have been used to attack hospitals and civilian shelters and to surveil Palestinian prisoners being forced to act as human shields for heavily armoured Israeli soldiers. This is not the first time DJI drones have been modified and used by armies. There were similar reports about both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022. At the time, DJIsuspended all sales to bothcountries and introduced software modifications that restricted the areas where its drones could be used and how high they could fly. However, DJI has not stopped selling drones to Israel. The Israeli army’s use of DJI drones is not new. By 2018, DJI drones were reportedly in extensive use across numerous divisions in the Israeli military. The Israeli campaign group Hamushim found evidence that Israeli military-trained operators were using DJI’s Matrice 600 model to drop tear gas on civilian protesters during the following year’sGreat March of Returnin Gaza. Despite their previous deployment by the Israeli military, their lethal use against civilians and protected targets in Gaza, as documented in this investigation, is unprecedented. Al Jazeera has reached out to Israeli authorities to request comment on the findings of this investigation but has received no response by time of publication. Sanad has documented several DJI drones that have been adapted for military use. However, it is the powerful DJI Agras drone, developed for agricultural use, that is the most significant. According to its manufacturers, the DJI Agras can carry a substantial payload and is capable of precision flight. As Sanad’s investigation shows, it can also be used to deliver an explosive payload to targets beyond the reach of conventional military forces. In addition to the DJI Agras, the DJI Mavic has been used by the Israeli military across Gaza for reconnaissance and target acquisition. Similarly, the compact DJI Avata drone, designed for recreational filming, has been repurposed by the Israeli military to navigate and map the intricate tunnel networks beneath Gaza. By late 2024, Israel had laid siege to Gaza’s north, pushing the population to thebrink of famineand imposing conditions described as “apocalyptic” by United Nations observers. Residents and humanitarian organisations reported an alarming number of what appeared to be civilian drones armed with explosives. In an incident documented by displaced civilians, footage shared on July 17, 2024, shows a DJI Agras drone dropping a bomb onto the IHH Turkish charity’s building in Jabalia, northern Gaza, less than 100 metres (330ft) from a school serving as a shelter and aid distribution centre. In November in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, a DJI Agras drone dropped a bomb in a residential neighbourhood where civilians had fled after Israeli shelling of a UN-operated school-turned-shelter. People who witnessed the bombing told Sanad the attack seemed calculated to instil fear. Beyond direct attacks, Israeli-modified DJI drones have been used extensively for surveillance and tactical operations throughout Gaza. In a further incident, footage obtained by Al Jazeera Arabic from one Israeli drone shows a DJI Avata helping to track an unnamed Palestinian being used by heavily armed Israeli soldiers as a human shield – an illegal practice under international law – in Shujaiya in December 2023. The individual is seen opening the school’s doors to make sure there were no Palestinian fighters inside, closely monitored by another drone that captured the entire operation. In 2022, in response to complaints from Ukrainian officials that DJI was sharing critical data with their Russian adversaries, the drone manufacturer suspended all sales to its retail partners in both countries. DJI explained the move: “We will never accept any use of our products to cause harm, and we will continue striving to improve the world with our work.” Despite evidence of DJI drones being weaponised by the Israeli military in Gaza, DJI has had no such response. Responding to direct inquiries from Sanad, DJI said: “Our products are for peaceful and civilian use only, and we absolutely deplore and condemn the use of [DJI] products to cause harm anywhere in the world.” A subsequent direct query asked if it plans “to halt sales in Israel or implement measures similar to those taken in the Russia-Ukraine conflict”. But DJI did not respond to the query not has it undertaken any measures to halt sales or impose software restrictions on where drones can fly over Gaza, allowing continued military deployments of their drones by the Israeli military.",

    "title": "As the conclave gathers, let debt justice be Pope Francis’s legacy",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis was never drawn to pomp or grandeur. He asked to be buried in a simple casket, and his burial was held not in the ornate halls of the Vatican, but in a modest neighbourhood church, true to his lifelong humility. As a conclave gathers today to choose his successor, world leaders and faith communities are reflecting on how best to carry forward his legacy. Francis would not have wanted ornate tributes or empty gestures. He would have wanted action – especially in the form of debt cancellation for developing countries and a renewed commitment to climate justice. Francis envisioned 2025, a Jubilee year for the Catholic Church, as a time to restore justice – among people, between nations, and with the Earth itself. A time to wipe the slate clean and begin again, not in words but in deeds. That vision aligns closely with another urgent global imperative: 2025 is also the year by which scientists warn that global carbon emissions must peak and begin to decline if we are to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. But instead of preparing for a just transition, many of the countries most affected by climate change are caught in a worsening “climate-debt doom loop.” From cyclones in Mozambique to floods in Pakistan and prolonged droughts in Malawi, climate-related disasters – caused overwhelmingly by industrialised nations – are tearing apart the infrastructure and economies of developing countries and displacing millions of people. Yet rather than receiving long-overdue funding and support, climate-vulnerable nations are being drained by record levels of debt payments – many owed to the very countries and institutions most responsible for global warming. According to calculations by 350.org, in 2023, developing nations spent roughly 40 times more on servicing foreign debt than they received in net climate assistance. This is not only unjust – it’s self-defeating. Funds that should be invested in clean energy, sustainable agriculture, reforestation, flood defences and public health are instead diverted to repay wealthy creditors. Meanwhile, the escalating impacts of climate change are driving up borrowing costs, pushing vulnerable countries even deeper into debt. For every $10 spent on debt payments, an additional dollar is effectively added as a premium for climate risk. The consequences ripple far beyond environmental damage. Debt service now consumes more government spending in many countries than healthcare and education combined. Over three billion people live in countries where more is spent on interest payments than on meeting basic human needs. This is not only economically short-sighted – it is a moral scandal. Pope Francis named this reality with unflinching clarity. In his final New Year’s message, he wrote: “Foreign debt has become a means of control whereby governments and private financial institutions of the richer countries unscrupulously and indiscriminately exploit the human and natural resources of poorer countries, simply to satisfy the demands of their own markets.” He reminded us that the financial debt of the Global South is the mirror image of the massive ecological debt the Global North owes. Research by Oxfam and others estimates that wealthy nations – responsible for more than 75 percent of historic carbon emissions – owe developing countries around $5 trillion each year in climate-related reparations. That’s a feasible figure, especially when you consider that these same wealthy governments currently spend about $7 trillion annually subsidizing fossil fuel industries. There is precedent for bold, transformative action. In the last Jubilee year – 2000 – a global movement led by civil society and faith groups secured the cancellation of over $100bn in debt for 35 heavily indebted nations. The results were remarkable: Tanzania and Uganda eliminated primary school fees, boosting enrolment. Mozambique and others expanded access to healthcare. Several countries saw improved credit ratings and increased foreign investment. That initiative was a recognition that economies must serve people, not the other way around. But it fell short of addressing the deeper structural flaws that enable recurring debt crises. In the years since, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, indebtedness has surged again. Now, the combined pressure of climate impacts, declining aid and economic instability – including trade disruptions triggered by protectionist policies – threatens to unleash a global debt tsunami. The poorest nations may be hit first and hardest, but this is not a crisis they face alone. A world shackled by unjust debt cannot act decisively to stop climate collapse. The debt crisis, if left unresolved, will sabotage efforts to protect people and the planet alike. Pope Francis reminded us that forgiveness, renewal and justice are not abstract ideals. They are moral and practical imperatives in an age of ecological breakdown. As the world prepares for the next chapter of papal leadership, we must act in his spirit: by resetting the rules of a broken financial system and building one rooted in equity, solidarity and care for our common home.

    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump plans to tout trillions of dollars of Arab investments in the US as a major achievement, but other issues are at stake, says University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami. Israel is threatening to further destroy the Gaza Strip unless progress is made in its ceasefire talks with Hamas. Meanwhile, Israel has refused to allow any food to enter Gaza – home to more than 2 million Palestinians – for more than two months. And despite Israeli objections, Trump may soon be able to reach a deal with Iran on its nuclear program.",

    "title": "US-UK trade deal: How are Trump’s global tariff talks shaping up?",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump announced the framework of atrade dealbetween the US and the United Kingdom, which re-sets US tariffs on most UK goods at 10 percent, on Thursday. “For so many years, everybody talked and talked about a deal,” Trump said in a display of warmth towards his British counterpart. “It’s now been done with us.” He added that there was an “external and internal bond” between the two countries. It had been “an honour” doing business with the UK, he said. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called in to the White House from the UK to join the announcement, welcomed the deal, saying it was a “historic day”. On Wednesday, Trump had said he was preparing to announce “a major trade deal with representatives of a big and highly respected country”. In a post on Truth Social, he promised it would be the “first of many”. Investors have been waiting for Trump to ease his global trade war amid fears that prolonged uncertainty over tariffs could inflictserious damageto the world’s biggest economies. The agreement with the UK marks Trump’s first trade deal since he imposed tariffs on dozens of countries onApril 2, a date he called “Liberation Day”. Separately, Trump has introduced bespoke tariffs on certain US imports, includingcarsandsteel. Trump has long accused other countries of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to bring jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance future tax cuts. Until now, most imports from the UK to the US have faced ablanket 10 percent tariff. The UK, like other countries, was also hit with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports to the US, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and car parts. Under the new agreement, US tariffs on UK goods will be set at 10 percent while tariffs on UK steel and aluminium will be reduced to zero. The 10 percent rate is still much higher than the 2.5 percent tariffs on cars under the administration of former US President Joe Biden. The deal will raise $6bn in revenues for the US and create $5bn in new export opportunities, the White House said. The UK has agreed to lower tariffs on US goods to 1.8 percent from 5.1 percent and to provide greater access in UK markets for US goods. It has also agreed to purchase $10bn of Boeing BA.N planes, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the White House on Thursday during the trade deal announcement. Starmer said the deal delivered on his promise to protect British carmakers and the steel sector. “All of these tariff cuts will come into place as soon as possible,” Starmer said following his phone call with Trump. The deal will also create an aluminium and steel-trading zone and secure the pharmaceutical supply chain, Trump wrote in a social media post as the deal was announced at the White House. The UK has not been forced to drop its 2 percent digital services tax on US tech firms, as was previously expected. A UK government statement said: “The Digital Services Tax remains unchanged as part of today’s deal. Instead, the two nations have agreed to work on a digital trade deal that will strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US – opening the UK up to a huge market that will put rocket boosters on the UK economy.” While both governments will likely present the agreement announced today as a significant win, it is essentially about returning to the status quo – removing the newly imposed tariff barriers. It remains to be seen how much any agreement will contribute to both countries’ economic output. In 2023, the UK had an overall trade surplus with the US. The UK reported a surplus of 71.4 billion pounds ($95bn) in goods and services. Most of that headroom came from services, however. On the goods side, the UK exported 15.3 percent of its goods to the US in 2023 – amounting to roughly 60 billion pounds ($80bn). Machinery and transport equipment accounted for the largest share, at 27 billion pounds ($36bn), ahead of chemicals at 14 billion pounds ($19bn). On the flipside, the US exported 58 billion pounds ($77.2bn) of goods to the UK in 2023. Ten percent of all goods imported by the UK came from the US in that year, second only to Germany. Machinery and transport equipment accounted for the largest share, worth nearly 20 billion pounds ($27bn), followed by fuel – amounting to 18.7 billion pounds ($25bn). On the services side, the US exported 102 billion pounds ($76bn) in services – things like advertising and banking – to the UK in 2023, and imported 127 billion pounds $170bn in British services. These are unaffected by tariffs. Trump cautioned that the agreement, with its preservation of a 10 percent tariff, was not a template for other countries. “That’s a low number,” Trump said. Trump’s top negotiating officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trade partners since the president’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2. Although Trump delayed implementing “reciprocal” tariffs for most countries by90 dayson April 9, he did raise them for China to 145 percent.Beijing, in turn, slapped a 125 percent tariff on US goods. The reciprocal tariffs, which varied from 10 percent to 39 percent, were designed to hit countries with which Washington has large trade deficits, or that impose heavy tariffs on US goods. On Tuesday, Trump said he would review potential trade agreements over the next two weeks to decide which ones to accept. Last week, he said that “we [already] have potential trade deals” with South Korea and Japan. Following his 90-day reprieve, steep reciprocal tariffs are due to be imposed on US trade partners in early July, leaving country representatives racing to avoid a full-blown trade spat with the world’s number-one economy. According todatafrom the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the total goods trade between the US and China stood at an estimated $582.4bn in 2024. US exports of goods to China totalled $143.5bn while US imports from China totalled $438.9bn. The upshot is that the US trade deficit with China was $295.4bn last year, 5.8 percent higher ($16.3bn) than in 2023. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland this weekend for talks, which may be the first step inresolving a trade warbetween the world’s two largest economies. Meetingswill take place in Geneva, and are expected to address reductions on broad tariffs, duties on specific products, export controls and Trump’s decision to end “de minimis” exemptions on low-value imports. China’s Commerce Ministry said last week that it was “evaluating” an offer from Washington. The Geneva meeting will be the first between the two countries since the announcement of Trump’s trade tariffs in April. On Tuesday, Bessent told Fox News, “We [the US and China] have a shared interest that isn’t sustainable. And 145 percent and 125 percent is the equivalent of an embargo. We don’t want to decouple. What we want is fair trade.” Trump has accused China of manipulating its currency to make its exports cheaper. He has also slammed Beijing for adopting what he says are market-interfering practices, such as direct government support for Chinese companies, as well as tax breaks and preferential financing. In 2023, the European Union exported 502 billion euros ($563bn) worth of goods to the US and in turn imported 344 billion euros ($386bn) of goods, amounting to a goods trade surplus in the EU’s favour of 157 billion euros ($177bn). After Trump temporarily dropped his 20 percent reciprocal tariffs on the EU in April, the EU paused retaliatory duties on 21 billion euros ($24bn) of US goods until July 14, including on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, chicken and clothing. Since then, Brussels has said it wants to increase US goods imports by 50 billion euros ($57bn) to address the “problem” in their trade relationship. Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s top negotiator, recently told The Financial Times that the bloc is making “progress” towards striking a deal. But Sefcovic suggested that the EU would not accept an indefinite 10 percent tariff on its exports as a fair resolution to trade talks. He added that his “ambition” was still to strike a “balanced and fair” deal with the White House. He also said he wants his US counterparts to take into account US services that are exported to the EU. The EU experienced a services trade deficit of 109 billion euros ($123bn) with the US in 2023 in terms of services. Brussels exported 319 billion euros ($361bn) in services to the US that year, while importing 427 billion euros ($483bn). Taking this into account would bring the US overall trade deficit with the EU to about 50 billion euros ($57bn), he said. The new $57bn US deficit could be closed quickly, Sefcovic added, with deals to purchase more US gas and agricultural products. Talks are currently continuing. In the first three months of 2025, India exported $27.7bn of goods (mainly pharmaceutical and engineering products) to the US, while importing $10.5bn of goods (mainly aircraft and medical goods), meaning a US trade deficit of $17.2bn. On Tuesday, Trump revealed that India had agreed to drop all tariffs on US imports “to nothing”. New Delhi has not yet issued an official statement confirming Trump’s remarks. At a White House event alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump said, “India has one of the highest tariffs in the world. We are not going to put up with that. They have agreed to drop it to … nothing. They wouldn’t have done that for anybody else but me.” According to Bloomberg, India has reportedly proposed eliminating tariffs on select US imports – including steel, car parts and pharmaceuticals – as part of ongoing bilateral trade talks with Washington. India currently imposes tariffs on US imports ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent, depending on the product category. A zero-tariff offer would apply on a reciprocal basis and would be limited to a specific volume of goods.",

    "article_text": "Tech billionaireBill Gateshas said that he will give away 99 percent of his wealth in the next two decades, funding his philanthropy the Gates Foundation long enough for it to close in 2045. In a statement published on Thursday, Gates also firmly criticised the way his fellow centibillionaire –Elon Musk, an adviser to US President Donald Trump – is pushing to slash United States funds for essential things like food and medical assistance in poor countries. “The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” Gates told the Financial Times, referring to Musk’s work with the Trump administration to dismantle theUS Agency for International Development(USAID). Gates, who has a current estimated net worth of about $108bn, has long been among the most recognisable figures in the field of philanthropy, with an emphasis on medical assistance in poor countries. He has also become a symbol of the enormous influence that such wealth can have on everything from politics to global health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was a vocal opponent of loosening patent protections aroundCOVID-19 vaccinesin order to allow poorer countries to manufacture their own versions and distribute them to their populations more quickly, arguing that doing so would harm innovation and intellectual property rights. Critics accused him of promoting a vision of “vaccine apartheid”. They have also questioned whether Gates, through his substantial funding of groups such as the vaccine group Gavi and the World Health Organization, wields disproportionate influence in the field of global health without the same oversight and accountability that a public institution would face. Over the years, Gates has stated that he is determined to give away most of his enormous fortune. While he is currently worth about $108bn, he expects the foundation to spend a total of around $200bn by 2045, depending on inflation and markets. “People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them,” the 69-year-old co-founder of Microsoft said in a post on his website. “There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,” he added. Gates also lamented that the US has pulled back from involvement in global health andhumanitarian assistancearound the world, offering a subtle rebuke of the Trump administration. “It’s unclear whether the world’s richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people,” he said.",

    "article_text": "Ukrainian legislators have unanimously voted to ratify a minerals deal with the United States in the hope of securing military assistance to deter future Russian aggression. The country’s parliament gave its assent to theagreement, which grants the US priority access to Ukrainian minerals and sets up an investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction, with 338 members voting in favour and none against it. Ukraine’s First Vice Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Thursday that the deal, which stops short of offering security guarantees but has raised hopes of revived US support, was “the foundation of a new model of interaction with a key strategic partner”. The Ukrainian Parliament has ratified the historic Economic Partnership Agreement between Ukraine and the United States. This document is not merely a legal construct — it is the foundation of a new model of interaction with a key strategic partner.pic.twitter.com/pIkMG1gUVu — Yulia Svyrydenko (@Svyrydenko_Y)May 8, 2025 The deal, signed by the US and Ukraine at the end of April, was approved despite legislators’ concerns over a lack of detail regarding issues such as how the reconstruction fund will be governed and how contributions will be made. In a news conference earlier that day, Svyrydenko had sought to assuage these concerns, indicating the deal would be operational in a few weeks. “We have managed to ensure that the agreement is equitable. The key principle is that management is 50-50. Neither side has an advantage, there is no dictatorship from either side, and decisions are taken by consensus,” she said. Svyrydenko underlined on X that the deal has no “debt provisions”, absolving Ukraine from earlier US demands that it cover the repayment of billions of dollars in military aid supplied by Washington since Russia invaded in February 2022. Ukraine managed to obtain the concession despite getting off to a bad start in negotiations back in February, when President Volodymyr Zelenskyyclashedwith US President Donald Trump during a testy Oval Office sit-down. Kyiv was initially hoping the US would provide security guarantees to help deter future Russian attacks, in exchange for preferential access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. But Washington refused, instead arguing that boosting its business interests in Ukraine would itself act as a bulwark against Russia.",

    "title": "Instagram CEO testifies about competing with TikTok: ‘You’re either growing, or you&#8217;re slowly dying’",
    "article_text": "Adam Mosseri says Meta got a reality check when TikTok gained steam. Adam Mosseri says Meta got a reality check when TikTok gained steam. byLauren Feiner When Adam Mosseri took over Meta-owned Instagram as CEO in 2018, the app was experiencing what he’d later call “concerning” drops and plateaus in user engagement, thanks partly to fierce competition from a new app: TikTok. Instagram estimated in 2019 that 23 percent of the decline in time spent on Instagram in the US was due to TikTok. Bytedance’s video app kept expanding through the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. “We can’t explain it all, but what’s clear at this point is that we need to adapt, and do so quickly,” Mosseri wrote to his team in March 2020. Instagram needed to recover, he testified Thursday in a DC courtroom, because “you’re either growing, or you’re slowly dying.” Mosseri described the dire situation while testifying in the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust trial against Meta, where the government alleges the company illegally monopolized the market for personal social networking services, a category that it says includes Snapchat but not more entertainment-focused apps like YouTube or TikTok. Mosseri’s testimony highlighted how much Instagram sees itself as in competition with TikTok, but it also showed that even as entertainment content becomes a larger portion of its offerings, connecting with friends is still a central part of its service — meaning it may still be a relevant market for the court to find it monopolizes. Since his March 2020 warning, Instagram has seen more success, thanks in part to improved AI recommendations for Reels. But TikTok still represents “the fiercest competition that we have faced.” As Instagram has sought to compete more effectively with TikTok in building out Reels, TikTok has become more similar to Instagram, Mosseri testified. While he used to consider TikTok a more of “lean-back experiences” where users passively watch videos, he now sees it as “every bit as participatory as we are at this point.” TikTok is actively trying to engage users’ connections with their friends, he testified, noting it’s rolled out a feed to watch friends’ videos. (A TikTok executive testified earlier in the trial that only 1 percent of videos watched on the platform are through that tab.) Meta has emphasized throughout the trial that connecting with friends and family has become a smaller part of its business in the face of competitive pressures. But Mosseri’s testimony highlighted that helping users engage with their friends is still a core use case for Instagram today, and a way it sees itself being differentiated from rivals. Mosseri said in a 2024 video on his own Instagram account that the reason the app wouldn’t expand into long-form video was because it wasn’t as conducive to sharing with friends. “I still think friends are an important part of the experience,” he testified, though he also shared that as the app has grown overall, “the percentage of the app spent on friend content has gone down.” “Instagram will always need to focus on friends,” Zuckerberg wrote in a 2018 email to Mosseri. Even as it grows to include more entertainment, he added, it “can never exclusively be for public figures or it will cease to be a social product.” Mosseri also bridged the gap between earlier testimony from Zuckerberg, who testified about all the ways Facebook helped Instagram grow, and Instagram co-founder and former CEO Kevin Systrom, who testified that eventually, Zuckerberg pulled back resources from Instagram in favor of Facebook. Mosseri took over as CEO when Systrom left in 2018, and he gave a third perspective on the key question of whether Meta helped grow Instagram in ways it couldn’t have otherwise, or whether it bought it to squash a nascent competitor and later deprive it of resources. Mosseri came over to Instagram from a role at Meta, so he was familiar with the cultures and gripes in both organizations. “As a new member of the Instagram team and a previous member of the Facebook team, I sat right in the middle of it,” he testified. Mosseri observed that in some ways, Instagram had “drifted culturally a bit too far apart in my opinion. We used to refer to Instagram as its own company, and it’s not.” He could seewhy Instagram’s founders were upsetwith some of the changes Facebook made to reduce promotion of Instagram from Facebook, but he saw both sides. “I disagreed with some of the changes personally, but I also thought they were being made more of than they needed to be.” Ultimately, Mosseri testified, Facebook’s decision to buy Instagram could go down as ​​“one of the best acquisitions of all time.” Instagram got to access Facebook’s resources and experience, and Facebook got to access the Instagram founders’ unique talent for coming up with innovative products — something Meta would need to stay ahead of competition in years to come. Both companies, he said, “benefited greatly.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Mashinsky pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud linked to the collapse of the crypto lending firm. byEmma Roth Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of the collapsed cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud that led to “billions in losses,”the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. Celsius, which held $25 billion in assets at its peak,abruptly halted withdrawalsand transfersduring a broader crypto crash in 2022, locking upbillions in customer funds. The firm filed for bankruptcyjust weeks later. TheDOJ charged Mashinskywith securities fraud in 2023, accusing him of misrepresenting Celsius’s business and finances.

    "article_text": "India, Lesotho, Bangladesh, and other countries have moved forward with Starlink adoption in recent weeks. India, Lesotho, Bangladesh, and other countries have moved forward with Starlink adoption in recent weeks. byEmma Roth The US government is bringing up Starlink adoption in the midst of tariff trade talks with other countries, according toa report fromThe Washington Post.In recent weeks, several countries have moved forward with licensing the Elon Musk-owned satellite internet company, including India, Somalia, Lesotho, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Internal messages seen byThe Postsuggest that US embassies and the State Department are encouraging countries to make way for US satellite internet services like Starlink. The messages don’t promise lower tariffs in exchange for adopting Starlink, but “they do indicate that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has increasingly instructed officials to push for regulatory approvals for Musk’s satellite firm,”The Postreports. Sources tellThe Postthat government officials in India rushed to secure regulatory approval for Starlink “with the understanding that doing so could help them cement trade deals with the administration.” This week,India cleared Starlink’s proposal, bringing it another step closer to establishing its service in the country. In a statement toThe Post, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said “the only consideration in the Trump administration’s trade negotiations with other countries is what’s best for the American people — which includes American companies succeeding at home and abroad” and that President Donald Trump “will not tolerate any conflicts of interest.” The State Department told the outlet that “any patriotic American should want to see an American company’s success on the global stage, especially over compromised Chinese competitors.” SpaceX didn’t immediately respond toThe Verge’s request for comment. In response toan earlierWashington Postarticleon the rapid global expansion of Starlink, severalSenate Democrats called on President Donald Trumpto investigate reports that Musk “used his government role to improperly advance his personal businesses abroad.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

You don’t have to spend a fortune to have a robot clean your floors. Here’s our pick of the most cost-effective bots you can buy right now. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Today’s robot vacuums are becoming a bit like cars: with all the features, upgrades, and fancy trimmings available these days, it’s easy to forget that they can just be simple machines that get us from point A to point B. Yes, some bots blow hot air on their bums (mop pads), deftly navigate dog poop, and have arms to pick up your socks, but there are plenty of basic budget robot vacuums that just do a decent job of cleaning your floor autonomously — as long as you tidy up first. Fancier models have obstacle recognition, and some even use AI-powered cameras to tell popcorn from poop and avoid the latter. If you want one of those, check out mybest robot vacuumbuying guide. But if you think you can manage the task of picking up after yourself (and your puppy), a budget bot will save you a lot of money and still do a good job cleaning your floor. Tap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock. Roborock’s S8 robot vacuum / mop features 6,000Pa of suction, sonic mopping, and dual rubber roller brushes that perform well on carpet. The Q5 Pro has a big bin and wheels to get up on high-pile carpet. It also has a removable mopping reservoir and excels at sucking up dirt and pet hair. The Shark Ion has good suction, a big bin and wheels, and a roller brush that’s made of bristles and plastic, which prevents it from getting tangled easily. To judge its vacuuming power, I run every robot vacuum through a series of tests on hardwood and carpet, including flour, kitty litter, oatmeal, and pet and human hair. I test obstacle avoidance using cables, shoes, socks, and bed skirts. I test mopping effectiveness on hardwood and tile floors using dried and moist messes.If the robot has an auto-empty dock, I test to see how well it empties the onboard bin as well as any other features of the dock. I run the robot vacs around three different levels in my home to see how they handle different surfaces, room transitions, and edge sensing. I evaluate how long they run before needing to recharge and test each app, focusing on its mapping functions to see how simple they are to use and how reliable they are.I also examine each robot’s build quality and parts availability, and I totally judge them based on how much my cat Boone likes to play with them. Yes, there are sub-$200 robots out there. No, I do not recommend you buy them. With so many new models coming out almost daily, it’s better to look for a sale on an older model from a well-known company than buy a no-name budget bot.You can pick up a brand new, two-year-old Roomba or Roborock with mapping and advanced navigation for half its original price. These gadgets should last for years, so it’s not like buying last season’s Prada slip-ons.That said, sales are hard to keep track of, so some of the prices listed here may seem high for a budget bot. If you see one that fits your needs, keep an eye onThe Verge’s deals pagefor when they go on an even better sale. The cheaper the bot, the more important suction power is, as they tend to have fewer features that improve cleaning. Higher-end robots have things like better brushes, carpet boost mode, and dirt detection.At a minimum, look for 2,500Pa (if the manufacturer lists suction power; some don’t). I also much prefer rubber roller brushes or a rubber/bristle hybrid over just bristle brushes. Rubber rollers get up more dirt and get tangled less than bristles. Bear in mind that most budget mopping bots don’t really mop — it’s more just using a damp cloth to pick up the fine dust the robot’s vacuum left behind, which is useful but not essential. Mop attachments with water reservoirs also take up space on a robot and mean a smaller bin. A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. Eight hundred milliliters is the largest I’ve seen, but anything over 450 ml is decent on a budget bot. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots and the prevalence of auto-empty docks, it’s hard to find robots with big bins. But if you’re on a budget and don’t want to spend extra for the dock, a big bin will mean less hands-on time with your vacuum. If you can swing it, I strongly recommend an auto-empty dock, and there are finally some cheaper versions out there. While it’s a nice-to-have rather than a must-have, delegating the chore of emptying the bin to the robot does mean your floors will be cleaner since a vacuum with a full bin won’t suck up dirt. Many standalone robots now have an auto-empty dock option you can add later if you want to wait and see, but buying them together is generally cheaper. We are starting to see true budget bots use thevSLAM (visual simultaneous localization and mapping) or lidar-powered navigation or mappingfound on higher-end robots, albeit lower-level versions. Some, use the bump and roll technique, with more now adding agyroscope functionthat at least makes them go in a straight line.Choosing an older version of a high-end robot will get you the better navigation, but I’ve also included a few bump-and-roll bots with basic mapping capability, which makes the experience better all around. Non-mapping bots may miss entire sections of your home and, when they start again after charging, may go over the area they last cleaned. However, mapping is less important if you want a bot for a single room or small apartment. While most bots can recharge and resume (go back to their charging base and refuel before going back out again), a bot that can go for at least two hours on one charge will get the job done more quickly and be less annoying. I look for at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is the best). A lot of budget bots have barely usable apps; this is another reason why buying a lower-cost option from a company with higher-end models gets you a better experience, as the app is usually more polished.A good basic app, though, should have the ability to set multiple schedules to send the robot out, an option for a do-not-disturb period (so it doesn’t start up again at 2AM because it finally recharged), and a way to link to voice assistants and smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple’s Siri. Even at the budget end, you’ll be spending $200 to $300 on a robot vacuum, so repairability and the availability of replacement parts are a big bonus. 8 Verge Score Cheap, even with the auto-empty dockA dual mop and dustbin means no swappingRoom-specific cleaningCarpet boost Short battery lifeSlow to rechargeDocking can be spottyBasic obstacle detection Suction power:5,300Pa /Dustbin capacity:300ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Mopping option:Yes /Mapping:Yes, lidar /Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Runtime:100 mins, 2,600mAh battery/Brush style:Single rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin. Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris. Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean. Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations. 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. It’s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin. 8 Verge Score Sonic-moppingAuto-mop liftAI-powered obstacle avoidanceDual-rubber roller brushesCarpet detection Very large and wideHave to wash the mop manuallyHave to refill the water tank manuallyNo heated dryingLimited mop lift Suction power:6,000Pa/ Dustbin capacity:400ml/ Runtime:180 mins, 5,200mAh battery/ Brush style:dual rubber/ Auto-empty dock option:yes/ Mapping:yes, lidar navigation/ Keep-out zones:yes, virtual/ Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum that mops well and has AI-powered obstacle detection—a rarity at this price point. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do an excellent job on hard floors and carpets, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. There’s the option of pairing the S8 with a fairly sleek auto-empty dock, but unlike Roborock’s QRevo line (which starts at around $600), the dock won’t automatically fill the water tank or wash the mop; you’ll have to do that work manually. Formerly a flagship robot vacuum for Roborock, this once $750 bot can now be found for well under $500, even with its auto-empty dock. Its flat mop pad vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing, and the bot comes with an extra-large on-board water tank, which means it actually gets wet enough to be effective. The S8 can be set to mop only — something few budget bots offer, and its mop-only mode does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though. Another great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. This bot can also raise its wheels when it cleans messes like ketchup to prevent its brushes from getting sticky. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings. The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). If you want to avoid those chores, you’ll need to bump up to about $600 and get whicheverRoborock QRevo vac and mop is on sale.This adds spinning mopping pads and an auto wash/dry/refill dock. 8 Verge Score Huge, 770ml binDual rubber roller brushesLidar mappingDigital keep-out zones No carpet avoidance when moppingBasic obstacle avoidanceMopping is lackluster Suction Power:5,000Pa /Dustbin capacity:770ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Mopping option:Yes /Mapping:Yes, lidar /Suction power:5,500Pa/Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Runtime:240 mins, 5,200mAh battery /Brush style:dual, rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts My recommendation for families with pets who don’t want to spend a small fortune on an auto-empty robot vacuum is to buy a good bot with a big bin. These are getting harder to find now that every bot wants to be a multitasker and also mop (the water reservoir takes up valuable dustbin room). So, I’m very pleased with Roborock’s Q5 Pro with its 770ml dustbin. This huge bin pairs with dual rubber roller brushes that are better at getting pet hair out of rugs than single brushes. The rubber is also less prone than bristles to getting tangled with hair, and combined with 5,500Pa suction power, this vacuum does a good job on very dirty floors. It does have a removable mopping pad with a small water tank built into it, too, which is useful for cleaning up the fine dust left behind by the vacuum, but it isn’t going to scrub your floors. It will, however, keep the pet hair at bay. Don’t confuse this with the cheaperRoborock Q5, however. That bot has a smaller bin, lower suction, shorter runtime, and only one roller brush. It’s worth spending the extra for the Pro. The Q5 Pro Pluspairs the bot with the redesigned Roborock auto-empty dock if you really don’t like emptying the robot’s onboard bin, normally a hefty price bump, it’s on sale for $360 at Amazon. The dock is relatively compact and lightweight compared to previous versions. However, considering the size of the Q5 Pro’s bin, you’d only have to empty it three times before the dock’s 2.5-liter bag is also full. The Q5 Pro doesn’t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects. It does have a huge 5,200mAh battery that will run for about four hours. It uses the excellent Roborock app and has all the same software features of the higher-end Roborock’s family, including lidar mapping and navigation, digital keep-out zones, room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and voice control. 7 Verge Score Big binEasy to operateEasy to repairBig wheels means it can get over most transitions Loud and rattlyNo mappingNo keep-out zones Suction power:unknown/ Dustbin capacity:425ml/ Runtime:120 mins/ Brush style:single bristle / rubber hybrid/ Auto-empty dock option:no/ Mapping:no/ Keep-out zones:no/ Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home TheShark Ion’s big bin, simple app experience, decent battery life, repairability, and bullish nature make this an excellent bump-and-roll bot. It doesn’t map or have any special navigation features other than colliding with things and changing direction. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done. It’s a good one to stick under a bed or desk and set to run when you’re not home, as it’s loud and rattly and will bang into everything in its path. But its big wheels and 120-minute runtime mean it’s less prone to getting stuck or running out of juice than simpler $200 bots. Unlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes. Its short, squat side brushes are surprisingly effective at getting debris into the robot’s path, and because they’re short, they’re less prone to getting tangled in stray cords. But the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots. That’s a good thing, as there’s no mapping, obstacle detection, or any way to set keep-out zones here. This bot just goes. Another bonus: replacement parts are easily available, making it simple to repair and just keep going. Shark doesn’t share suction power specs, but it ably handled all my tests, including the toughest: raw oatmeal. Those little flakes are hard to pick up; side brushes will spin them all over the floor. It did a good job on pet hair, too, although, like most robots I tested, it required at least two runs to get everything up effectively. The app is super basic: just on / off, scheduling, and a choice of three power levels (all loud). Disappointingly, you can only schedule it once a day. Most robots can be programmed to do two to three passes, but in place of that, I like the option to schedule it to go out twice to make sure it gets the job done. I couldn’t do that with the Shark. Still, you can press its button or use the app to send it out again if needed. 7 Verge Score Great vacuumingRoom mappingReliable app No virtual keep-out zonesCan be aggressiveHave to roll up your carpets to mop Suction power:unknown/Dustbin capacity:419ml/Runtime:90 minutes/Brush style:dual rubber/Auto-empty dock option:yes/Mopping option:yes/ Mapping:yes/Keep-out zones:physical only/ Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Roomba i5 is the follow-up to my previous top pick for a budget robot, the Roomba i3. It’s not the cheapest bot on the block, but its cleaning chops, attractive design, good software, and robust, easily-repairable hardware make it a good choice for spending a smaller budget. The i5 brings mopping capability to the lower end of iRobot’s line via a swappable mopping bin that adds a flat mopping pad and a sizable 210ml reservoir. There’s no carpet avoidance, though, so I had to roll up the ends of my carpets to block it from going on them. But this bot is best as a vacuum, and it cleans almost as well asiRobot’s higher-end j7but for a lot less money. It has slightly lower suction power, but it boasts Roomba’s signature dual roller rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of removing pet hair from hardwood floors and sucking up oatmeal from plush carpets. These are slightly different from the Roborock dual brushes, and I find the nubs make them more effective at digging out the dirt, especially from carpet. The i5 has mapping and room-specific cleaning, so you can send it to clean the kitchen if you want. However, unlike my top pick, the Tapo RV30, there’s no option to set virtual keep-out zones. If you have somewhere you don’t want the bot to roam, you’ll need to buy iRobot’svirtual wall towers. It also has a relatively small bin, but you can pair it withan auto-empty base(although that doubles the cost). The i5 is a solid vacuum with big wheels and a big bumper that can easily tackle any floor surface you throw at it. It can manage most transitions and is one of the only vacs I’ve tested that doesn’t get stuck on the uneven wooden floors in my screened-in porch. It does tend to bump into things, but it gets almost everywhere you want it to and won’t be put off by a bed skirt. But if you have delicate items on rickety tables, watch out. As with all Roombas, the i5 is easy to self-repair, and you can buy (not inexpensive) replacements for all its parts. I’ve actually rebuilt an i3 (the previous model) after it rolled over some dog poop. There’s no obstacle avoidance here; you have to bump up to theRoomba j7for that (which, if you can get it on sale anywhere, is a great robot vacuum.) iRobot also offers theCombo j5for $529.99 (currently on salefor $249.99 at Amazon), adding more advanced mapping, including virtual keep-out zones and better obstacle and carpet detection. It also has ashinier finish, whereas the i5 retains the fabric-covered body of the i3. If you can find the j5 on sale for close to or less than the i3 (it’s$379 with the auto-empty dock on Amazonat the time of writing), go for it. Otherwise, the i3 is your best bet for a budget Roomba. 8 Verge Score Big binSlim profileAvoids obstaclesQuietEasily repairable No mappingNo keep-out zonesSmall battery Suction power:2,000Pa/ Dustbin capacity:600ml/ Runtime:100 mins/ Brush style:single bristle / rubber hybrid/ Auto-empty dock option:no/ Mapping:no/ Keep-out zones:no/ Works with:n/a The Eufy 11S Max is a rarity — a robot vacuum that doesn’t use Wi-Fi at all. There’s not even an app. Instead, you just press the button, and off it trundles. It also comes with a remote if you’d rather not get up off the couch, and you can use that to program it to clean at a specific time. The 11S is super slim, 72.5 mm high, with no lidar tower, so it will get under most couches and very quiet. It has a big 600ml bin, and I was very impressed with how much it got up off my hardwood floors, even with its relatively small 2,000Pa of suction. There are three cleaning levels, and at the lowest, it registers around 55db, quiet enough to run in a home office. It does have a smallish battery — only 100 minutes of runtime — but it will go back and recharge. For $200, this is the perfect budget bot for those wary of or who don’t want to deal with an app and Wi-Fi. It’s a bump-and-roll bot, meaning there are no real navigation skills. But it has plenty of replaceable parts, including thebattery and wheels, so you can keep it going for a long time. 7 Verge Score Effective vibration moppingMultifunctional dockCarrying handleBig water tank Navigation can be spottyObstacle avoidance isn’t greatThe app is a bit fiddly Suction Power:5,100Pa /Dustbin capacity:360ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Mopping option:Yes /Mapping:Yes, lidar /Suction power:5,100Pa/Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Runtime/Battery:180 mins, 5,400mAh /Brush style:Single rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home The Yeedi Cube is the least expensive robot vacuum with the same kind of multifunction dock and high-end features asrobots over $1,000. This means it can automatically fill its onboard water tank, clean and dry its mop, and empty the bin. It also has more advanced obstacle avoidance tech than most budget bots, although, unlike the pricier bots, it uses lasers to see objects, not an AI-powered camera, which is less effective. While it originally retailed for $699.99, it’s now an older model and is regularly on sale for less than $500. The Yeedi resembles the Shark and Roomba in its full-speed-ahead nature. It will just run into things, and if it can clean them, great! It also only goes around larger objects. So, while it ably sucked up Cheerios and picked up all the oatmeal flakes, it got stuck on cords and socks. Definitely keep it away from pet waste. The Yeedi’s mopping prowess is impressive. It scrubs the floor using a thin microfiber cloth that vibrates 2,500 times a minute to get up grime. The dock cleans the mopping pad, drains the dirty water, and auto empties the bin, but the robot carries its one-liter water tank around on its back, so it doesn’t need to go back and refill during a run. One downside is that it uses a single hybrid rubber / bristle brush, which gets tangled with hair. However, combined with 5,100Pa of suction power, it did a good job of picking up dirt from the floors. I really liked the handle; it makes it easy to pick up the vacuum and put it where you want to clean. An onboard spot clean button means you don’t need to fuss with the app to get it to clean up a dedicated area. The map offers room-specific cleaning and keep-out zones for vacuuming and mopping but can be a bit fiddly to use.

    "article_text": "A Biden-era policy letting schools provide hotspots for remote learning to children underserved by broadband internet is no more. A Biden-era policy letting schools provide hotspots for remote learning to children underserved by broadband internet is no more. byGaby Del Valle The Senate has voted to end a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule that used federal funding to cover Wi-Fi hotspots that could be used outside of school and libraries. The program, first implemented by former FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, applied funds from the $2.6 billion federal E-Rate program to a program that enabled schools and libraries to provide free Wi-Fi hotspots to children and others with poor or no internet access at home. AsPolicybandnotes prior to a successful Senate procedural vote yesterday to take up the measure, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said the rule “violates the Communications Act, which clearly limits the use of the funds in question to classrooms and libraries.” In astatement last year, Rosenworcel disagreed that the law doesn’t support hotspot lending. Citing remote learning issues that were put in sharp relief by the covid pandemic, Rosenworcel wrote that while E-Rate had “overwhelming success connecting schools and libraries,” it needed to be modernized so that schools and libraries could “loan out Wi-Fi hotspots to support high-speed internet access in rural America, urban America, and everything in between.” She noted that the change could be accomplished “within the existing E-Rate budget.” The FCC under Chairman Brendan Carr, who opposed the hotspot lending program, has aggressively pulled back from consumer protection programs and turned into the Trump administration’sde facto censorship arm. GOP members of Congress have worked to rollback subsidies that help to increase US internet access, such as theFCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program, in the name of spending reduction. Citing a recent study in March,TechDirtwrote that the “$7–$8 billion annual taxpayer cost of the program generated between $28.9 and $29.5 billion in savings thanks to expanded access to affordable internet and remote telehealth services.” In astatementreleased after the vote, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, who wasnominated by former President Joe Biden, said the vote will exacerbate economic disparities. “Those with sufficient internet access are increasingly separated from those without, and this decision risks widening that gap even further,” Gomez said.

The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commissionare inviting the public to submit commentsabout harmful practices in live ticketing as part of efforts to “identify unfair and anticompetitive” behavior in the industry. In March, President Donald Trump issuedan executive orderto address unfair practices in the ticketing industry, such as scalpers using bots to buy up massive amounts of tickets. He directed the FTC and DOJ to enforce competition laws, as well as file a report about their progress within six months. The agencies plan to use the public comments to inform their recommendations. Ticketmaster has been under closer regulatory scrutinyafter its site crashedwhen Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour tickets went on sale in November 2022, sparking outrage among fans andeven Swift herself. TheDOJ filed an antitrust lawsuitagainst Ticketmaster and its parent company, LiveNation, last year, claiming their illegal monopoly results in higher ticket prices for consumers. You can submit your comments about the live ticketing industry onthe Regulations.gov websitefrom now until July 7th. “We will continue to closely examine this market and look for opportunities where vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws can lead to increased competition that makes tickets more affordable for fans while offering fairer compensation for artists,” Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said in the press release.

Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said a \"breakthrough\" deal with the U.K. would include \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports,\" specifically agricultural products. He added that the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. The final details are being written and will be delivered in the coming weeks, the president said. \"We still have our 10% tariff on which will produce $6 billion of revenue for the United States,\" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during the White House briefing, referring to a10% tax on imported goodsfrom all U.S. trade partners, including Britain, imposed by Mr. Trump in April. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost trade between the two countries and create jobs. \"This is a really fantastic, historic day in which we can announce this deal between our two great countries,\" Starmer  said over the phone during the White House announcement. \"I think it's a real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\" Britain says the deal will cuttariffson U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. News of a potential deal inflated investor confidence Thursday, with markets making gains in early trading. Following the trade deal announcement, the S&P 500 soared 55 points, or 1%, to 5,686 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408 points, or 1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3%. More trade deals are also in the works,accordingto President Trump. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation. Mr. Trump imposed levies ofas high as 145%on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods. Forbusinesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoinguncertaintyon where the U.S. economy is headed. A10% baseline tariffon most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-calledreciprocal tariffsagainst other countries — with theexception of China—are pauseduntil July. The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\"Liberation Day\" tariffson April 2. Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow. \"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\" While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits. Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer. Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch. Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly. \"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\" Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said. The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan. It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India — countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest. Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June. What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.  President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, butChina deniedany talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place. The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administrationannouncedTuesday. Apostfrom the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\" A spokesperson for the embassy said in astatementWednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly oppose[s] the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\" In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according toBloomberg. The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal. \"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note. Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\" \"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\" While it's hard to predict whatotherpotential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding. In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs. \"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said. Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\" The Associated  Presscontributed to this report.

    "title": "Read Pope Leo XIV's first address",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 8, 2025 / 5:36 PM EDT/ CBS News In his first address Thursday,Pope Leo XIVspoke of peace, building bridges and helping people who are suffering. The themes of his speech seemed to suggest he would have continuity with his predecessor Pope Francis, whom Leo XIV thanked in his remarks. Standing on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica with a large crowd of people in St. Peter's square, Leo XIV spoke in both Italian and Spanish. Here's a translation of his speech: Peace be with you all! Dearest brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the Risen Christ, the good shepherd who gave his life for the flock of God. I too would like this greeting of peace to enter your hearts, to reach your families, to all people, wherever they are, to all peoples, to the whole earth. Peace be with you! This is the peace of the Risen Christ, a disarmed peace and a disarming, humble and persevering peace. It comes from God, God who loves us all unconditionally. We still keep in our ears that weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis blessing Rome. The Pope who blessed Rome gave his blessing to the world, to the entire world, that morning of Easter Day. Allow me to follow up on that same blessing: God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail! We are all in God's hands. Therefore, without fear, united hand in hand with God and among ourselves, let us move forward. We are disciples of Christ. Christ precedes us. The world needs his light. Humanity needs him as the bridge to be reached by God and his love. Help us too, and then each other to build bridges, with dialogue, with encounter, uniting us all to be one people always in peace. Thank you Pope Francis! I also want to thank all my brother cardinals who have chosen me to be the Successor of Peter and to walk together with you, as a united Church always seeking peace, justice, always trying to work as men and women faithful to Jesus Christ, without fear, to proclaim the Gospel, to be missionaries. I am a son of Saint Augustine, an Augustinian, who said: \"with you I am a Christian and for you a bishop.\" In this sense we can all walk together toward that homeland that God has prepared for us. To the Church of Rome, a special greeting. We must seek together how to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, dialogue, always open to receiving, like this square, with open arms. All, all those who need our charity, our presence, dialogue and love. And if you will allow me a word, greetings to everyone and especially to my dear diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, where a faithful people accompanied their bishop, shared their faith and gave so much, so much to continue to be a faithful Church of Jesus Christ. To all of you, brothers and sisters of Rome, of Italy, of the whole world, we want to be a synodal Church, a Church that walks, a Church that always seeks peace, that always seeks charity, that always tries to be close especially to those who suffer. Today is the day of the Supplication to Our Lady of Pompeii. Our Mother Mary always wants to walk with us, be close, help us with her intercession and her love. So I would like to pray with you. Let us pray together for this new mission, for the whole Church, for peace in the world and let us ask this special grace to Mary, our Mother.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 8, 2025 / 5:10 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —President Trump celebrated the election of the first U.S.-born pope, calling it a \"Great Honor\" thatRobert Francis Prevost, who choseLeo XIV as his papal name, was selected Thursday as the first pontiff to hail from the U.S. \"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\" After an event at the Oval Office, Mr. Trump told reporters that \"we were a little bit surprised and very happy\" to learn the new pope is an American. Leo, 69 wasborn in Chicagoandattended Villanova Universitybefore becoming a missionary in Peru. He was elected and accepted his fate as the next Bishop of Rome, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics earlier Thursday. The U.S. has the fourth-largest Catholic population, after Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines. Thelate Francis Iwas the first pope born in the Western Hemisphere, as a native of Buenos Aires.

    "title": "How U.S. Catholics see the role of the Church and the pope in their lives — CBS News poll",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 7, 2025 / 8:11 PM EDT/ CBS News Most U.S. Catholics say they rely on the pope and the Church's teachings for difficult moral questions, this is particularly the case for those who call themselves strong Catholics. For most U.S. Catholics, their Catholic faith is important in their daily lives, including many who call it extremely or very important.  (Behind this is a big difference however. Their Catholic faith is especially important to those who routinely go to Mass, but less so for those who rarely or never go.) The pope is, for a majority of U.S. Catholics, equally important in their connection to the Church as their local priest and parish. But the next pope will also lead a U.S. laity with some differences within it. A sizable number of the U.S.' current Catholics feel they have become less connected to the Church over their lives. They aren't frequent mass attenders and don't currently consider themselves very strong Catholics. This group tends to be a little older than those who say their connection hasn't changed, and are relatively less likely to prioritize tradition over change. Just under half of Catholics today don't feel the Church is in touch with their personal needs. (This, even as Catholics overall said the Church is more in touch now after Francis' papacy compared to before it.) One reason why those who feel the Catholic Church is out of touch with their own needs, say so: reports of past sexual abuse of children by priests.  It's a matter most Catholics think has been handled poorly by the Vatican. Relatively fewer, although sizable numbers, point to the church's political views and stands on issues like abortion and divorce, or church doctrine itself, as reasons they feel the church is out of touch with their needs. Those who think it is out of touch still mostly believe the Church respects women as much as men, just not to the extent that those who call it \"in touch\" do. Big majorities feel the Catholic Church currently provides them with spiritual guidance, forgiveness from sin, along with connection to tradition and belonging and community. And they'd like the next Pope to be someone compassionate, also most want one who'd be outspoken. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S.  interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the 2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

    "title": "New pope's social media posts offer some insight into his politics",
    "article_text": "In this day and age, even the holy leave social media trails. Thenew pope'sonline footprint was quickly dissected Thursday just minutes after he was elected the next head of the Catholic Church, sparking a mixed reaction from some on the right. Before hebecamePope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost occasionally posted on social media, including some messages that appeared to be critical of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their worldview. His most recent activity on X came in mid-April, whenhe shared a post on his accountfrom a Catholic commentator who called out Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for laughing about thedeportation of Kilmar Abrego Garciaof Maryland. The post linked to an article published by the Catholic Standard newspaper, in which Bishop Evelio Menjivar asked of Catholics about Abrego Garcia: “Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?” In February, Prevostposted linksto stories that were critical of Vance, including one from the National Catholic Reporter. Prevost repeated the headline on X: “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.\"In the article, the writer rebutted Vance’s claim in a Fox News interview that Christians prioritize loving people close to them before those from other countries. Reached for comment Thursday, the White House directed NBC News to a post on X by Vance. Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and happened to meet with Pope Francis the day before he died, congratulated Prevost on being elected the first American pope. \"I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”hewroteon X. Trump alsooffered his congratulations. “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope,” he wrote on Truth Social. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!” Other reposts from Prevost's X account have suggested he supports protecting immigrants, reducing gun violence andcombating climate change. The day after the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Prevostshared a post from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,that said: \"To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers. None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\" Also in 2017, Prevost reposted someone who wasdefendingimmigrantswho came to the UnitedStatesillegally as children, known as Dreamers. \"I stand with the #Dreamers and all people who are working toward an immigration system that is fair, just, and moral. #DefendDACA #DACA,\" the post said. In a matter of hours, his X account had added more than 200,000 followers. Still, the new pope has not been a prolific poster — and much of what he shared was fairly standard Catholic fare — so his social media posts don't give a complete picture of all his political views. Some conservative commentators have already seized on Prevost's posts and comments. Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator andclose Trump ally, published a series of posts decrying Leo’s politics. “Just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican,”she wrote. Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was more neutral in his reaction to Prevost's election. \"Let’s just say, not so great tweets about having some willingness for open borders. We’ll see kind of how he is on that. Also some George Floyd stuff that I’m not too crazy about,\" he said in avideoon X. \"But overall, it seems like he’s a pro-life warrior. There’s a lot yet to learn about this pope, but I hope that he will be a strong advocate for strong borders. And for sovereignty.” In 2020, Prevostreposted tweetsoffering prayers anda message of support for Floyd, whose murder by a Minneapolis police officer led toa national reckoningon race relations and policing. Other Republicans, like former President George W. Bush, had more positive reactions. Bush said in a statement that it's a \"historic and hopeful moment for Catholics in America and for the faithful around the world.\" Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat and only the second Catholic to be elected to the White House, alsovoiced support for the new pope on X: \"Habemus papam — May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\"",

    "article_text": "Robert Francis Prevost,elected Thursday as the first pope from the United States, will soon have the opportunity to declare where he stands on some of the church's most pressing topics. But first, many wanted to know his leanings on a different topic. Is Prevost, a Chicagoan, a fan of the Cubs or the White Sox? Prevost’s brother Johntold NBC Chicagothat, contrary to speculation, his brother rooted for the city's South Side team. “Whoever said Cubs on the radio got it wrong,\" John Prevost said. \"It’s Sox.\" The question of his rooting interests was one of immediate fascination as soon as Prevost was announced Thursday as the newest leader of the 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide. Within hours of his election, the Cubs — 41 years after longtime broadcaster Harry Caray celebrated an unlikely victoryby shouting, \"The good Lord wants the Cubs to win!\" — claimed Prevost as one of their own on social media. Their mother was a Cubs fan, having been raised on Chicago's North Side, famously the home of the Cubs' Wrigley Field, John Prevost toldWGN-TV. Their father, he added, was a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals. Yet the man who would go on to become pope had a different belief system, his brother said. \"He was never, ever a Cubs fan,\" John Prevost told WGN. The White Sox, who have had little go right on the field in recent seasons, were quick to play up a rare bit of good news, saying they had already sent a jersey and a hat to the Vatican. “Family always knows best, and it sounds like Pope Leo XIV’s lifelong fandom falls a little closer to 35th and Shields,” the team told NBC Chicago. “Some things are bigger than baseball, but in this case, we’re glad to have a White Sox fan represented at the Vatican.” Though the new pope spent decades of his adult life working in Peru, his Chicago roots led to speculation and jokes on social media about his sports leanings. Though faith has dominated Prevost's life, sports have also played a role. Prevost, a 1977 graduate of Villanova University,retweeted in 2016 a postcongratulating the university on its recent NCAA men's basketball national championship. And asked ina 2023 interviewhow he liked to spend his free time, he said, \"I consider myself quite the amateur tennis player. \"Since leaving Peru I have had few occasions to practice, so I am looking forward to getting back on the court,\" he said. \"Not that this new job has left me much free time for it so far.\" Neither will his new one.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Thursday night that he is appointing Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., calling her \"incredibly well qualified for this position\" and \"in a class by herself.\" Trump made the announcement onhis Truth Social, mentioning Pirro's previous roles as a prosecutor and a judge, and said she was \"currently Co-Host of The Five, one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television.\" NBC News reported Thursday that Trump was strongly considering Pirro for the position. Trump announced earlier in the day that he waswithdrawing the nomination of conservative activist Ed Martinto stay on as the top federal prosecutor in Washington on a permanent basis. ABC Newsfirst reportedTrump was considering Pirro to take over the job on an interim basis. Martin's role as acting U.S. attorney is set to end May 20. Follow live politics coverage here In a statement after Trump's announcement, a Fox News spokesperson said Pirro \"has been a wonderful addition toThe Fiveover the last three years and a longtime beloved host across FOX News Media who contributed greatly to our success throughout her 14-year tenure. We wish her all the best in her new role in Washington.\" Pirropushed conspiracy theoriesabout voting in the aftermath of Trump's 2020 election loss, and she came up in litigation filed by Dominion Voting Systems. Fox News tried to redact what one of Pirro's executive producers thought about one of her post-2020 election monologues, with the producer writing, “This is completely crazy.” Fox News and Dominionreached a $787.5 million settlement in the defamation lawsuitin 2023. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said this week that he could not support Martin, a “stop the steal” organizer, for the position, citing concerns over his associations with Jan. 6 rioters. Trump lauded Martin in aTruth Social postThursday night and said he will be moving to the Justice Department to serve as the new director of the \"Weaponization Working Group,\" as well as associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney. Trump added that Martin will investigate what he called \"the Weaponization of our Government under the Biden Regime.\" Pirro has not been as closely aligned with Capitol attack defendants as Martin, but she fed some of the conspiracy theories that precipitated the 2021 riot. Three days before the attack,Pirro on the aircompared disruption of Congress' planned certification of the 2020 election results to soldiers who fought in the American Revolutionary War. \"These hungry, tired, cold, defeated soldiers knew that it was their moment to stand up and fight for freedom. To many, Jan. 6 is such a moment,\" she said. \"As we are all being told to shut up and move on, Jan. 6 will tell us whether there are any in Congress willing to battle for the America that those soldiers fought for, the one that you and I believe in.\" Three days after the attack, Pirro condemned the events,saying they were\"deplorable, reprehensible, outright criminal,\" and she said members of the movement should stop looking for others to blame. \"Take the veil of politics off. Be totally objective. Anyone watching this must condemn it,\" she said.",

    "title": "Trump operation against Houthis cost more than $1 billion",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s fight against the Houthis never dealt a crippling blow to the militant group, but it has cost America more than $1 billion since March, including the thousands of bombs and missiles used in strikes, along with seven drones shot down and two fighter jets that sank, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the cost. After weeks of operations by the U.S., the Houthis seemed to still be able to strike outside Yemen, launching an attack that targeted Israel’s main international airport just this week.  But the surprise deal that Trump announced Tuesday, in which the U.S. would suspend strikes and other operations against the Iran-backed Houthis in exchange for the group halting its attacks on U.S. ships, might be enough to declare mission accomplished, for now. Details about the deal have been sparse. It is still unclear how it was made, how long it might last and what it meant in the long term for a conflict that began weeks after Hamas — which, like the Houthis, is backed by Iran — attacked Israel in October 2023. What is known is that the agreement, which was brokered in part through the Omani government, according to two U.S. officials, pertains only to U.S. ships. The Houthis are expected to continue firing on Israel and on other countries’ ships. “The administration was clearly looking for an off-ramp for this campaign against the Houthis,” said one U.S. official familiar with the military operations against the Houthis. Success in the fight since March was hard to measure: U.S. drones sent to determine if targets had been hit were often shot down by the Houthis and there were no American forces on the ground in Yemen who could assess the effectiveness of the campaign for the Pentagon, the official said. But the effort under Trump came at great cost and was depleting American stockpiles, the two U.S. officials said. Since March 15, when the Trump administration announced its current campaign against the Houthis, known as Operation Rough Rider, the Pentagon has expended roughly 2,000 bombs and missiles worth more than $775 million against the group, according to the two U.S. officials briefed on the cost. That includes hundreds of 2,000-pound bombs; which can cost $85,000 apiece; at least 75 Tomahawks, which run about $1.9 million apiece; at least 20 AGM 158 air-launched cruise missiles at about $1.5 million per missile; and many other munitions. After this article was initially published, a Defense Department official told NBC News that these munitions cost figures are inaccurate and overstated, saying they’re closer to $400 million. But other defense officials disputed that. The U.S. also spent at least $10 million moving at least two Patriot missile defense systems and military supplies to sustain the systems to the region by ship, according to a U.S. military tally provided to NBC News. That does not include the cost of equipment it moved by air. During congressional testimony last month, Adm. Sam Paparo, who heads U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said the military used 73 C-17 flights in moving a single Patriot air defense system from his region to the Middle East. A C-17 costs about $27,000 per hour to fly, and the U.S. military moved two Patriot systems to the region. But there was mounting concern that the Trump administration’s approach to fighting the Houthis would never be long term. “Washington has little patience and a short attention span and was unlikely to commit the resources and high-level attention necessary to see this campaign through to a meaningful outcome,” said Dana Stroul, who was the top policy official for the region at the Pentagon during the Biden administration. If the agreement Trump announced Tuesday holds, it could allow the U.S. to justify suspending operations against the Houthis but it won’t likely change the reality that the Houthis can still be disruptive to shipping in the Red Sea. “The Houthis will stop shooting at U.S. ships for some period of time,” said Stroul, now the research director at the Washington Institute. “But they will not stop firing missiles at Israel, commercial shipping will not return, and nothing will change in the Yemen civil war,” she said. After the Houthis began attacking international shipping in the Red Sea following the Hamas attack on Israel in 2023, the Biden administration began a campaign against the Houthis to help restore what is called “freedom of navigation” — the ability of ships to move unmolested by hostile forces. Those operations did little to degrade the group, critics of the Biden administration’s approach have said. In March, Trump administration officials announced they would increase pressure on the group. A second aircraft carrier and its attendant ships were brought into the region;NBC News reported lastmonth that a number of missile defense platforms, including the two Patriot mobile missile defense systems and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system, were also moved in. Under Trump, Army Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, who leads U.S. Central Command, was given wide-ranging authorities to go after the group. Under then-President Joe Biden,many of Kurilla’s plans to attack the Houthis had not been approved. But there were divisions within the Trump administration over just how far the campaign against the Houthis should go. NBC News has reported that Biden officials had put together a blueprint for devastating the Houthis that required a long-term commitment and felt they were in a position to put that blueprint into action at the start of this year but held off to avoid boxing in their successors and gave the plans to the incoming Trump administration. While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke publicly of their ambitions to decimate the Houthis, U.S. and foreign officials said privately they didn’t think Trump had the stomach or the long-term commitment required to get the job done. Divisions within the administration about the campaign spilled into public view after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with multiple top officials. The published logs of the group chat showed Vice President JD Vance expressing concern that Trump did not know what he was getting into and suggesting the U.S. had no business deepening its role in the area. If the Houthis hold up their end of the deal and refrain from attacking American ships, it will be enough for the Trump administration to justify ending its role in the fight against the group, Stroul said. “Washington can send a ship through the Red Sea and claim freedom of navigation has been restored.”",

    "title": "Some podcasters fear Spotify's new play count will crowd out smaller shows",
    "article_text": "Some podcasters raised concerns this week over a new Spotify feature that will publicly display how many plays each podcast episode gets. The streaming service on Tuesdayannounced the rollout of its “Plays” metric, calling the feature “another invaluable source of insight” for creators “as they look to optimize their content for success.” But after the announcement, some podcasters — particularly those with smaller, niche followings — said they think the new feature could actually turn listeners away. “It’s like the social media-ification of podcasts now,” said Adrienne Cruz, a podcast manager who represents four small podcasts. Traditionally, “podcasting has been such a good fertile ground for small creators,” saidCruz. The medium, which first emerged in the mid-2000s, was a small, niche market until the industry’s first big hit, “Serial,” helped propel it into the mainstream. Inrecent years, simpler, personality-driven shows have taken off, giving hosts like Joe Rogan massive success across platforms like Spotify, SiriusXM, YouTube and Apple. With Spotify’s new feature, Cruz and others said they worry the already crowded podcasting space could turn into a “popularity contest.” “Hey!!! As one of your biggest creators — WE DONT WANT THIS! This is going to hurt so many podcasts,”  “The Psychology of your 20s” podcast, which has almost 200,000 followers on Instagram, wrote onSpotify’s post announcing the news. “Public metrics don’t support the creator community — they discourage experimentation and amplify comparison. This doesn’t help us grow; it makes us hesitate,” another podcaster wrote. A spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment. In itsblog post unveiling the feature, Spotify said it aims to “give creators more comprehensive insight into the scale and depth of their audience.” “For creators, plays will be a key metric on the home dashboard, show overview, and individual episode analytics pages, offering a near-immediate snapshot of how content is performing based on active engagement,” the streaming service said. Some podcasters celebrated having more access to data. Dr. Mikhail “Mike” Varshavski, a physician who talks about medical issues and hosts “The Checkup with Doctor Mike,” called the news “AWESOME.” “I’ve been desperate for this feature to roll out to begin building a better understanding of what episodes are performing well,” he said in a statement sent via Spotify to NBC News. “This has been foundational to success on YouTube, studying successful videos, and now we can do the same on Spotify.” But others responded to the news on social media by asking ifSpotify would let them opt outof the new feature. They pointed out that the listens-per-episode number would only reflect the plays on Spotify, and not across platforms, possibly misleading audiences and potential brand partners. “This is actually a disservice to a lot of smaller shows, and it won’t reflect the other places people listen to or watch podcasts,”“Gabbing with Gib”hostGibson Johns commentedon Spotify’s announcement. “You should consider letting podcast creators hide this metric.” Cody Dueitt, the host of the “Pray Before Chips” podcast, said that while he’s happy with the base of core listeners he's built, he thinks the feature could have a negative toll on podcasters with smaller followings. \"What about the smaller ones? ... we’ve been grinding and grinding and trying to make it happen, but we only have, you know, who knows how many listeners we have, truly,\" he said. While he's been podcasting since 2018, Dueitt estimates the most plays he's ever gotten on an episode was about 200. Janny Perez, host of the “Latina Mom Legacy” podcast, worried her followers wouldn’t see her reach across other platforms. “I have a larger audience in the whole scheme of things, right?” said Perez. If brands are making their decision to work with creators based on the number of listens an episode gets, Perez said, “that could potentially hurt you and prevent you from potentially earning money.” Spotify said plays will be rounded to the nearest thousandth or millionth. For the first 24 hours after publishing, episodes will display a “new” label instead of a play count as they build up initial listens. After that period, episodes with fewer than 1,000 plays will display <1K and will refresh approximately every hour. Spotify also plans to improve the product over time. Play counts will be reflected across the Spotify app and in the Spotify for Creators and Megaphone dashboards “starting this week,” the platform said.",

    "title": "Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel confirms he's considering a run for governor",
    "article_text": "CLEVELAND — Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, a Republican and a former Ohio State football coach, confirmed Thursday that he is considering a run for governor in 2026. Tressel, who previously said he was not thinking about a bidbut stopped short of ruling one out, indicated in a statement first shared with NBC News that his thinking has changed. “What has been a surprise, and it has been humbling, is how many people are encouraging me to run for Governor,” Tressel said in the statement, after emphasizing how much he was enjoying his current job. “I have not decided yet, but when I became Lieutenant Governor in February, Ellen told me that it seemed like God had more work for me to do, and she was right,” Tressel added, referring to his wife. “While I have not ruled out a run for Governor — and there will be a time in the future for those conversations — for now, I will remain focused on helping Ohioans get off the sidelines and into our workforce so they can reach their full potential.” Follow live politics coverage here Tressel’s statement came ahead of ameeting Fridayat which the Ohio Republican Party’s state central committee will consider issuing an early endorsement for the May 2026 primary. Allies of Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur whose candidacy for governor is backed by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, are pushing hard to win the endorsement over state Attorney General Dave Yost. But term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine has been calling committee members urging them to hold off, citing the possibility that other candidates could jump in the race,NBC News reportedthis week. DeWine’s effort has been viewed by many party insiders as a move to keep the state party from committing advertising and organizational resources to Ramaswamy before Tressel makes a decision. The governor picked Tressel to be his deputy less than three months ago, immediately triggering speculation that he was grooming him for even higher office. “I think he would like to forestall an endorsement taking place, because I think he would like to see if he can convince Jim Tressel to run for governor,” one Republican leader in the state said of DeWine this week. DeWine chose Tressel in February after he appointed his previous lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to fill the Senate vacancy Vance left when he became vice president. In a statement Tuesday, DeWine stressed that it is too soon to take sides in the race to succeed him. “As far as who I endorse in the Republican primary for Governor, it is much too early, as we do not even know who all will be in the race,” he said. “We are now 364 days away from the primary and 293 days away from the filing deadline. In politics, this is a lifetime!” Tressel, 72, won multiple national championships as a college football coach, first guiding the lower-division Youngstown State Penguins to four titles in the 1990s before jumping to the Big Ten and winning the 2002 national championship with the Ohio State Buckeyes in his second year as head coach there. Heresigned from Ohio Statein 2011 with the football program mired in controversy and an NCAA investigation involving players selling memorabilia to a tattoo parlor. Public and internal polling has shown Ramaswamy, 39, with a sizable lead over both Yost and Tressel. An outside group supportive of Ramaswamy hasalready spent millionsto amplify Trump’s endorsement in TV ads. And Vance has directed some of his top political advisers tohelp steer Ramaswamy’s campaign. Donald Trump Jr. urged state central committee members Wednesday to ratify his father’s choice, while conceding that “early endorsements aren’t the norm.” “We have a country to save, and we don’t have any time or money to waste,” Trump Jr. wrote in apost on X. “President Trump endorsed Vivek, in one of his very first 2026 endorsements, for a reason: We need Vivek in Ohio, and Ohio needs Vivek as its Governor.” On the Democratic side, Dr. Amy Acton, who was DeWine’s health director in the early days of the Covid pandemic, has launched a campaign for governor. Former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his Senate seat last year, and former Rep. Tim Ryan, who lost to Vance in the 2022 Senate race, are among the other Democrats considering running. Democrats have not won the governorship in Ohio since 2006, and the state has leaned even further to the right in recent cycles, with Trump winning by comfortable margins in all three of his presidential campaigns.",

    "title": "Why Asian and Mexican immigrants, moments away from being deported to Libya, never left the U.S.",
    "article_text": "A Filipino immigrant detained in Texas described being woken up at 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday by armed guards in tactical gear, being told he was being sent to Libya, and then waiting for hours on a bus at a military base outside a military plane, his lawyer said. The flight never took off and he was sent back to solitary confinement in the Texas facility along with the other 12 detainees, mostly from Asian countries, the immigrant’s lawyer, Johnny Sinodis, told NBC News. The immigrant requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation. The immigrants, including people from the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Mexico, would later learn that their attorneys filed an emergency motion after reports that the Trump administration had planned to send a group of immigrants to Libya. A federal judge then enforced a previous order Wednesday afternoon, halting deportations to third countries. Tin Nguyen, another immigration attorney whose client was aboard the bus, said that though the deportation was halted, many continue to be on edge over the possibility of being sent to a country that is unfamiliar to them and has been criticized for major human rights abuses. “Libya or El Salvador or Rwanda … it’s very scary for people,” Nguyen, who’s based in North Carolina, said. “People don’t know anything about these countries, and what they have heard about them is very terrifying.” The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment on questions related to the deportation flight and legal motion. Last week, a judge granted a preliminary injunction, ruling that prior to removing any noncitizen to a third country, the Trump administration must take several steps to ensure they receive adequate due process. Sinodis said that his client had been told earlier this week by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents that he was being sent to Libya. Days later, the detainees were given a few minutes to gather their belongings before being processed out of the facility, shackled and shuffled onto a bus, the attorney said. The detainees were eventually taken back to the facility and released to the facility’s general population by the next morning. Sinodis criticized the process as both legally concerning and inefficient. Sending an immigrant from Mexico across the world, for example, makes little sense, he said. “I mean how much money does it cost to send someone from Mexico to Libya?” he said. “You can just drive someone to Mexico.” Nguyen recounted a similar chain of events, adding that his client, who’s Vietnamese, had previously been threatened with the prospect of being sent to Libya. At one point, the detainee and others were ordered to sign a document agreeing to be deported to the country, according to the emergency motion filed on Wednesday, in which Nguyen’s client is a plaintiff. “He didn’t read the document. He can’t read [English] and it wasn’t translated in Vietnamese, or through an interpreter. So he refused to sign,” Nguyen said. “And because he refused to sign, he was separated from the other folks.” The emergency motion said that detainees who refused to sign off on the removal to Libya were put in separate rooms, “cuffed in” and forced to provide their signatures for the document. After hours on the tarmac, Nguyen said his client called his wife. “They were not intermingling with the general population or with each other, but they were able to make phone calls,” Nguyen said. Nguyen said it’s unclear what will happen next, but his client would rather be sent back to Vietnam than a third country. “This time around I’m helping folks speed up the process of actually trying to get the travel documents from Vietnam, so people can just go to Vietnam,” the attorney said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month at a Cabinet meeting that the United States is “actively searching for other countries to take people.” “We are working with other countries to say, ‘We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries,’” Rubio said. “‘Will you do that as a favor to us?’ And the further away the better, so they can’t come back across the border.” Reports of plans to send migrants to Libya drew backlash from immigration and humanitarian advocates. Libya has long been criticized for its treatment of migrants. TheIndependent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya,established by the United Nations Human Rights Council, found in its report from 2023 that it was likely that “crimes against humanity were committed against Libyans and migrants throughout Libya.” The report documented examples of “arbitrary detention, murder, torture, rape, enslavement, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing and enforced disappearance, confirming their widespread practice in Libya.” The State Department’s own website cautioned against traveling to Libya, classifying the country as under a Level 4, the highest advisory level due to a “greater likelihood of life-threatening risks.” Libya’s provisional Government of National Unity said on social media that it is not coordinating deportations with the United States and that it rejects using the country as a destination for deported immigrants without its knowledge or consent. “The Government categorically denies the existence of any agreement or coordination with it regarding the reception of any migrants deported from the United States,” it said.",

    "title": "Key New York Republicans reject 'insulting' offer on 'SALT' tax break",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Four New York Republicans issued a blistering joint statement Thursday rejecting an offer they said came from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the House's top tax writer on how to expand the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT. Their firm opposition in the narrowly divided House spells trouble for GOP leaders as they hope to advance the tax part of their party-line bill for President Donald Trump’s agenda through committee next week. They can ultimately afford to lose only three Republican votes on the House floor. Lifting the $10,000 cap on SALT deductions, which was imposed by Trump's 2017 tax law, is a make-or-break issue for several GOP lawmakers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, who have been negotiating with party leaders on a compromise. But Reps. Elise Stefanik, Andrew Garbarino, Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler said Johnson and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., are proceeding with a policy to lift it to $30,000, which they consider woefully insufficient. “We’ve negotiated in good faith on SALT from the start—fighting for the taxpayers we represent in New York. Yet with no notice or agreement, the Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap—an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support,” the four Republicans said in the statement. “It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse. A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness,” they added. “We reject this offer.” LaLota has been the loudest voice for expanding the SALT deduction. And Lawler and Stefanik areconsidering runningfor governorin New York, where the issue looms large. Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee met privately a few hours earlier to resolve their differences ahead of the committee's markup next week. SALT is one of several difficult issues they must address. Earlier in the day, before the House adjourned for the week, Johnson suggested when a reporter asked about a possible $30,000 SALT cap that the issue was not yet settled. “I’ve heard that number, and I’ve heard others, as well, but it’s still an ongoing discussion amongst the members, and I think we’ll find the right point,” Johnson said. “I’m not going to handicap it. ... We want to make sure that most of the constituents, that the large share, the vast majority of the constituents of the affected districts, are covered by that. And I think we can find the right number that’ll do it and satisfy all the various concerns about it.” A spokesperson for the Ways and Means Committee did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Notably, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., a rare member of the \"SALT Caucus\" who is on the Ways and Means Committee, did not sign on to Thursday's statement. She said Wednesday that the issue was still a work in progress. “We’ll get there. It’s just a little work. We have very SALT-y members, and then we have the low-sodium members,” Malliotakis told NBC News. “We've just got to find that compromise.”",

Though Kaavia’s long-awaited arrival was joyous, Union recently shared that using a surrogate had an extreme emotional cost. “I’ll never have peace with it, ever,” Union toldMarie Clairein an interview published on May 7. “It’s such a personal journey that I may never know full peace with the coulda, woulda, shouldas.” Kaavia is now a thriving 6-year-old and Union said she is “very grateful to our gestational caregiver,” however, she didn’t mince words when sharing how turning to surrogacy affected her. “For me, it felt like failure. My body failed. It just felt like such a f------ public humiliation,” she said in the interview. She had previously shared that she struggled through years of failed IVF cycles and aroundeight or nine miscarriages(there were so many she lost count). “Surrogacy felt like a cuckold; watching somebody do something I can’t do. To be there for somebody else succeeding where I failed — it is a mind f--- for people who have had my journey and who feel similarly.” Union knows that some people who haven’t needed to consider surrogacy may judge her for doing so, but she hasn’t heard negative feedback so far. She explained that “nobody has the balls to say that s--- to my face, so I don’t say s--- because nobody’s said s---.” Her own attitude may have played a part in the type of responses she has received. “I lead with anI don’t give a f---attitude,” she said. “If I had the ability to do this myself, I would’ve. Your baby’s here and your baby’s awesome. My baby’s here and my baby’s awesome.” Regardless of the way Kaavia — or herthree stepchildrenfrom Wade’s previous relationships — entered her life, Union seems to be thriving as a mother. “Nothing we have done as parents feels revolutionary or groundbreaking. It just feels like common sense, kindness, compassionate,” she said. And it was all worth it. Union shared that becoming a mother has brought her “unmitigated joy.”",

    "title": "Who is the new Pope Leo XIV and what are his views?",
    "article_text": "By Juliana Kim , Ayana Archie Pope Leo XIV greets the public for the first time from the main balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption About 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide have a new spiritual leader:Pope Leo XIV. The election of Robert Francis Prevost, who chose the name Leo XIV, as the 267th leader of the Roman Catholic Church marks two historic firsts. Leo is the first-ever U.S.-born pope to lead the church and the first pope from the Augustinian order. On Thursday, the new pope appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered a short speech. His opening words were \"Peace be with all of you!\" The 69-year-old pontiff added that he wanted his message of peace to \"enter your hearts, reach your families and all people, wherever they are.\" During his address, he spoke in Italian, Spanish and Latin. The new pope thanked his fellow cardinals for selecting him. He also expressed gratitude to his former diocese in Peru and spoke warmly of Pope Francis, his late predecessor, before ending his remarks with a prayer. Leo is known to share some of the same priorities as Francis, particularly when it comes to the environment and outreach to migrants and the poor, according toThe College of Cardinals Report,a resource created by a team of Vatican journalists. On his X account, Leo has recently posted and reposted content critical of President Trump's immigration approach and of Vice President JD Vance'sviews on religion. He also shared messages in support of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests in the aftermath of thekilling of George Floyd. \"We need to hear more from leaders in the Church, to reject racism and seek justice,\"he saidin a 2020 tweet. The new pope was born in Chicago in 1955, according toVatican News. His father is of French and Italian descent, while his mother is of Spanish descent. Leo studied at the Minor Seminary of the Augustinian Fathers. He went on to attend Villanova University in Pennsylvania, where he received a degree in mathematics. He later pursued his theological education at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Although the new pontiff is American, one of the most significant chapters of his ministry took place in Peru. Prevost served there for roughly two decades. He was appointed as Bishop of Chiclayo in 2014, promoted to archbishop in 2023, and then cardinal in the following year. Over the course of his career, he has also taught canon law, patristics and moral law. Rev. Robert Hagan, Prior Provincial of the Province of St. Thomas of Villanova,told NPR's All Things Consideredthat he was a student when he met Pope Leo over dinner. Hagan said that back then he could tell that Leo embodied the core value of Augustinian Fathers — friendship. \"We are speechless,\" Hagan said. \"We really are, we're overjoyed. When he appeared on that balcony it was like seeing a family member step up and we're just so happy. Not just for him but for the world.\" An earlier version of this story misspelled Robert Francis Prevost's middle name as Frances. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Bilal Kuchay , Diaa Hadid A man stands inside his house destroyed by Pakistani artillery shelling in the village of Salamabad, India, Thursday.Sajjad Hussain/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Pakistan's army said itshot down25 military drones that fanned over population centers — including the city that houses Pakistan's general army headquarters. By Thursday evening, residents in Indian border towns reported hearing blasts. Authorities announced blackouts along parts of the border, and the Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken to thePakistani prime ministerand theIndian foreign minister, urging \"immediate de-escalation\" by both countries. This followed India'smissile attacks across Pakistanin the early hours Wednesday, in what has been the latest ratcheting of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries that began with gunmen killing Indian tourists in late April. \"This is a serious, serious provocation,\" Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen.Ahmed Sharif Chaudharysaid of the Indian drones in an English-language statement. \"It appears that India has apparently lost the plot. Rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment.\" Amid the tensions,the U.S. Consulate Generalin Lahore, Pakistan, directed its staff to shelter in place. Operations weresuspendedin Indian and Pakistani airports near their border. School was out in border areas ofboth PakistanandIndia. Parents on one Pakistani WhatsApp group exchanged emergency checklists that included baby milk powder and coloring books to keep kids busy. \"Stay calm, stay prepared. May we all remain safe,\" the list concluded. The escalation began after India accused Pakistan of being behindan attackwhere gunmen killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in India-administered Kashmir on April 22. It was the worst attack against Indian civilianssince 2002, and it sparked outrage across India after eyewitnesses reported the gunmen specifically targeted Hindu men. Pakistan denies any connection to the attack. The Himalayan territory is divided between India and Pakistan; both countries claim it in its entirety. Paramedics carry an injured tourist at a hospital in Anantnag, south of Srinagar, on April 22, following an attack. Gunmen in Indian-administered Kashmir opened fire on a group of tourists in one of the worst attacks targeting civilians for years in the region.Tauseef Mustafa/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption In the early hours on Wednesday, India struck what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" across Pakistan, in the most widespread strikes it had conducted against its neighbor since the two sides went to war in 1971. India described the strikes as retribution. Pakistan said the strikes and subsequent shellingkilled 31 people, including children. Pakistan's military said it downed five Indian aircraft, which India did not comment on. India accused Pakistan of killing 16 civilians in cross-border fire. On Thursday morning, residents reported hearing the sound of blasts in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, near an old airport. Muhammad Abbas, a 47-year-old groundskeeper in an upscale Lahore suburb, was washing a car when he heard a bang. He said \"a few people were frightened,\" but otherwise, people carried on. \"Pakistani people are not cowards who hide in their houses. Whatever happens, will happen to all of us.\" The blasts appeared to be related to one of the drones, which army spokesman Sharif said had \"managed to engage a military target near Lahore.\" He said four army personnel were injured in that incident. India's information ministrysaid its armed forces \"targeted Air Defence Radars and systems at a number of locations in Pakistan,\" and added \"it has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised.\" A Kashmiri man using a cellphone light during a blackout is seen after residents of the city of Jammu reported hearing explosions and sirens in Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Thursday.Mukhtar Khan/APhide caption By Thursday evening, blasts could be heard above the towns in Jammu, Achabal and Anantnag in Indian-administered Kashmir. An Indian army spokesperson, Suneel Bartwal, told NPR that districts along the line that separates India and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir \"have been put on high alert. A blackout is in place.\" Any new development could change calculations on either side, saidAjai Shukla, a strategic affairs commentator and retired Indian army colonel. \"The potential for greater escalation is very high.\" Both countries had a deep bench of military capabilities, he said. \"They've barely touched the surface so far.\" On Thursday, Indian residents piled by the roadside to watch security forces gathered around one fallen projectile in a field in the village ofMakhan Windi, some 25 miles from the Pakistani border. The mood was more curiosity than fear. A post shared by NPR (@npr) But in Poonch, a town in Indian-held Kashmir, local resident Narendar Singh said most of his neighbors had fled after Pakistani shelling. Resident Sarfaraz Ahmad Mir said Pakistani shelling overnight killed his cousins, a twin boy and girl aged 11-years-old. \"This shouldn't have happened,\" Mir said. \" They shouldn't have targeted civilians at all.\" Even as hostilities gripped the public's attention, human rights activists said Indian authorities had rounded up and detained more than 30 Rohingya refugees from their homes in the Indian capital, including the elderly parents of David Nazir. Nazir said his wife was spared, because she was pregnant. Nazir said he, and some other Rohingya managed to flee, and slept in a park. A lawyer, Colin Gonsalves, who is representing the detained people, said the government appeared to have taken advantage of the situation to detain the men. Delhi police did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In his call with Pakistan's prime minister, Secretary of State Rubio \"expressed U.S. support for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan and encouraged continued efforts to improve communications,\" according to a State Department statement. Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst for India with International Crisis Group, said the international community needed to take the conflict between India and Pakistan seriously. \"Both are nuclear powers. And all it takes is a miscalculation or a mistake,\" Donthi said onNPR'sMorning Edition. \"Both these powers are not completely in control of the escalation dynamics, which the world seems to believe. So there lies the risk.\" Army personnel examine the remains of a projectile discovered in Makhanwindi village near Amritsar, India, on Thursday.Raminder Pal Singh/ANI Photo via Reutershide caption He said Washington had the best chance of ending the hostilities, because of the country's historic ties with Pakistan, and its increasing closeness to India. \"Ultimately,\" he said, \"the U.S. is the superpower who can bring both the parties to the table.\" Diaa Hadid reported in Mumbai, India.

    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Cam Hamilton, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security oversight hearing of FEMA on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.Jose Luis Magana/APhide caption WASHINGTON — The Federal Emergency Management Agency faced fresh upheaval Thursday just weeks before the start of hurricane season when the acting administrator was pushed out and replaced by another official from the Department of Homeland Security. The abrupt change came the day after Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL who held the job for the last few months, testified on Capitol Hill that he did not agree with proposals to dismantle an organization that helps plan for natural disasters and distributes financial assistance. \"I do not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,\" he said Wednesday. President Donald Trump has suggested that individual states, not the federal government, should take the lead on hurricanes, tornadoes and other crises. He has been sharply critical of FEMA's performance, particularly in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa, will run FEMA for the time being. He does not appear to have any experience in managing natural disasters. He currently serves as the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction. FEMA staff were notified of the change in leadership through a brief email. Last month, Trump, a Republican, created a review council tasked with \"reforming and streamlining the nation's emergency management and disaster response system,\" according to Homeland Security. During Hamilton's appearance before a House Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday, he shared concerns about how FEMA assistance is administered. He also said the agency had \"evolved into an overextended federal bureaucracy, attempting to manage every type of emergency no matter how minor.\" But when Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, asked Hamilton how he felt about plans to eliminate FEMA, Hamilton said he did not believe the agency should be eliminated. \"Having said that,\" Hamilton continued, \"I'm not in a position to make decisions and impact outcomes on whether or not a determination such as consequential as that should be made. That is a conversation that should be had between the president of the United States and this governing body.\" In a statement Thursday afternoon, DeLauro expressed support for Hamilton and accused Trump of firing \"anyone who is not blindly loyal to him.\" \"The Trump administration must explain why he has been removed from this position,\" said DeLauro. \"Integrity and morality should not cost you your job.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "RFK Jr. says autism database will use Medicare and Medicaid info",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise NIH Director Jayanta Bhattacharya, left, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speak before a news conference at the Health and Human Services Department on April 22.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption The National Institutes of Health will use information from federal health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid to create a \"real-world data platform\" to determine the cause of autism, the agencyannounced this week. The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement on Wednesday that the NIH would team up with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to create the database utilizing insurance claims, electronic medical records and data from wearable devices with health sensors, like smartwatches. \"We're using this partnership to uncover the root causes of autism and other chronic diseases,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. HHS said that CMS and NIH would establish a data use agreement focused on Medicare and Medicaid enrollees — about 36% of Americans — and follow autism diagnoses before expanding their research into additional chronic health conditions. \"Using ASD [Autistic Spectrum Disorders] as the pilot research program, teams at CMS and NIH will establish a secure tech-enabled mechanism to enhance this data sharing with timely, privacy and security compliant data exchange,\" the statement read. There was outragelast monthafter NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya told his staff of plans to compile a database of Americans with autism using private data that could be used to create a national autism registry Unnamed HHS sources toldmultiplenewsoutletsthat the agencies are not creating an autism registry and described the effort instead as a real-world data platform linking existing datasets. NPR has not independently confirmed the reporting. In Wednesday's statement, NIH's Bhattacharya said that the partnership with CMS was \"an important step in our commitment to unlocking the power of real-world data to inform public health decisions and improve lives.\" \"Linking CMS claims data with a secure real-world NIH data platform, fully compliant with privacy and security laws, will unlock landmark research into the complex factors that drive autism and chronic disease — ultimately delivering superior health outcomes to the Americans we serve,\" he said. NPR has reached out to HHS, NIH and CMS, but none responded to requests for comment before publication of this story. The latest details immediatelyraised more alarm bellsfor the autistic community and privacy experts, who questioned how this data would be used and how patients' sensitive data would be protected. Helen Tager-Flusberg is the director of the Center for Autism Research at Boston University and leader of the Coalition of Autism Scientists, an organization formed in response to Kennedy's widely debunked views on autism. She warned of the potential for information collected in this database to be abused. \"CMS data includes certain information about individuals — age/date of birth, sex, where they live. It is possible to identify a person based on knowledge about these characteristics,\" Tager-Flusberg said in an email to NPR. \"While the NIH Director provides assurances that privacy protections will be put in place, we have seen other examples of how this administration has given permission to identify people to certain people working for the federal government. How will this registry be protected?\" she asked. The heightened public focus on autism comes as Kennedy has repeatedly vowed to identify the cause of the disorder and ultimately eradicate it. To that end, Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has made a number of baseless, conspiratorial claims about autism, including that it can be traced back to childhood vaccinations and that an \"environmental toxin\" is to blame for the uptick in autism diagnoses over the years. He described autism as \"a preventable disease\" and said his agency would find the root cause of the disorder by September. The notion that vaccines cause autism has beenthoroughly debunkedin medical science, and experts say there is likely no single cause for autism. Bhattacharya, the NIH director, pushed back on the September deadline to find a cause and said that a year timeline was more realistic. And while a Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreportdid find that autism prevalence in the United States had increased from 1 in 36 children five years ago, to 1 in 31 children in 2022, it is more likely that this is due in large part to more comprehensive screening across a broader population.

Below is a transcript of the speech, translated from its original Italian. Peace be with all of you!Dearest brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the Risen Christ, the good shepherd who gave his life for God's flock. I, too, would like this greeting of peace to enter your hearts, to reach your families, and all people,  wherever they are, all of the people, all over the earth. Peace be with you! This is the peace of the Risen Christ, an unarmed peace and a disarming peace, humble and persevering. It comes from God, God who loves us all unconditionally. We still have in our ears that weak, but always courageous voice of Pope Francis as he blessed Rome! The Pope who blessed Rome, gave his blessing to the world, to the entire world, that Easter morning. Allow me to follow up on that same blessing: God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail! We are all in the hands of God. Therefore, without fear, united hand in hand with God and among ourselves, we move forward. We are disciples of Christ. Christ precedes us. The world needs his light. Humanity needs him as the bridge to allows it to be reached by God and by his love. Help us, too, and help each other to build bridges, with dialogue, with meetings, uniting us all to be one people, always in peace. Thank you, Pope Francis! I also want to thank all my brother cardinals who have chosen me to be Peter's Successor, and to walk together with you, as a united Church always seeking peace, justice, always seeking peace, justice, always seeking to work as men and women whoare faithful to Jesus Christ, without fear, to proclaim the Gospel, to be missionaries. I am a son of Saint Augustine, an Augustinian, who said: \"with you I am a Christian and for you I am a bishop\". In this sense, we can all walk together towards that homeland that God has prepared for us. To the Church of Rome, a special greeting! We must seek together how to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, dialogue, always open to receive like this square with its open arms, all, all who need our charity, our presence, dialogue and love. And if you allow me a word, a greeting to all and especially to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, where a faithful people accompanied their bishop, shared their faith and gave so, so much to continue being a Church that is faithful to Jesus Christ. To all of you, brothers and sisters of Rome, of Italy, of the whole world, we want to be a Church of the Synod, a Church that walks, a Church that always seeks peace, that always seeks charity, that always seeks to be close, especially to those who suffer. Today is the day of the Supplication to Our Lady of Pompeii. Our Mother Mary always wants to walk with us, to be close, to help us with her intercession and her love. So, I would like to pray together with you. Let us pray together for this new mission, for the whole Church, for peace in the world and let us also ask Mary, our Mother, for this special grace.

    "title": "World Central Kitchen closes soup kitchens across Gaza due to dwindling supplies",
    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By The Associated Press Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Monday.Abdel Kareem Hana/APhide caption DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza — Israel's ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance for Gaza forced a leading aid group to shut its community soup kitchens Thursday as it faced empty warehouses and no replenishment of supplies in the war-battered enclave. U.S.-based World Central Kitchen, which was serving 133,000 meals per day, said there is almost no food left in Gaza with which to cook. The ongoing hunger is threatening Gaza's population, already battered by 19 months of war. In April, the World Food Program said its food stocks in Gaza had run out under Israel's blockade, ending a main source of sustenance for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the territory. A UNICEF spokesperson said most of Gaza's water system is damaged, while fuel shortages make it harder to operate desalination plants or water trucks. Malnutrition and hunger are becoming increasingly prevalent in the Gaza Strip as Israel's total blockade enters its third month, and aid agencies say supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition are running out. Israel imposed the blockade on March 2, then shattered a two-month ceasefire by resuming military operations in the territory on March 18. It said both steps aim to pressure the militant Hamas group to release hostages. Rights groups call the blockade a \"starvation tactic\" and a potential war crime. With restaurants and bakeries closed, community kitchens are often the only way for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza to eat a daily meal. But a third of those supported by the U.N. have closed in the past 10 days for lack of food or fuel, according to the U.N. humanitarian office, or OCHA, which said more closures could be imminent. \"The hot meals provided by these kitchens constitute one of the last remaining lifelines\" for Palestinians, OCHA said. At those still open, chaotic scenes of desperate men, women and children fighting to get meager rations are common. UNICEF spokesperson Jonathan Crickx on Thursday said 65-70% of Gaza's water system is damaged. Aid workers have instead set up water distribution points that rely on trucking. But it's difficult to reach people when fuel has become scarce, Crickx told The Associated Press. \"The children are, of course, bearing the brunt of this war,\" he said. Water availability has plummeted to an average of 3-5 liters per person per day, according to the Palestinian Water Authority. That's less than the 15 liters that the World Health Organization says people need to survive. A pipeline operated by Israel had been supplying 70% of Gaza City's water since the war began, but it was damaged with the renewed Israeli offensive in April. Desalination plants had supplied about 7% of Gaza's water needs before the war, until the aquifer became contaminated and depleted. Since the start of the war, World Central Kitchen said it has served more than 130 million meals and baked 80 million loaves of bread. On Thursday, the group said it had no flour left in their mobile bakery. \"Our trucks — loaded with food and supplies — are waiting in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, ready to enter Gaza,\" said José Andrés, the celebrity chef who founded the organization. \"But they cannot move without permission. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to flow.\" COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid to Gaza, said the blockade would continue unless the Israeli government changed its policy. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said the government was concerned that Hamas controlled the humanitarian aid, and that Israeli officials were exploring ways to get it only to \"those in need.\" Mencer said the hunger had been \"engineered by Hamas,\" and said the blockade would end when the group lays down its weapons, he said. However, Israel has provided no evidence that Hamas syphons off aid. The U.N and aid workers deny there is significant diversion of aid to militants, saying the U.N. strictly monitors distribution. Since the start of the year, more than 10,000 children have been treated for acute malnutrition, according to the World Health Organization. The number climbed dramatically in March, to 3,600 cases from 2,000 the month before, UNICEF reported. Nearly half the 200 nutrition centers around Gaza have shut down because of displacement and bombardment. World Central Kitchen had previously suspended operations in April of last year after seven aid workers were killed in Israeli strikes on their convoy, before resuming weeks later. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said Thursday the bodies of 106 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 367 wounded, the ministry said in its daily report. The overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war rose to at least 52,760 since Oct. 7, 2023, the ministry said. Another 119,264 have been wounded, it said. It said the tally includes 2,651 dead and 7,223 wounded since Israel shattered the nearly two-month ceasefire on March 18. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the dead were women and children. The Israeli military said they are targeting Hamas infrastructure in Gaza. On Wednesday, chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told commanders that Israel plans to \"expand and intensify our operations\" in Gaza. Also on Thursday, a series of Israeli airstrikes hit hilltops in the vicinity of the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh, killing at least one person and wounding eight others, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. The Israeli military said it bombed infrastructure that belonged to the Hezbollah militant group and included weapons and tunnels. Israel said that Hezbollah's activities at the site violated a November ceasefire. Hezbollah did not immediately comment on the strikes. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said public institutions in the area were closed after the attacks as families rushed to schools to take their children home. Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November stopped the war between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon have continued. Hezbollah says its has largely disarmed south of the Litani River, while Israel insists the militants are rearming themselves. Some 4,000 people in Lebanon were killed during the war, including many civilians. A renowned Palestinian journalist arrested by the Israeli military and suffering from multiple chronic illnesses has been placed on six months of administrative detention, the Israeli military said. Ali Samoudi, who has worked for international news outlets including CNN and Al Jazeera, was detained late last month by the Israeli military from his family home in the city of Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and has spent part of the time in the hospital due to chronic health issues. The Israeli military said Samoudi was detained based on involvement in \"actions endangering regional security\" but that a police investigation did not find sufficient evidence against him to issue an arrest. However, on Thursday, a military court decided to place him under administrative detention for six months. Israeli authorities can renew administrative detentions indefinitely. Detainees are held without charge or trial. Israel says the controversial tactic is necessary for security reasons, but Palestinians and rights groups say the system denies due process and is widely abused.

    "title": "Trump administration unveils a plan to modernize the air traffic control system",
    "article_text": "By Jaclyn Diaz , Scott Neuman U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy speaks at an event unveiling a new U.S. air traffic control system at the Department of Transportation on Thursday in Washington, D.C.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says he wants a full modernization of the nation's antiquated air traffic control system within four years. On Thursday, he announced a far-reaching, estimated multibillion-dollar plan that would drastically overhaul the current technology used by thousands of controllers responsible for guiding planes in and out of airports. Duffy and other Trump administration officials unveiled the ambitious modernization plan afterseveral days of turmoilat Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the nation's busiest. \"A lot of people have said: This problem is too complicated, too expensive, too hard,\" Duffy said at an event at Department of Transportation headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"But we are blessed to have a president who actually loves to build and knows how to build.\" He said President Trump \"doesn't want to pass this problem to the next administration, the next secretary, or the next set of victims.\" Duffy was cagey about saying what this plan will cost. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee estimated last week that it might cost $12.5 billion to modernize the air traffic control system. Duffy said he estimates this project will cost more than that. The Modern Skies Coalition, a group of aviation industry experts, pilot association representatives and others, issued a statement saying they believe a minimum of $18.5 billion in additional emergency funding (on top of the $12.5 billion figure being floated) should be appropriated over the next three years. And that's in addition to FAA's annual technologies and facilities budget. The DOT isproposingto replace the existing decades-old telecommunications, radio and surveillance systems (which currently rely on things like copper wires and floppy disks) with modern technology. The plan also includes investing in new ground radar sensors on tarmacs and at airports, a new flight management system and some new air traffic control towers and other facilities, Duffy said. The plan will need approval from Congress and to get this done within four years, the secretary is requesting Congress provide the funding up front, rather than incrementally. Trump has endorsed the plan, even joining Duffy at the press conference via speakerphone. Airline executives and trade representatives attended the plan's unveiling, expressing full backing of the proposal. \"We can't kick the can down the road. We need to do it now,\" said Nicholas Calio, president and CEO of Airlines for America, a trade association for the aviation industry. The control tower at Reagan National Washington Airport is shown on Jan. 30, in Arlington, Va.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption Theplan comes after years of mounting problems at airports and a series of incidents just this year. In January, themidair collisionof an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial airliner near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (known by the airport code DCA) led to the deadliest aviation accident in the U.S. since 2001. In the months since, multipleclose callsand other crashes, as well as technology failures that led to delays and cancellations at Newark airport spurred officials to act. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy expressed full support for the plan saying, \"An aging system poses an untenable risk to safety. I said it after DCA, I'll say it again now: an untenable risk to safety.\" Bad weather,the months long renovation of one of Newark'sbusiest runways for departing flights and a shortage of air traffic controllers have led to more than a week of of long delays and cancellations at the airport. On April 28, air traffic controllers stationed at the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, which is responsible for separating and sequencing planes in and out of Newark, lost all radar and communications with planes, leaving them unable to hear or talk to the pilots for at least 30 seconds. Some controllers took leave \"to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages,\" the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. The chaos at Newark helped highlight the aging air traffic technology the industry relies on and spurred officials to do more. To address the situation, the FAA this week announced several changes, including introducing three \"new, high-bandwidth telecommunications connections\" between the New York station that processes radar data and the Philadelphia location where controllers handle Newark's arrivals and departures. The old, copper telecommunications connections will get a fiber-optic technology update, allowing for greater bandwidth and speed, the agency said. Stephen Creamer, the president & CEO of the Air Traffic Control Association, an industry group, said he was encouraged by the administration's commitment to vital upgrades and bipartisan support in Congress. \"Today was all about leadership. It was all about political purpose and will — setting the stage for all of those plans to be built,\" he said. \"They've taken advantage of recommendations from across the industry,\" he added. \"Now, with political support, they have the shot in the arm they need to get this done.\" Last week, Duffyannounceda new recruitment award and retention incentive program to boost hiring of controllers. But staffing is not part of this new, wider proposal introduced Thursday. Following the recent chaos at Newark, the Trump administration has railed against former President Joe Biden and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, blaming them for the issues with the air traffic control system. Trump took tohis Truth Social accountThursday to say: \"Air Traffic problems caused by the incompetent Biden Administration, as headed by, in this case, a total novice and political hack, Pete B. I WILL FIX IT!!!\" During his first term, Trump discussed possible solutions — includingprivatizing air traffic control— thatwent nowhere. After taking office for the second time, the Trump administration laid off hundreds of FAA employees as part of a federal effort to cut back on workers. Officials said controllers and other \"critical safety personnel\" were not among those laid off. But problems with the civilian aviation industry did not start with Newark, the Jan. 29 crash at DCA or the Biden administration. Airlines and unions have called on the government to do more for decades. Under the Biden administration, Buttigieg asked Congress to provide more funding to hire thousands of new air traffic controllers. House Republicans blocked that effort. In September,the Government Accountability Office saidthe FAA needed to make drastic changes, and fast, to fix the aging air traffic control system. The report found that in the previous year, the FAA determined more than a third of its systems \"are unsustainable, citing outdated functionality, a lack of spare parts, and more.\" The report said most modernization projects won't be completed for another 10-13 years. Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation industry analyst, who spoke to NPR earlier this week about the disruptions at Newark, expressed skepticism that a new system will be built. \"This has been the same mantra for the past 30 years. Give them more money. They'll build the new system. It'll work better, work harder. And this is what airlines tell the FAA. This is what the FAA says they want to do each time the agency comes up for reauthorization. And we've been doing that for well over 30 years now, and we've gotten the same results,\" Mann said. Sheldon Jacobson, a University of Illinois professor who has studied risks in aviation, says that the system works remarkably well as is. But he agrees that an upgrade is critical. Still, he points out that the pilot error accounts for three-quarters of all aviation incidents. \"Would improving ATC reduce that?

    "title": "States try to revive Medicaid work requirements, worrying some low-income Americans",
    "article_text": "By Alexandra Olgin Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks at a campaign rally for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, in Nov., 2024. In January, Sanders announced plans to reprise an effort to institute work requirements for Medicaid, as Arkansas did under the first Trump administration.Evan Vucci/APhide caption More than 70 million Americanswho are low-income or disabled have health insurance paid for by the state and federal government called Medicaid. The main qualification currently is that you have to make below a certain income level. But there's an idea that's been popular with Republicans – that all those individuals shouldalsobe required to work. While Republicansintroduced a bill to create a national work requirement,states have a lot of flexibility to add their own rules.Arkansas and 12 other statesgot the greenlight to add these work requirements during the first Trump Administration, but after just a few months, courts halted those plans. Now that Trump is back in the White House, states including Arkansas, Ohio and Arizona are reviving the effort – which concerns some Medicaid patients and advocates. Summer Neal, 31, relies on a lot of medications to keep her healthy. The Paragould, Arkansas resident suffers from lupus, an auto-immune disease that causes joint pain and leaves her susceptible to frequent illnesses. \"Someone can have a cold and it'll turn into the flu for me, or pneumonia,\" Neal says, \"I've had COVID 11 times.\" Thanks to Arkansas' Medicaid, Neal is able to afford her essential doctor visits and medications. But in December, when Neal went to pick up her prescription to manage pain and inflammation, the pharmacist told her that she no longer had insurance coverage and she owed more than $1,000. \"I was really worried,\" Neal recalls, leaving the pharmacy empty handed. \"If I don't have a steroid to keep this inflammation down, the amount of pain that I am in is almost unbearable.\" The situation turned out to be a paperwork error, but it created a two-month nightmare for Neal. She said she ended up delaying paying her rent to afford some medications. Neal does work now, as a manager at a pizza restaurant, but her income is low enough to qualify for Medicaid. And she worries that if she gets sicker, she could have to stop working -- and lose her Medicaid coverage. That's because in January, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sandersannounced plansto reprise the requirement the state tried to institute under the first Trump administration. Under current rules, if you are a single adult making about$20,000 a year or less in Arkansas, you can qualify for Medicaid.The proposed rules would add another test – you have to work. \"Most Arkansans work hard to pay for their health insurance, but many of these healthy adults don't work at all and receive it for free,\" Sanders said. In a statement, she said the state is spending$2.2 billion on Medicaid for more than 200,000healthy adults and estimated 40% are not working. The state's plan this time is to offer those peoplestate-funded help finding a joband, only if they refuse, pause their Medicaid coverage. This is different fromtheir attempt in 2018, where if people didn't report that they worked 80 hours a month, they would automatically lose health insurance. \"Once this work requirement starts, we will achieve our goal of moving Arkansans off the path of government dependency and on the path to prosperity,\" Sanders said when announcing the program. However, multiple studies show that more than90 percent of eligible adults on Medicaid nationallyare already working, or are exempt from the requirement because they have disabilities, are in school or are caregiving. Arkansas could get the signoff from the federal government any day now.Ohio and Arizona are waiting on the same approval.Several other states including South Carolina, Idaho and Iowa are also in talks to add their own work rules. Seven years ago when Arkansas did this under the first Trump administration, a third of the eligible adults, or about18,000 people, lost coverage in less than a year.Many were working butdidn't follow the complicated monthly process for reporting work. Fixing those mistakes and helping people regain coverage became Legal Aid of Arkansas attorney Trevor Hawkins' full time job. \"It was my entire day,\" Hawkins said, \"I was able, for a lot of folks, to help them get their coverage back.\" However, many others didn't regain Medicaid. Just atenth of those who lost coverage had itthe next year. In 2019, a federal judgehalted the state's program, ruling that it was illegal and didn't address Medicaid's core purpose of providing medical coverage to low-income individuals. Research from theHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Healthalso found that the rules didn't result in more work. \"It's been tested,\" Hawkins said about the work requirement program, \"It's a bad investment.\" In order to implement these work rules, states also have to create new tracking and reporting systems which can beexpensive to set up and run. Proponents of work requirements argue that the policy will help lift low-income individuals out of poverty by motivating them to get jobs. ButGideon Lukens, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, believes these work requirements are simply a tactic to shrink Medicaid enrollment. TheCongressional Budget Officehas estimated that imposing work requirements nationwide could save over $100 billion over the next decade – by excluding more people from Medicaid so the government doesn't have to pay for their medications and care. Lukens says, \"When you have people losing coverage, yes, you do pay less money, but you also have extreme hardship.\" States with limited Medicaidcoverage have double the rate of people without insurance, compared with states that have expanded Medicaid coverage. Right now, states are the ones requesting approval for these work changes, but if the proposal from House Republicans for a national work requirement were to pass,The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundationestimate that up to 5 million people could lose coverage.

    "title": "New RSV vaccine, treatment linked to dramatic fall in baby hospitalizations",
    "article_text": "CDC study finds big declines in hospitalizations—and they may be underestimates. Far fewer babies went to the hospital struggling to breathe from RSV, a severe respiratory infection, afterthe debut of a new vaccineand treatment this season, according toan analysis published today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RSV, or respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the US. An estimated 58,000–80,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized each year. Newborns—babies between 0 and 2 months—are the most at risk of being hospitalized with RSV. The virus circulates seasonally, typically rising in the fall and peaking in the winter, like many other respiratory infections. But the 2024–2025 season was different—there were two new ways to protect against the infection. One is a maternal vaccine, Pfizer's Abrysvo, which is given to pregnant people when their third trimester aligns with RSV season (generally September through January). Maternal antibodies generated from the vaccination pass to the fetus in the uterus and can protect a newborn in the first few months of life. The other new protection against RSV is a long-acting monoclonal antibody treatment, nirsevimab, which isgiven to babies under 8 months oldas they enter or are born into their first RSV season and may not be protected by maternal antibodies. For the new study, CDC researchers looked at RSV hospitalization rates across two different RSV surveillance networks of hospitals and medical centers (called RSV-NET and NVSN). They compared the networks' hospitalization rates in the 2024–2025 RSV season to their respective rates in pre-pandemic seasons between 2018 and 2020. The analysis found that among newborns (0–2 months), RSV hospitalizations fell 52 percent in RSV-NET and 45 percent in NVSN compared with the rates from the 2018–2020 period. However, when the researcher excluded data from NVSN's surveillance site in Houston—where the 2024–2035 RSV season started before the vaccine and treatment were rolled out—there was a 71 percent decline in hospitalizations in NVSN. For a broader group of infants—0 to 7 months old—RSV-NET showed a 43 percent drop in hospitalizations in the 2024–2025 RSV season, and NVSN saw a 28 percent drop. Again, when Houston was excluded from the NVSN data, there was a 56 percent drop. Lastly, the researchers looked at hospitalization rates for toddlers and children up to 5 years old, who wouldn't have been protected by the new products. There, they saw RSV hospitalization rates were actually higher in the 2024–2025 season than in the pre-pandemic years. That suggests that the latest RSV season was more severe, and the drops in infant hospitalizations may be underestimates.

    "title": "A Soviet-era spacecraft built to land on Venus is falling to Earth instead",
    "article_text": "Kosmos 482 is encased in a titanium heat shield, with a good chance of reaching the surface intact. Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft shrouded in Cold War secrecy, will reenter the Earth's atmosphere in the next few days after misfiring on a journey to Venus more than 50 years ago. On average, a piece of space junk the size of Kosmos 482, with a mass of about a half-ton, falls into the atmosphere about once per week. What's different this time is that Kosmos 482 was designed to land on Venus, with a titanium heat shield built to withstand scorching temperatures, and structures engineered to survive atmospheric pressures nearly 100 times higher than Earth's. So, there's a good chance the spacecraft will survive the extreme forces it encounters during its plunge through the atmosphere. Typically, space debris breaks apart and burns up during reentry, with only a small fraction of material reaching the Earth's surface. The European Space Agency, one of several institutions that track space debris, says Kosmos 482 is \"highly likely\" to reach Earth's surface in one piece. The Kosmos 482 spacecraft launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, now part of Kazakhstan, aboard a Molniya rocket on March 31, 1972. A short time later, the rocket's upper stage was supposed to propel the probe out of Earth orbit on an interplanetary journey toward Venus, where it would have become the third mission to land on the second planet from the Sun. But the rocket failed, rendering it unable to escape the gravitational grip of Earth. The spacecraft separated into several pieces, and Russian engineers gave up on the mission. The main section of the Venus probe reentered the atmosphere in 1981, but for 53 years, the 3.3-foot-diameter (1-meter) segment of the spacecraft that was supposed to land on Venus remained in orbit around the Earth, its trajectory influenced only by the tenuous uppermost layers of the atmosphere. The mission was part of the Soviet Union's Venera program, which achieved the first soft landing of a spacecraft on another planet with the Venera 7 mission in 1970, and followed up with another successful landing with Venera 8 in 1972. Because it failed, Soviet officials gave the next mission, which would have become Venera 9, a non-descriptive name: Kosmos 482. Over time, the dead spacecraft succumbed to aerodynamic drag, slowly losing altitude before dipping deeper into the atmosphere in recent weeks. In the last few days, Kosmos 482's orbit brought the spacecraft less than 100 miles (150 kilometers) from Earth. This additional aerodynamic drag is hastening the craft's fall from space. As of Thursday, expert predictions centered on a likely reentry of Kosmos 482 early Saturday. But reentry forecasts have large margins of error. Small variations in the density of the upper atmosphere driven by solar activity could bring down the spacecraft sooner or later than expected. TheAerospace Corporation's expertspredict Kosmos 482 will fall to Earth some time nine hours before or after 1:54 am EDT (05:54 UTC) Saturday. The European Space Agency's forecast is centered on 3:12 am EDT (07:12 UTC) Saturday, plus or minus 13.7 hours. The reentry windows will narrow over the next couple of days, but experts won't be able to pinpoint an exact time or location before the spherical spacecraft makes its final plunge. \"As we approach the reentry, the uncertainty in the prediction decreases,\" the European Space Agency wrote on awebsite tracking Kosmos 482. \"The remaining uncertainty is caused by the difficulty of modeling the atmosphere, the influence of space weather, and the unknowns about the object itself, such as which way it is facing.\" However, there are a few things we know about where it will come down. Kosmos 482's flight path takes the spacecraft between 52 degrees north and south latitude on each orbit, so it never flies over the northernmost parts of Canada, Europe, and Russia. As the forecasts become more precise, it will be possible to identify the corridors where Kosmos 482 will fly during the reentry window. A map of Kosmos 482's orbital tracks during the Aerospace Corporation's 18-hour reentry window is shown below. If you go through most of your days without worrying about space junk falling on you, there's little reason for serious alarm now. The Aerospace Corporation says any one individual on Earth is \"far likelier\" to be struck by lightning than to be injured by Kosmos 482. The US government's safety threshold for uncontrolled reentries requires the risk of a serious injury or death on the ground to be less than 1 in 10,000. The Aerospace Corporation projects the risk of at least one injury or fatality from Kosmos 482 to be 0.4 in 10,000 if the descent craft reaches the surface intact. Marco Langbroek, a Dutch archeologist and university lecturer on space situational awareness,wrote on his websitethat the risk of public injury from Kosmos 482 is lower than that from the reentry of a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage. One of those came downuncontrolled over Polandin February, scattering some debris but causing no injuries. Langbroek said the reentry analysis suggests the Kosmos 482 descent capsule will impact the ground or water at about 150 mph (242 kilometers per hour), assuming it makes it to the surface in one piece. The lander carries a parachute that would have slowed its final descent to Venus, but it's not likely that the parachute deployment system still works after 53 years in space. \"There are many uncertain factors in whether the lander will survive reentry though, including that this will be a long shallow reentry trajectory, and the age of the object,\" Langbroek wrote. If you find yourself along one of the lines on this map, perhaps it's worth keeping track of Kosmos 482 over the next couple of days—out of curiosity more than worry. Chances are the spacecraft will fall into the ocean or over an unpopulated area. But what happens in the unlikely event that Kosmos 482 winds up in your yard? \"If Kosmos defies the odds anddoesland in your yard, please don’t touch it!\" the Aerospace Corporation said. \"It could potentially be hazardous, and it is best to notify your local authorities. \"As for keeping it, don’t get your hopes up,\" Aerospace says. \"There is a United Nations treaty that governs found debris—the 1967Outer Space Treaty. It states that countries keep ownership of objects they launch into space, even after those objects reenter and return to Earth. The country that launched the object in this case is Russia, which could request the return of any parts that survived reentry. \"It is also worth noting that the treaty says that the launching country is also internationally liable for damages.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "AI use damages professional reputation, study suggests",
    "article_text": "New Duke study says workers judge others for AI use—and hide its use, fearing stigma. Using AI can be a double-edged sword, according to new research from Duke University. While generative AI tools may boost productivity for some, they might also secretly damage your professional reputation. On Thursday, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)publisheda study showing that employees who use AI tools likeChatGPT,Claude, andGeminiat work face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from colleagues and managers. \"Our findings reveal a dilemma for people considering adopting AI tools: Although AI can enhance productivity, its use carries social costs,\" write researchersJessica A. Reif,Richard P. Larrick, andJack B. Sollof Duke's Fuqua School of Business. The Duke team conducted four experiments with over 4,400 participants to examine both anticipated and actual evaluations of AI tool users. Their findings, presented in a paper titled \"Evidence of a social evaluation penalty for using AI,\" reveal a consistent pattern of bias against those who receive help from AI. What made this penalty particularly concerning for the researchers was its consistency across demographics. They found that the social stigma against AI use wasn't limited to specific groups. \"Testing a broad range of stimuli enabled us to examine whether the target's age, gender, or occupation qualifies the effect of receiving help from Al on these evaluations,\" the authors wrote in the paper. \"We found that none of these target demographic attributes influences the effect of receiving Al help on perceptions of laziness, diligence, competence, independence, or self-assuredness. This suggests that the social stigmatization of AI use is not limited to its use among particular demographic groups. The result appears to be a general one.\" In the first experiment conducted by the team from Duke, participants imagined using either an AI tool or a dashboard creation tool at work. It revealed that those in the AI group expected to be judged as lazier, less competent, less diligent, and more replaceable than those using conventional technology. They also reported less willingness to disclose their AI use to colleagues and managers. The second experiment confirmed these fears were justified. When evaluating descriptions of employees, participants consistently rated those receiving AI help as lazier, less competent, less diligent, less independent, and less self-assured than those receiving similar help from non-AI sources or no help at all. The researchers discovered this bias affects real business decisions. In a hiring simulation, managers who didn't use AI themselves were less likely to hire candidates who regularly used AI tools. However, managers who frequently used AI showed the opposite preference, favoring the AI-using candidates. The final experiment revealed that perceptions of laziness directly explain this evaluation penalty. The researchers found this penalty could be offset when AI was clearly useful for the assigned task. When using AI made sense for the job, the negative perceptions diminished significantly. Notably, the study showed that evaluators' own experience with AI significantly influenced their judgments. In the study, those who used AI frequently were less likely to perceive an AI-using candidate as lazy. The Duke AI study also notes that similar concerns of stigma have historically accompanied other new technologies. From Platoquestioningwhether writing would undermine wisdom, to moderndebatesabout calculators in education, people have long worried that labor-saving tools might reflect poorly on users' abilities. Reif and colleagues suggest this social impact may present a hidden barrier to AI adoption in workplaces. Even as organizations push AI implementation, individual employees might resist due to concerns about how they'll be perceived. That dilemma is apparently already here. In August last year, whilecoveringChatGPT hitting 200 million active weekly users, we mentioned that Wharton professor Ethan Mollick (who frequently researches AI) called people who use AI without telling their bosses \"secret cyborgs.\" Because many companies ban the use of AI outputs, many workers have anecdotally turned to secret AI use. And if that doesn't complicate the picture enough, wepreviously covereda study that adds a different layer to AI workplace issues. Research from economists at the University of Chicago and University of Copenhagenfoundthat while 64–90 percent of workers reported time savings from AI tools, these benefits were sometimes offset by new tasks created by the technology. The study revealed that AI tools actually generated additional work for 8.4 percent of employees, including non-users tasked with checking AI output quality or detecting AI use in student assignments. So, although using AI to do some tasks potentially saves time, employees may be creating additional work for themselves or others. In fact, the World Economic Forum'sFuture of Jobs Report 2025suggested that AI may create 170 million new positions globally while eliminating 92 million jobs, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs by 2030. So the picture is complicated, but it appears the impact of AI on work is ongoing at a steady pace. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

On Wednesday, OpenAIannouncedthat Instacart CEOFidji Simowill join the maker of ChatGPT as \"CEO of Applications\" later this year, according to a company blog post. Simo, who hasserved on the company's boardsince March 2024, will oversee business and operational teams while continuing to report directly to Altman in the newly created role. Altman will remain the primary CEO of OpenAI. According toReuters, Simo spent a decade at Meta, including a stint serving as the head of Facebook from 2019 to 2021. She also currently sits on the board of e-commerce services site Shopify. The announcement came earlier than planned due to what Altman described as \"a leak\" that \"accelerated our timeline.\" At OpenAI, Simo will manage what Altman called \"traditional company functions\" as the organization enters its \"next phase of growth.\" The applications category at OpenAI includes products like ChatGPT, the popular AI assistant. \"Applications brings together a group of existing business and operational teams responsible for how our research reaches and benefits the world,\" wrote Altman in a message to staff later published on the OpenAI website. Simo will transition into her new position at OpenAI over time. Shepostedon LinkedIn that she is \"not going anywhere for a couple of months,\" saying she'll stay on with Instacart for a bit longer as that company appoints a successor. In the message, Altman described Simo as bringing \"a rare blend of leadership, product and operational expertise\" and expressed that her addition to the team makes him \"even more optimistic about our future as we continue advancing toward becoming the superintelligence company.\" Simo becomes the newest high-profile female executive at OpenAI following thedepartureof Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati in September. Murati, who had been with the company since 2018 and helped launch ChatGPT, left alongside two other senior leaders and foundedThinking Machines Labin February. The leadership addition comes as OpenAI continues to evolve beyond its origins as a research lab. In his announcement, Altman described how the company now operates in three distinct areas: as a research lab focused on artificial general intelligence (AGI), as a \"global product company serving hundreds of millions of users,\" and as an \"infrastructure company\" building systems that advance research and deliver AI tools \"at unprecedented scale.\" Altman mentioned that as CEO of OpenAI, he will \"continue to directly oversee success across all pillars,\" including Research, Compute, and Applications, while staying \"closely involved with key company decisions.\" The announcement followsrecent newsthat OpenAI abandoned its original plan to cede control of its nonprofit branch to a for-profit entity.

    "title": "DOGE software engineer’s computer infected by info-stealing malware",
    "article_text": "The presence of credentials in leaked \"stealer logs\" indicates his device was infected. Login credentials belonging to an employee at both the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Government Efficiency have appeared in multiple public leaks from info-stealer malware, a strong indication that devices belonging to him have been hacked in recent years. Kyle Schutt is a 30-something-year-old software engineer who, according toDropsite News, gained access in February to a “core financial management system” belonging to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As an employee of DOGE, Schutt accessed FEMA’s proprietary software for managing both disaster and non-disaster funding grants. Under his role at CISA, he likely is privy to sensitive information regarding the security of civilian federal government networks and critical infrastructure throughout the US. According to journalistMicah Lee, user names and passwords for logging in to various accounts belonging to Schutt have been published at least four times since 2023 in logs from stealer malware. Stealer malware typically infects devices through trojanized apps, phishing, or software exploits. Besides pilfering login credentials, stealers can also log all keystrokes and capture or record screen output. The data is then sent to the attacker and, occasionally after that, can make its way into public credential dumps. “I have no way of knowing exactly when Schutt's computer was hacked, or how many times,” Lee wrote. “I don't know nearly enough about the origins of these stealer log datasets. He might have gotten hacked years ago and the stealer log datasets were just published recently. But he also might have gotten hacked within the last few months.” Lee went on to say that credentials belonging to a Gmail account known to belong to Schutt have appeared in 51 data breaches and five pastes tracked by breach notification serviceHave I Been Pwned. Among the breaches that supplied the credentials is one from 2013 that pilfered password data for3 millionAdobe account holders, one in a 2016 breach that stole credentials for164 million LinkedIn users, a 2020 breach affecting 167 million users of Gravatar, and a breach last year of the conservative news site The Post Millennial. As Lee notes, the presence of an individual’s credentials in such logs isn’t automatically an indication that the individual himself was compromised or used a weak password. In many cases, such data is exposed through database compromises that hit the service provider. The steady stream of published credentials for Schutt, however, is a clear indication that the credentials he has used over a decade or more have been publicly known at various points. In the event, however, that Schutt used the same or similar credentials in systems or machines during his work at CISA and DOGE, attackers may already have been able to access sensitive information he’s privy to. And as Lee noted, the four dumps from stealer logs show that at least one of his devices was hacked at some point. DOGE critics said Lee’s findings are consistent with other operational security gaffes by the office, such as awebsite that could be edited by anyoneand unprecedented and extraordinarily broad access to government data like that stored in thefederal payroll system. “At this point it's difficult not to suspect their awful 0pSec is a choice, and that there are specific people (*ahem* *cough cough* the Russians *cough*) to whom they're leaking secrets, with incompetence being merely plausible deniability for their true, treasonous agenda,” one criticwroteon Mastodon. Representatives at CISA and the Department of Homeland Security—the agency that oversees CISA—didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking confirmation of the report.

    "title": "Trump just made it much harder to track the nation’s worst weather disasters",
    "article_text": "US abruptly stops tracking costs of the most devastating storms. The Trump administration's steep staff cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) triggered shutdowns of several climate-related programs Thursday. Perhaps most notably, the NOAAannouncedit would be shuttering the \"billion-dollar weather and climate disasters\" database for vague reasons. Since 1980, the database made it possible to track the growing costs of the nation's most devastating weather events, critically pooling various sources of private data that have long been less accessible to the public. In that time, 403 weather and climate disasters in the US triggered more than $2.945 trillion in costs, and NOAAnotesthat's a conservative estimate. Considering that CNNnotedthe average number of disasters in the past five years jumped from nine annually to 24, shutting down the database could leave communities in the dark on costs of emerging threats. All the NOAA can likely say is to continue looking at the historic data to keep up with trends. \"In alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) will no longer be updating the Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters product,\" NOAA announced. \"All past reports, spanning 1980-2024, and their underlying data remain authoritative, archived, andavailable,\" NOAA said, but no data would be gathered for 2025 or any year after. According to NCEI'sFAQ, every state has experienced at least one billion-dollar disaster since 1980, while some states, like Texas, have been hit by more than 100. The Central, South, and Southeast regions of the US are most likely to be hurt most by the data loss, as those regions \"typically experience a higher frequency of billion-dollar disasters,\" the FAQ said. Shutting the database down now seems like a bad idea, since the FAQ confirmed \"the number and cost of disasters are increasing over time\" due to factors like people building larger or cheaper properties in vulnerable areas and \"changes in the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.\" Those include notable rises in vulnerability to \"drought, lengthening wildfire seasons in the western states, and the potential for extremely heavy rainfall becoming more common in the eastern states,\" the FAQ said. Previously, the FAQ noted, this database also helped monitor socioeconomic vulnerabilities, helping communities plan to avert future harms by comparing county extreme weather risk scores with county data on minority or elderly populations, as well as populations living with a disability or below the poverty line. Although the database purported to have \"no focus on climate event attribution,\" its tracking appeared to conflict with Trump orders prohibiting DEI andundoing climate initiatives, alongside othercrippling cuts to science. CNN dubbed the database's closure \"another Trump-administration blow to the public’s view into how fossil fuel pollution is changing the world around them and making extreme weather more costly.\" It's unlikely that any private company, nonprofit, or academic research group could replicate the effort, CNN suggested, since private industry otherwise shields its data from public view. Losing the database will not only impact how local governments assess the most devastating weather catastrophes but will also hobble all research dependent on the database to expand analysis of concerning trends. And it comes at a time when the Trump administration is threatening even more cuts at NOAA, planning to eliminate its research division and climate labs, CNNreported.

    "title": "Senate passes “cruel” Republican plan to block Wi-Fi hotspots for schoolkids",
    "article_text": "Senate vote nullifies FCC hotspot-lending program for kids without broadband. The US Senate today voted along party lines to kill a Federal Communications Commission program to distribute Wi-Fi hotspots to schoolchildren, with Democrats saying the Republican-led vote will make it harder for kids without reliable Internet access to complete their homework. The Senate approved a Congressional Review Act (CRA)resolutionto nullify the hotspot rule, which was issued by the Federal Communications Commissionin July 2024under then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. The program would be eliminated if theHouse versionpasses and President Trump signs the joint resolution of disapproval. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas)announcedthe plan in January, saying the FCC program would \"imped[e] parents' ability to decide what their kids see by subsidizing unsupervised access to inappropriate content.\" He also alleged that the hotspot program would shift control of Internet access from parents to schools and thus \"heightens the risk of censoring kids' exposure to conservative viewpoints.\" The Rosenworcel FCC's rule expanded E-Rate, a Universal Service Fund program,allowingschools and libraries to use E-Rate funding to lend out Wi-Fi hotspots and services that could be used off-premises. The FCC rule was titled, \"Addressing the Homework Gap through the E-Rate Program,\" and the hotspot lending program wasscheduled to beginin funding year 2025, whichstarts in July 2025. Today's Senate vote on the resolution of disapproval was 50–38. There was a 53–47vote on Tuesdaythat allowed the Senate measure to proceed to the final step. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)said on Tuesdaythat \"this resolution would prevent millions of students, educators, and families from getting online.\" \"It would be a disgrace if we deprive those students and their families of this vast resource, of literally life-changing access to a really necessary service that helps them not just now but throughout their futures,\" Blumenthal said. \"We ought to expand Internet access, not constrict it. We ought to be enhancing it, not cutting it off.\" Blumenthal pointed out that under a joint resolution of disapproval, the FCC is forbidden to adopt a similar rule in the future. \"I have to ask, really? Are schools and teachers crying out to repeal this rule? Really? No, they are not. How does this proposal make any sense for them or for families? For the parents? For the community? It makes no sense,\" Blumenthal said. Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.)calledthe Republican move \"a cruel and shortsighted decision that will widen the digital divide and rob kids of the tools they need to succeed.\" The FCC previously distributed Wi-Fi hotspots and other Internet access technology through the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) that was authorized by Congress in 2021. After that program was axed last year, the FCC responded by adapting E-Rate to include hotspot lending. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who was elevated to the agency's top spot by Trump in January, voted against the program last year. Carr said in hisdissentthat only Congress could decide whether to revive the hotspot lending. \"Now that the ECF program has expired, its future is up to Congress,\" he said at the time. \"The legislative branch retains the power to decide whether to continue funding this Wi-Fi loaner program—or not. But Congress has made clear that the FCC's authority to fund this initiative is over.\" Overall E-Rate funding is based on demand andcappedat $4.94 billion per year. Actual spending for E-Rate in 2023 was$2.48 billion. E-Rate and other Universal Service Fund programs are paid for through fees imposed on phone companies, which generally pass the cost on to consumers. The House version of the measure to kill the lending program was introduced by Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho). \"E-Rate was designed to ensure schools and libraries have the connectivity they need to educate and serve their communities, not to create a backdoor entitlement program that stretches beyond the law's clear boundaries,\" Fulchersaid in Februarywhen he filed the resolution. \"The FCC cannot be allowed to unilaterally interpret the law in a way that fits their political agenda. The expansion of this program under the Biden administration was a blatant example of overreach that is not only unlawful but also disregards congressional intent.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Report: DOGE supercharges mass-layoff software, renames it to sound less dystopian",
    "article_text": "Report: DOGE software automates layoffs, slashing biggest agencies in a blink. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly overhauled a historically wonky Department of Defense-designed tool that automates layoffs of federal workers. Expected to expedite DOGE's already rushed efforts to shrink the government, the redesigned software could make it easier for DOGE to quickly dismantle the biggest agencies in a blink, sources familiar with the revamptold Reuters. Developed more than two decades ago, AutoRIF (short for automated reductions in force) was deemed too \"clunky\" to use across government, sources told Reuters. In a2003 audit, the DOD's Office of the Inspector General noted, for example, that \"specialized reduction-in-force procedures needed for the National Guard technicians made the module impractical.\" Basically, each department needed to weigh its cuts differently to avoid gutting essential personnel. Despite several software updates since then, Wiredreported, the tool remained subject to errors, sources told Reuters, requiring most federal agencies to continue conducting firings manually rather than risk work stoppages or other negative outcomes from sloppy firings. So far, DOGE has already cut an estimated 260,000 government workers who either were laid off or opted to take buyouts or retire early without using the updated software, a Reuters analysis found. But many more layoffs are coming, as larger agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service plot looming cuts of tens of thousands of workers. In February, Wired first sounded the alarm that workers could soon be fired by an algorithm, and now sources have told Reuters much more about the DOGE-led effort. According to sources, AutoRIF has been rebranded as the \"Workforce Reshaping Tool,\" which is apparently the government's attempt to find a more \"benign-sounding name\" than the somewhat dystopian-sounding AutoRIF. The Workforce Reshaping Tool update was likely spearheaded by a former Tesla engineer, Riccardo Biasini, whose name is attached to a GitHub repository that Wired uncovered. Sources told Reuters that updates included creating a user-friendly web version of the tool, which can provide \"targets for layoffs much more quickly than the current labor-intensive manual process.\" Other improvements include a feature that makes it possible to upload employee data that human resources employees previously had to manually input. And where before AutoRIF could only be accessed by one user to manage an entire agency's layoffs, updates also included enabling multi-user access, which is expected to speed up approvals to further expedite layoffs. In the coming weeks, agencies will get access to this web version for demos and testing, Reuters reported, while noting that the tool appears to be the \"only known example\" of DOGE following through on its mission to modernize the federal government. DOGE has been hit with immense backlash for rash cuts, sparking protests after it gutted popular agencies andmistakenly fired probationary workerswho had to be rehired, either because a court ordered reversals of illegal firings or department heads later flagged laid-off workers as mission-critical. The Elon Musk-led agency is also facinglawsuits seeking to stop mass layoffs, many of which still name Musk as a defendant, despite his recent decision to step away from DOGE toput out fires at Tesla. In particular, efforts to demolish the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau, which somecritics suggest would be a gift to Musk, have sparked protests, while Democrats complained that DOGE seemed to be targeting agencies forcuts that could spare Musk billions in penalties. And certainly among the most recently damning to DOGE's public image, in an interview announcing the sunsetting of the Gates Foundation today, Bill Gatescriticized Musk's DOGE cutsat United States Agency for International Development for \"killing children.\" It seems unlikely that the Workforce Reshaping Tool by any name could fix DOGE's popularity problem, especially if the tool still makes errors but at a much faster clip, experts have warned. A law fellow with the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center, Abigail Kunkler, warned in a Marchblogthat more transparency is needed about AutoRIF's updates. \"It is not clear how AutoRIF has been modified or whether AI is involved in the RIF mandate (through AutoRIF or independently),\" Kunkler wrote. \"However, fears of AI-driven mass-firings of federal workers are not unfounded. Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have made no secret of their affection for the dodgy technology and their intentions to use it to make budget cuts. And, in fact, they have already tried adding AI to workforce decisions.\" Automating layoffs can perpetuate bias, increase worker surveillance, and erode transparency to the point where workers don’t know why they were let go, Kunkler said. For government employees, such imperfect systems risk triggering confusion over worker rights or obscuring illegal firings. \"There is often no insight into how the tool works, what data it is being fed, or how it is weighing different data in its analysis,\" Kunkler said. \"The logic behind a given decision is not accessible to the worker and, in the government context, it is near impossible to know how or whether the tool is adhering to the statutory and regulatory requirements a federal employment tool would need to follow.\" The situation gets even starker when you imagine mistakes on a mass scale. Don Moynihan, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan, told Reuters that \"if you automate bad assumptions into a process, then the scale of the error becomes far greater than an individual could undertake.\" \"It won't necessarily help them to make better decisions, and it won't make those decisions more popular,\" Moynihan said. The only way to shield workers from potentially illegal firings, Kunkler suggested, is to support unions defending worker rights while pushing lawmakers to intervene. Calling on Congress to ban the use of shadowy tools relying on unknown data points to gut federal agencies \"without requiring rigorous external testing and auditing, robust notices and disclosure, and human decision review,\" Kunkler said rolling out DOGE's new tool without more transparency should be widely condemned as unacceptable. \"We must protect federal workers from these harmful tools,\" Kunkler said, adding, \"If the government cannot or will not effectively mitigate the risks of using automated decision-making technology, it should not use it at all.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Microsoft effectively raises high-end Surface prices by discontinuing base models",
    "article_text": "Discontinuation of 256GB models gives older Surface PCs an effective price hike. When Microsoft announced new Surface devices earlier this week, we noted that there wasn't a lot of daylight between the starting prices of the new but lower-end devices ($799 for the12-inch Surface Pro, $899 for the13-inch Surface Laptop) and the starting prices of theolder-but-higher-end Surfaces from last spring($999 for both). It appears Microsoft has quietly solved this problem by discontinuing the 256GB versions of the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 and the 13-inch Surface Pro 11. Microsoft'sretail pages for both deviceslist only 512GB and 1TB configurations, with regular prices starting at $1,199. Though not technically a price hike—the 512GB versions of both devices also cost $1,199 before—it does amount to an effective price increase for last year's Surface hardware, especially given that both devices have user-replaceable storage that can easily be upgraded for less than the $200 that Microsoft charged for the 256GB-to-512GB upgrade. The upshot is that the new Surface PCs make more sense now than they did on Tuesday in relative terms, but it's only because you'll pay more to buy a Surface Pro 11 or Surface Laptop 7 than you would before. The 15-inch version of the Surface Laptop 7 still lists a 256GB configuration and a $1,299 starting price, but the 256GB models are currently out of stock. While the Surface Pro and Laptop getprice hikes that aren't technically price hikes, some Surface accessories have had their prices directly increased. TheSurface USB-C Travel Hubis now $120 instead of $100; theSurface Arc Mouseis now $90 instead of $80, and a handful of replacement parts are more expensive now than they were,according to recent Internet Wayback Machine snapshots. Generally, Surface Pen accessories and Surface Pro keyboard covers are the same price as they were before. Microsoft alsoraised prices on its Xbox consoles earlier this monthwhile warning customers that game prices could go up to $80 for some releases later this year. If you're quick, you can still find the 256GB Surface devices in stock at third-party retailers. For example,Best Buy will sell youa Surface Laptop 7 with a 256GB SSD for $799, $100lessthan the price of the 13-inch Surface Laptop that Microsoft just announced. We'd expect these retail listings to vanish over the next few days or weeks, and we wouldn't expect them to come back in stock once they're gone. Increased import tariffs imposed by the Trump administrationcould explain at least some of these price increases. Though PCs and smartphones are currently exempted from the worst of them (at least for now), global supply chains and shipping costs are complex enough that they could still be increasing Microsoft's costs indirectly. For the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, the decision to discontinue the old 256GB models also seems driven by a desire to make the new 12-inch Pro and 13-inch Laptop look like better deals than they did earlier this week. Raising the base price does help clarify the lineup; it just does so at the expense of the consumer. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump’s NIH ignored court order, cut research grants anyway",
    "article_text": "Officials testified that DOGE was directly involved in hundreds of grant terminations. For more than two months, the Trump administration has been subject to a federal court order stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders. Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order. But new whistleblower records submitted in a lawsuit led by the Washington state attorney general appear to contradict the claim. Nearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted amemo that detailshow the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. The Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases. In the most high-profile case so far, the administration hasyet to comply with a federal judge’s order, upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, requiring it to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March. The records filed in the NIH-related lawsuit last week also reveal for the first time the enormous scope of the administration’s changes to the agency, which has been subject to massive layoffs and research cuts to align it with the president’s political priorities. Other documents filed in the case raise questions concerning a key claim the administration has made about how it is restructuring federal agencies—that the Department of Government Efficiency haslimited authority, acting mostly as anadvisory body that consultson what to cut. However, in depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations. The lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Grants related toresearch in Chinahave also been cut, andclimate changeprojects are under scrutiny. Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, the NIH’s parent agency, told ProPublica in an email that the grant terminations directly followed the president’s executive orders and that the NIH’s actions were based on policy and scientific priorities, not political interference. “The cuts are essential to refocus NIH on key public health priorities, like the chronic disease epidemic,” he said. Nixon also told ProPublica that its questions related to the lawsuit “solely fit a partisan narrative”; he did not respond to specific questions about the preliminary injunction, the administration’s compliance with the order or the involvement of DOGE in the grant termination process. The White House did not respond to ProPublica’s questions. Mike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said. “Our office will use every tool we have to uncover the truth about why these grants were terminated.” Since Trump took office in January, the administration has provided limited insight into why it chose to terminate scientific and medical grants. That decision-making process has been largely opaque, until now. In February, Washington state—joined by Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado, and three physicians—sued the administration after it threatened to enforce its executive orders by withholding federal research grants from institutions that provided gender-affirming services or promoted “gender ideology.” Within weeks, a federal judgeissued an injunctionlimiting the administration from fully enforcing the orders in the four states that are party to the suit. The same day as the injunction, however, the NIH terminated a research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital to develop and study an online education tool designed to reduce the risk of violence, mental health disorders and sexually transmitted infections among transgender youth, according torecords filed in the court case. The NIH stated that it was the agency’s policy not to “prioritize” such studies on gender identity. “Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” thenotice stated, without citing any scientific evidence for its claims. The NIH sent another noticereiterating the terminationfour days later. The Washington attorney general’s office requested thetermination be withdrawn, citing the injunction. But the administrationrefused, claiming that it was in compliance as the termination was based on NIH’s own authority and grant policy and was not enforcing any executive order. The Washington attorney general asked the judge to hold the administration in contempt for violating the injunction. While therequest was denied, the court granted an expedited discovery process to better assess whether the administration had breached the injunction. That process would have required the administration to quickly turn over internal documents relating to the termination. In response, the administrationreinstated the grantfor Seattle Children’s Hospital and declared the discovery process moot, or no longer relevant. However, US District Judge Lauren J. King, who was appointed by former President Joseph Biden,permittedit to continue. In recent months, whistleblowers havemade the plaintiffs in the lawsuit awareof internal records that more closely connect the grant terminations to the administration’s executive orders. In aninternal spreadsheetof dozens of grants marked for cancellation at an NIH institute, the stated reason for termination for several was “gender ideology (EA 14168),” including the grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital. The rationale appears to reference Executive Order 14168, whichbanned using federal fundsto “promote gender ideology,” again seeming to conflict with the administration’s stance that the termination was not based on the executive orders. The termination dates of the grants, according to the spreadsheet, were after the injunction went into effect. Another internal document, which provides extraordinary insight into the administration’s efforts to reshape the NIH, also states the executive order was the impetus for grant terminations. In theMarch 11 memo from Memoli, the NIH cataloged all actions that the agency had taken thus far to align with the president’s executive orders. In a section detailing the steps taken to implement the “gender ideology” executive order, one of the 44 actions listed was the termination of active grants. “NIH is currently reviewing all active grants and supplements to determine if they promote gender ideology and will take action as appropriate,” the memo stated, noting that the process was in progress. While the administration has said in court filings that it is following the judge’s injunction order, the Washington state attorney general’s office told ProPublica that it disagreed. “Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.” In depositions conducted last month as part of the lawsuit, the testimony of two NIH officials also raised questions about why the research grants were terminated and how DOGE was involved. Liza Bundesen, who was the deputy director of the agency’s extramural research office,testifiedthat she first learned of the grant terminations on February 28 from a DOGE team member, Rachel Riley. Bundesen said she was invited into a Microsoft Teams video call, where Riley introduced herself as beingpart of DOGEand working with the Department of Health and Human Services. Riley, a former consultant for McKinsey & Co., joined HHS on January 27, according tocourt filings in a separate lawsuit, and hasreportedly servedas the DOGE point person at the NIH. Theexecutive orderdetailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members theauthority to direct the cancellationof grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations. “She informed me that a number of grants will need to be terminated,” Bundesen testified, adding that she was told that they needed to be terminated by the end of the day. “I did not ask what, you know, what grants because I just literally was a little bit confused and caught off guard.” Bundesen said she then received an email from Memoli, the NIH acting director, with a spreadsheet listing the grants that needed to be canceled and a template letter for notifying researchers of the terminations. “The template had boilerplate language that could then be modified for the different circumstances, the different buckets of grants that were to be terminated,” she said. “The categories were DEI, research in China and transgender or gender ideology.” Bundesen forwarded the email with the spreadsheet to Michelle Bulls, who directs the agency’s Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration. Bundesen resigned from the NIH a week later, on March 7, citing “untenable” working conditions. “I was given directives to implement with very short turnaround times, often close of business or maybe within the next hour,” she testified. “I was not offered the opportunity to provide feedback or really ask for clarification.” Bulls confirmed in her own deposition that the termination list and letter template originally came from Riley. When Bulls started receiving the lists, she said she did what she was told. “I just followed the directive,” she said. “The language in the letters were provided so I didn’t question.” Bulls said she didn’t write any of the letters herself and just signed her name to them. She also said she was not aware whether anyone had assessed the grants’ scientific merit or whether they met agency criteria. The grant terminations related to gender identity did not stem from an independent agency policy, she testified, appearing to contradict the administration’s assertion that they were based on the agency’sown authority and grant policy. As of April 3, Bulls said she had received more than five lists of grants that needed to be terminated, amounting to “somewhere between five hundred and a thousand” grants. Most grant recipients endure a rigorous vetting process, which caninvolve multiple stages of peer reviewbefore approval, and before this year, Bulls testified that grant terminations at the NIH have historically been rare. There are generally two main types of terminations, she said, for noncompliance or based on mutual agreement. Bulls said that she has been “generally involved in noncompliance discussions” and sinceshe became the directorof the office in 2012, there had been fewer than five such terminations. In addition to the termination letters, Bulls said she relied on the template language provided by Riley to draft guidance to inform the 27 centers and institutes at the NIH what the agency’s new priorities were to help them scrutinize their own research portfolios. Following the depositions, the Washington state attorney general’s office said that the federal government has refused to respond to its discovery requests. It has filed a motion to compel the government to respond, which is pending. Riley, Bundesen, Bulls, and Memoli did not reply to ProPublica’s requests for comment. While the administration did not answer ProPublica’s questions about DOGE and its involvement in the grant terminations, last week in itsbudget blueprint, it generally justified its proposed cuts at the NIH with claims that the agency had “wasteful spending,” conducted “risky research” and promoted “dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.” “NIH has grown too big and unfocused,” the White House claimed in its fiscal plan, adding that the agency’s research should “align with the President’s priorities to address chronic disease and other epidemics, implementing all executive orders and eliminating research on climate change, radical gender ideology, and divisive racialism.” Jeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.” “It is profoundly distressing to see this great institution being reduced to a lawless, politicized organization without much focus on its actual mission,” he said.

    "title": "Google hits back after Apple exec says AI is hurting search",
    "article_text": "Google doesn't think Eddie Cue is right about search. Theantitrust trialtargeting Google's search business is heading into the home stretch, and the outcome could forever alter Google—and the web itself. The company is scrambling to protect its search empire, but perhaps market forces could pull the rug out from under Google before the government can. Apple SVP of Services Eddie Cue suggested in his testimony on Wednesday that Google's search traffic might be falling. Not so fast, says Google. In an unusual move, Google issued a statement late in the day afterCue's testimonyto dispute the implication that it may already be losing its monopoly. During questioning by DOJ attorney Adam Severt, Cue expressed concern about losing the Google search deal, which is a major source of revenue for Apple. This contract, along with a similar one for Firefox, gives Google default search placement in exchange for a boatload of cash. The DOJ contends that is anticompetitive, and its proposed remedies call for banning Google from such deals. Surprisingly, Cue noted in his testimony that search volume in Safari fell for the first time ever in April. Since Google is the default search provider, that implies fewer Google searches. Apple devices are popular, and a drop in Google searches there could be a bad sign for the company's future competitiveness. Google'sstatementon this comes off as a bit defensive. Here it is in full: We continue to see overall query growth in Search. That includes an increase in total queries coming from Apple’s devices and platforms. More generally, as we enhance Search with new features, people are seeing that Google Search is more useful for more of their queries—and they’re accessing it for new things and in new ways, whether from browsers or the Google app, using their voice or Google Lens. We’re excited to continue this innovation and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O. Cue's testimony suggests that more people are switching to AI-based ways of finding information, including ChatGPT, Perplexity, and others. Dropping search traffic on Apple devices, which recently integrated a heap of AI features, would be a bad sign. And indeed, the markets took it as one. Google's stock price cratered 8 percent late on Wednesday. This dramatic reaction is probably what prompted Google's terse statement. This is clearly a sore spot for Google. After doing the work to create the transformer architecture in 2017, Google hung back and gave OpenAI the space to become a cultural phenomenon. Since Google allowed its AI obsession to become all-consuming, ithas seen usage of its Gemini AI increase. Still, if the future of search is AI, Google may find itself struggling to stay on top, regardless of the court's decision on antitrust remedies.

    "title": "Apple: “Hundreds of millions to billions” lost without App Store commissions",
    "article_text": "Argues that recent \"extraordinary Order\" is punishment, not based on findings. Many horses, includingSpotifyandAmazon's Kindle Store, have already left the barn. But Apple is moving quickly to shut the external payments door opened bylast week's rulingthat the company willfully failed to comply with court orders regarding anticompetitive behavior. Inan emergency motion filing late Wednesday(PDF), Apple described US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' \"extraordinary Order\" as including an injunction that \"permanently precludes Apple from exercising control over core aspects of its business operations, including charging for use of its property and protecting the integrity of its platform and in-app purchase mechanism.\" Acertificate(PDF) accompanying the emergency filing states that the order \"fundamentally changes Apple's business and creates destabilizing effects\" for App Store customers. The restrictions, \"which will cost Apple substantial sums annually,\" are not based on the company's conduct, Apple claims, but \"were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance\" with the 2021 injunction. Inher ruling(PDF), Gonzalez Rogers described Apple as conducting an \"obvious cover-up\" and said that Apple \"at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.\" Apple had already altered itsApp Review Guidelinesto comply with Gonzalez Rogers' ruling. Under the updated rules, developers have been able to include buttons, links, and calls to action to consider purchasing subscriptions and in-app payments through external sites and vendors. Apps like Spotify and Amazon's Kindle have already placed buttons and had their updates approved by Apple, and vendors like Stripe have been providing guidance on taking payments without Apple's commission. Before this, under a2021 injunctionat issue in recent filings, Applecharged a 12 to 27 percent commissionon external payments, with significant filing and auditing requirements. Epic, whose lawsuit against Apple followingFortnite's removal from the App Storekicked off this yearslong legal battle, complained about Apple's restrictions on external payment methods. That led to Gonzalez Rogers' order, which found that Apple \"willfully\" failed to comply with her 2021 injunction and referred the matter to federal prosecutors for potential criminal charges. Apple’s motion seeks to stay the injunctive opening of its App Store to external payments while it prepares its appeal. Apple argued in its emergency motion last night that its appeal would show that it complied with the 2021 injunction \"by allowing iOS app developers to convey information to users about alternative purchase options.\" Apple argues that the original injunction \"says nothing about commissions or pricing,\" nor about conditions for link placement and language. \"The new rules profoundly undercut the integrated iOS ecosystem that this Court sustained as lawful and that is the foundation of user trust and confidence in the App Store,\" Apple's motion reads. Compliance with the order would cost \"hundreds of millions to billions\" of dollars, \"which Apple can never recoup,\" Apple argues.

    "title": "Belief in fake news linked to problematic social media use",
    "article_text": "People with high score on problematic social media use are more likely to like and share fake news. The vast majority of people these days use some form of social media, but some develop what's known as problematic social media use (PSMU). It's not yet deemed a clinical addiction, but it does share some symptoms with addiction and substance abuse disorders. And according to anew paperpublished in the journal PLoS ONE, someone who exhibits PSMU is also more likely to believe in—and share—fake news online, contributing to the rampant spread of misinformation that is the bane of the 21st-century Internet. \"If someone struggles with a substance dependency, it's the decision-making process in their brain where they have difficulties stopping,\" co-author Dar Meshi of Michigan State University told Ars. \"They take their drug and have a negative outcome: get a DUI or crash their car. Most people learn from a bad outcome and don't do it again, but someone with a substance use disorder continues to do that action.\" In the case of PSMU, someone might feel bad if they are unable to access social media for an extended period (withdrawal), or their use of social media might lead to losing a job, poor grades, or mental health issues. Meshi specializes in risky decision-making, impulsivity, and PSMU; his co-author and MSU colleague Maria Molina researches misinformation and disinformation. The two were chatting one day, and Meshi mentioned that he'd found in his research that problematic social media users were typically more impulsive and took more risks than average. He thought there might be an interesting link. Perhaps people with PSMU might also be more likely to engage with, or believe in and propagate, online misinformation \"because their risk evaluation is a little bit different than a neurotypical person,\" he said. (Misinformation is fake or false news that is unintentionally distributed; disinformation is when it is intentionally spread, explicitly to deceive.) Their study looked at subjects' propensity to believe fake news by measuring actions, such as clicking on a link or liking, sharing, or commenting on posts. Meshi and Molina recruited 189 college students who completed a questionnaire about their social media habits. PSMU is not yet recognized in the DSM as an official disorder or addiction, which requires a person to exhibit either psychological distress or impairment in daily functioning. But the criteria Meshi uses to assess PSMU is based on the same six core biopsychological components of addiction—for example, withdrawal, tendency to relapse, mood modification (using social media to change one's mood), or tolerance (needing to spend more and more hours on social media to achieve the same psychological rewards). That's why, when designing their survey, \"We didn't ask questions like 'How much time are you spending [on social media],'\" said Meshi. \"There is a correlation between how many drinks someone is having and how severe their alcohol use disorder is. But you wouldn't diagnose someone by how many drinks they're having because they could still be functioning fine or not have an impairment in their daily functioning or psychological distress, so we use these other six criteria to assess it.\" Next, the researchers presented subjects with 20 non-political news stories in the form of social media posts. Ten were real and 10 were fake, and the subjects answered seven questions about each article. The first three asked them to rate to what extent they thought the stories were accurate, authentic, or believable. The last four were designed to measure potential engagement by rating how likely they were to click on a link or like, comment on, or share each news story. Meshi and Molina also created attention checks to make sure participants were not just rapidly clicking buttons without really thinking about their responses. Subjects who showed more symptoms of PSMU were far more likely to believe fake news was true. They were also more likely to interact with news posts, whether they were fake or genuine, and were much more likely to click on fake news posts. And the greater the PSMU score, the more likely subjects indicated their likelihood of sharing fake news posts, thereby contributing to the propagation of online misinformation. Meshi hopes the findings will help therapists identify PSMU and look for a possible corresponding vulnerability to misinformation or conspiracy theories. \"This was just a first step,\" said Meshi. \"No one had ever looked at this relationship before, so we investigated it. In follow-up studies, we will try to understand the [underlying] mechanism. I'm a neuroscientist by training, and my research is on the reward system of the brain, which is involved in decision-making and evaluation of risk and how much value is there and how much you discount the value with the risk. So I would imagine that the processing in brain regions might be a little bit different [in people with PSMU], and that could result in this behavior.\" Meshi does not vilify social media use in general, despite its problematic aspects. \"Every technology that's been introduced into our society has kind of been vilified at one point or the other,\" said Meshi. \"If you go back and look at newspapers, there are cartoons about people not sleeping and having wide eyes because of light bulbs,\" he said. \"Cars, airplanes—'it's not natural to travel so quickly.' I like to express not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There are some genuine benefits to social media. People are lonely, and it's sometimes hard to connect with people in today's busy world, especially older adults whose social networks are shrinking, as people move all over the country or even all over the world with globalization. \"It's just like any type of thing that you can develop a problematic relationship to, like drinking, for example,\" he added. \"You might say, it's good to go out and have a drink with dinner and socialize. It loosens things up and you enjoy the socializing a little bit more. But if you don't do that in moderation, then it can cause problems in your life. I recommend the same type of attitude toward social media. Use it for the good stuff. But if you notice it's causing a problem, then it might be time to scale back and use it more in moderation.\" DOI: PLoS ONE, 2025.10.1371/journal.pone.0321361(About DOIs).

    "title": "Trump admin to roll back Biden’s AI chip restrictions",
    "article_text": "Officials call previous framework \"unenforceable\" as May 15 deadline looms. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind and replace a Biden-era rule regulating the export of high-end AI accelerator chips worldwide,BloombergandReutersreported. A Department of Commerce spokeswoman told Reuters that officials found the previous framework \"overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation\" and pledged to create \"a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance.\" The Biden administrationissuedthe Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion in January during its final week in office. The regulation represented the last salvo of a four-year effort to control global access to so-called \"advanced\" AI chips (such as GPUsmade by Nvidia), with a focus on restricting China's ability to obtain tech that could enhance its military capabilities. News of the planned policy shift immediately affected markets, with shares of Nvidia rising 3 percent after the announcement. Since April, AI chip makers have seen several other stock market swings due to ever-shifting Trump policy announcements related to tariffs, a separate but interrelated issue. The Biden-era chip restriction framework, whichwe coveredin January, established a three-tiered system for regulating AI chip exports. The first tier included 17 countries, plus Taiwan, that could receive unlimited advanced chips. A second tier of roughly 120 countries faced caps on the number of chips they could import. The administration entirely blocked the third tier, which included China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, from accessing the chips. Commerce Department officials now say they \"didn't like the tiered system\" and considered it \"unenforceable,\" according to Reuters. While no timeline exists for the new rule, the spokeswoman indicated that officials are still debating the best approach to replace it. The Biden rule was set to take effect on May 15. Reports suggest the Trump administration might discard the tiered approach in favor of a global licensing system with government-to-government agreements. This could involve direct negotiations with nations like the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia rather than applying broad regional restrictions. However, the Commerce Department spokeswoman indicated that debate about the new approach is still underway, and no timetable has been established for the final rule.

    "title": "USPTO refuses Tesla Robotaxi trademark as “merely descriptive”",
    "article_text": "According to CEO Elon Musk, Tesla's future rests on the two-seat driverless pod. \"We are an AI, robotics company,\" Tesla CEO Elon Muskannounced last April. Despite the fact that the company's revenues areoverwhelmingly derived from selling new electric vehicles, such prosaic activities hold no luster for the boss.Instead, Tesla's future, according to Musk, depends upon a (claimed) sub-$30,000 driverless two-seater,revealed to the world last Octoberin a staged demonstration on a film set.But Musk's plans just hit a snag: The company must find some new names. As spotted by Sean O'Kane at TechCrunch, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has informed Tesla that it will not be allowed to trademark the word \"robotaxi\" to describe the vehicle.According to the USPTO, the term is far too generic. Indeed, aGoogle n-gramsearchshows a steady growth in the use of \"robotaxi\" starting more than a decade ago. According to the USPTO, the term is merely descriptive.The agency citesevidence from Wikipedia, The Verge, and the Amazon-backed autonomous vehicle startup Zoox in its denial of Tesla's trademark application. Tesla could challenge this decision, but it would have to show the USPTO all the product's marketing materials, brochures, and manuals that intend to use the name. If those aren't available, Tesla must explain to the patent and trademark office's satisfaction how this product will differ from others, with detailed specifics, not generalities. Tesla must also explain whether the car features robotic systems and whether any of Tesla's competitors use \"robo,\" \"robot,\" or \"robotic\" to describe their own goods and services—the fact that Zoox refers to its autonomous pods as robotaxis will be very inconvenient for Tesla. It's not the first time that Tesla has been accused of a lack of originality.Alcon Entertainment sued Warner Brothers and Teslaafter it refused them permission and adamantly objected to WB's and Tesla's attempt to link the vehicle with vehicles seen inBlade Runner 2049. Although Tesla attempted to get the case dismissed, in April, the court ordered the parties toenter into mediation. Perhaps even more inconveniently for Tesla, it will have to find a new name for the car itself. Tesla's attempt to trademark \"Cybercab\"was also rejectedin large part due to the potential for confusion. Although Tesla applied for a trademark last October after revealing the vehicle,several other companies have previously registered Cyber- prefix trademarks, including one for \"Cybercab\" issued earlier in 2024. Next month, Tesla intends to deploy the two-seat EVs to Austin, Texas. The vehicles lack an actual steering wheel, so they won't conduct this testing with human safety operators on board; instead, Tesla will rely on teleoperation to handle problems that are too complicated for its AV stack to work out. Those operators will probably be quite busy—last year, independent testing showed that Tesla's \"FSD\" system averaged one human intervention every 13 miles, and thereare numerous open investigationsby the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration into Tesla's driver assist systems, which only use monovision optical cameras and can be fooled by bright sunlight—and even, like Wile E. Coyote,a painting of a road. Then again, perhaps as boss of DOGE, Musk will just use his \"special government employee\" statusto bring the USPTO to heel, purging it of the experts needed to regulate his business,just as he did at NHTSA.

    "title": "Elon Musk is responsible for “killing the world’s poorest children,” says Bill Gates",
    "article_text": "\"The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one.\" Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates ratcheted up his feud with Elon Musk, accusing the world’s richest man of “killing the world’s poorest children” through what he said were misguided cuts to US development assistance. Gates, who is announcing a plan to accelerate his philanthropic giving over the next 20 years and close down the Gates Foundation altogether in 2045, said in an interview that the Tesla chief had acted through ignorance. In February, Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in effect shut down the US Agency for International Development, the main conduit for US aid, saying it was “time for it to die.” The co-founder of Microsoft, and once the world’s richest man himself, said the abruptness of the cuts had left life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses and could cause the resurgence of diseases such as measles, HIV, and polio. “The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” he told the Financial Times. Gates said Musk had canceled grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, that prevents women transmitting HIV to their babies, in the mistaken belief that the US was supplying condoms to Hamas in Gaza in the Middle East. “I’d love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” he said. Gates, 69, on Thursday announced plans to spend virtually his entire fortune over the next 20 years, during which time he estimates his foundation will spend more than $200 billion on global health, development, and education against $100 billion over the previous 25 years. The Gates Foundation will close its doors in 2045, decades earlier than previously envisaged. Gates said the rationale for accelerated spending was to have maximum impact, with the potential for finding once-and-for all solutions such as eradicating polio and curing HIV. “It gives us clarity,” he said. “We’ll have a lot more money because we’re spending down over the 20 years, as opposed to making an effort to be a perpetual foundation.” The foundation will continue to spend the bulk of its budget, which will rise to about $10 billion a year, on global health, with vaccines, maternal, and child health continuing to be a focus. But Gates said that private philanthropy could not make up the shortfall from the cuts to USAID, whose budget was $44 billion last year. Gates intends to pass on less than 1 percent of his wealth to his children. He said he was a supporter of a strong estate tax to prevent “dynastic wealth” and of “much more progressive taxation.” Critics have accused Gates of using his foundation’s charitable status as a tax shield and of parlaying his billions into undue influence on global health priorities. In a letter outlining his decision, Gates said: “People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve.” Gates and Musk have clashed before over philanthropy. In 2012, Musk signed the Giving Pledge, launched by Bill and Melinda Gates and investor Warren Buffett, through which dozens of billionaires promised to give away at least half their wealth. But Musk later told Gates that philanthropy was mostly “bullshit” and that commercial solutions to problems like climate change, including Tesla’s electric vehicles, were more effective, according to Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson. Isaacson described Musk’s fury in 2022 on learning that Gates had shorted Tesla stock, calling him a hypocrite for trying to make money by undermining a company that was seeking to do good. In a comment at the time on Twitter, now X, Musk posted an unflattering photograph of Gates accompanied by the caption: “In case u need to lose a boner fast.” Gates told the FT that Musk, who called USAID “a criminal organization,” had no understanding of what the US agency did or how it operated. Musk in February acknowledged mistaking the Mozambican province of Gaza for the Palestinian territory, saying that “some of the things that I say will be incorrect.” Gates has been more restrained in his criticism of Donald Trump, saying he may not have fully understood the impact of cuts and holding out the prospect that some could be reversed. The Gates Foundation is one of many that fear the US president might try to remove their tax-free status through an executive order. Gates criticized Trump’s appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health, saying that Kennedy had “attacked vaccines, and specifically my role... with a lot of falsehoods.” But he reserved his sternest criticism for Musk, whose cuts he said threatened to undermine 25 years of Gates Foundation work. Gates once told Isaacson that Musk should spend more time worrying about life on Earth than seeking solutions on other planets. “He’s overboard on Mars,” he said. Musk and Doge did not respond to requests for comment. Additional reporting by Joe Miller in Washington. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.

    "title": "The Vibes Ncuti Gatwa Brings to Doctor Who Deserve to Be Celebrated",
    "article_text": "For the better part of the past decade or so, theDoctor Whofandom has been the one I’ve danced around, trying to get into it but never fully committing. What made it so challenging was the staggered release schedule, with the UK getting episodes first while those of us in the U.S. had to wait. Often, to my consternation, I’d end up seeing spoilers on Tumblr months in advance, which was discouraging to say the least. However, when the partnership between the BBC and Disney was announced with the plan that it would air all globally on a regular schedule, I was excited to jump back in. That and I was a huge fan of newDoctor Ncuti Gatwafrom hisSex Educationdays. Sure, it was like make-up homework to watch the five episodic specials, which showed what happened when the 13th Doctor regenerated into the 14th with the visage of David Tennant’s 10th version of the Time Lord. But it was fun to get that refresher through the familiar dynamic between the Doctor and Donna to explain the lore in a short amount of time. And it was nice to give that version of the Doctor a new identity separate from them splitting into Gatwa’s Time Lord. Once he met his first companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) we were off to the space races. There have been some incredible episodes, including the alienBridgertonone, which introduced the Rogue (played by Jonathan Groff) as the Doctor’s love interest and expanded on a new lore for this iteration of the character. Sometimes, though, the series gets bogged down with rehashed ideas from other Doctors or threads that aren’t getting paid off and overplayed (Mrs. Flood). Sometimes it seems to hold back on fully committing to Gatwaâs potential as the first Black Time Lord. And as a result some episodes that attempt to address how that does influence howhumanstend to see him nowfeel constrained or as if they are pulling punches. In the wake of Disney suddenly taking steps back in representation seemingly due to the current political climate, for example by removing the trans storyline in Pixar’s showWin or Lose, it’s felt harder to findDoctor Whoon Disney+’s landing page, a move that’s a little bit concerning as a regular watcher of the show on the platform. When I go to see if a new episode is dropped, I often have to search for the show and find the lack of advertising disappointing.Â  It’s a shame because this new era is exciting and captivating because of Gatwaâs magnetism. It drives the show, and every time he meets a new companion or makes friends, it feels as if he could be yours too. So it’s a bummer thatDoctor Whoisn’t being featured alongside other juggernaut fandoms like Marvel andStar Wars. The most Disney has done? Last year, the TARDIS showed up at Disneyland for photo ops. That made me wonder if Disney Experiences recalled thatDoctor Who‘s presence goes back years. In fact, one of my first tries at dipping my feet into the Whovian world was maybe 13 years ago when I was at Disneyland on the Mark Twain river boat, and I saw the strangest sight on Tom Sawyer’s Island. There were men in fez hats and bow-tied suits or cloaked coats running around. People at the park that day were dressed as various Doctors and companions. When I got off the boat, I asked one of the participants what was going on, and it turned out to be the unofficialDoctor Whomeet-up coinciding with Gallifrey One, the Whovian convention in LA. This was well before Disney had any inkling of acquiring the show and the friends I made that day inspired me to watch the show. But like I said, back then the internet was filled with spoilers. View this post on Instagram Iâm surprised that Disney hasnât made moves to connect with the audience that came to them even before the show’s acquisition, especially at the theme parks. Recently, other movie-inspired theme parks have begun hosting their own after-dark fandom events, drawing on all their IP partnerships including major sci-fi properties. I’ve wondered if that could mean Disney might finally seeDoctor WhoÂas an asset to include in its own fandom offerings. Imagine if Disney finally featured the Doctor during Halloween’s Oogie Boogie Bash, allowing fans to meet face characters inspired by the Fifteenth Doctor and his companions and potentially re-engaging those hesitant older fans by alternating meet-and-greets with the Fourteenth Doctor and Donna. Hopefully Disney will continue to amplify the show and not miss the opportunity to bring it to life in ways that could bring in more fans and reinvigorate older ones for an era that’s filled with so much potential. I’m frankly tired of the internet’s discourse already fueling rumors of impending cancellation. It’s such a great new chapter that really deserves a chanceâthe past few episodes with the Doctor’s second companion have been a delightful showcase of Gatwa’s chemistry alongsideAndorâsVarada Sethu as Belinda Chandra. Even with a platform as far-reaching as Disney+, it somehow still feels like people are unaware that the show is back and should remain part of the cultural conversation. Gatwa is someone you really canât take your eyes off as he embodies the magic of the Doctor in ways that allow the glee and joy to shine through during adventures that have served as weekly appointment viewing. If any of the Doctors showed up outside my door, the Fifteenth is who I’d dance with. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "If You Liked Cynthia Erivo’s Poker Face Appearance, You Have to Check Out The Outsider",
    "article_text": "Poker Faceis back on Peacock, and itsseason twopremiere features a gangbusters guest-star turn by Cynthia Erivoâplayingmultiple identical siblingscaught up in the latest murder puzzle to cross paths with Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne). While fans now immediately associate Erivo with her Oscar-nominated turn as Elphaba inWicked, one of her first big showcases came on another crime-infused TV series: HBO’sThe Outsider. The Outsiderran in early 2020, concurrent with Erivo’s first Oscar nomination (for 2019’sHarriet), but its airing on such a popular, mainstream platform meant that it was many viewers’ first time seeing her perform. That it was based on the 2018 Stephen King novel of the same name also helped draw interest, as did the rest of the cast: Jason Bateman, Ben Mendelsohn, Paddy Considine (pre-House of the Dragon), and Yul Vasquez (pre-Severance), among others. But if you watched itâand if you didn’t, now would be a fantastic time to start!âthe then-emerging star Erivo left the biggest impression. Erivo plays a recurring Stephen King character, Holly Gibney. Holly made her debut in 2014’sMr. Mercedes(in the series adaptation of that tale, she was played bySuccession‘s Justine Lupe), and she’s still aroundâshe’s the central character inNever Flinch,King’s latest novel, which releases later this month. In HBO’sThe Outsider, Holly’s the co-lead with Mendelsohn’s Ralph Anderson, a Georgia cop grappling with personal demons while facing the most perplexing case of his career. When a boy is found horribly murdered, all the evidence points to a beloved local baseball coach (Bateman), whoinsistshe’s innocent, but is gunned down before his arraignment. The viewer is privy to a strange figure with a malformed face skulking around the show’s early proceedingsâand Ralph, a seasoned detective, still can’t shake the idea that the accused was somehow telling the truth. An unusual crime calls for an unusual investigator, so that’s when Erivo’s character enters the story. Holly’s abilitiesâshe’s highly perceptive, to the point of being extra-sensory; she also has creative quirks, likeknowing lyrics to songs she’s never heard beforeâmake her an ideal foil for Ralph, a no-nonsense guy suddenly confronted with the notion that a supernatural explanation may be theonlyexplanation. Even beyond the outstanding performances, the 10-episodeOutsideris a chilling, rewarding ride. It follows a terrifying thread to some very dark places, with atmosphere to spare and an ending that satisfiesâbut also makes you wish HBO would’ve signed on for more.

    "article_text": "He turned theThunderboltsintoThe New Avengers,and now director Jake Schreier may bring theX-Meninto the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Deadlinereports that theThunderboltsdirector “is in early talks” to directMarvel’s upcomingX-Menproject.Michael Lesslie, the writer ofThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,has been attached as a writer since last summer, while development on the filmhas been happening for even longer than that. io9 reached out to Marvel for comment or clarification and will update this post if or when we hear back. This move makes a whole lot of sense, though. Starting with Jon Favreau and all the way up to the Russo brothers, Marvel Studios loves to use directors with whom it has already shared success. And after the strong opening weekend, especially critically, forThunderbolts, you can totally see how Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and the team would want to put such a massive project in trusted hands. And it is amassiveproject. Ever since Disney first announced intentions to acquire 20th Century Fox in 2017, fans have been anxiously awaiting the full, proper introduction of Fox’s characters into the MCU. After years,The Fantastic Fourare coming in a few weeks, and X-Men characters have slowly been trickling in, headlined by last summer’sDeadpool & Wolverine. A fullX-Menmovie has always been the north star, though, and the entire company has been very, very careful about it. Clearly it knows there have been manyX-Menmovies before, most of them are quite good, and it’s a high bar with some very valuable and beloved characters. It’s unclear who will be on this specific team, or how it will incorporate characters fromDeadpool & WolverineorAvengers: Doomsday,which is bringing back more of the Fox X-Men characters. But, you can say with some certainty that it’ll take place after the events of Avengers: Secret Warsand set the tone for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, over 10 years after the possibility first happened.

    "title": "30 Years on, Voyager‘s B’Elanna Split Episode Remains Fascinatingly Fraught",
    "article_text": "Star Trekhas always been fascinated with the idea of characters pulled between two worlds. Spock’s exploration ofhis human heritage, Worf’s status onÂTNGas an early example of post-peace Klingon integration with the Federation, even Sisko’s position as a Starfleet officer thrust into the simultaneous roles of guiding diplomat, military leader,and spiritual emissaryâtime and time again the series has been drawn to this character archetype across ideas of race and status. EarlyStar Trek Voyagerwas no exception with its interest in B’Elanna Torres, one of the show’s early breakout characters. The Maquis rebel turned chief engineer who embodied this trope not just through her own journey as an ex-guerrilla, but also as a half-Klingon womanâand the show’s first real attempt to explore that latter, 30 years ago today in “Faces,” had to tread fertile, yet highly contentious ground. “Faces” was the 14th episode ofÂVoyager‘s debut season, and saw thereturn of the Vidiians, a race of aliens forced to harvest organs and body parts from other species to try and avoid being ravaged by a horrifying plague. Having captured a handful ofÂVoyagercrew while they were on an away mission, B’Elanna included, a Vidiian scientist eager to explore the potential impact of regenerative elements in Klingon DNA in battling that plague uses his people’s advanced medical technology to reach an unorthodox conclusion: split B’Elanna into two people. Completely separated down to the genetic level into separate human and Klingon individuals (both played by Torres actress Roxann Dawson, with the help of photo double Joy Kilpatrick), both B’Elannas ultimately have to overcome their differences to find a way to escape the Vidiians alongside their fellow captured crewmates. The idea makes literalÂStar Trek‘s aforementioned fascination with characters who struggle to reconcile being from two very different backgrounds, but by making B’Elanna’s first real exploration of her biracial identity on the show so literal, “Faces” has to skirt some pretty wild lines that it can never really quite interrogate. Much of the conflict between the human B’Elanna and the Klingon B’Elanna is derived from what is ultimately presented by the episode as genetically derived traits. Human B’Elanna is physically and emotionally weaker, repeatedly incapacitated by fear as she struggles to adapt to being held prisoner by the Vidiians. Klingon B’Elanna, meanwhile, plays up the established Klingon caricature of violence and anger issues, an underlying arrogance that sees her seek conflict before anything else. It’s made especially fraught given the post-TNGre-imagining of the Klingons away from their original (andsimilarly racially fraught!) depictions and toward a race of almost exclusively dark-skinned humanoids, alongside other Afro-inspired traits like textured hair. The image of a slight light-skinned human B’Elanna (for what it’s worth, Dawson is ofPuerto Rican descent) cowering in the presence of her aggressively framed, dark-skinned Klingon self is brought up time and time again in “Faces,” as the two argue with each other over being “cursed” with the negative traits of the other, human B’Elanna lamenting her Klingon temper as being the reason she ultimately left Starfleet Academy. Even though by the end of “Faces” the two come to an understanding, and the Klingon B’Elanna is allowed to sacrifice herself to protect the human B’Elanna she had admonished as her lesser, it’s still presented in more of a way of the noble savage trope than it is a particularly enlightened re-imagining of their bond. But while “Faces” ultimately concludes that the two B’Elannas work better together, it doesn’t exactly interrogate the racialized element at play between them in presenting her internal conflict over her biracial identity as an external one. Even the climax of the episode, when B’Elanna has reached that aforementioned understanding with her Klingon self, handles it in a compromised mannerâher re-embrace of her Klingon side is done as much out of any kind of acceptance as it is the fact that she’s told that shehasto re-integrate with her Klingon DNA, without which she won’t survive. The episode’s final moments are intriguingly framed: the still-human-appearing B’Elanna tells Chakotay as she sits inVoyager‘s sickbay waiting to undergo surgery that while she now appreciates and admires aspects of her Klingon self, she is also reckoning with the fact that she will fight that version of herself for the rest of her life, before stroking her smooth forehead in solitude for one last time before the physical reminder of her internal struggle returns. For much of the rest ofÂVoyager, the series’ exploration of B’Elanna’s racial identity will be explored through her damaged relationship with her Klingon mother, rather than her own internal attitudes to being part-Klingon. That is, with one significant, equally wild exception: the season seven episode “Lineage,” which sees a newly pregnant B’Elanna attempt to genetically alter her child in-utero to ensure they are born fully human. It’s fascinating that much of the show’s exploration of her identity is bookended with these episodes that are broadly in conversation with each other, and not necessarily in the best of ways. “Lineage,” while providing a level of understanding for B’Elanna’s choices, is at least much more definitive in its view that her apprehensive view of being part-Klingon is misguided, and her actions in the episode are equivocally in the wrong. Perhaps then, “Faces” walked so it could runâand provide a chance to do a bit more right by a characterVoyagerhad been deeply interested in from its earliest beginnings. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Rare Snail Caught Laying Egg Though Its Neck, in Scientific First",
    "article_text": "The miracle of life can be majestic at times. Other times, it’s an incredibly rare snail in New Zealand having kids out of its neck hole. In a first, officials at New Zealand’s Department of Conservation have documented aPowelliphanta augustasnail laying its eggs. The carnivorous land snails are known for their unique method of mating and reproduction, which involves a “genital pore” just below their head. This latest egg-laying feat is all the more important given that the slimy animals were almost completely wiped out of existence. P. augustais also called the Mount Augustus snail, named after the only known habitat on New Zealand’s South Island where they were once natively found. About 20 years ago, a coal mining operation in the areabegan to decimate its environment, and conservationists scrambled to save as many snails as they could to be raised in captivity. DOC officials based in the nearby town of Hokitika have been raising their own captive population of Mount Augustus snails since 2006. But they’ve only now been able to seeâand capture liveâthe snails’ egg-laying up close and personal. DOC hasposted a videoof the snail’s egg-laying on its YouTube account. âItâs remarkable that in all the time weâve spent caring for the snails, this is the first time weâve seen one lay an egg,” said ranger Lisa Flanagan in a statement released by the DOC on Wednesday. “We caught the action when we were weighing the snail. We turned it over to be weighed and saw the egg just starting to emerge from the snail.â Most land snails are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female sexual organs. This allows them to reproduce with any other member of the species, or even to self-fertilize if needed, though the latter usually results in less viable offspring. Mount Augustus snails in particular carry out their mating with the help of a genital pore along their neck. This same opening is also where the snail’s eggs will emerge from. âIt extends its penis out of this pore and into its mateâs pore, and its mate does the same, simultaneously exchanging sperm, which they can store until they each fertilize the sperm theyâve received to create eggs,” Flanagan explained. P. augustasnails mature relatively slowly, taking about eight years before they can start laying eggs. And even then, they only lay about five eggs a year, which can take another year to hatch. So compared to other snails, including invasive species threatening New Zealand, it’s been harder to ensure their continued survival. But the DOC has been able to breed them in captivity and they’ve started to reintroduce new populations to the wild with some success. Until these efforts are firmly self-sustaining, however, the DOC will hold onto its houseguests, which can live up to 30 years in captivity. And with any luck, they’ll continue to learn more about these weird but plucky creatures. âI just love watching their progress each month, weighing them, how their shells develop, and all the interesting things they do,” said Flanagan.

    "article_text": "The end of this week’s episode arc onAndorfinally welcomed K-2SO into the fold. In an enemies to besties moment on thestreets of Palmo, Cassian (Diego Luna) is saved from the KX droid when it gets run over and he takes the pieces back to Yavin with him.

K-2SO awakens and asks why a gun is pointed at him in actor Alan Tudyk’s recognizable character voice. Originally, however, his introduction was a lot more unsettling. âDan Gilroy wrote an amazing, entirely self-contained episode that was episode 209,â Tony Gilroy toldEntertainment Weekly,âIt was an amazing episode that was like a horror movie.â “They had to bring this huge ugly tanker ship to Yavin, and there was a KX unit that was trapped inside there hunting. It was sort of like a monster movie with K2 on it. It was really cool.â But ultimately it wasn’t meant to be. âWe could not afford to do it,” he said. It was great that there were still some strokes of horror in the episode as he’s jolted back to life in a mad-scientist, old-school spooky way, but it also would have been interesting to see the extended version. However, âit was made clear that it was out of the range, so we had to abandon that and consolidate things,” Gilroy said. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Crypto-Friendly GENIUS Act Fails Key Senate Vote as Dems Defect",
    "article_text": "In a rare occurrence, which may only last for a week, Democrats in the Senate showed some spine and voted down an important procedural vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill that would establish a (very weak) regulatory framework for the use of stablecoins. It was expected that the bill would get rubber-stamped, given the number of crypto-curious Dems in the caucus, but it will now have to go back to the drawing board before coming up for a vote again, whichcould happen as early as next week. The bill ultimately failed a cloture vote Thursday, achieving just48of the necessary 60 votes that would have formally ended debate on the bill and allowed it to advance to a full vote. There was expectation in advance of the vote that enough Democrats would cross the aisle and vote in favor of moving the bill forward, according toreporting from The American Prospect. But Democratic Senators who are members of the crypto caucusâRuben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester, Andy Kim, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Angela Alsobrooks (a co-sponsor for the bill) all voted no to closing debate. The change of heart from Demsâwho, again, could easily change course and pass this thing next Mondayâappears to stem in part over concerns regarding Donald Trump’s growing crypto empire, which includes a recently launched stablecoin called $USD1 that the Trump-connected World Liberty Financial announced earlier this year. That stablecoin was recently in the news because an investment firm in Abu Dhabi announced it would use $USD1 to invest$2 billion into cryptocurrency exchange Binance, creating a seeminglyendless web of conflicts of interestwith the President at the center. Following that announcement, along with some reportedly unexpected changes made to the bill by Republicans without including Democrats in the conversation, led to Thursday’s failure.Decrypt reportedthat both parties met repeatedly in the 24 hours leading up to the vote in hopes of settling their differences, but couldn’t reach an agreement in time. Once an expected “yes” vote, Arizona Republican Ruben Gallegoexplained, âThe Republicans killed it, because my colleagues don’t have enough time to read the changes that we have been proposing.” Senator Warner clearlysignaledthat the plan is still to pass this thing, just with some changes. In astatement, he said, “Stablecoins are undeniably a part of the future of finance, and the United States should set the standard for responsible innovation in the digital financial space.” He also said that he remains “fully committed” to passing it once he and his colleagues are able to “strengthen this legislation.” Should the bill pass, it’ll establish some very light regulations for the issuance of stablecoins, which are supposed to be pegged to fiat currency and used to facilitate transactions. The bill would set standards for capital and liquidity requirements, establish mandatory audits, and make stablecoin issuers subject to complying with the anti-money laundering requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. And while that might be better than nothing, it also is basicallyexactly what crypto operators have lobbied for. The bill also takes zero steps toward barring public officials from profiting off stablecoins, which has suddenly become a pressing issue because the President is monetizing the office. Trump and his family have reportedlymade $2.9 billion off their crypto venturesthus far, and there is currently nothing standing in the way of his continued profiting off a mostly unregulated industry that his administration currently sets the standard for. Dems will reportedly push for protections to restrict Trump and other elected office holders from cashing in on stablecoins,per Axios, but it’s unclear if that will prove to be a true breaking point or if Dems will fold.

    "title": "At Tokyo Disneyland, I Found a New Collecting Obsession",
    "article_text": "We havetoo much Disney stuff.In our home, one entire room is specifically dedicated to Disney posters and memorabilia. In other rooms, we have shelves dedicated toStar WarsGalaxy’s Edge,Robin Hood, Toy Story,and more. It’s too much. And so, when finally making that bucket list trip to Japan to visitTokyo DisneylandandTokyo DisneySeawe knew we had to take it easy with the buying. But then I saw it. Leaving DisneySea’sIndiana Jonesride(which is just like the Disneyland ride,exceptCrystal Skullthemed), I noticed they were selling a tiny, Matchbox-sized replica of the ride vehicle. I had to have it. It was small, themed to something I love, and hyper-specific. That was the key. This wasn’t just someIndiana Jones-themed shirt, it was the ride vehicle fromthisride. I scooped it up. A few rides later, I realized the amazingFrozenride I just exited also had a mini-ride vehicle. And thePeter Panride. And at the end of the day, I was carrying eight new ride vehicles in my backpack. The next day, at Tokyo Disneyland, the buying continued, and by the end of our trip, I’d purchased 12 vehicles, at a cost of about $15 apiece. (On the top level, you’ve got, from left to right,Haunted Mansion, Indiana JonesandÂBeauty and the Beast, FrozenandPeter Pan, and20,000 Leagues Under the SeaÂ andJungle Cruise. On the bottom, you’ve gotSoarin’, the resort Monorail andAquatopia,Happy Ridewith Baymax, andToy StoryMania.) The vehicles are made by a company called Tomica and they’ve been teaming up with Disney since,according to Wiki, 2001. So it’s not like I’m the first person to discover these. They’ve been around for literal decades. But the size, exclusively, and specificity just spoke to me. Plus, because of their size, I knew that I could pretty easily find places for them to display in our very, very Disney-filled home. But I had to set limits. An important part of my buying was being selective. I wasn’t buying everything. I was buying vehicles for rides I actually rode and really liked. And while I certainly bought a lot, in one of the stores at Tokyo Disneyland, there was a display with what appeared to be every vehicle currently available. There were way more than 12. You may notice one famous ride vehicle that’s not in there:the Starcruiser fromStar Tours. When I started buying these, one of my first thoughts was, “Is there one forStar Tours?” I then checked all around the ride and park but no, there wasn’t. At least not now. I later found out there were out-of-print vehicles forStar Toursthat, maybe, I’d purchase at a later date. But, that later date almost happened much sooner. Later on our Japan trip, I found myself in a geek mecca called Nakano Broadway. A few minutes outside of Tokyo, this four-story mall is filled with all manner of geek merchandise and you could spend days getting lost in its stores. At one point, I walked into a store and saw what I believed was theStar Toursride vehicle I was after. This one looked a little different, though, and had a sign next to it that said something about “330.” I asked the employee for more information. Turns out, this particular piece wasn’t 330 yen, nor was it 3300 yen. It was 330,000 yen, the U.S. equivalent to about $2,300. According to a translation of the sign, it was some discontinued version of the vehicle and, clearly, very rare and valuable. “Do you still want it?” she asked. The answer, of course, was yes, but I couldn’t afford it, so I said “No, thank you.” She then took the sign and wrote on it, making it clearer what the piece cost. That was the moment, though. In the two minutes before realizing how expensive that piece was, but also knowing it was going to be more expensive than the ones in the park, I was ready. If it had been $200 or something, I would’ve pulled the trigger. I was on vacation! I wantedStar Toursfor my collection! Of course, I didn’t buy it, but I did realize I had officially added mini ride vehicles to my long list of collecting obsessions. Want more io9 news?

The Lenovo Legion 9i should support 30 games with 3D effects, though it may be brought down by an enormous, tariff-boosted price tag. Ignoring the possible enormous price, Iâm left holding out hope that lenticular lenses can find a niche in todayâs gaming environment. The Legion 9i is one of those kitchen sink, desktop replacement laptops meant for both gamers and creatives who want to do everything from one device, even one that weighs nearly eight pounds. Thatâs nothing new, though whatâs different about this device is its 18-inch âPureSightâ display that supports 4K resolution in 2D alongside 2K (1,920 x 1,200) resolution in 3D. Like what we experienced with theSamsung Odyssey 3D gaming monitorandLenovoâs concept 3D curved displays, the screen is an IPS LCD panel built with a lenticular lens array. This creates a kind of pseudo 3D popout effect along with a subtle hint of depth on images. If you ever tried the 3D effect on a Nintendo 3DS, then you have a good idea what this looks like. TheNintendo 3DSwas also notorious for requiring pitch-perfect viewing angles for the 3D effect. The technology has improved thanks to the use of eye-tracking cameras that beam the image to each eye individually. Lenovo says users will be able to control this using the Lenovo 3D Studio software. The company claims this supports 3D viewing in âa myriad of video, image, and streaming formatsâ including some creation apps. Yes, the 3D effect is a novelty for a niche crowd of gamers, but from what I played, the effect enhances the otherworldliness of games with more stylized visuals. Ourmain gripe with the Samsung Odyssey 3Dwas its mere 13 supported games when the monitor itself cost $2,000. Lenovo told Gizmodo this laptop supports 30 games, including major titles of the last several years likeCyberpunk 2077,Death Stranding,Black Myth: Wukong,Forza Horizon 5, andFallout 4. We have yet to see this 3D effect when playing a first-person game, and weâd be concerned the view would lead to a sense of queasiness when a cyberpsychoâs monofilament blade aimed at your character pops out of the screen like a knife aimed at your eyes. The screen also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) that can switch from 240Hz at 4K to a blistering 440Hz at FHD. Thatâs handy, since the laptop is set to contain an Intel Core 9 275HX CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 laptop GPU, plus up to 192GB of RAM. We still donât have pricing, but considering the stated specs, it could be an enormously expensive device. The Legion 9i could cost even more than theMSI Titan 18 HX, one of the beefiest and most expensive laptops Iâve ever reviewed. At least it supports four slots apiece for RAM and SSD storage extensions. Even the cover of the laptop is unique, sporting a camo-like pattern made of eight layers of carbon fiber. The gaming laptop wonât be available until fall this year, although some gamers and creators in China will likely be the first to check it out. Trump tariffs havepushed prices up for most gadgets and many other products besides, so we arenât holding out much hope for a product most people can actually afford. Even with 30 games on offer at launch, that still may not be enough to push 3D screens into the mainstream. We asked Lenovo if the Legion 9i could support third-party 3D software, like Samsungâs Reality Hub used on its Odyssey 3D, but the company declined to say. The cost of concept devices like this will only get steeper as time goes on. GamingLenovoSamsung Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Bill Gates Accuses Elon Musk of ‘Killing the World’s Poorest Children’ With DOGE Cuts",
    "article_text": "Bill Gates is not impressed by Elon Musk’s work with the Department of Government Efficiency. In aninterview with the Financial Times, he described Musk’s work as hurting the most vulnerable people on the planet. âThe picture of the worldâs richest man killing the worldâs poorest children is not a pretty one.â He repeated that line a bit more directly inconversation with the New York Times, stating that while Musk could go on to become a great philanthropist, saying, “In the meantime, the worldâs richest man has been involved in the deaths of the worldâs poorest children.” Gates zeroed in on Musk’s cuts to the United States Agency for International Development, which he called stunning and worse than he ever imagined. “I thought thereâd be, like, a 20 percent cut. Instead, right now, itâs like an 80 percent cut. And yes, I did not expect that,” hetold the New York Times. He also didn’t shy away from placing the blame for those cuts directly on Musk, stating, “Heâs the one who cut the U.S.A.I.D. budget. He put it in the wood chipper.” The results of those cuts are going to be devastating, and in no small part, the result of a complete misunderstanding of what it is that USAID does. For instance, Gates said that one of the consequences of Musk’s bizarre claim that the government was spending$50 million on condoms for Hamaswas the cancellation of grants that would have gone to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, that works to prevent the transmission of HIV to children. âIâd love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,â Gates told the Financial Times. He didn’t mince words about what the results of Musk’s work will be, either. He told NYT, “Because of these cuts, millions of additional deaths of kids.” And fixing it isn’t going to be as easy as tearing it down was. Gates said he’s currently expecting a four- to six-year interruption in funding. While he’s still optimistic that aid organizations that he’s involved with will be able to reduce childhood mortality in the long term, he said, “The cuts are so dramatic that even if we get some restored, weâre going to have a tough time.” That’s exacerbated by the fact that humanitarian aid ison the decline globally, so there’s no obvious candidate to step up and fill in the gap left by the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for extending a hand to anyone born outside America’s borders (and frankly, most inside them, as well). For Musk, it’s possible that he’d view the unfortunate side effects of cutting aid (lots of death) as just part of the necessary pain needed to make the essential cuts that DOGE was put in place to do. Except…it’s not doing that. Musk initially claimed that he’d cut $2 trillion from the government’s spending, his pseudo-agency has claimed just $162 billion thus far, but the experts at Musk Watch could onlyverify $5.02 billion of that, which accounts for 0.25% of the initial goal. So yes, there are millions of children and adults likely to die because a billionaire waved his hands and stopped funding essential humanitarian efforts that he never even bothered to understand, but at least he can rest easy knowing that he also failed spectacularly at his stated mission along the way. It does not seem like it is a stretch to say that we are letting people die in order to protect the ego of the world’s richest and most fragile man.

    "title": "Murderbot‘s Creators on Finding the Right Tone for the Sci-Fi Comedy-Thriller",
    "article_text": "Murderbotcreators, writers, directors, and executive producers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz had well-established source material when it came to adapting their new series for Apple TV+. Martha Wells’Murderbot Diariesbooks, starting with the Hugo- and Nebula-winning novellaAll Systems Red, craft a specific world and an even more specific character:a self-aware Security Unitthat’sboth heavily armed and deeply sarcastic. Of course, it (mostly) only shoots when necessaryâincluding when things heat up inMurderbot‘s plotâand the majority of its snarky taunts go unheard by anyone but the audience as part of the character’s inner monologue. Even still, the 10-episode show is very much both a comedy and a thriller, a balance of tones the Weitzes aimed to keep consistent without making it feel forced. “I think it’s really hard to have it constantly in mind,” Chris Weitz told io9 at a recentMurderbotpress day. “You’ve just got this kind of tuning fork of tone in your mind, and things either fit or they don’t. You don’t want the threat to ever become goofy, and you don’t want the humor to ever undermine the stakes of what’s going on.” He continued. “Some of that takes place in the editing room. A lot of it can actually be addressed in terms of when you’re doing the CGI, just in terms the veracity of the things that you’re portraying. Like when there’s a hostile monster attacking, how to not make it look goofy, how to make sure it feels like it exists in physical space. So then, when you do make a turn from one aspect of tone to another, from a thriller to comedy, just having a good ear for when it clangs and when it doesn’t.” The length of each episodeâmostMurderbotentries are around 25 minutesâalso helped, according to Paul Weitz. “It’s really beneficial to have this be a half-hour show as opposed to an hour show, in terms of the tension,” he said. “We did want it to have tension throughout the show, and that would have been a lot harder if we were trying to pad stuff into an hour, [since] almost all sci-fi [shows are] an hour long.” Accorted to the Weitzes, author Wells took an active role in shaping the series; she’s credited as a consulting producer. Also crucial: star Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, who’s also one of the show’s executive producers. “If an actor is going to agree to do a show, it’s going to take a substantial amount of time out of their creative lives,” Paul Weitz said. “I think for us, the really big thing in a way wasâaside from the things that Alexander brought to it, where he has a really quirky sense of humor that juxtaposes against what he looks like, what his physicality isâI think that Alexander really wants to erase the distance between himself and the world and wants to believe the character exists. So he kind of wouldn’t let us get away with anything.”Â Bringing the show to the screen was very much a collaboration, Weitz explained.Â“We had two big collaborators, one of whom was Martha Wells. If we were adding somethingâbecause we didn’t take anything out of the book, basically, but we did add some stuff in order to make 10 episodesâshe was available to us to bounce ideas off of, to read scripts, to give us ideas if she didn’t like the ideas that we were having. So that was our first big collaborator.”Â He continued. “And then Alex was our next big collaborator because he’s very literal, almost in a Murderbot fashion. He doesn’t want to just have something happening because that’s a cool thing to be happening in the plot. He wants to know why something’s happening.” The first two episodes ofMurderbotarrive May 16 on Apple TV+. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "MAGA Crackpots Turn on Trump’s Crackpot Surgeon General Nominee",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump withdrew his nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, on Wednesday following controversy overher credentials. The president quickly nominated a new pick, wellness influencer Dr. Casey Means, but even the MAGA faithful have already gotten the knives out for her. Means attended Stanford Medical School and pursued her residency at Oregon Health & Science University, but dropped out before finishing the program, according toNPR. She’s an anti-vaxxer who doesn’t have a medical license and founded a companycalled Levelsthat sells products for monitoring glucose levels. Means, a close ally of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also frequently talks about the importance of “spirituality” for health, as she did during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcastlast year. Laura Loomer, who can likely be credited for getting at least half a dozen people fired from Trump’s administration so far, has taken issue with Means and the far-right influencer seems to be most upset with her focus on spiritual matters. Means, like Kennedy and his MAHA movement, really emphasizes the role of spirituality in achieving the best health outcomes. “I want to know which one of President Trumpâs geniuses chose a woman who literally talks to trees and spiritual mediums and who doesnât even have an active medical license to be the US Surgeon General,” Loomer wrote Thursdayon X. “I would call her a Witch Doctor, but she doesnât even have a valid active medical license. So Iâm not going to call@CaseyMeansMDdoctor.” Loomer almost certainlyhelped torpedoDr. Janette Nesheiwat, Trump’s first nominee for Surgeon General. But when it came to Nesheiwat, it seemed like Loomer was most angered by her acceptance of the covid-19 vaccine. Loomer falsely claims the vaccine is “now killing millions of people.” Loomer also took credit for getting others in Trump’s government fired, like theDirector of the NSAand theNational Security Advisor. It’s not just Loomer. Nicole Shanahan also has major issues with Means andvented themWednesday on X. Shanahan was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.âs running mate in the 2024 presidential election before he dropped out to endorse Trump. Shanahan wrote that it was “very strange” how Means was being selected and said that she had been promised the influencer wouldn’t be chosen for Surgeon General. “I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr. in his Senate confirmation that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment (and that people much more qualified would be),” Shanahan wrote. “I don’t know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on. It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly who is controlling his decisions (and it isn’t President Trump). With regards to the siblings, there is something very artificial and aggressive about them, almost like they were bred and raised Manchurian assets.” It’s not entirely clear what Shanahan means by “Manchurian assets” but it’s similar to the phrase Manchurian Candidate, a reference to the 1962 movie where Communists brainwash a captured American soldier in order to get him to kill the U.S. president. Trump tweeted the announcement of Means as the nominee on Truth Social onWednesdayby praising her “academic achievements” and her “life’s work” as “absolutely outstanding.” “Casey has impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials, and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to ensure a successful implementation of our Agenda in order to reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health, in the future, for ALL Americans,” Trump wrote. “Her academic achievements, together with her lifeâs work, are absolutely outstanding. Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History. Congratulations to Casey!” But as of Thursday, Trump seemed to want it both ways. The president would like credit for selecting Means but is also keeping her at arm’s length because he seems to sense that blowback is imminent. Asked about Means and her lack of a medical license on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Bobby), liked her. REPORTER: You just announced a new nominee for US Surgeon General who never finished her residency, and is not a practicing physician. So can you explain why you picked her to be America’s top doctor? TRUMP: Because Bobby thought she was fantastic … I don’t know her [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com)May 8, 2025 at 8:43 AM Means, who wrote a book calledGood Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health, appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast last year and belittled double-blind, placebo-controlled studies while sarcastically referring to “the science” as a way to mock people who believe in things like vaccines. The Vergereportsthat Means and her company Levels was co-founded by Sam Corcos, who’s currently helping Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency dismantle the federal government. But Trump’s strategic ignorance of his own government does appear to be working out for him thus far. Many X users blamed Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, for choosing Means. And that kind of rationalization is to be expected among Trump supporters. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones recently said that Trump must not understand how bad Real ID is and blamed the people around him for leading him astray by allowing the Real ID deadline to become reality. Loomer is an anti-Muslim bigot and a ridiculousconspiracy theorist. But it’s darkly funny to watch her wield enormous power in Trump’s government. Here’s this crackpot who got banned from ordering takeout from Uber Eats because she’s too racist. And yet she gets to decide who might be the Surgeon General. What a country.

    "article_text": "Eventually, Ed and Lorraine Warren had to stop investigating supernatural activity. And, in the first trailer forThe Conjuring: Last Rites, the basic premise is thatthis case was so, so bad, it was the reason they stopped. Now, how true that specifically is, we aren’t quite sure. But the trailer forthe fourth and finalConjuringfilm starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the married investigators sure makes a compelling case. The plot isn’t quite on fully display but, from the casting, it sure seems as if the evil demons the Warrens fight on a daily basis have finally come for their own family. In addition to Farmiga and Wilson,The Conjuring: Last Ritesstars Mia Tomlinson as Ed and Lorraineâs daughter Judy Warren and Ben Hardy as her boyfriend, Tony Spera. And if the demons are coming after Ed and Lorraine’s kid, they are surely mighty pissed off about all the good they’ve been doing for humanity. There are terrors throughout the trailer, but the scariest thing might be that this is being sold as the finalConjuringfilm centering on the Warrens. Because let’s not forget, it was the first two films in this series,The ConjuringandThe Conjuring 2, that set the series up to be the most successful horror franchise in a modern history.The Conjuringfilms also gave usAnnabelleandThe Nun, both of which had their own sequels and continue to be lasting brands on their own.

    "title": "Tech Weirdos Want to Transform Guantánamo Into a ‘Freedom City’",
    "article_text": "If you have an ounce of historical awareness (and basic empathy), the name “GuantÃ¡namo Bay” triggers images of torture and pain. It’s a site where the deprivation of the powers that be has been on full display. But what if GuantÃ¡namo wasn’t such a downer? What if it became a “prosperous charter city”? That’s theproposal coming from the most recent group of libertarian tech weirdostrying to rebrand Guantanamo with the help of a little modern-day slave labor. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has been courted byseveral groups proposing “charter”, “startup”, or “freedom” citiesin the United States. Exempt from taxes and regulations, these cities propose themselves as wonderlands where business (like clinical trials) can be conducted without governmental oversight. But their sites aren’t limited to the U.S. alone. In February, one of the groups, the Charter Cities Institute,released its proposalto transform GuantÃ¡namo through “governance autonomy, private-sector investment, and immigration reform.” The group honed in on GuantÃ¡namo due to its legal status as a site under U.S. jurisdiction with “minimal local legal complexity.” Compared to domestic sites where the group encounters “multi-tiered hurdles” like zoning boards and city regulations, setting up a charter city on GuantÃ¡namo would be a breeze. In its proposal, CCI wrote, “By transforming Guantanamo Bay into a charter city, the U.S. government can catalyze economic growth, manage immigration flows, and project America’s unparalleled capacity for innovation and statecraft â all while requiring no legislation.” Generally, Trump has been receptive to so-called charter cities and previously suggested usingprotected federal land to build them. In March, Trumpcomparedtheir efforts to “past generations of Americans” who “pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier.” He also said that building these cities would “reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and, in fact, the American dream.” Trump’s words echo portions of CCI’s proposal, which also pitched a GuantÃ¡namo charter city as an opportunity for “undermining Cuba’s community regime.” It all sounds corny because it is. While groups like CCI propose their developments as innovative structures where cutting-edge tech can prosper,all they’re really doing is bringing back company towns. However, Trump isn’t completely off in his comparison. CCI’s ambitions are similar to past generations of Americans who relied on, you know, genocide and slavery. In its proposal, CCI pitched GuantÃ¡namo as a “unique opportunity to rethink immigration pathways while balancing economic opportunity with security concerns.” The proposal went on to suggest housing immigrants at GuantÃ¡namo for a “probationary period” while “evaluating their contributions to the local economy and society.” CCI also pitched a “Guantanamo Bay Tech Visa” to fast-track high-skilled workers into “market integration.” The idea of housing immigrants at GuantÃ¡namo isn’t far-fetched. In the early 90s, HIV-positive Haitian asylum seekers weredetainedat GuantÃ¡namo in horrific conditions. Earlier this year, Trump alsoorderedthe expansion of detention centers at GuantÃ¡namo. Although Trump aimed to detain up to 30,000 migrants on the bay,fewer than 500 people have been held there, per a New York Times report published this week. It’s possible to go on for days about how ugly and weird CCI’s proposal is. Trying to rebrand GuantÃ¡namo as a place of prosperity while simultaneously proposing modern-day slavery is foul. Immigrants are already dying in detention facilities due to medical neglect andsuicide. As Joseph Margulies, a Cornell professor and author ofGuantÃ¡namo and the Abuse of Presidential Power, told theNew Republic, “[The proposal] contemplates the creation of a place where human beings exist solely to demonstrate their capacity to participate in a neoliberal experiment. That’s just horrific.” Beyond the lack of humanity, CCI’s proposal is shaky from a legal perspective. It relies on the notion that GuantÃ¡namo is a regulation-free zone, but that’s not necessarily the case. Regardless, CCI and all these charter city bozos should be treated as the losers they are and booed anytime they talk. Instead, these organizations have the backing of tech billionaires likePeter Thiel,Marc Andreessen, andBalaji Srinivasan, and an administration that’s in full agreement. charter citiesguantanamo Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "New Old Guard 2 Trailer Sees Charlize Theron Cross Swords With Uma Thurman",
    "article_text": "Ahead of Netflix’sTudumevent, the streamer and Skydance released the official trailer forThe Old Guard 2, starring Charlize Theron. For those who may have forgotten,The OldGuardwas a pretty kick-ass sci-fi action film released on the streamer in 2020.ÂBased onÂGreg Rucka and Leandro FernÃ¡ndez’s Image Comics series,the movie follows a team ofimmortal mercenaries-turned-found family, led by Theron’s Andy, battling unseen threats to protect humanity. Along the waythey bring a girl named Nile (KiKi Layne) into the fold, have their secret exposed, and suffer betrayal from within their tight-knit group. Now, after five years of patient anticipation, the newly released trailer sees Andy confronting her former bestie Quynh (Veronica NgÃ´), whom she left in an iron maiden at the bottom of the ocean. Andy also has her work cut out with a deadly confrontation with the first immortal being, played by Uma Thurman, who threatens to destroy everything they hold dear with a power “they can’t even imagine.” Not only does Thurman’s villain come equipped with a katana, but she also has a mysterious bone to pick with Andy, rivaling the fury of the Bride’s warpath inKill Bill. Naturally, the trailer hints at a final showdown between Thurman and Theron, teasing a powerhouse match-up action fans didn’t know they wanted to see. Aside from the enticing tease of seeing Theron and Thurman fight, the trailer also sprinkles a nugget of information that would make their battle even more one-sided in Thurman’s favor. Despite apparently knowing the Old Guard’s history and relationships, she doesn’t seem to understand that Theron’s Andy is no longer immortalâthough who could blame her, with all of the death-defying stunts we see in the trailer? As revealed in the movie’s official description, with Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) in exile,Â Andy, Nile, Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli), and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) seek out Tuah (Henry Golding), an old ally who may hold the key to unlocking the secrets of their immortality. Whether this discovery will help Andy regain her lost immortality or strip it from Thurmanâs character to level the playing field for their final confrontation remains to be seen. Filming forThe Old Guard 2wrapped up in 2022, but post-production faced delays due toshifts at Netflix and industry-wide strikes. Because of the film’s radio silence, fans feared the project had been put on ice. However, in a2024 interview with Variety, Theron set the record straight, reassuring folks the sequel was still moving forwardâand that she was âreally excited about it.” “Itâs really good,â Theron told Variety. âItâs a really important film to us. I only wanted to do it if we could make it amazing. I really love this movie.” The Old Guard 2releases July 2. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "NASA May Accelerate Mars Mission Timeline Following Trump Budget Proposal",
    "article_text": "NASA is considering launching missions to Mars as early as next year in an effort to expedite its plan to land astronauts on the Red Planet. The surprise shift of focus comes less than a week after the U.S. administration released its proposed budget for the agency, which emphasizes the national goal of landing a human on Mars. The space agency is exploring the possibility of launching multiple missions to Mars in the very near future to accelerate its timeline for a human mission, Politicoreported. “We are evaluating every opportunity, including launch windows in 2026 and 2028, to test technologies that will land humans on Mars,” NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens is quoted in Politico as saying. The exact details of these missions, such as the rocket and payloads involved, were not disclosed. Last Friday, President Donald Trump’s administrationreleased a proposed budget for NASAâs fiscal year 2026, which highlighted the âobjectives of returning to the Moon before China and putting a man on Mars.â The proposed budget is a 24% cut from NASAâs current $24.8 billion budget for the year 2025, and the majority of programs are facing budget cuts save for NASAâs human space exploration budget, which received an additional $647 million compared to the 2025 budget. Trumpâs administration allocated an additional $1 billion in new investment for programs focused on Mars. The proposed budget would also axe NASA’s Mars Sample Return mission, suggesting that the plan to return rocky samples from Mars by way of a fleet of robots can be carried out by a human mission instead. If NASA were to launch a mission to Mars by next year, SpaceX’s megarocket Starship would be the most fit for the job. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has a fixation on Mars, and he often rants about his plans to colonize the planet so that humans become a multi-planetary species. Musk recentlystatedthat Starship is set to launch to Mars by the end of 2026, with human missions to the Red Planet taking place as early as 2029. Musk’s obsession with Mars seems to have translated to a change of direction for NASA under Trump’s administration, of which the rocket billionaire is a close ally. Starship has had a total of eight test flights so far, and it has made steady progress. This week, the Federal Aviation AdministrationgrantedSpaceX the license tolaunch as many as 25 times a year from Starbase,a significant jump from the previous limit of just five annual launches. This development will help move Starship along, although it’s not clear whether it will be Mars-ready by next year. Launching a mission to Mars isn’t something you can plan on a whimâthere are lots of factors to consider, such as rocket readiness and orbital mechanics. Presumably, SpaceX’s Starship rocket will be the launch vehicle of choice for these missions. In order to reach Mars, Starship needs to pull off a complex orbital refueling to help it reach beyond Earth’s orbit. That’s not a small thing, and SpaceX is still a long way from demonstrating that capability in space. Importantly, missions to Mars are often timed based on when Earth and the Red Planet are in close proximity, to reduce time and costs of missions to the Red Planet. As The Economist explained in a recentarticle: The only difficulty arises from the need to arrive at such a point at the same time as Mars itself does. Getting that right requires Earth to lag behind Mars by roughly 45 degrees at the time of launch, a state of affairs which comes around only every two-and-a-bit yearsâwhich is to say, only twice in any given four-year presidential term. If humans are to be launched to Mars before Mr Trumpâs constitutional time is up, they will have to leave Earthâs orbit during the opportunity which opens at the end of 2028. So the mission isn’t too risky, at least one uncrewed precursor landing would need to happen firstâand that would have to launch during the window starting in late 2026, according to the Economist. It’s an open question as to whether NASA and its partners can meet these challenges. Regardless, the race to Mars is heating upârealistic or not.

The incident came at the height of a rocket rivalry between SpaceX and ULA. SpaceX is looking to increase its rocket launches, which local environmental groups say are harming nearby wildlife. The space-based observatory will scan the cosmos in 102 colors we can't see to unlock the secret history of the universe. The budget threatens to kill Lunar Gateway and the Mars Sample Return mission, along with phasing out the gigantic SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. \"Elon is so terrific,\" the president told graduates at the University of Alabama.

    "title": "The $170 Backbone Pro Mobile Controller Falls Just Short of Premium",
    "article_text": "In an effort to expandbeyond smartphones, Backbone is now selling an everything controller. Just like theBackbone One, the new $170 Backbone Pro turns a phone into a quick and dirty gaming handheld, but with added Bluetooth connectivity, it also connects to a PC or smart TV. If youâre the traveling kind, it promises to be the only quality (albeit expensive) controller you need to take with you. Or it would be a solid 2-in-1 gamepad ifâunlike meâyou apparently have enormous hands. See Backbone Pro at Amazon There has to be something exemplary about a âProâ device, especially to justify the $170 price compared to the $100 you pay for the Backbone One. If you judge it merely by its on-paper feature set, thereâs not so much that stands out. The new mobile controller has a pair of back buttons on both the left and right grips. Not exciting enough? The Backbone Pro also houses a special pairing button for connecting to external devicesâmainly PC, Mac, or TVâover Bluetooth. You can combine it with the Backbone+ app for button mapping and easy swapping between connected devices with the new âFlowStateâ feature. Backbone Pro It feels good in hand, but there are missing features that make it less 'pro' than it could be. Pros Cons That easy swapping is especially nice for gaming on multiple devices, but is it the controller you honestly want to use for both PC and mobile? Controllers live and die by how they feel in your hands. If youâve ever held a Backbone One, you have a good idea of the general feel for the âProâ controller, even though there are subtle improvements. The high point of the Backbone One is the D-pad and face buttons, which arenât overly loud even though they have the sort of clicky feeling I enjoy most on low-profile controls. This pricier Backbone includes Hall effect triggers, but even if the new full-size thumbsticks are responsive, they are still the traditional ALPS-type sensor. These use potentiometers to calculate the orientation of the stick, and that can lead to wear and stick drift, whereas Hall effect sticks normally last longer. Hall effect sticks would be more welcome on a gamepad whose full-sized sticks could get knocked around in your backpack when traveling. The Backbone Proâs satin-textured grips have the feel I normally only get from premium devices, but is it $170 premium? If I had to judge, it wasnât quite on par with high-end âProâ level devices from the likes of SCUF, Razer, or even anXbox Elite wireless controller. These devices normally cost closer to $200 or more, so the Backbone Pro needs to be pitch-perfect. Using the controller, I found my hands were big enough that I needed to adjust my grip ever-so-slightly if I wanted to access the face buttons or D-pad while maintaining quick access to the thumbsticks. Itâs not a problem when playing some mobile titles or emulating retro titles. When playing a more modern game such asThe Elder Scrolls V: Oblivionremake through Xbox Game Pass, I had to adjust my grip more than I was used to. A larger device like aGamesir G8+fits my hands better, but its controls donât feel nearly as polished as the Backbone Pro. There are other trade-offs to consider. Unlike the Backbone One, there is no version of the Pro that supports Appleâs Lightning connection. TheRazer Kishi Ultra at $150extends far enough to fit a tiny tablet, but the Backbone Pro doesnât even stretch to allow for the most recentiPad miniâs 8.3-inch screen. Thatâs where Bluetooth could come in handy, if only I could cover or remove the USB-C dongle to fit my non-standard device inside. Combined with a foldable phone like theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Backbone Pro became a kind of pseudo gaming handheld that was especially handy for playing games that fit its wonky 20:9 aspect ratio, specificallyDiablo Immortal. Add on the ease of the Backbone+ app, and the Backbone Pro makes streaming games through Nvidia GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass far more of a console-like experience. The app promotes its âdual screenâ experience when playing on PC or TV. However, itâs only useful for checking the charge on both the controller and the phone. The battery life is perhaps the Backbone Pro’s best feature. I could go for around three hours without seeing the device dipping into the 20% mark. The gamepad also includes smart passthrough charging that tops off both the phone and built-in battery at once. I canât knock the build quality on the Backbone Pro. It has controls Iâd be happy to use on practically any other gaming device, though only if I didnât have any of my other preferred controls around. The Backbone Pro is the wireless controller I would slip into my backpack if that space already wasn’t occupied with mySteam Deck. As for a mobile controller that would actually fit in my pocket, I’ll just keep waiting forMCon to slip into my life.

    "article_text": "Forget the cars, cash, and criminals: I want to go on a wilderness walk. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A mere 15 seconds into the newGTA 6 trailerand we've already spotted something exciting. No, I'm not talking about Jason Duval's chiseled torso. I'm talking about all the animals you can see if you're not staring at Jason Duval's chiseled torso. You probably saw a bunch of seagulls and pelicans flying overhead as the trailer opens: they're easy enough to spot. But there's also an enormous iguana ambling toward Jason's house in the very second shot, and a raccoon can be seen, twice, digging through a trashcan in the background as Brian chastises our hunky hero. Aw, trash panda! That's not all the wildlife and pets on display in the trailer and screenshots Rockstar released this week, if you pull your eyes away from the action. A bodega cat sits on an ATM cleaning itself as Jason buys beer, Jason and Lucia have a pet python in their house. There's even a great white shark that can just barely be seen lurking beneath the waves of a busy marina. I'm thrilled to see all these creatures in the background (I feel like I spot more each time I watch) and there are also plenty on full display: along with the trailer Rockstar released abuttload of screenshotsthis week featuring sea turtles, panthers, deer, gators, and don't worry, they didn't forget dogs. Even screens with an animal front and center, like the one below showing a couple of gators, you can still see more animals: there are some herons or maybe spoonbills to the middle-right of the image and what may be nutria or muskrats to the middle-left. I'm glad the tradition continues: GTA 5 also has tons of animals if you know where to look. Head to the farms of Grapeseed and you'll see pigs and chickens. Take a trip to Mount Chiliad and you might spot some elk or boars. From cougars to coyotes to cows to cats, the world is full of wildlife, livestock, and pets, so I'm happy to see GTA 6 is also bursting at the seams with feathered and furry friends. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Some of my excitement is purely selfish: a mod for GTA 5 let meplay the game as a shark, which was quite honestly the most fun I had in GTA 5. Who needs guns when you can just bite your enemies in half? As long as they're in the water, that is. If not, you might have to wriggle out on land or call for a cabbie to have a snack: I know my dream of being a shark in GTA 6 is a long, long way off: first the game has to come out in 2026, then it has to come out on PC in 2027 (?), and then modders will have to do whatever magic they do that will let me inhabit a shark instead of Jason Duval. But I bet it'll be worth waiting for. I'm also happy because Rockstar gives a lot of attention to its animals in general. The wildlife in Red Dead Redemption 2 was so enjoyable, not just to hunt (though that was fun), but to observe. The horses were incredibly detailed, the bears were terrifying, and everything else from birds to beavers to bullfrogs were so caringly created that it made putting down your pistol and going on a nature walk supremely satisfying. To me, GTA and RDR games are most enjoyable once you've finished the story missions and are left with a big, beautiful sandbox to explore and play around in. Once Jason and Lucia's drama is in my rearview, I'm looking forward to parking the car and going on a long nature walk to see how many animals I can spot. And hopefully, somewhere down the line, I'll get to play as a shark again.

    "title": "I couldn't have played Clair Obscur without its accessibility settings, and now it might be my GOTY",
    "article_text": "One toggle between delight and disaster. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I was enthralled by Sandfall's gorgeousBelle Époque-styled RPG from the moment it began, but I camethisclose to not playing it at all. Almost as soon as I startedClair ObscurI knew I couldn't get enough of its beautiful world or the wonderfully naturalistic performances of its cast. I settled in, eager to dedicate the rest of the day and hopefully all of the next to this fascinating game. And then it all fell apart in the same moment. As you may already know, Clair Obscur mixes traditional turn-based RPG combat, everyone lined up and politely waiting around until they get to have a go, with an exciting real-time dodge/parry system. I can dodge everything.Everything. Some boss comes at my team with a sword a mile long? Yep, I can dodge that. I can even get a bonus if I manage to dodge everything, like someone got a bit of Devil May Cry in myDernière Fantaisie. In theory, anyway. The truth is, even though I've been battling virtual mythical creatures my entire life on almost every game platform ever created, I just couldn't handlelookingat Clair Obscur's combat. The camera kept tripping me up. It's a busy little thing, dynamically zooming about and shifting around as swords swing and spells fly, always trying to show the most exciting angles as multiple pieces of information are hurled onto the screen from literally every direction at differing speeds. I tried to ignore it, because of course I'm not going to let a few fancy swooshes, split-second pop-ups, a plethora of animated tells, and sudden, sharp cuts get in the way of a good story, but after forcing myself for a few minutes longer it became obvious I couldn't continue. I had to shut the game off and stew in my own disappointment, honestly wondering whether I should just put in for a Steam refund. The unavoidable onslaught of ever-changing visual information was more than I could bear. The presentation is so much more than just \"busy\" or personally irritating, it's physically painful for me to process, like someone's shouting directly at my eyeballs. Ithurts. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If that sounds like an extreme reaction to a few camera movements: you're probably not autistic. I am, and for all the joy that brings into my life—like an unquenchable thirst for gaming knowledge and a fondness for theem dash—it also means some forms of stimulation are more than I can handle. Touch can be overwhelming at times, leaving me sitting in a quiet room with my hands upturned for however long it takes my body to calm down. Most kitchen appliances are too noisy, leaving me puréeing, whisking, and washing by hand. It was only after I grumbled about my experience with Clair Obscur online, frustrated and upset, that several people kindly pointed out there was an option to disable much of the wild camera movement in the accessibility menu. I didn't look. I honestly didn't even think to look. I've come to assume accessibility menus are for subtitles, color blind options, the odd arachnophobia toggle, and maybe some sort of \"story\" or \"god mode\" setting if we're really lucky, serving as a handy catch-all for anyone who finds a game too difficult or tiring to engage with. I didn't think it'd contain anything for an autistic adult struggling with something as vague as \"It's painful when you make the camera swing around like that.\" And to be entirely fair, I'm not the kind of person the developers had in mind. The option to disable camera movement is labelled as being for people who suffer from motion sickness, and by their own description's admission this setting makes some attacks harder to read. They're right. Some attacks really are harder to read, bosses disappearing skyward while the camera stays behind, forcing me to rely on half-seen special effects and audio cues to time my counters. But I love it anyway. Because my options for playing Clair Obscur weren't between \"easier to read\" and \"harder to read.\" They were between \"I literally can't look at the screen\" and \"at times this isn't framing attacks quite right, but eh, I'll manage.\" Imagine if the developers hadn't bothered. Imagine if they'd decided it was probably fine and nobody was going to mention it even if it wasn't. For me, that'd mean all that story, lost. Eight hours worth of beautiful music unplayed (and unbought). Dramatic battles left unchallenged. What a waste of Sandfall's time, funds, and talents that would have been for me and so many other players like me. Thanks to this toggle I have a choice, and I get to decide what I'm prepared to put up with. Which is what accessibility's all about, really:Allowing as many people as possible to join in the fun, to be provided a practical suite of tools and then left to create their own solutions and compromises. Thanks to one tiny toggle I'm about 17 hours and 2000 wallpaper-worthy screenshots into Clair Obscur, and resentful that I have to work instead of playing some more. This could honestly be my GOTY. Sandfall has got more than my money—they've got a new fan. Whatever they make next, I'll be there day one.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alien: Rogue Incursion launched on Steam in 2024 to \"mixed\" user reviews and modest player numbers, no doubt in large part because it's a VR-exclusive game and if you don't have a headset, well, you just can't play. But in September, those of us who are not VR equipped will have a chance to check it out for ourselves viaAlien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, a \"re-envisioned\" take on the game that opens it up to all PC gamers. The new-for-most-of-us Alien game follows former colonial marine Zula Hendricks on her mission to expose \"black-site experiments\" being conducted by the Weyland-Yutani corporation. In the company of her synthetic companion Davis 01, she must penetrate the Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and, using both stealth andguns, deal with yet another xenomorph infestation. The current Steam listing for Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition is for the first of a two-part story, \"where you will uncover the secrets lurking within the GES facility on LV-354, the enigmatic planet Purdan.\" Developer Survios says it \"stands alone as a complete story,\" but also \"leaves you hanging on a thrilling cliffhanger,\" which honestly does not sound like a complete story to me—if anything, it's the opposite. Still, while thereviews on Steamare mixed—68% positive, which isn't great but far from disastrous—the VR version of Alien: Rogue Incursion seems to be faring better on theMeta Store, where it holds a 4/5 rating across 475 reviews. Dodgy performance seems to be the most common complaint on Steam, which the new non-VR version may do something about. But it also may not—there are no system requirements listed at this point, nor did Survios say anything about how the game has been \"re-envisioned,\" so we'll have to wait and see on that front. Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition is set to launch on September 30, and one bit of potential good news is that owners of the VR version may get this updated edition for free. It hasn't been confirmed yet, but several people who own the VR release say the Evolved Edition has already been added to their library.

    "title": "How do you get fresh blood in a 22-year-old, infamously impenetrable MMO? EVE Online hopes it's a 'player-created gig economy' that has veterans making missions for newbies: 'We're 100% sure that you will do a better job'",
    "article_text": "Space spreadsheets, meet space gig economy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At EVE Online's yearly Fanfest in Reykjavik, Iceland, developer CCP Games announced the 22-year-old MMO's next expansion,Legion. In addition to new ships and quality of life features, Legion looks to offer one of the most creative solutions I've ever seen for getting new players invested in a complex, long-runner MMO: Just put the veteran players in charge. Members of EVE's player corporations will be able to create missions⁠—collect so much of a material, eliminate players of an enemy faction, etc.—and post them on a \"Freelance Jobs\" board for unaffiliated players to pick up. Speaking with EVE senior brand manager Ingibjörg Lilja Diðriksdóttir at Fanfest, she called it a \"player-driven, player-created gig economy.\" There's an element of self-service for the corps: Getting extra help in areas they aren't specialized to handle, or farming out grunt work to freelancers (just like real life!). But the real coup is how this will, hopefully, allow the corporations to recruit new members, while inexperienced players will be introduced to EVE's player economyby the game itself. Instead of jumping from developer-made tutorial missions straight into a Discord full of strangers, you'll be introduced to them through in-game objectives that benefit both sides of the relationship. CCP knows it makes a challenging game—that's a major part of this rigorous, economics-focused space sim's enduring appeal. But that also compounds the struggle of attracting new players to an MMO with so much history already under its belt, and combatting any perception that the party might already be over. \"You're not catching up,\" said Diðriksdóttir. \"You don't have 20 years of catching up to do. You can start now, you can still make your mark, and you can still make a real impact from day one.\" EVE has an outsize reputation for massive conflicts and audacious intrigues perpetrated by its player-run corporations⁠—to compare them to other games' guilds does a disservice to their professionalized organization both in and outside of the game. Theirspreadsheets, payrolls, and communication long ago expanded beyond the in-game tools offered by CCP and rival honest-to-god businesses that bring in real dollars. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. They've become the main selling point of the game: Prove yourself in a singular PvP sandbox, and potentially form the sort of friendships that will have you shipping off to Iceland for a convention multiple times over the course of 20 years. Speaking to players at Fanfest, including longtime EVE streamerRahne, I got the impression that getting fresh faces into EVE and, crucially, keeping them there, was a major concern among veteran players. Rahne in particular thought that hooking them into EVE's ecosystem of corporations and alliances as quickly and smoothly as possible was the way to do it. And CCP seems to agree: \"If you make it into a player organization, your chance of surviving EVE goes up tenfold,\" said EVE creative director Bergur Finnbogason. \"There are two moments like that: Getting into a player organization, and the other is, if you die flying with another player, and that player tells you why you died.\" Many MMOs have problems with tutorials, or let you breeze through levels 1-40 until you smash headfirst into the far more complex endgame or \"real\" part of the experience⁠. That's very much the case with EVE, and CCP's tutorials are no substitute for a player with thousands of hours of experience as your copilot. \"We want people to experience the beauty of EVE. And the beauty of EVE is when you fly with others,\" Finnbogason said. Finnbogason and EVE game director Snorri Árnason characterized CCP's experiments with onboarding new players as a \"pendulum\" that has swung between careful hand-holding and absentee parenting over the years, never quite finding a way to consistently get newcomers over the social and mechanical gulf before joining a corporation. At a keynote presentation at Fanfest, Árnason told the crowd, \"We're 100% sure that you will do a better job.\" \"I think every idea from other games has been brought up,\" said Árnason. EVE's economy fundamentally limits how much CCP can intervene and \"baby\" new players by protecting them from financial consequences or offering them safe, PvP-disabled spaces. That's actually another area where Diðriksdóttir thinks shortening EVE'stime-to-corpmight help: In addition to having backup to prevent disasters in the first place, a corporation's financial resources mean the loss of a ship might not be as much of a death sentence. This new initiative in EVE is also just inherently cool for anyone interested in live games or modding: An MMO where players create the quests, and are so supported by the developers that in-game progression can be tied to user-made content from the moment you boot it up. I can't remember anything like this outside extremely niche or otherwise fully DIY games: SomeMulti-User Dungeons, Neverwinter Nights' \"persistent world\" mini-MMOs, and fan servers for mothballed games like Star Wars Galaxies orCity of Heroes. CCP has said that building out this capacity in EVE resulted in an overhaul in how it designs and implements new story missions internally⁠—basically, it sounds like the tools are now much easier and more intuitive. While Diðriksdóttir and EVE producer Ed Smith wouldn't definitively say these tools would come to players, it certainly seems like that's the way EVE is heading, potentially allowing for even more complex community-made missions in future expansions. Player-created missions seamlessly integrated into EVE on equal footing with CCP's own, working together to drive future player-led wars? That strikes me as potentially incredible innovation out of a game that's already been kicking for nearly a quarter-century. Even more traditional games might have something to learn from how EVE is handling its player retention/new player conundrum. Destiny's weekly grind of repeatable activities always felt like it was in an entirely separate sphere from its challenging, brilliantly designed dungeons and raids⁠—the best part of the game is the least approachable, just like EVE's corporations and fleet battles. Bungie's statistics have shown that only an estimated11% of players ever completed a raid. Everyone I spoke with at EVE Fanfest was excited about getting new players into the game, and they seemed on board with the Freelance Job board as a way to do it. So if you've ever been EVE-curious, maybe just wait a few more weeks to give it a shot: The Legion expansion and its Freelance Jobs arrive on May 27. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "article_text": "Word of Mobius Digital's new project arrived in a throwaway comment in the patch notes for the final Outer Wilds update. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Six years after the release of the most excellent sci-fi camping gameOuter Wilds, developer Mobius Digital is working on something new, a fact it let slip in a recently-released update—which is also the final \"major update\" planned for the game.0. It's unusual, you see, because typically when a studio begins work on a new game, and especially when it's following up on a big critical and commercial hit, there's noise about it: Game sites get a press release, an announcement goes out on social media, the dev team drops a teaser of some sort, all that sort of thing. In this case, though, there was none of that. Instead, there was an off-the-cuff comment in the Outer Wilds' patch 16changelog. \"This is a minor patch mainly for adding a couple folks to the credits and fixing two PC-only bugs: clicking out of the game disabling certain inputs (such as the key for the ship’s lock on), which affected streamers in particular, and diagonal movement being faster than normal with mouse and keyboard,\" the studio wrote, explaining that the patch would launch on Steam first and follow for other platforms later in May.\"Why stagger the releases like this? It’s to increase the chance that, if any bad bugs on Steam slipped through testing, they’ll get caught and fixed before the release of the other platforms. This is no shade to our QA testers, we’re just trying to be extra risk averse and conservative with the resources we put toward Outer Wilds since our new game is our priority!\" Lest there be any confusion, the studio repeated the statement at the end of the patch notes: \"There are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game.\" Now personally, I could not swear to you that this is the very first time a new game from Mobius Digital has ever been announced, but I believe it is.RPSsays it is, for one thing (that's who tipped me off), and there also appears to be genuine surprise about the development on social media. That's also where Mobius Digital warned that, even though the word is now out, people shouldn't expect to hear anything more about the new game anytime soon. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"It's gonna be a while, on the order of years, before we have any details to share about it,\" the studio wrote onXin response to one inquiry about the new project. \"Good things take time.\" The full patch notes for the latest Outer Wilds update, since that's what brought us here in the first place, are below. As mentioned before, there are no more major updates planned for Outer Wilds or Echoes of the Eye because we are hard at work on our next game.

    "title": "Titan Quest 2 early access delayed due to 'a lot of noise' from ARPG competitors, but the developers say closed playtest results have been 'incredibly motivating'",
    "article_text": "Best to let things settle a bit, perhaps. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I have unfortunate news for everyone else who spent too much time reading about Greek mythology when you were a teen: We can't play Titan Quest 2 as soon as we'd hoped. In aSteam news posttoday, developer Grimlore Games announced that the Ancient Greek Diablo-like's early access launch is being pushed back to summer. Considering it was originally announced as a Winter 2024/2025 release, we probably shouldn't be surprised, because, you know. That was a season ago. The reason, Grimlore Games said, is that it was \"closely monitoring the market and realized there was a lot of noise with regards to ARPG in our targeted release window.\" If anything, that's an understatement. In the last six months, Path of Exile 2 hit its own early access launch, embarking on a rollercoaster of difficulty discourse anddisastrous patch rollouts. Diablo 4, meanwhile, is causing upsets with ever moreexpensive cosmetic bundles. And while those two heavy hitters stir up turmoil, Last Epoch has emerged as a Diablo-likedark horse for discontented loot goblins. So, yeah. Things are a bit loud in ARPGs at the moment. Probably better for Titan Quest 2 to wait for the volume to die down. But despite the delay, Grimlore said it's gotten \"incredibly motivating\" data from its closed demo playtest in March, which contained the game's introduction chapter, Mastery selection (subclasses, basically), and a boss fight with what looks like some kind of giant, horrible griffin. In a refreshing case of game development transparency, the studio shared some of the numbers from its playtest survey, and the responses from early testers sounds promising. 92% of surveyed players reported a \"very positive experience,\" which includes the 66% of players who described themselves as recent Titan Quest players or TQ1 experts. Good sign if the diehards are pleased. Grimlore said results were similarly positive for the game's atmosphere, quests, and combat design, with players reporting—on a scale of 1 to 6—an average difficulty rating of 3.6. \"This is a good place to be—challenging but not unfair,\" Grimlore said. \"We want to strike a balance between engaging combat and an experience relaxing enough to enjoy after a long day.\" Given my own appreciation forcasually blowing up screens of skeletons, that's reassuring to hear. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The studio did acknowledge areas that players identified as needing some improvement, however—namely that some described the combat as feeling a little low tempo. Grimlore said its goal is to make combat feel \"tactical and meaningful, but it should never feel sluggish,\" and that it's \"looking into improvements.\" Work's also been done to alleviate struggles that some players had with aiming abilities during fights. We don't know when exactly to expect Titan Quest 2's early access launch this summer, but the developers said they \"hope to be able to announce a fixed date very soon.\" Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept.

    "title": "'This is not our first rodeo': Dune: Awakening team confident servers won't implode at launch",
    "article_text": "\"Rest assured, there will be thousands of servers grouped together in hundreds of Worlds available at launch,\" Funcom said. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's something we've seen happen so many times previously it's now an expected part of gaming: the launch of a highly-anticipated multiplayer game and the immediate failure of that game's servers to handle the massive influx of players on day one. Survival MMODune: Awakeninghas aweekend betabeginning tomorrow and a full launch planned for June 10. Will it suffer the same server issues as so many other games before it? Developer Funcom wants to preemptively settle your nerves. \"We’ve seen several comments expressing concerns about server load and queues,\" Funcom said in apost on Steam. \"We certainly expect heavy loads at launch, and that is why we are preparing accordingly.\" Noting that full servers are \"impossible to completely avoid,\" the developer said \"there will be thousands of servers grouped together in hundreds of Worlds available at launch,\" spread out across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, adding that it'll be able to \"spin up more\" servers if necessary. \"This is not our first rodeo, we’ve launched several MMOs and survival games over the past 25 years, and we have a robust set of tools and processes in place, managed by an experienced live operations team,\" Funcom said. I love the confidence, but I feel like I've heard other developers and publishers claim they have systems in place that can handle things if more players show up than expected. And to my memory, no matter how good the plan is for day one, things can and usually do go awry. In fact, day one server woes seem to be getting more common instead of less over time. We even deemed 2024 \"the year of server issues\" because it happened again and again: the launch of a big game followed by players gnashing their teeth because they couldn't get online. We saw it with games like Helldivers 2, Last Epoch, Palworld, Nightingale, and Microsoft Flight Simulator: they all quickly faltered under the strain of a massive influx of players and had to scramble to get the problems fixed. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That can take time. It was a couple of weeks before Helldivers 2 sorted itself out. Microsoft Flight Simulator was completely unplayable for nearly everyone for its entire launch day. Last Epoch had been playable in early access for years and was still caught off guard when one of its services unexpectedly failed during its 1.0 launch. Even with a plan in place, Funcom is already warning players of potential issues, particularly one that every player dreads: \"you will join a server queue when logging in\" if a player concurrency cap is reached, Funcom said. Funcom also suggests maybe that isn't a bad thing? \"Commonly, survival games don’t offer this, and you are left having to wait and hope you are able to click fast enough when a slot opens up,\" Funcom said. \"By adding a server queue functionality, you can simply click once and rest easy knowing that you will get in when a slot becomes available to you.\" We'll see how the beta goes this weekend: Funcom has released \"tens of thousands\" of beta keys which sounds like a healthy amount for a real stress test. But even that probably won't come close to the full launch in June, which could attract potentially hundreds of thousands of players.

    "article_text": "Barone doesn't want to \"just be the Stardew Valley guy,\" but a sequel isn't out of the question. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stardew Valleycreator Eric Barone, who's presently considering hiding away in a cabin to finish his long awaited next game,Haunted Chocolatier, says he might one day get around to making a sequel to the farming life sim that made him famous. Stardew Valley 2 could \"eventually\" happen, Barone told comedian Bobby Lee on arecent episode of the TigerBelly podcast(viaGamesRadar). The topic comes up at around 43 minutes into the episode, after Lee asks Barone why he keeps adding free updates to Stardew Valley rather than making Stardew Valley 2. \"It's so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch,\" Barone said. \"Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have, whimsical ideas. \"Because I'll play Stardew Valley myself, and when I'm playing, I'm like, 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way.\" Pressed to consider how much money a Stardew Valley sequel could make, Barone said that it could happen, but not because he wants to get richer. \"I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest,\" he said, adding after a follow-up question about why he doesn't charge for Stardew Valley updates, \"I just don't care about money that much to be honest.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Responding to friendly mock applause from the podcasters, Barone added, \"Alright, I'm not trying to virtue signal. But I honestly don't care about money that much. It's never been the driving, motivating factor. What I care about is people loving the game.\" Barone doesn't strike me as the type to have blown his Stardew Valley fortune on yachts, so it helps that affording necessities is unlikely to be a concern of his for the foreseeable future. But another reason he hasn't made a sequel, he says, is that he doesn't want to \"just be the Stardew Valley guy,\" which is why he's working onHaunted Chocolatier. At GDC earlier this year,Barone told PC Gamerthat he's now fully focused on the candy-themed life sim. \"I think at some point I'm going to have to completely cut off everything else,\" Barone said. \"Honestly, I've thought about, maybe I should just go into a cabin in the woods and completely get off the internet, and just say, 'Okay guys, I'll see you in two years. You won't hear from me at all and I'm going to finish this game.'\" Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call \"boomer shooters\" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!).

We know a lot about the survival sandbox take on Frank Herbert'sDune series, but test runs have historically been far more limited and tight-lipped.

    "title": "EB Games is coming back to Canada, 'with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart'",
    "article_text": "And hopefully not NFTs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. EB Games lives again—in Canada, at least. GameStop Canada has been acquired by Stephan Tetrault, an entrepreneur and \"longtime leader in the collectibles and entertainment space,\" and is being relaunched asEB Games Canada, \"a beloved and iconic name many Canadian gamers still associate with their earliest gaming experiences.\" It seems like an odd move at first blush. The rise of online shopping has been absolutely murder for conventional retail, and nowhere is that truer than in the field of videogame sales. Why go to the trouble of driving to the mall, after all, when you can just browse over to your digital storefront of choice and choose from among, well,everything? \"This isn't just a business decision—it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved,\" Tetrault said in a statement. \"We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart.\" Tetrault is definitely going to have to lean into those aspirational qualities. Selling videogames is pretty much a sideline for game retailers these days, which typically seem to be more focused on Funkos, gift cards, peripherals, various types of game-adjacentswagand occasionally getting stupid withNFTs, that is. But that seems to be more up his alley anyway: He's the founder and owner ofImports Dragon, a \"global toy manufacturer and distributor that has become one of the fastest growing toy companies in Canada,\" and is also co-owner ofMcFarlane Toys. It's kind of amusing (to me, at least) that GameStop hasn't actually been in Canada all that terribly long. It has beenlegally—GameStop acquired EB Games in 2005—but it continued to operate in the country as EB Games until 2021, when it finally got around torebranding. Less than four years later, it all seems like kind of a waste of time: The old name is coming back, but for many of us who aren't regular visitors, it never really left. It's been years since EB (or GameStop) had any relevance to PC gaming, but I'm old enough to remember when it was a destination—a time before the eminence of Steam, when PC games came in boxes, took up as much space on the shelves as console games, and browsing the bargain bins—which to be clear were literally wire bins with cheap games dumped into them—was a genuine and often rewarding thrill. And I know that's not coming back, but even so it'll be nice to see the old shingle back over the door—and yeah, I'll probably stick my head in when I'm in town anyway. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Bill Gates says Elon Musk's DOGE cutbacks are directly responsible for kids dying: 'The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one'",
    "article_text": "Adds that Musk has no idea what these agencies do. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has announced a new plan to give away99% of his $108 billion fortune by 2045, alongside which he's givenan interview to the Financial Timesdamning the actions of his fellow billionaire Elon Musk within the Trump administration. Gates' blog post outlines his core goals for the Gates Foundation, but it's in this context that Gates takes aim at not just Musk but countries like the UK and France for cutting foreign aid budgets. \"It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people,\" says Gates. \"But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty.\" Gates then went for Musk, claiming that the Tesla CEO's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) makes Musk personally responsible for the outcome of decisions such as cutting the US Agency for International Development's budget and gutting its staff. \"The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,\"said Gates. He raises the example of a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, which President Donald Trump falsely claimed was using US funding to make condoms \"for Hamas,\" a claim that Musk himself later acknowledged was wrong. Musk also confused the hospital's location with Gaza in Palestine, saying at the time \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect.\" \"I'd love for [Musk] to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,\" said Gates. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Gates goes on to reference Musk calling USAID \"a criminal organisation\", saying this shows Musk has no idea what the agency does. This is not the first time that the billionaires have clashed, with Musk previously calling Gates' style of philanthropic giving \"bullshit\" and claiming companies like Tesla would more effectively tackle issues like climate change. Gates' blog post says The Gates Foundation has spent around $100 billion on its various projects, and expects to spend $200 million over the next two decades. Gates explains some of his thinking by citing a 1889 essay by Andrew Carnegie, The Gospel of Wealth, which argues that the super-rich have a moral duty to return their fortunes to society. \"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,\" says Gates.

    "title": "Death Stranding was all about connection, but after Covid-era metaverse hype, Kojima says that 'maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much'",
    "article_text": "Woopsie! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is due for release in June, though the inevitable PC version is yet to be confirmed: let's just hopeit doesn't take eight monthsthis time. Creator and director Hideo Kojima has been on the interview circuit and, among other things like constantly making Metal Gear comparisons, gives some surprising insights into the themes of both games. Necessary context here is that, while Death Stranding was developed before the Covid-19 pandemic, it released a few months beforehand. Coincidence though it may have been, it made the game's themes of isolation, delivery work, and internet-style social connections seem absurdly prescient and, as time went on,even quite haunting. \"Death Stranding was developed before the pandemic,\"says Kojima to IGN. \"There were movements toward division at the time such as the United Kingdom leaving the EU, and so both its story and gameplay were created based on my thoughts on that during that time. But then Covid started three months after [releasing] the game, and I was truly shocked.\" Brief refresher: the United Kingdom narrowly voted to leave the EU in 2016, following a divisive national campaign riven with half-truths and misguided notions such as \"taking back control.\" The UK officially left the EU in 2020 and, while opinions differ, the vast majority of economists regard it as an act of self-sabotage, and the political after-effects continue to be felt. \"Now in the 21st century, though, we have the Chiral Network... which is to say the internet,\" continues Kojima. \"Spanish flu struck in the early 20th century, but we were able to survive this time because we were connected by the internet. We started working remotely, while concerts and live events vanished. We had no choice but to rely on the internet. Children couldn't go to school or play and had to stare at screens all day. \"I think we didn't have any other choice at the time. You'd turn on the TV and hear about how the metaverse was the next big thing, but that isn't how human communication works. You don't meet people by chance that way.\" I'm very much here for Hideo Kojima just casually dismissing the metaverse, not least because he strikes me as being quite right. And what's interesting about Kojima's thoughts is where they lead to, which is essentially that he might have been too starry-eyed about the idea of people connecting in this way. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"This may sound strange, but I made the first game based on the theme of, 'We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect,'\" says Kojima. \"Then Covid hit after it came out. After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings, including 'the stick and the rope.' I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title.\" Kojima goes on to talk about the strands that dangled down from the original's logo, which in the sequel dangle above the logo like puppet strings. \"It's kind of like the logo for The Godfather,\" says Kojima. \"This applies to Dollman too, and you'll find enemies dangling from strands if you go to the weapons factory as well. I added a lot of moments that will make players aware of the presence of different strands. When you really think about it, what does it mean to be connected? I hope you'll play the game when it comes out at the end of June. You've all gone through Covid, so there should be something to resonate with for everyone.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Palworld devs 'disappointed' as they patch out a game mechanic to appease Nintendo, but 'the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration'",
    "article_text": "Goodbye, Pal gliding. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today, Palworld received a new patch. Update v0.5.5 doesn't add any new features, Pals, or environments. It doesn't fix any bugs or offer any optimization improvements. Instead, the accompanyingSteam news postfrom developer Pocketpair only includes one patch note: Pocketpair offered additional context for the update ina post on X, explaining that the adjustment to Pal gliding was \"another compromise\" made in response toNintendo's ongoing lawsuit, which alleges that Pocketpair infringed on a series of patents protecting Pokémon game mechanics. In its tweet, Pocketpair confirmed that an earlier November 2024 update to Palworld, which made it so Pals were summoned beside the player instead of released from Poké Ball-esque spheres, had been implemented to address the lawsuit allegations. \"As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration,\" Pocketpair said. \"Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.\" [Regarding the lawsuit, changes to Palworld and the future]We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust…May 8, 2025 Likewise, Pocketpair said that today's patch was \"necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.\" Pocketpair doesn't specify what that \"greater deterioration of the gameplay experience\" might have been, but considering Nintendo's history of pursuing a salted-earth legal strategy, I suspect it was less a matter of maintaining fun gameplay and more about the game's continued existence. The patents asserted in Nintendo's lawsuit,JP7545191,JP7493117, andJP7528390, grant protections on a series of mechanics related to catching and riding Pokémon as implemented in 2022's Pokémon Legends: Arceus. By updating Palworld to distance its mechanics from those described in Nintendo's asserted patents, Pocketpair is following a prediction made by videogame IP lawyer Kirk Sigmon, who spoke to PC Gamer in September 2024 about thelawsuit's potential outcomes. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The lawsuit, Sigmon said, presents risks for both sides. For Nintendo, the risk would be losing those patents entirely. Personally speaking, my criticisms of Palworld arepretty well-documented, and even I think the idea that Nintendo can claim a patent on riding a creature around is both absurd and blatantly noncompetitive. If a judge agreed, they'd have grounds to revoke those protections. But IP lawsuits are notoriously expensive, and every week the lawsuit continues is one in which Pocketpair is bleeding legal fees—and I personally wouldn't want to try to outlast Nintendo's legal budget. As a result, Sigmon's prediction in September was that neither party would want to prolong the lawsuit. \"You get them in a room, you go, 'Look, neither of us want to do this. What do you want done?' It could be something as simple as a licensing agreement,\" Sigmon said. \"You could say, 'We're going to agree to some changes in the game,' and add some conditions. Usually, both parties before they even go into those meetings have a general idea of the sphere of things they're willing to agree to.\" Lincoln has been writing about games for 11 years—unless you include the essays about procedural storytelling in Dwarf Fortress he convinced his college professors to accept.

    "title": "Europa Universalis 5 feels like the ultimate grand strategy game, drawing on Paradox's entire history—and it makes me feel like an idiot",
    "article_text": "This beast is going to take hundreds of hours to unpack, and I can't wait. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Paradox has finally unveiled the worst-kept secret in strategy gaming: Europa Universalis 5 is coming. This reveal also means I can finally talk about my failed attempt to unite the British Isles under Scotland, my tumultuous conquest of Byzantium as the Ottomans, and how even after many hours of unravelling this behemoth it still makes me feel like a stupid child. While Crusader Kings is the series that really introduced Paradox's complex brand of grand strategy to the wider world, the long-running Europa Universalis series has always been the company's flagship. But the 12-year-old Europa Universalis 4 is already so dense and wide-ranging—especially when you take into account the vast number of DLCs—that it's pretty reasonable to wonder what a sequel could really offer. So let's get this out of the way: it's pretty damn different. So much so, in fact, that I have spent a considerable amount of time being pleasantly baffled by its myriad complex systems, rules and ridiculous flexibility. EU feels new again, and learning the ropes like a novice has been a delight. Let's get the headline changes out of the way, shall we? The most striking thing about EU5 is how uncompromising it feels. With CK3, there was a real sense that Paradox was inviting everyone to the party. Yes, it's still a party with complex rituals and interactions and not everyone is going to have a great time, but it felt welcoming all the same. EU5 is more of a private shindig. Something for the hardcore. The history devotees. The number crunchers. The grand strategy fetishists. I don't want to paint it as impenetrable. Not completely, anyway. EU5 doesn't eagerly invite everyone in, but it does invite everyone tobecomethe sort of person who'd feel right at home here. The build I played doesn't have a tutorial and does little to give players, old or new, a way to ease into things, but the automation is still evidence of modern Paradox's desire to not just throw players to the sharks. I don't want to paint it as impenetrable. Not completely, anyway. Like Distant Worlds, the excellent space 4X, you're blessed with the ability to automate every part of your burgeoning empire. This means you can let the AI handle the stuff you don't care about, but it's even more helpful in letting you learn how to play, system by system. Based on the preferences you establish when you start a game, EU5 will suggest a nation for you, and then automate broad families of systems. You can fiddle with this right from the get go, turning on or off whatever you want, whether that's every system devoted to conquest, or just one specific nugget of the game. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even with this assistance, however, EU5 is… well, it'sa lot. In removing so much of the abstraction and more board-game-esque elements, Paradox has created something that's so much deeper and fascinating than its ancestors, but so much trickier to grasp. As I always do when I embark upon a new Paradox misadventure, I began in Scotland. My goal? Spank the English. It's typically a tall order. Even distracted by the Hundred Years War, the English begin with simply more of everything. More cash, resources, manpower (but yes, more enemies too). Scotland also begins in the midst of a civil war between the Bruce diehards and the English-loving Balliol loyalists. Naturally I picked the good guys. Sorting out the civil war was simple enough, and anyone who's played a Paradox grand strategy game in the last decade and change will broadly understand how you win a war—win fights and sieges, and grab territory, raising your warscore. OK, it's not actually remotely that simple, but I ain't writing a guide here. Even with a united Scotland, though, I wasn't even close to ready to take on the southerners. Unfortunately, I had to take a leaf out of the English playbook and start gobbling up Ireland. But hold on, because one does not simply declare war in EU5. I mean, you can do that if you really want to, but declaring war without a casus belli means that everyone thinks you're kind of a dick, and you do need some international friends if you're gonna get by. In CK3 and EU4, you can simply command a minion to fabricate a claim on some territory, and voila: casus belli. But this is too gamey for EU5. Instead you need to come up with a legitimate reason, and use your spies, which takes time. But even then, it might simply be impossible to come up with a solid reason why you have to invade another country, and to screw over the English is not, it turns out, a valid reason. When all else fails, you'll need to get help from your parliament. While EU4 had parliaments, these institutions are considerably more involved this time around. They represent the estates of your nation, which in turn broadly represent your pops and their competing interests. They have all sorts of agendas, and also powers that you can take advantage of, but only if you can get enough of them to agree. And if you want them to support a new war, you might struggle to pass anything else on the agenda. This allowed me to begin my conquest of Ireland, starting with Ulster, and halting England's plans for the island. But I had plenty of domestic issues to deal with at the same time. There was friction, you see, between the Highlanders and Lowlanders, the traditionalists and urbanites. I kept having to make decisions about embracing the old ways, the clans and an agrarian society, or supporting the expansion of our cities and the newer burgher class. Naturally, this had an impact on how pleased the estates were with my rule, but it also affected everything from the economy, to my international relationships, to the legal system, to the national language. By favouring the clans and changing the court language to Gaelic, I was popular with the clans and aristos, but this weakened my connection to Europe, specifically my old ally France, and made the city-dwellers pissed off. To appease irate estates, you can grant them more privileges, which can also come with benefits for you, but there's risk involved: you don't want to empower an estate that might become disloyal. But their fortunes can change, too. A dominant estate's power can be eroded over time, eventually becoming completely obsolete and ultimately being replaced. With so many competing concerns, both domestic and international, my dream of outperforming the English started to feel a lot more unrealistic. I realised that, despite decades of experience with Paradox's grand strategy games, I needed to start with something a bit more straightforward. My Ottoman campaign had a very different flavour. The Ottomans start in a much stronger position than Scotland. A burgeoning superpower, it's the big boy of Anatolia, has a standing army, and it's just on the cusp of being able to spank waning Byzantium. Like I said, there's no tutorial yet, but this feels like a great place to begin. What makes an Ottoman campaign so rewarding is the extra narrative components. Certain historical flash points, like the aforementioned Hundred Years War, or the Ottoman rise to prominence, are handled by bespoke 'situations', which come with their own special mechanics. So as the Ottomans, you can hit up a special menu and, for example, claim more Anatolian territory, giving you an instant excuse for warring against a neighbour. Then there are the semi-random events that crop up from time to time, giving you discrete objectives or letting you annex entire nations without a fight. Some of these events give you choices, and in cases where this is an event based on real history, you can see what the canon option is before you make your choice. So EU5 gently nudged me in the right direction, putting me in a position to swallow up all the surrounding territory and either keep building up my power or just conquer Byzantium a century early. But in this reactive, dynamic world, making too many big moves can be a big risk. Sure, you might easily be able to sack Constantinople, but being too aggro will inspire coalitions of nations to rise against you, forcing you into a much larger, bloodier conflict. Maybe you're ready for a war of that scale. I was not. I was too busy dealing with all my prospective leaders trying to kill each other following the death of the last one, in turn gutting my pool of potential advisors and cabinet ministers. That was a bit of a problem, given that they are one of the most important expressions of your power, allowing you to integrate provinces, increase your nation's stability and improve your diplomatic standing with your neighbours. I was too busy dealing with all my prospective leaders trying to kill each other following the death of the last one. So even with the odds stacked in my favour, I was still very busy, increasingly sweaty and extremely sweary. It's like trying to play Hearts of Iron, March of the Eagles, Crusader Kings and the older Europa Universalis games all at the same time. I feel like I'll need at least 100 hours just to wrap my tiny brain around just the trade and economic side of things. The dynamism of the markets, the influence of buildings, the myriad factors that impact supply and demand, the effect politics and diplomacy has on commerce—I'm not ashamed to admit that I left this up to the AI a lot of the time. But I still had to get stuck in from time to time, because the AI just picks what it perceives as an optimal strategy, which can't really take into account what the player might be trying to achieve. Let's just say it's going to be a while until I feel up to running Venice or, even more daunting, the Hanseatic League. Because, yes,you don't just play regular countries in EU5. Instead playable entities are broken into four different types. A settled country is your default nation. Your Scotlands and Ottoman Empires. An army-based country is one defined by its military—at least to the degree that as long as it has an army, the nation persists. Even if it doesn't own territory. These are your hordes. Extraterritorial countries include the Hanseatic League, and serve specific functions based on buildings they own. They don't own land per se, but they do rule subjects with land. Banks, trading companies, holy orders—these are all extraterritorial countries. A society of pops, meanwhile, is a less settled, tribal group, which doesn't have all the powers of an official state. Naturally, this opens the door to all sorts of new playstyles and strategies. As a banking country, for instance, you can get fat on international debts, taking over loans and then forcing those nations to pay you the interest instead, filling your coffers so you can embark on big projects. And these specialist countries also get their own bespoke advances, as well, letting you refine and develop them in unique ways. Advances can net you new reforms, laws, estate privileges and mechanics, and are in part defined by the global historical age. Which ones you have access to can also be determined by what nation you're playing as. So in my Ottoman game, a lot of my early advances were connected to Islam, but I could also research more generic ones relating to things like merchant guilds or naval supremacy. The system feels less gamified than a typical strategy tech tree, in large part thanks to concepts like the aforementioned age mechanic, and the institutions that these ages spawn. So the game's second age, the Age of Renaissance, grants new potential advances everyone has access to, while also spawning game-changing institutions like the Renaissance, banking and professional armies. These can spawn dynamically or in their historical locations (something you can determine yourself), and then, like all good ideas, spread through your population, and once enough people have embraced these new concepts, you can start researching the special advances these institutions provide. These fancy new ideas can then spread abroad, through trade routes and across borders, and I am a big fan of how this encourages you to start thinking globally, lest your nation be left behind while everyone's getting to play with new toys. Taking advantage of this spread also requires you to start thinking about the literacy of your population, and your nation's social classes, both of which impact how quickly ideas spread. I've lost entire afternoons to what at first seemed like simple objectives. \"I want to explore this Renaissance thing the Italians are going on about\" could lead you down a rabbit hole as you delve into the trading system, select advances and reforms that promote literacy, encourage urbanisation and elevate the burgher class. Systems on top of systems on top of systems. And when you think you've reached the bottom? Nope. More systems. While this is daunting, it just feels so organic that I didn't feel utterly overwhelmed. Or at least I was too busy to notice it. I found myself just going in for a nibble, dipping my toes in and trying to focus on a single goal, and then a few hours later I'd come up for air and realise I'd gained three new degrees. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, though. As I've already mentioned a few times, EU5 makes me feel very, very stupid. And some of that is down to the UI being a work-in-progress, or the tooltips not always being clear enough, or systems not entirely working as intended. But mostly it's just because EU5 is unrelentingly ambitious, breaking away from its ancient board game origins in a way Paradox has never attempted before.

    "title": "The mod that aimed to recreate Counter-Strike 1.6 in CS:GO is now officially cancelled following 'abrupt actions by Valve that prevent us from releasing' the project",
    "article_text": "A last-ditch effort to resurrect Classic Offensive in March has come to naught. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite a brief blip of hope that a way forward may be found, the ambitious Counter-Strike mod Classic Offensive has been officially cancelled. \"After eight years of development, and despite being officially Greenlit by Valve in 2017, we are devastated to announce the cancellation of Classic Offensive,\" the development team wrote in a message posted toReddit. \"This decision follows abrupt actions by Valve that prevent us from releasing or continuing development on the project.\" Initial work on Classic Offensive, an effort to recreate the classic Counter-Strike 1.6 experience in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, began way back in2015: We first reported on it in2016, and it got the official go-ahead from Valve in 2017 in the oldSteam Greenlightprogram. All seemed well until January 2025, when the team announced that Valve had \"retired\" the mod—removed it from Steam, basically—without warning or explanation. Developers said at the time that the takedown felt worse than a conventional cease-and-desist order because they'd been allowed to work on the mod right up until it was ready for release, with no indication of trouble, and even after the mod was taken down they weren't told why. Following that, the Classic Offensive team decided to release the mod via ModDB instead, which is apparently what prompted Valve to reach out in March 2025. The simple fact that the two sides were talking seemed like a good sign, but it went nowhere: Valve informed the team that \"releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on [Valve's] intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement.\" The mod team is clearly (and understandably) not happy about how this has all worked out, saying Valve's position on Classic Offensive represents a sharp turn away from \"three decades of modding tradition that shaped many of their successful games\"—not to mention the fact that Classic Offensive was at one point officially approved by Valve. \"This situation has implications far beyond our project, raising serious concerns for the future of modding within Valve's ecosystem,\" the team wrote. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Modders should reconsider how they see Valve: A company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.\" That's harsh and perhaps a little overstated, but fair play to the Classic Offensive team, I think a little bitterness is warranted here. Not that anything shady or underhanded has happened, and Valve is well within its rights to protect its property as it sees fit, but eight years is a long haul and to have it shut down mere hours before release has to be a heartbreaker. One rather persistent rumour for what's happened is that Classic Offensive was using Valve's own leaked code, which would at least make Valve's stance a little more understandable. But the team vehemently denies this in the project's FAQ: \"No, Classic Offensive does not use any leaked code and never has,\"reads the FAQ. \"We have built it on top of the latest CS:GO release through file editing and scripting, similarly to Portal 2 mods without a license. This seems to be a recurring rumor spread by either misinformed or purely malicious individuals that are trying to discredit our work.\" The dev team has now launched a website asclassic-offensive.net, which includes the FAQ noted above as well as a timeline of events, contributor credits, and media from the mod. \"We are immensely grateful for the incredible support, enthusiasm, and patience shown by the community throughout Classic Offensive's support,\" the team wrote. \"Thank you for believing in our project.\" Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

One of the first things I heard aboutClair Obscur: Expedition 33was how incredible its soundtrack is, so I was already expecting big things, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. So it comes as absolutely no surprise at all that the album has topped the charts. \"Our soundtrack is connecting far beyond what we ever imagined,\" Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 says onsocial media. \"Over 18 million streams since launch. Wow.\" The album is currently sitting at number one on Billboard’s Classical Album Chart & Classical Crossover Album Chart, number 13 on the Official Soundtrack Album Chart, and number 31 on the Official Album Download Chart.

Wow. pic.twitter.com/kCgV4rWYqAMay 7, 2025 There are 154 songs in Expedition 33, running in at eight hours and nine minutes, and it's absolutely baffling how every single one of them is a banger. The cutscene, map, and fight scene music are all equally great, but my favourite has to be Monoco's theme. The album and the composer Lorien Testard, who hadpreviously never worked on a videogame soundtrack, deserve all the recognition they get. Expedition 33 has been doing well with more than just its album, though. The JRPG managed tosell over 1 million copiesin just three days despite being on Game Pass. French President EmmanuelMacron even gave the game a shout-outon Instagram: \"You are a shining example of French audacity and creativity.\" I'm nearing the end of Expedition 33, and I love it so much that I've decided to momentarily abandon the story and go back to complete all the side content. There are more portals to explore, trinkets to grab and bosses to fight to keep me occupied for some time. Although not all the portals lead to a massive map, some are just one open space with a single item to be found in it. I realise my need to keep the game going is probably due to my inability to let go of things that I love. But if these little explorations eke out another 20 hours or so of quality time with the disaster expedition paired with a beautiful soundtrack, then I'll gladly take what I can get.

    "title": "Hideo Kojima says Death Stranding 2 has so much tactical espionage action that even his own staff 'worried it was getting a little Metal Gear-ish'",
    "article_text": "Th-thank you Boss! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is due for release on PlayStation 5 in June, and let's hopeit doesn't take eight monthsto come across to PC this time. Creator and director Hideo Kojima has just donea big interview with IGNto accompany some preview coverage, within which he just cannot stop with the Metal Gear comparisons. This has been a notable element of Death Stranding 2's marketing, even. The release of a 10 minute long trailer (yes, really) in Marchmade the Metal Gear links overt, with new character Neil giving us a new version of Snake's bandana-tying, and a mech unmistakably reminiscent of Metal Gear Rex. To be clear, Metal Gear remains a Konami property and none of these references or echoes are in any way official: but it does feel very much that Kojima, having firmly established himself and Kojima Productions, is now much more comfortable with his own legacy. To the extent that, when explaining the differences between Death Stranding and its sequel, he immediately reaches for the leap between Metal Gear Solid and its own sequel. \"I'd like to ask you to think back to the beginning of Metal Gear Solid,\"Kojima told IGN. \"No weapons appear at first, and you only acquire them after going up the elevator. Placing weapons at the very start will cause players to pick them up and start killing enemies, so we consciously decided to not do that. But that part turned out to be unpopular, with some people saying they couldn't get up the elevator. \"Still, we had to design Metal Gear Solid so that players learned how stealth works. For Metal Gear Solid 2, we made it a little easier to use weapons and aim at specific parts using a POV angle, as many players were already aware of stealth games. \"It was the same for Death Stranding. There aren't many games about delivery, so we had to get people accustomed to it first. For the sequel, we wanted to allow players that want to fight to do so more freely. Players can use weapons, and it's now easier to drive cars and motorcycles. For the story, the first game was about Sam and Cliff, but this time one of the main themes is Lou and what her existence means.\" Lou is the Breach Baby or \"BB\" that Sam carries around in the first game, though here she's now more toddler age. It is interesting Kojima picks out the vehicles: Death Stranding actually allows you to access a motorbike relatively quickly, though that brings its own traversal challenges. I thought the first game hit a nice balance of vehicles having real utility while also not trivialising how you get across the map, and I'll be curious to see if the sequel still manages to make the walking as impactful as it could feel in the first game. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Another open world element that casts Kojima's thoughts back to bygone times is the day and night cycle, though here the comparison comes from the very end of the Metal Gear series and the stupendously good Phantom Pain. \"We did [a day/night cycle] in Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain as well, but I wanted to properly include the passage of time in an open world,\" says Kojima. \"Gazing at the sky as the sun rises and sets is something that couldn’t been done in the first game, in part due to engine-related reasons, but it's been put into the sequel.\" Kojima goes on to discuss some specifics of lighting changes and his desire to control exactly how specific scenes look rubbing up against the dynamism of this system (\"this is a game, not a movie\"). \"We also included the option to go to bed and wait for the morning before leaving,\" finishes Kojima. \"This is something we've been sure to include because I imagine there will be players that don't want to travel at night. Metal Gear Solid 5 had a system where you could smoke to advance time, but this game does it in more natural ways, like going back to bed in a private room after waking up once.\" I don't think you could get more natural than the Phantom Cigar, which always made me smile thanks to its \"woooah-oooh\" music and fast-forward effects, but good to know anyway that we'll have some control over when we do things in Death Stranding 2. Finally we come to what looks to be the biggest distinction between this and the original game, which is the emphasis on combat. \"It's not that I'm simply pushing combat,\" says Kojima. \"The game is still fundamentally about cargo delivery, but combat has become more flexible. Some of the staff on Death Stranding 2 worked with me on the Metal Gear series, so there were times when people worried that it was getting a little Metal Gear-ish. My personal explanation for it is that we simply pursued more enjoyable combat. This is actually connected to the theme of 'we should not have connected.'\" Erm… so even Kojima's own staff thought it was getting a little bit too much like Metal Gear, but he just thinks that's because it's \"enjoyable.\" Well OK! I mean, MGS5's probably some of the most fun I've ever had in an open world combat game, so bring it on. Kojima also adds that, while stealth is an important element of the game, \"that doesn't mean that you will be forced into stealth: I don't even use stealth myself.\" Finally I found myself rather amused by the fact that Kojima himself didn't fully engage with the Social Strand System of the first game, which refers to the semi-persistent building that players can engage in across the landscape. I love the idea of this and used it a little to create many smaller elements in the world, but when it came to larger projects like the giant highways I left it to others and just contributed the odd bundle of resources. \"When I play the game myself, I use ladders and make bridges, but I don’t build any of the highways; I just use what someone else made,\" says Kojima. \"That's why I was concerned if people would really make roads themselves when the game came out, but it turned out that a lot of people did nothing but that. That was a pleasant surprise for me. I wanted to make sure that the sequel would have more interesting things to do for those players as well. The monorail is one such element.\" Death Stranding 2 really does sound like it could be something special. My love for Kojima's games is no secret, and seeing him once again return to the rich vein of ideas that ran through Metal Gear feels like a long-overdue homecoming. It felt like the acrimonious nature of his split from Konami and the director going solo left him a little fearful of being too explicit about his legacy the first time around, but make no mistake: Hideo Kojima was and will always be Mr. Metal Gear. We'll have to wait and see how that manifests in the full experience when Death Stranding 2: On the Beach makes its way to PC. But I'm happy to say one thing right now.

    "article_text": "Downright Gith in determination. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lae'zel is a lot of things—a proud warrior of Vlaakith, a fierce combatant, and a genuinely impressive character, able to grapple with her faith and still come out determined to do things the right way. Turns out, her voice actor shares that determination. In a recent interview withReadyAimFire, Devora Wilde tells two understandably-astonished interviewers that she was recording voicelines for the character \"two days\" before giving birth. \"At the beginning it was fine but towards the end I was getting like, a bit 'oof',\" Wilde says, in what must be the understatement of the century. \"95% of the time you'd be in the suit, and so by the end I'd have to have a little chair [so I could] between the lines go and have a little sit down. \"It was getting towards the end, and they were like, 'Are you sure you wanna come in?' And I said, 'Guys I'm gonna be here right up until the due date, just you watch'.\" Wilde goes on to say that this wasn't some nefarious pressure on Larian's behalf, she was just determined to get the job done. \"Nobody was pressuring me to, they were like, 'You can leave whenever you want', but I was like, 'Guys I feel fine, why would I [go]? Let's hit the ground running now!'\" At the time, another (less important) due date was coming—the release of Baldur's Gate 3: \"This was coming up to May 2023, the game was due out in August. So I knew like, 'The game has to come out, come on guys, we need to get on it!' \"It was coming up to that week where I was about to give birth, and I was still coming into the studio, and I was like 'see you tomorrow!' and they were like 'maybe!' and I was like 'haha!' And then my waters broke after the session,\" you'd think that'd gently encourage Wilde out of the recording booth and into the hospital, but she adds: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I said to my husband, well, I feel alright, maybe I can go in tomorrow! And he went, 'You're absolutely not going in … I think now's probably not the time.' … I was still very much in denial of the fact that I had to like, push a human being out\". Hypothetically-speaking, Lae'zel as a character wouldn't get pregnant: Gith lay eggs, and hand-pick who goes to a creche in the Prime Material Plane (time moves differently in the Astral Plane, where the Gith typically live) to do so. However, the determination of being about to create new life and going 'yeah, I could probably record more voicelines'?

    "article_text": "Does that mean 'stylish' or 'boring' to you? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alienwarehas just announced a couple of new gaming laptops that go by 'Aurora' and have a rather simple and clean design. We're talking rounded corners, a single, simple logo, a \"chamfered\" (sloping) front edge for one-handed opening, and no thermal shelf at the rear. I quite like it, but I know some find such a minimalistic style boring. Admittedly, these laptops aren't minimalistic by non-gaming standards, but byAlienware'sstandards? These are as modest as can be. Their design is a pretty big departure from its usual MO. The laptops are following the company's 'AW30' design language revealed earlier this year, which is \"inspired by extraterrestrial phenomena\" (for Alienware? You don't say). According toAlienware, this is a \"brand-new design language … crafted to evoke a sense of mystery and transcendence that is undeniably Alienware.\" Things get a little confusing, though, when Alienware says that itsArea-51 laptopsincorporate the AW30 design language, and yet the company wants to distinguish these from the new Aurora line: \"Moving forward, you’ll see two distinct tiers across Alienware desktops and laptops: Area-51 [is] our flagship tier designed for those who demand maximum performance and premium features in a durable, robust design. Aurora [is] our versatility tier offering strong performance within a sleek, streamlined form factor.\" Whatever the wider strategy, with these Aurora laptops—Alienware 16 Aurora and Alienware 16X Aurora—we know what we're getting on the design front. On the specs front, the 16X looks to be the more powerful version with up to 64 GB (rather than 32 GB) of DDR5 RAM , newer Core Ultra chips, RGB (rather than single-colour) lighting, and a 240 Hz (rather than a 120 Hz) refresh rate. The non-X will, however, offer more options than the RTX 5060/70 the 16X will, too, on the lower end at least, down to an RTX 3050.

If thermals are a concern, especially given the lack of a thermal shelf sticking out behind the screen hinge, Alienware assures us that this \"thermal package\" is now underneath the device. It \"strategically takes advantage of unused space where a tall rear foot would normally be located. Coined Cryo-Chamber, this solution helps maximize airflow intake and expel heat efficiently through strategically placed vents.\" I know not everyone is into such simple designs, but I'm a bit of a sucker for it. The \"Interstellar indigo\" colour scheme, top-of-keyboard mesh speaker, and rounded edges hit all the right spots for me. Though much will depend on what pricing looks like, because right now we just know that \"select configurations of Alienware Aurora Laptops will launch in EMEA on May 27, 2025 starting at £899\" and \"additional models will arrive soon after.\" A starting price doesn't tell us much, considering configurations will go down ones with to an RTX 3050.

    "title": "Mojang has just killed support for Minecraft VR, an underrated but very flawed VR experience",
    "article_text": "It's up to the fans from here. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The power of nostalgia is an incredible thing. It can make you really crave spaghetti hoops after a hard day's work, it can make you feel like a kid when you get a whiff of a scent that you can't quite place, and it can make you restart Minecraft for the tenth time, only to stop playing it after a week. VR was the first time I felt surprised opening up a new blocky world in years, and it happened about thirty minutes after myOculus Quest(yes, the first one) arrived. Now, almost a decade after its first implementation, Mojang has removed VR support. Okay, we actually knew about this for some time.Last October, Mojang announced it would end support for Minecraft VR in March 2025, and it even gave a small grace period, which is why it has now stopped in May (as spotted byPC World). Softening that blow in a very strange way, Mojang's implementation of Minecraft in VR was both temperamental and a little underwhelming. In my time with the game, I always felt like I was playing Minecraft, with a little asterisk up the top right. Firstly, performance was inconsistent, and I often had to tinker with things or turn my setup off and on again to get it working. Hitting trees, mud, and zombies also didn't feel quite as satisfying as I would like, often missing clear shots or generally losing out on speed (I swear, it's the game's fault I keep missing the zombie). To feel more like actual Minecraft, I had to swap to clicking a button to hit trees, but it just doesn't quite capture the magic of actually playing VR. With these rather large caveats out of the way, Minecraft VR is one of the most fun experiences I've had in my years playing VR. Games likeNo Man's SkyandPhasmophobiaprove that transforming flat games into the world of VR can give the game a nice shot of adrenaline, and I think this is largely because these games become very comfortable in their original form. When my Keyboard or PlayStation controller is removed from my hand, and I'm given the Meta controller in their place, I'm suddenly afraid of zombies, creepers, and skeletons once more. Meta Minecraft added a depth to the world that made me feel like I was playing it for the first time again. This sounds like a bit of a cliche, but it's true. Seeing Minecraft in VR just feltdifferent. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In fact, in a funny coincidence, I tried to boot up virtual Minecraft just last month. It didn't work, and I can only assume that was partly my fault, but it shows the game was on my mind. There are workarounds, should you still want to play it, in the form of mods likeVivecraft. Vivecraft is an embodiment of one of the best things about PC gaming. It's a free fan fan-supported mod that allows people to play Minecraft in VR from their PC. It, alongside a handful of similar fan projects, offers a better experience than the official port. However, Vivecraft doesn't account for compatibility. Playing Minecraft in VR through the official route meant you could join other worlds your friends were playing on, and they didn't need a VR helmet to play alongside you. Now, to play with others, you will, at minimum, need to get a few mods working and convince all your friends to do the same. It also doesn't fix that PSVR Minecraft VR players don't have any sort of workaround. Unfortunately, we don't know what the player figures were like for Mojang's VR port prior to the end of its support, but Mojang's rationale is likely tied to Minecraft's single biggest selling point right now—its ever-evolving nature. Minecraft is a very different game from the one I'm nostalgic for, and that's due to the implementation of new mobs, areas, ores, and more. Each update also requires an update to every other version of Minecraft, and that extra work is compounded by the fact that Mojang has to update both Bedrock and Java versions of the game. The Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox One, and PS4 versions of the game have all been discontinued, not receiving updates in years. As the game gets larger and larger, developers have to think more broadly about what they choose to implement and which platforms deserve to see that update. Minecraft VR losing support is only another rung in the planned obsolescence of older or less popular versions of Minecraft, and official VR support felt particularly half-hearted even when it was in its prime. It's a shame to see official Minecraft VR support go, even if it doesn't feel like a huge surprise. Given the strength of virtual reality Minecraft ports in fan circles, hopefully, the community can continue picking up the slack.

    "title": "This transparent HDD from Buffalo is both beautiful and woefully impractical—just how I like my tech",
    "article_text": "She is beauty, she is grace, she's got my finger smears all over her transparent face. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When folks talk about transparent hardware, I'm sure I'm not the only one whose frame of reference is still stuck somewhere between the mid-90s and the early oughts. Besides sleuthing with Barbie on the family desktop, my earliest gaming memories involved affixing my tiny mitts to my semi-transparent Game Boy Color. For a hot second back then, that purple-y plastic was very in vogue and though I still have a soft spot for those hard shells, I'm a little thankful transparent tech is ever so slightly more elegant these days. Case in point, Buffalo Japan's commemorative'skeleton'hard drive disc (viaTechspot). To celebrate the company's 50th anniversary, Buffalo has released a modern take on its original see-through HDD, which made its debut all the way back in 1998. The 2025 rendition is called the Buffalo HD-SKL, and comes with an interesting mount that offers a front row seat as the actuator arm dances across the platter. Though primarily a decorative, desk-side conversation starter, this transparent HDD is still very much functional thanks to a standard USB 3.2 (Gen 1) interface. The catch? Well, there are a few. For one, as you may have already guessed, the Buffalo HD-SKL is Japan-exclusive. For another, it costs 100,000 yen (which is about $696) and only offers 4 TB of space—that's hardly the best deal for the space. Furthermore, Mac fiends are potentially out of luck as Buffalo's own dedicated software, SeekWizard, is Windows-only. This application allows you to run the Buffalo HD-SKL in a number of 'demo' modes, meaning you don't actually have to write anything to the drive to see the read/write heads fly. The demo modes available include 'second hand step,' 'random seek,' and 'sequential seek. ' Though not exactly useful with regards to any of my own storage needs, I still kinda want one. However, limited to just 50 units, it doesn't look like my still tiny mitts will get to leave finger smears anywhere near the see-through surface of this exceptionally pretty hard drive. A Japan-exclusive lottery will ultimately determine who has a chance to splash their cash on this commemorative centrepiece, with shipments expected to go out in June.

    "article_text": "Finally, I can stop the bickering. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The last time I playedFrostpunk 2, I was about a hair's breadth away from a political breakdown. I had somehow managed to anger every faction. I fell behind on promises I made to pass laws, and every time I get something done I end up pissing off more people than I impress. In the end, a vote of no confidence that would've certainly seen me stranded in the tundra was the last straw—I haven't been back in over five months. But even with all the stress, I'm still morbidly intrigued to see first-hand what Frostpunk 2's first major content update has in store for us today. \"This substantial update introduces transformative new systems, a sprawling new map, and several long-requested community features to the city builder,\" a press release says. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together The new map is for the Utopia Builder mode, and it's set around the remnants of a failed Generator project. This may mean there's some leftover resources for you to mine, but it will be a challenge to build near thanks to the rugged terrain. There are also new optional narrative challenges like quests, storylines, and rewards for you to explore, as well as modding tools, which are finally exiting beta, providing a little bit of replayability as players can shape the frostland to their liking. Alongside this, there's an overhauled heat system, meaning you can manage temperature at a district level, but with this comes new research laws and consequences, as citizens will be more responsive to how warm or cold they are. But the best feature arriving in this update, as far as I'm concerned, is the Serenity Mode. I know, I'm a coward. But I'm a coward who just wants to experience building in the frostlands without having to deal with all the relentless bickering, politics, and everyone getting angry at me when I accidentally kill a bunch of orphans—I didn't know the mine was going to collapse and I was told the kids were fine with it. The Serenity mode will provide a \"gentler survival experience with mild weather, plentiful resources, and no faction conflict,\" which is perfect for beginners or players like me who just want to build cool cities in the snow without all the yelling. This content update, which is releasing today, is just the beginning for the support lined up for Frostpunk 2. \"This update marks a significant step forward in the evolution of Frostpunk 2, reinforcing 11 bit studios’ long-term commitment to significant post-launch support and player-driven creativity,\" the press release says. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. More updates are scheduled for 2025, including DLC announcements and the console release.

    "title": "Mafia: The Old Country gets an August release date, and don't worry, I won't be cracking a joke about making an offer you can't refuse",
    "article_text": "Spend summer in Sicily. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I confess that I'd forgotten all about Mafia: The Old Country, the fourth game in the long-running series and the second developed by Hangar 13 (not including its remake of the OG Mafia). Indeed, the last time I'd thought about Hangar 13 was a few years ago, after itlaid off a substantial amount of staffnot long after it promised it wouldn't be doing that exact thing. Who can keep track of all these games?Oh right.Anyway! Mafia: The Old Country is indeed a thing that is happening, and it is actually happening quite soon. We're off to Sicily on August 8, it turns out. And in the meantime, you can direct your eyes towards a new trailer and a dev diary. Hangar 13's first Mafia, Mafia 3, was not very good, but it was surprising. Rather than another traditional, overdone mafia romp, it followed the misadventures of Black Vietnam vet Lincoln Clay in a facsimile of New Orleans. Sadly it quickly devolved into rote open-world busywork and a tired quest for revenge, but there was a welcome attempt to tell a slightly different kind of mafia story. Mafia: The Old Country, though, is kicking things back to Sicily in the early 1900s, which has piqued my interest for different reasons. Shittier guns. Slower cars. Horses! I'm here for it. That said, Hangar 13 head honcho Nick Baynes' description is sending me right to sleep. “Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay. That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.” Granted, \"focused, linear experience\" does suggest it will sidestep some of the last game's exhausting open-world bits, but this premise does sound a wee bit tired. The same goes for the description of Enzo elsewhere in the press release. This guy, apparently, is loyal, honourable and obedient. Sounds like a hoot! It is interesting, though, how much Hangar 13 and 2K are pushing the whole 'this isn't a big game' aspect. \"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments,\" says 2K prez David Ismailer. The cynic in me reads this as \"We're worried about having another huge, expensive flop on our hands,\" but god knows I need more short games in my life, so this is pretty appealing.

    "title": "Here's how long it would take 12 RTX 5090 GPUs to crack your password… and a reminder that just adding more characters still works",
    "article_text": "Try to go for 18 characters or more. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybersecurity company, Hive Systems, has just put out its2025 Password Tableas a continuation of its yearly analysis of how difficult passwords are to crack. The results are in, and while it's not exactly pretty, the good news is that unless you're against computing might of a multibillion global AI company, you're probably safe just adding some extra characters to your password. That's if you weren't already practicing good password security to begin with, which involves essentially just that: having a very long password (a different one for each account/service). Preferably with a combination of numbers, lowercase letters, capital letters, and symbols. Hive Systems explains: \"Nvidia finally released a new consumer graphics card, theRTX 5090. To simulate a fairly successful hacker we once again assumed not one but twelve RTX 5090s.\" Twelve GPUs seems to be the key number because it is \"the best consumer accessible hardware configuration that won’t block you from running tools used for brute forcing passwords.\" That's what the company said about its previous 12 x RTX 4090 analysis, anyway, and presumably the same is true about next-gen high-end consumer GPUs, too. Bcrypt is the algorithm that most sites and services use these days to 'hash' your plaintext password and is what the company is analysing the GPU cracking against. Hashing is the process of turning your plaintext password into something else so that, for instance, if someone hacks the server your hash is stored on, they won't be able to see your password but only its hash. This can't be reverse engineered, either. As Hive Systems explains: \"Hashing software is a one-way street by design.\" So, the 2025 table shows how long it can take 12Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090graphics cards to brute force their way through to guess the correct hash to log in to your account—in other words, to crack your password. The long and short of it is that, as expected, if you use a password that's eight characters long and only uses lowercase letters and numbers, you're screwed. It'll only take the RTX 5090 GPUs three weeks to crack. Adding in some uppercase letters (but keeping it at eight characters) puts that time frame up to 15 years. Adding numbers puts it up to 62, and adding symbols puts it up to 164 years. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Diversifying your password's character set is clearly one way to go, then. But so is adding additional characters. If you have 18 characters, even if those are just numbers, it would take these 12 top-end graphics cards 284,000 years to crack. The difference can be exponential, too. For instance, a password made of 13 numbers would take the graphics cards 3 years to crack, but add in just one more number and that rises to 28 years, then add another and it rises to 284. What is artificial general intelligence?:We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology)still recommendsa minimum character count of 15 for passwords. This makes sense, because it's the number that increases cracking time to well in excess of a lifetime when using a standard brute force hacker's best likely setup. If you're looking to defend against actors with a lot more compute power than this (who is after you?), Hive Systems analysed how long it would take the hardware that was used to train ChatGPT-4 (20,000Nvidia A100 server GPUs). Even using this hardware, it would take 388 years to crack a numbers-only password of 18 characters—but it would take 39 years for 17 characters and 4 years for 16 characters, again proving the rule that adding more characters is almost always a good idea if you're in this kind of range. So, if you're using a weak password, then yes, we are now in a computing era where plenty of bad actors will be able to successfully brute force your password with some pretty standard (albeit expensive) compute power. But if you use long passwords with lower case, upper case, numbers, and symbols, you still have little to worry about… well, not on the brute force front, anyway. Maybe now's the time to download that password manager you've been meaning to get around to trying out. Jacob got his hands on a gaming PC for the first time when he was about 12 years old.

    "article_text": "\"I make one stupid pant sh*t joke and it all goes ballistic.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Helldivers 2 players were very excited today over a Warbond that, per Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, would allegedly make players \"shit their pants\". That's via an offhanded joke by way of Discord message that has spawned an entire swarm of memes. I'm about to link one of them, and then I'll let you browse the rest yourself, because I quite frankly don't want this article (which is about a Warbond) to get purely scatological. Well, now it's out, are my trousers browned? Not exactly, but it does look stylin' for one simple reason: The Masters of Ceremony war bond finally adds a sword. Not a chainsword, not a stun baton, just a straight-up curved saber. Whilenot the first melee weaponto make it into the game, it is the second of its kind. It's also extremely ill-advised on the hellish battlefields of a galaxy swarming with tanks, giant bugs, and whatever the Illuminate has going on. Here's the full rundown of what the Warbond, which arrives May 15, contains: The CQC-2 Saber looks sick as hell while also seeming appropriately useless. I mean, don't get me wrong, I respect any diver who draws this thing and goes toe-to-toe with a Charger, but the laws of physics are immutable and that dude absolutely is getting thrown 20 feet and splattered against a rock. You cannot 'nah, I'd win' your way out of an arms disadvantage and 5 tons of insect muscle. At least not with my attitude, I guess. The update'll also come along with patterns for theFRV recon vehicle, applied to past Warbonds where it makes sense—which is a nice bonus. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for how the community's responding? It's early on, but I'm seeing a little murmuring of disappointment, given Shams Jorjani told us to \"shit our pants\" and everything. Players did get a little over-excited, mind. One even wrote, in the game's Discord: \"ALLOW ME TO DEFECATE IN MY TROUSERS AND MY LIFE IS YOURS\". To which Jorjani replied, \"Chill\". At the same time, it's was clearly a joke, or as Jorjani puts: \"I make one stupid pant shit joke and it all goes ballistic.\" The only real issue I have there is Jorjani not saying 'it all goes to shit', because come on, it was right there. Conversely, it has been a little while. Helldivers 2's last Warbond released March 20, which means that battle-hungry players have been waiting on the edge of their porcelain seats for (by the time the Warbond's here) 56 days. Still, given this time last year the Arrowhead's teamwas feeling the pressure. I'm sort of glad they're pacing themselves. Besides—there'sapparently a \"Singularity Party\"coming May 13, so that might be when I need to get a new pair of boxers.

Cooking is involved in a lot of the quests inDisney Dreamlight Valley, but the request to rustle up a fairly fancy appetizer is a bit vague. More often than not, you're given the exact recipe you need to bake or cook for a task, but sometimes you're thrown a real curveball and have to figure it out for yourself, which makes things much harder given how many recipes there are in Dreamlight Valley. Making a fairly fancy appetizer is a confusing instruction to be given, but when you break it down, the request is a lot more open than it initially seems. In fact, you have plenty of dishes to choose from once you know what exactly makes them fairly fancy. So, if you've been tasked with bringing your villagers something to their tastes, here are the steps you need to get this mission done and dusted. A fairly fancy appetizer means any appetizer with a four star rating.This can be any meal made with ingredients from the valley, or either DLC. There are plenty of appetizers to choose from too, so it's likely you already have the ingredients you need lying around. Any of the following meals count toward completing the fairly fancy appetizer task: This duty occasionally springs up on the Star Path, so can be a quick and easy one to complete for some limited tokens.

    "article_text": "No bundle, no discount. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Diablo 4'srecent collab brings Kentaro Miura's Berserk to the bloodied chaos of Estuar. While I'd love to say that anything Berserk is worth it, I think this crossover pushes the boundaries just a little too much, because altogether, it's way too expensive. Redditor HilltopHoodbroke down all the pricesfor the Berserk sets: \"Obtaining all Berserk sets will run you 16,500 platinum.\" But for whatever reason, there are no bundles, discounts or pricing incentives for buying all of them together at once. Diablo 4 boss loot tables: Who drops what?Diablo 4 resplendent sparks: Save for MythicsDiablo 4 unique items: Endgame gearDiablo 4 Altar of Lilith locations: Every altarBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now The premium cosmetics are forspecific classes only, with the Barbarian getting The Berserker Armour (the best cosmetic, obviously), Rogues getting The Hawk of Light and The Struggler, and Necromancers getting The Skull Knight costume. There's also a pet bundle, a mount and mount armour. Individually, each costs 2,500 platinum (2,800 platinum equals $24.99/ £18.76). But if you wanted to buy all of the Berserk sets and didn't already have 16,500 platinum just lying around, you'd need to overbuy and get the 18,500 platinum bundle. While it would leave you with 2,000 platinum left over, it would still cost you around $150/£112.50, which is also twice the price of theVessel of Hatred Expansion, which is priced at $70/£60. With all of that in mind, it's completely unsurprising that players aren't happy. \"The PET costs 2,800 platinum, literally just the pet,\" one player says. \"The absolute f*cking audacity lmao.\" It seems like the general consensus is that no one's falling for this cash grab. Most people are either going to completely skip out on the collab or just get one thing, but the overpricing is a shame for diehard Berserk fans who just love supporting Miura's work. Otherspoint outthat the collaboration was also just a bit boring: \"Diablo x Berserk was underwhelming.\" You can do so much with Berserk, more than just making a couple of cosmetics. I feel like Blizzard missed out on making content inspired by arcs or fights. Even a dungeon with the monsters from the Lost Children Arc would've been a cool nod to the manga. Unfortunately, a whole dungeon inspired by Berserk is probably too much to ask for. While I will say the Berserker Armour is really cool, I just wish there was a little bit more content—at the very least, it could be priced more affordably than what's currently on offer.

The business relationship between audio brand Sennheiser and audio care conglomerate Sonova is a little confusing, but basically what you need to know is that Sonova finalised their purchase of Sennheiser's consumer division for €200 million back in March 2022. Sennheiser still makes their own studio kit for professionals, but amateur audiophiles are served by Sonova draped in Sennheiser's brand banner. To put it another way, when you pick up some Sennheiser branded headphones—like theHD 550 that Jacob just reviewed—they're actually made by Sonova. What's far easier to understand is that Sennheiser and Sonova are being fined to a total of nearly €6 million for price fixing.The Bundeskartellamt—that's the federal cartel office in Germany—found that Sennheiser had been engaging in price fixing since at least 2015. What's more, Sonova continued the practice after its purchase of the brand, right up until the antitrust investigation began in September 2022. According to the Bundeskartellamt's findings, this price fixing was a concerted, vertical effort between Sennheiser itself and merchants selling products to end-users, though interestingly the council isn't fining any of the involved retailers. Sennheiser closely monitored consumer prices using both price comparison websites as well as more specialised software. If the company found consumer pricing was significantly below their MSRP, it would reach out to affected retailers directly. Following this intervention from Sennheiser, retailers would then frequently raise their price and the end consumer would ultimately pay for it. The Bundeskartellamt describes a \"code language\" being used for internal conversations about price maintenance measures at Sennheiser, though that's far from the wildest detail. According to Bundeskartellamt president Andreas Mundt, \"Sennheiser employees even underwent antitrust training but used that knowledge to cover up their price-fixing practices.\" He adds, \"This illustrates that companies must not only adopt compliance measures but also put them into practice.” The result is a fine in the millions that apparently takes into account the fact Sennheiser and Sonova co-operated fully with the Bundeskartellamt's investigation. Besides the audio giants at the centre of this case, three Sennheiser employees specifically are also being fined and, boy, would I hate to be any one of those guys. Mundt also said, \"When it comes to illegal cartels, what first comes to mind are agreements at the same market level, for example between manufacturers or between retailers. However, price competition is also significantly hindered to the detriment of consumers if manufacturers and their retailers conclude agreements on fixed retail prices. Over a long period of time, Sennheiser hampered the free pricing of premium headphones.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Perhaps €6 million is just a drop in the ocean for Sonova, but perhaps it's not naive to hope this federal fine sends a message. If nothing else, maybe my next headphone purchase will be slightly less dear—or maybe I shouldn't dare hope for premium audio at a slightly less than premium price.

    "title": "Peak Sekiro-like Nine Sols gets a 40% price cut ahead of its 1-year anniversary, and if you've ever liked parrying in a videogame, you need to play this thing",
    "article_text": "One of my sleeper hits from last year is absurdly good for value right now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nine Sols is a game I very nearly missed last year—it arrived in May 2024, but I didn't play it until December of the same year. I spent the next 28 hours methodically kicking myself, because it's one of my favourite Sekiro-likes of all time, and I'd recommend it to just about anybody.Especially now it's 40% off. For the uninitiated, Nine Sols is an indie game made by Red Candle Games (a studio who'd previously only made horror titles) that blends Hollow Knight's metroidvania stylings with Sekiro's parry-timing combat. That's a serious undersell, though, because this game is downright exceptional. It has a fantastic soundtrack, an entrancing visual artstyle, and a focused, tightly-written story that had me caring deeply for its cast of characters. Yi is a fun twist on your typical soulslike stand-in, in that he actually has a fully-fledged personality, character development, and sometimes makes decisions that left me (deliciously) uncomfortable. Don't let his cuddly appearance fool you, either. Nine Sols is both viciously dark, genuinely gory, and deeply existential. And that's not even getting to the boss fights, which are some of my favourite in the genre. They're all snappily-designed, and its penultimate battle is the only time I've ever felt tempted to attempt a no-hit run on a boss in a game like this, well, basically ever. It also introduces some fun twists on the formula, such as the Unbounded Counter: Which sees you holding down a limited-time block andreleasingit at the right moment in order to parry someone extra hard. Your toolkit is narrow, but every weapon in your arsenal feels great to use. All this to say: Being able to get it for $18 (£18—which isn't how price conversions work, RedCandle, but I'll forgive you since I like your game so much) is an absolute steal for around 20-30 hours of absolute peak. The deal brought it to the Steam bestsellers list at the time of writing, and it's absolutely deserved. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The studio's doing this to celebrate its one-year anniversary and the culmination of itsprelude manga, but I recommend you play the game and let its mystery unravel first before you check it out.

    "article_text": "Turn your crafted items back into resources. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheUncrafting Stationis a machine worth unlocking as soon as theCheshire Catmoves into your town inDisney Dreamlight Valley. It'll give you the ability to turn anything you've already crafted back into its resources, which is incredibly valuable if you're constantly making things in surplus or need specific materials you're struggling to find. With that said, it's a bit of a slog to unlock the quest that grants you access to it. When you reach level seven friendship with the Cheshire Cat, you'll be able to start the Uncrafting Station quest. As is expected with Cheshire, it's not exactly a straightforward way to get hold of the crafting recipe. Here are all the hoops you need to jump through before he helps you create a machine of your own. The Cheshire Cat will ask you to craft himthree Wildly Jubilant Topiariesfor him, so you'll need to gather the following materials: Take these to the Cheshire Cat once you've crafted them and he'll ask you to place them, and break them with your pickaxe. You don't need any special potion to do so, unlike a lot of quests in the past when you've been asked to break unusual items. You'll get some of the resources you used to craft them back when you break them. Speak to Cheshire again, and he'll ask you to do the same withthree balloon arches. You'll then have a conversation with him about how you can't usually do this, and how having some sort of machine to turn things back into their resources would be more efficient. With that idea in mind, the Cheshire Cat will send you back to the Alice in Wonderland realm to collect blue spores. You need to collect 20 blue spores from all around the forest in this realm. They can be found all over, so it won't take you long to gather them all. Most spores are found underneath the large blue mushrooms around the entrance to the forest. Go back to the Cheshire Cat when you've gathered enough. He'll give you yet another list of materials to collect, which he states are for the Uncrafting Station but it seems like a strange bunch of items needed to craft a machine. Gather the following materials: Go to a crafting table with these materials, and you'll be able to craft the Uncrafting Station. Place it in the Valley, and use it to uncraft a piece of furniture. Similar to the slow cooker, you'll need to wait for this process to be done. Collect your resources, and return to the Cheshire Cat to finish the quest. You'll then be able to use the Uncrafting Station whenever you need. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kara is an evergreen writer.

    "title": "With the GPU market a hellscape right now, here are the PC gaming upgrades you actually CAN do",
    "article_text": "Instead of overpaying for graphics cards, why not get something that's actually worth your money? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're currently in the market for one of thebest graphics cards, I offer my sincerest sympathies. It's rough out there right now, and although the market is showing some signs of recovery, the MSRP is kind of like Bigfoot—we've all heard of it, and yet, no one's actually seen it in action. Fortunately, there are other PC upgrades that you could spend your money on and enjoy before the GPU market ever considers becoming more reasonable. Sure, youcanbuy a graphics card; hell, get yourself theRTX 5090if you want to. The question is: Do you feel like gifting retailers a few hundred or thousand dollars extra just because? Unfortunately, that's the situation right now, with nearly every GPU selling well above MSRP. Evencheap GPU dealsaren't all that cheap these days, but they're simply the best we can get. Good news: If you give up on the idea of buying a GPU for now, it's actually not a terrible time to shop for other hardware. Broadening your horizons can help improve your entire PC gaming experience through meaningful upgrades. I'll walk you through some options that are both affordable and impactful. Yes, it's possible, and yes, it's worth it. Well, it's certainly more worth it than spending over $3,000 on anRTX 5090, anyway. If you have the budget for a new graphics card, chances are you also have the budget for a new processor. That's because CPUs, while also hit by these same disastrous market conditions that we're dealing with in just about every area of life, are still better off than GPUs. You can get a very solid CPU under $400; only a select few are currently super overpriced. And not even the best of thebest gaming CPUswill cost you $1,000 and up, thankfully. Let's hope that whoever's in charge of setting the prices isn't reading this article, or I might have just cursed the next generation of CPUs. A CPU won't deliver the same kind of upgrade in frame rates that a GPU will, at least not outside of some edge cases and CPU-bound games, but it'll give your whole PC a boost instead. You'll get some extra fps, your PC will get some future-proofing, and you'll be able to indulge yourself by opening a bazillion Chrome tabs all at once while gaming. Win-win-win! I'm going to leave some top-notchCPU buying advicefor you here to help you figure out the motherboard/socket/core count madness. Instead of delving into that, I'll show you some neat deals that you can pick up to upgrade your PC. AMD users have quite the conundrum when it comes to upgrades. The obvious choice for a gaming PC is theRyzen 7 9800X3D, which has more cache than I have sense—but I'm going to tell you to steer clear of that one; the darn thing is just too expensive right now. If you're on socket AM5, I'd say you might as well stick to whatever CPU you're using and wait for better days with theRyzen79800X3D. The only two decent options (pricing-wise) from the latest generation are the Ryzen 9 9900X, currently discounted down to$369(£387), or the Ryzen 7 9700X, down to$302(£279). Dipping into the past generation is a safer bet; grab the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for$391(£363) and you're all set. Because AMD is the opposite of a commitment-phobe and seems to stick to its CPU sockets for years on end, even those with an AM4 motherboard have options. The 5700X3D is a cheap ($269|£199) but fantastic gaming CPU that'll keep you from doing a full platform replacement for a good while. If you're running on Intel and are in the market for an Arrow Lake CPU (fat chance, I know), you'll be pleased to know that Intel's justslashed the price of a couple of chips by $100. Alright savings and a decent CPU, so if you want one, go for it. Otherwise, some of my recent Intel favorites include the Core i5-13400F ($134or£189) and the Core i7-14700K ($320or£283for the KF model). I'd advise against buying anything pricier, as you won't see much of an improvement in gaming scenarios anyway. RAM and SSD are among the easiest PC upgrades you can get. Replacing either will take you 15 minutes tops, and both have a sweet impact on the performance of your entire computer. I'm one of those people who never have fewer than 30 Chrome tabs open at any given time, and if I'm playing an MMO, chances are I'm also watching Netflix and sitting on Discord at the same time. My PC needs a boatload of RAM to support such degenerate habits, and for the sake of my sanity, I also need a fast and spacious SSD. Luckily, both of those things are rather affordable right now. DDR4 DDR5 If you're using DDR4 RAM, 32 GB of Corsair's Vengeance 3200 MHz memory is currently just$47(£47). It's not the fastest DDR4 RAM can be, but an extra 400 MHz isn't worth the extra bucks most of the time. Corsair also has faster, 3600 MHz kits, and 64 GB of that will set you back$120(£104). Crucial's slower (3200 MHz) 64 GB kit is way cheaper, currently at$89(£90). DDR5 users have some nice deals to explore, too. There's the Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6400, and 32 GB will cost you$95(£99). This is a limited-time deal, so snap it up while it's there. TeamGroup has a cheaper, but slower 6000 MHz option at$77(£88). If you're looking for 64 GB, Crucial has a 4800 MHz kit for$144(£148), but I'd spend more to get this set of TeamGroup 6000 MHz RAM sticks, currently$169(£204). PCIe 4 PCIe 5 As far as storage goes, I'm only going to suggest SSDs. If you're somehow still running on an HDD, the upgrade will blow your mind; if you already have an SSD, it won't make too much of a difference in some tasks, but it'll be noticeable in others. Doubling SSD data transfer rates might not do much for your Windows loading times because you'll shave off a few seconds at most. Loading screens in games will go from fast to blazing-fast, though, and that's all we really care about, right? Outside of our curated list of thebest SSD deals, a few PCIe 4.0 models I can recommend picking up are the Kingston NV3 1 TB for a budget option ($61/£55), the Crucial P310 2 TB for fast speeds and plenty of storage ($129/£102), and the Silicon Power UD90 2 TB for something in between ($110/£90). Upgrading to PCIe 5.0 gives you a much faster SSD, although it should come as no surprise that it'll also be pricier. The Corsair MP700 Pro 1 TB is$139(£134), but it also delivers up to 11,700 MB/sec sequential read speeds. For more storage, there's the Corsair MP700 Elite 2 TB ($179, currently 29% off, or£199), or the powerful but eye-wateringly expensiveSamsung 9100 Pro 2 TB($269/£214). For your regular ol' gaming purposes, just load up on reasonably fast storage and don't bother pushing for top-shelf performance. It's just not worth the money. Instead of eyeing your PC and planning to gut the poor thing for some hardware upgrades, why not pivot towards peripherals? While that might not directly improve your gaming performance, it'll boost your whole gamingexperience. Fancy stuff. Truthfully, I spent a long time ignoring my peripherals. I'd spend every last bit of my PC building budget (and then some) on the actual rig, only to get myself a $15 keyboard to match. For shame, Monica, for shame. These days, having invested in a proper headset, keyboard, mouse, and all that jazz, I can honestly say that peripherals shouldnotbe overlooked. Whether you're on Year 25 in Stardew Valley or you're currently obliterating enemies in PUBG as we speak, you need a mouse. We dug up some greatgaming mouse dealsthat will have you covered in that regard, but I've got more. I'll add theRazer Viper V3 Proto that list (currently$136/£127), alongside theBasilisk V3($44/£41) and theLogitech G502 Lightspeed Wireless($99/£139). I've personally tested all three squeakers and can swear by them. I'm currently using a Naga V2 Pro ($179/£152), but you don't really need one unless you play games that make the most of these types of button-heavy mice. Moving on to gaming headsets, most audiophiles will yell at me if I recommend youactualheadsets—meaning headphones and a microphone all in one. It's true that the sound quality won't match a separate set of cans and a standalone mic, but some of thebest gaming headsetscan do the job just fine. Your buddies will still hear you well enough on Discord, complete with heavy breathing, chewing, and angry dogs in the background. (That might just be my experience.) I'm a fan of wireless, so I recommend theHyperX Cloud Alpha wireless. These are fairly affordable, too, and you can snag them for$144(£128) right now. TheAudeze Maxwellis a superb pair that racks up the price to$299(£349). For something that's wired and much cheaper, check out the Razer BlackShark V2 X, right now on sale for just$38(£36). Or, make your own DIY gaming headset with an Antlion ModMic Wireless ($149|£139) and one of thebest gaming headphones. I used to think that owning a high-quality keyboard just for gaming wasn't a big deal, but itsois. Seriously, I truly love that thing. While my own keyboard doesn't rank on our list of thebest gaming keyboards, I'll still say that it's worth buying just based on my own experience with it. It's the Razer BlackWidow V3, which you can pick up for$139(£111). Beyond my love for my pink, clickety keyboard, our favorite gaming keeb is theAsus ROG Strix Scope II, and it's on sale for$169(£125). Cheaper options exist: Check out the Razer Ornata V3 X ($29/£33) and the Logitech G213 Prodigy ($49/£39). Between all the upgrades listed above, you've got plenty of options to sink your money and time into. Whether you decide to upgrade your CPU or pick up a new gaming headset, you'll still see an improvement in your overall gaming experience. Buying a GPU can—andshould—wait for better days. While all of these options are sound, they won't help if your current graphics card bursts into tears the moment you launch your Steam library. If you need one, then you need one, and that's that. I recentlyrounded up five of the GPUs that are (sorta, kinda, maybe) worth buying in this current climate, so start there if you're desperate. We've got new GPUs on the imminent horizon, too.AMD's RX 9060 XTandNvidia's RTX 5060are right around the corner, and those are mainstream cards, so even if both manufacturers and retailers add on an extra premium on top of their MSRPs, they'll still be somewhat affordable. Whether they'll be a good deal is another matter entirely. As a last resort, I recommend trying the second-hand market. Used GPUs from the previous generations are plentiful on eBay, and they'll keep you going if you're in a pinch. Beware, though, because scams are wildly common. Ultimately, remember that all of these upgrades will still be good whenever you're ready to buy a GPU. You're not wasting money or time—you're just sitting this one out and buying something else instead. I don't know about you, but I much prefer that to spending $900 on a GPU that was meant to cost $600 (looking at you,RX 9070 XT).

During theCheshire CatChaos event inDisney Dreamlight Valley, you'll have the opportunity to complete four separate dreamlight duties in return for some limited rewards. TheClean Your Roomduty is one of the four, and the most challenging since you'll have to travel between the valley and a separate realm in order to complete it. You'll need access to the Toy Story realm, and both Woody and Buzz unlocked before you can complete this duty. Provided you've already done this, you'll be able to enter and exit the realm freely and work towards getting your Wonderland-themed reward. Here's what you need to do once you're in the realm. To complete the Clean Your Room duty, you need to visit the Toy Story realm andclear away purple paw prints left by the Cheshire Cat. They look identical to the ones you saw in the Alice in Wonderland realm and during theChaos in the Kitchenand Mannequin Madness quest, so they're hard to miss. When you find clusters of these paw prints,use your watering can to wash themaway rather than interacting with them like you would Night Thorns. You need to clean up 20 sets of paw prints to complete this duty, and they won't all spawn at one time. Fortunately, they do respawn every 15 minutes so you'll be able to keep re-visiting the realm to chip away at the task. When you've ticked it off your docket, you'll be rewarded with a Rabbit Rocking Chair which is exclusive to this challenge. If you don't have the Toy Story realm unlocked yet, you've got until May 20 to welcome Buzz and Woody to your valley and open up the option to travel between realms.

    "title": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 devs to issue its first nerf to an ability that does 2 billion damage: 'We gave it a big damage boost—and clearly overdid it'",
    "article_text": "Stand down, Stendhal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is getting its first set of hotfixes tomorrow—which'll include a nerf to Stendhal, a skill that's beenallowing players to do around 4 billion damage, which, as I observed yesterday, is enough to kill the game's hardest endgame superboss 45 times over. \"We hadn’t planned to make any balance changes this early,\" Sandfall Interactivewrites on X, \"just bug fixes, unless something clearly stood out. Well, Stendhal did.\" In case you're unfamiliar with Stendhal, players are able to combo it with a set of skills, Pictos (equipment) and Luminas (equipment passives) to damage scale it into the stratosphere—while this required quite a bit of setup to start one-tapping postgame bosses, it was still good from the outset and only scaled into low orbit from there. Interestingly enough, the team explains that Stendhal was initiallyunderpowered during testing. \"It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost—and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options. \"We still want you to be able to break the game—and you absolutely still can—but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.\" While I'm typically on the side of players in these cases, as I don't think a build being overpowered in a single-player RPG matters too much, I do think Sandfall's making the right call here. Cranking absurd levels of damage with the right combo is fun, but the pinnacle of the game's difficulty—an endgame superboss named Simon—shouldn't be one-tapped by it 45 times over. In my opinion, part of the game's appeal is having a lot of different builds to try out, since its Luminas system is deliciously complex. Having one both be easy to set upandmuch stronger than the competition seems counter to that goal. It's fun to feel strong, but it's also kind of, uh, boring to just skip over carefully-designed challenges. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"You’ve got one more day to enjoy it in its current form and set some wild records,\" warneth Sandfall. \"The adjustment will be included in our first full hotfix set, going live tomorrow.

    "title": "One US politician wants to add trackers to Nvidia's GPUs so they can be bricked if they go to China",
    "article_text": "Very James Bond, I like it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a very strange thing that happens when an industry starts to become incredibly relevant to national security: There's talk of spy movie-sounding tech like tracking and remote disablement. And no, I'm not talking about PC gaming—this is, of course, about Nvidia's AI chips and the potential that they could end up in China's hands. According toReuters, such remote tracking and disablement might actually be on the cards, if a bill planned by Democrat Representative Bill Foster comes into effect. The bill would have AI chips like Nvidia's be made in such a way that the country could keep a rough track of where they end up, and potentially even prevent them from booting if they're tracked to a restricted country. Foster tells Reuters that the technology for such tracking (even if not the disablement) already exists and much of it is already built into Nvidia chips. Apparently, \"independent technical experts\" that Reuters interviewed agree, even though the news agency reminds us that Nvidia has publicly said itcannot track its productsafter they are sold. There's supposedly already some bipartisan support for this bill, too. It must, of course, be China that the legislators primarily have in mind with this bill. The race for AI supremacy between the US and China has had the former country's administrations over the past few years attempting to curb powerful AI chips entering the eastern superpower's hands. That's primarily taken the form of export controls. The USset restrictions for exports to Chinaback in 2022. It then planned to split the world into three tiers: those that can have US chips, those that can have some, and those that can't have any. This was on track to come into effect this month, but President Trump isreportedlyconsidering a different approach which would have each individual country require a license for US chips. Despite Nvidia'spleas for the countryto \"accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world,\" it seems unlikely the US will ease up on restrictions. This, of course, will eat into the company's profits; it'salready saidthat, as a result of chip licensing restrictions, \"first quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.\" DespiteNvidia's denial of 'tall tales'of China's extravagant smuggling operations, there does seem to be reason for the US to worry. We've already seen that restricted chips have ended up in China's hands, a fact that might, for instance, already cost TSMC over $1 billion afterone of its chips was found in a Huawei processor. And when Nvidia is saying that \"China is right behind us\" in the AI race, it's no wonder US lawmakers are concerned. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Whether to restrict exports is a policy issue, however. What's in question here is implementation: How can the US ensure export restrictions are adhered to? Best SSD for gaming: The best speedy storage today.Best NVMe SSD: Compact M.2 drives.Best external hard drives: Huge capacities for less.Best external SSDs: Plug-in storage upgrades. The latest planned bill would propose tracking as a solution to this problem, which would apparently mean having the chips communicate with a server that measures how long it takes for the signal to travel back to it. This would then give the US a rough idea of where the chip is, ie, which country it's in. Remote disablement would, of course, be a different story. It's hard to imagine how such a thing could work in practice in a way that couldn't be circumvented. But I'm also sure the state's technological capabilities when it comes to national security are far beyond what we would normally assume, so perhaps it wouldn't be impossible. While part of me is sceptical that any measures such as this, even if implemented well, could make it impossible for China to get its hands on working chips, I suppose the US would just have to make it difficult enough that the country stops bothering trying to do so. Which might work out the best all-round, consideringChina seems to want to move away from reliance on US techanyway. Nvidia might be the only loser in the arrangement. But somehow I think the chip behemoth—currently thethird biggest company in the worldafter Apple and Microsoft—will be just fine. Jensen Huang won't have to give up hisshiny jacketsany time soon.

Synergyhas had an impressive rework for its official launch. While this does mean you have to say goodbye to your early access saves, I've been playing the final build and can assure you it's a worthy trade for loads of new features like new plants, seasons, and storylines. I remember when Synergy was but a little city builder. When I played theSteam Next Fest demoearly last year, everything was very small-scale: I was constrained to building on a little patch of land, interacting with limited resources, and playing through a truncated storyline. Even still, I adored it. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Its solarpunk influences are Synergy's biggest draw. I love all the creative ways I can grow my city side-by-side with nature, and that it gives what I'm building a real purpose. I'm looking after a small group of refugees who have had to flee their homes due to a climate disaster and need to provide for them while also looking after their new settlement located in the middle of an unforgiving desert. It used to be that all you had to really worry about was dehydration during the dry season, which would come around every few seasons. While this may result in a couple of sick villagers, it wasn't too hard to prep for with the help of a reliable spring and a ton of water storage towers. But in the full release of Synergy, you have to deal with a fluctuating temperature, which will only worsen as time goes on. There'll be harsher dry seasons, which will test the resilience of your city, and the extreme heat will now impact productivity. Output in exposed buildings will slow down, and its only remedy will be new tools that you have to plan and create before you encounter the problem. If you start work when things get bad, then it'll likely be too late for your city. I've had to do even more preplanning than I'm used to. I have always liked getting a healthy jumpstart on food and water, as these variables depended on the shifting weather, but now I have to add tools and collect the right materials as I'm establishing my city. Alongside rising temperatures, your city will also now face threats like contagious diseases. There are events which, if you fail, will bring about the collapse of your city, so it's a good idea to have a working hospital up and running as soon as possible alongside a functioning scientific district. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One sick person may not seem like a huge issue at first, but boy, can things snowball quickly. Once I didn't get on top of an outbreak straight away, and one ill person turned into two, then four, and then before I knew it, there was a queue for the hospital that went around the block. There are tons of other new features, and I am nowhere near done exploring them all yet. Thankfully, not everything's harder in the new Synergy. There are some helpful updates to the underlying building systems, like a unified water supply. Before every water station was solitary, so you'd have to move the water stock around according to consumption in various parts of your city. It was a bit too micromanagey. But now all your water towers are linked and will automatically redistribute water for you. This is a great addition, especially considering I used to use a ridiculous number of villagers to just keep on top of water distribution during dry seasons or crises, which was a massive drain on resources and productivity. There's also improved resource monitoring, which is perfect for my control freak approach to managing a growing city. Now you can see a breakdown of single and ongoing actions with a chart showing production and consumption trends, and production limits, so you don't have to watch every factory like a hawk. There are tons of other new features, and I am nowhere near done exploring them all yet. So far Synergy's full release has been everything I'd hoped it would be, and I can't wait to see what's in store for me as my city grows. That is, if I manage to make it that far.

    "article_text": "If it looks this good on a five year old console, it'll probably look incredible on PC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The new Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer is graphically impressive in a way videogame trailers generally aren't anymore. That's to be expected: Rockstar has more resources than any other studio in the world, and nowadays, the graphics arms race favours studios with loads of money, time, and talent at their disposal rather than just, say,one smart programmer. As a result, finer details that other studios don't have time to make sing—such asbeer bottles—really stand out. The culmination of all these touches makes the GTA 6 trailer look decidedly next-gen, but actually, it's running on a base PS5. \"Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 was captured entirely in-game from a PlayStation 5, comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes,\" Rockstar Gamesposted on Xearlier today. GTA 6 is only confirmed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at this point, so it's probably no surprise that the footage is derived from what will be the lead platform. Still, I half-expected the footage to be running on a PS5 Pro. Or even a PC, even though the PC version doesn't exist as far as Rockstar is concerned. It's worth remembering that GTA 5 first launched for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2013. That's kind of shocking in retrospect, but the game was perfectly playable on those antiquated consoles, and the inevitable next-gen versions for Xbox One and PS4 weren't seismic improvements. The game's PC launch was different, though: not only did it finally support framerates higher than an occasionally ropey 30 fps, but we also got higher resolution, an in-game video and image editor, and mods. GTA 6 probably won't hit PC until 2027 at this rate—the console version gotdelayedto 2026 this week—but when it does, it'll likely besumptuous.

We've got all the tools you need right here, however you want to win. Who knew one little gap could cause so much trouble? I was so close, and my rows were so green, but I'd never felt further away from finding the right word. One helpful yellow letter became the key to today's success. As soon as it turned up I knew what I had to do (and how long I'd been chasing the wrong idea, too). Something pleasant or soothing could be called this, especially weather.

If you're new to the daily Wordle puzzle or you just want a refresher after taking a break, I'll share some quick tips to help you win. There's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day. You're not up against a timer, so you've got all the time in the world—well, until midnight—to find the winning word.

Keeping track of the last handful of Wordle answers can help to eliminate current possibilities. It's also handy for inspiring opening words or subsequent guesses if you're short on ideas for the day. Here are the last 10 Wordle answers: Wordle presents you with six rows of five boxes every day and the aim is to figure out the correct five-letter word by entering guesses and eliminating or confirming individual letters. Getting off to a good start witha strong wordlike ARISE—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good tactic. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "article_text": "Gotta go fast. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over on Reddit, an Oblivion Remastered player going by the name of purpleturtlehurtler claims to have foundthe perfect balance of speed and fun. In a 90-second video, their high elven mage (with a custom class called \"Master Blaster\") leaps from a frozen mountainside, flies through the air to land near the sunny Imperial City, then hops across the water of the Niben without seeming to lose any velocity. It's all done without console commands or mods, or evendrinking skooma for that sweet buff to your speed stat. In the early Elder Scrolls games, being able to craft your own spells and magic items led to some powerfully broken combinations. What purpleturtlehurtler is taking advantage of here is the fact that, while spells that fortify your attributes don't normally stack their bonuses in Oblivion, they do if you craft spells with the same effects but different names. The process, which probably takes as long as the video itself to implement, involves casting multiple spells that buff intelligence, willpower, and magicka just to give yourself enough points to be able to cast the subsequent spells that buff acrobatics, speed, and athletics. With at least 75 points in acrobatics you unlock the mastery perk, which lets you jump across water. The elven mage seen in purpleturtlehurtler's video has an acrobatics score that's been boosted by 475 points, and probably started at 100. In the original Oblivion there was a cap of 255 on your attributes and skills, thanks to the Gamebryo engine's 32-bit architecture. Oblivion Remastered doesn't have that limit. In fact, it doesn't seem to have any limits on your stats, and given that it calculates your jump height by adding your acrobatics skill, I look forward to seeing someone finally master Icarian Flight and leap straight into the sun.

    "article_text": "Strange Antiquities, the sequel to botany shop puzzler Strange Horticulture, gives you new ways to solve all its perplexing little mysteries. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Along with sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, and Hercule Poirot, pop culture is full of detectives who aren't, technically, real detectives. Jessica Fletcher of Murder, She Wrote was a novelist who just happened to solve in the neighborhood of 250 murders. Father Brown was an exceptionally nosy small town priest who had a knack for sniffing out the truth. Encyclopedia Brown was a smug little narc who constantly ratted out his classmates. You don't need credentials or a badge to solve crimes. I also became an unofficial detective by sitting behind the counter of a flower shop in 2022'sStrange Horticulture. It didn't seem like a detective game at first: customers came into my botany shop with a request and it was my job to figure out what unusual plant they were looking for. But over time it revealed itself as a real detective game: I gathered clues, examined evidence, and pieced together a small mystery with each customer request as a larger, darker mystery unfolded outside the doors of my gloomy but cozy little shop. Strange Horticulture isn't just a puzzle game, it'sa brilliant detective adventure. So I was pretty excited to play a demo of Bad Viking's sequel,Strange Antiquities. Taking place in the same town, Undermere, as the original game, now you're running a little curio shop. Once again, customers file into your store with a request, and you've got to piece together clues to figure out which artifact might help them out. And instead of plants, your shop will become filled with unusual occult relics. The demo I played only lasted for two in-game days and I could only assist a handful of customers, but by the end I still had a great collection of items to show off: stone tablets carved with runes, brass effigies adorned with markings, pendants, sculptures, and even a weird blackened claw-like hand wearing a gold ring. That's my kinda inventory. Along with the new merchandise, there are new ways to examine and identify items. In Strange Horticulture you'd peer at plants with a magnifying glass and pore through pages in your botany book to suss out which plant was which. In Strange Antiquities you not only have several books to look through for clues, but you can use more of your senses while forming an ID. First, you can examine an item's color and get a description of the material it's made from. \"Iron-grey metal flecked with dark red. It's not rust, it's blood\" said the description of one item in my shop, which appeared to be a statuette of a six-fingered hand with an unblinking eye in its palm. Is an item hot? Cold? Soft or hard? You can use your sense of touch to examine not just the object as a whole but different parts of it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. You can also listen to artifacts (I didn't hear anything in the demo, but I wouldn't be shocked if some of the items started talking, or maybe wailing) and sniff them to see if they emanate a scent, another useful way to help you determine exactly what the object is. Then there's a sort of nebulous detective tool called \"inner perception.\" What vibe does this weird thing give you? I didn't detect much with this in the demo either, though one item made me feel as if I was being watched—which, weirdly enough, perfectly fit one particular customer's needs. Why would someone want to buy a piece of jewelry that instilled a feeling of paranoia? I won't spoil it, but it's actually a very good reason. In Strange Horticulture you could open a map and explore the mysterious world around your little town while hunting for new plants. In Strange Antiquities, I only had a map of the town itself, but it was still fun to explore by visiting a few locations like a farm and a library to uncover new objects and information. I even popped by the botany shop from the first game and brought a plant back to my new artifact store where it now sits on a shelf next to a wooden carving of an owl and pendant with one green eye that follows my mouse movements. (I haven't identified that second one yet, but I'm dying to.) The demo of Strange Antiquities is just a teeny, tiny sample of the full game, but it strikes the same cozy yet creepy notes as the original adventure and opens up the sleuthing with several fun new investigative tools. I'm officially counting the days until I can tidy up my countertop, pet my shop cat, and ring the bell to welcome the next customer. There's no release date yet, but I'll cross the fingers of the weird claw-like hand on my shelf and hope it's soon.

    "article_text": "The tech giant is reportedly making progress on a chip to power them When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Apple’s been rumored to be working on smart glasses for what feels like forever, and it makes sense considering that this wearable gadget would be lighter than theApple Vision Prowith a slimmer all-around design and, hopefully, lighter on the wallet as well. A new report fromBloomberg’s Mark Gurmandetails that the Cupertino-based tech giant is making progress on a chip that will power “its first smart glasses.” The report notes that ‘progress has been made’ on the chip, which means that internal work on the smart glasses is ramping up and that production on the processor is set to start by the end of 2027. Now, dates can move and change, but that would put these smart glasses on the road for release in about two years. These aren’t the full-fledged AR glasses that have long been rumored, though; rather, the report says these smart glasses “would compete with the popular Ray-Ban spectacles” from Meta. TheMeta Ray-Bansare a hit for the company, landing in a similar build to classic glasses. They allow one to take photos or videos without taking a phone out and offer easy access to the Meta AI assistant. Apple’s exact feature set for these smart glasses that wouldn’t overlay the world around you isn’t set as of yet, though. According to the report, “Apple is currently exploring non-AR glasses that use cameras to scan the surrounding environment and rely on AI to assist users.” This sounds pretty similar to what Meta Ray-Ban offers and also toVisual Intelligenceon theiPhone 16lineup – and iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max – which uses Google or ChatGPT to identify what’s in the scene. Hopefully, by 2027, though, Apple Intelligence will be more widely rolled out, with AI-powered Siri in the hands of plenty of consumers on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Seeing that this reported chip is modeled after theApple Watch’s SoC, it’s likely that these smart glasses would pair with another device like an iPhone, probably in a process similar to setting up an Apple Watch or AirPods. However, Apple isn’t just switching to focusing on building smart glasses without AR. The report notes that this new model and the previously rumored one are in development, and thatTim Cookreally wants to beat Meta in the world of smart glasses. Offering more than one model when the time comes for a release would be an easy way to attract more consumers, especially if it lowers the entry price. Even so, we’re far out on Apple’s rumored smart glasses, as two years puts them at the earliest of 2027, but I’d bet we'll see plenty more rumors and reports in the lead up to that. In the more immediate future, though,Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference will kick off on June 9, 2025, and the company should share more about its next-generation platforms and Apple Intelligence at large. Who knows, we might even get a more substantial update for the Vision Pro, which could hint at future glasses. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "OpenAI set to splurge $3 billion on AI coding tool Windsurf as ChatGPT inventor looks to make programmers a bit more nervous",
    "article_text": "Windsurf deal could give OpenAI a major coding advantage When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAIis set to acquire Windsurf, a top artificial intelligence-powered coding assistant, in a deal reportedly worth $3 billion. At the time of writing, the deal has not yet been finalized, however, if it goes through, it would mark OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date and signal an aggressive push to dominate the rapidly evolving field of AI-assisted software development. Windsurf, previously known as Codeium, is a product of Exafunction Inc., a startup that has attracted significant investor attention over the past year, as one of several emerging tools that translate plain language prompts into working code, reducing the need for manual development and, in some cases, automating tasks typically handled by junior engineers. This acquisition would put OpenAI in more direct competition withMicrosoft’s GitHub Copilot and Anthropic’s AI developer tools, two of thebest coding platformsin this space. Windsurf was recently valued at $1.25 billion and had been in talks with investors to raise new funding at a $3 billion valuation before OpenAI stepped in with an acquisition offer. The deal follows OpenAI’s recent $40 billion investment round led by SoftBank, which pushed the company’s valuation to $300 billion. With such financial backing, OpenAI has the resources to expand its coding solutions and integrate Windsurf’s capabilities into its broader ecosystem. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! There has been no official public comment from either OpenAI or Windsurf, but sources suggest the acquisition could give OpenAI an edge in building AI assistants that better understand and execute complex programming tasks. The company is likely targeting a unified platform that not only generates functional code but also adapts to individual developers’ habits and project needs.

    "title": "I've used a Samsung The Frame TV for years, and here's why The Frame Pro is a huge upgrade",
    "article_text": "Neo QLED and a wireless box make for a big upgrade When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsung’sThe Framehas long stood out from the list of thebest TVsavailable for you to spend your hard-earned money on, basically since its inception. Not necessarily for its picture quality or the tech onboard, but more so due to the fact that it’s extremely aesthetically pleasing. When it’s off, it’s not a big, black rectangle on your wall or propped up on a cabinet – instead, it displays artwork or photos, and rather than a thick bezel around the screen, it’s wrapped in a bezel that makes it look like a picture frame. It’s been a winning combo, and with the screen gaining the same matte finish as the flagshipSamsung S95D OLED TVin recent generations, works of art now look even more realistic as screen reflections are blocked. And that’s what makesThe Frame Prosuch an interesting addition to Samsung’s lineup – it replaces the larger-screen sizes of the standard Frame with much of the same feature set, plus offers two key upgrades. The standard QLED screen is replaced with NeoQLED, which features Mini-LED backlighting, and there's now a Wireless One Connect box for wirelessly connecting sources. It’s an especially appealing upgrade for folks who already have a standard Frame TV and are after a better quality picture or those who have always been interested, but were waiting for the image quality to be kicked into a higher gear. It also keeps a premium price tag. Here’s how the Frame Pro breaks down by size: Even so, in typical Samsung fashion, it’s already discounted. The65-inch is $2,199, the75-inch is $3,199.99, and the85-inch is $4,299.99. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I’ve been using a 55-inch The Frame with the matte finish and a Disney metallic silver frame bezel for a few years as my bedroom TV, and after spending some time with the Frame Pro, here’s why I think it’s a significant upgrade over the original. Part of the appeal of the Frame TV was that one cable connected to the TV itself, and it came from the external One Connect Box, which serves as a central hub for the HDMI, optical, and other ports, allowing you to more effortlessly, and effectively, cable manage your home entertainment setup. While the Frame Pro still requires a power cable, albeit a thinner one, that’s the only connection you’ll make anywhere near the TV. The One Connect Box is wireless, and a good bit slimmer, and can be placed up to 30 feet away from the TV itself. This infinitely frees up placement options for the Frame Pro – either on the included stand or mounted using the included bracket – and it doesn’t mean any shortcoming for picture quality. It can stream up to a4Kresolution picture at up to 120Hz refresh rate as long as it’s within 30 feet of the Frame Pro. The new box itself takes up considerably less space than the previous One Connect Box, as well, meaning it should be easier to find a spot, and you get the freedom of placement. I have a feeling many folks with a current Frame TV will be jealous of the wireless box, though Samsung has made it clear that it is exclusive to the Pro. Now, I only spent about an hour with the Frame Pro, and unfortunately, it wasn’t alongside the standard Frame but instead a competing model – likelyHisense’s Art TV. Even though I couldn’t do any side-by-side comparisons, the NeoQLED upgrade is noticeable on its own, just as it was when I saw it at CES 2025. The Frame Pro delivered excellent picture quality with high brightness and popping colors in some tests. Future Labs also conducted some early benchmarking and found that it reached 1,000 nits of brightness at its peak, which is 400 nits over the standard Frame’s brightness. Samsung’s testing room was pretty dim, and the Frame Pro got quite bright. It was great for some test content, ranging fromYouTubevideos of varying quality levels to Netflix shows. It’s a much more solid TV overall, with better hardware to deliver stronger contrast and more vivid color. I really look forward to spending more time with the Frame Pro, which also provides a bit more value within the Frame lineup. The Frame, now Frame Pro, has always cost more than Samsung’s core QLED TVs and was priced at the same level or more than some NeoQLED models, so having a much-improved display type is a delight here. The Frame has always been the most aesthetically pleasing TV, and the Frame Pro takes this up a notch. It still displays art very well with great detail and realism. Especially if you pay extra to wrap the Frame Pro in the frame bezel, which completes the look. I ran through more than a dozen pieces of artwork, all available from Samsung’s Art Store, which is built into the TV and costs extra ($4.99 a month or $49.99 a year in the United States). All looked particularly sharp and vivid… well, at least if that’s how the artist intended it. And to keep the realistic approach, so you might do a double-take, Samsung switches off local dimming and 120Hz display so as not to up the brightness too much when in Art Mode. This can also help with energy consumption. All in all, the Samsung Frame Pro is still one to watch. If you’ve been waiting for a substantial upgrade to the Frame, this is the tech giant’s answer. It’s more than the equivalent leapfrog of when Samsung added the matte, anti-reflection coating. Plus, that Wireless One Connect Box will make finding a home for the Frame Pro a little less challenging. The only downside would be the limited sizing for the Frame Pro – anything smaller than a 65-inch, and to get the Frame effect, you'll need to be alright with the standard QLED picture and a hardwired One Connect Box, but at least you'll get a boosted refresh rate as well.

    "title": "Naughty, naughty! More than a third of IT workers are using unauthorized AI, despite risks of shadow tech looming large",
    "article_text": "Employees stay silent on AI use to avoid being seen as unskilled or replaceable When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly embedded in the workplace, organizations are struggling to manage its adoption responsibly, new research has said. A report by Ivanti has claimed the growing use of unauthorizedAI toolsin workplaces is raising concerns about deepening skill gaps and increasing security risks. Among IT workers, over a third (38%) admit to using unauthorized generative AI tools, while nearly half of office workers (46%) say some or all of the AI tools they rely on were not provided by their employers. Interestingly, 44% of companies have integrated AI across departments, yet a large portion of employees are secretly using unauthorized tools due to insufficient training. One in three workers say they conceal their AI usage from management, often citing the “secret advantage” it provides. Some employees avoid disclosing their use of AI because they don’t want to be perceived as incompetent. With 27% reporting AI-fueled impostor syndrome and 30% worried their roles may be replaced, the disconnect is also contributing to anxiety and burnout. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! These behaviors point to a lack of trust and transparency, emphasizing the need for organizations to establish clear and inclusive AI usage policies. “Organizations should consider building a sustainable AI governance model, prioritizing transparency and tackling the complex challenge of AI-fueled imposter syndrome through reinvention,” said Ivanti’s Chief Legal Counsel, Brooke Johnson. The covert use of AI also poses a serious risk. Without proper oversight, unauthorized tools can leak data, bypass security protocols, and expose systems to attack, especially when used by administrators with elevated access. Organizations must respond not by cracking down, but by modernizing. This includes establishing inclusive AI policies and deploying secure infrastructure - starting with strongendpoint protectionto detect rogue applications andZTNA solutionsto enforce strict access controls in distributed environments. Ivanti notes AI isn’t the problem; the real issues are unclear policies, weak security, and a lack of trust. If left unchecked, shadow AI could widen the skills gap, strain mental health, and compromise critical systems.

    "article_text": "It knows what you mean by “that outfit with rizz” When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pinterest has always been about visuals over text. Now, with the help of AI, you can figure out how to describe those visual inspirations and even get a chance to buy your favorite items, starting with women’s fashion. A growing number of Pins on Pinterest will have specific pieces of an outfit or aesthetic highlighted with a shimmering animated glow. Click on, say, the plaid skirt or the blue jacket, and Pinterest will show you some of the words to describe the item and help you find more like it without you needing a fashion dictionary. Pinterest is using generative AI and Visual Language Models (VLMs) for the new features. The VLMs essentially translate images into searchable terms, decoding your taste from an image and helping you shop for it. It's like a more nuanced reverse image search tool, one that can converse with you about your interest in vivid tones and stereopunk plaid. You’re not expected to describe your dream outfit with perfect vocabulary. You’re not expected to know what kind of tailoring makes a jacket “structured casual.” You just have to know that you liked that one look for its vibe. Pinterest takes it from there. “Our visual search technology represents a shift in how users interact with and discover inspiration,” Pinterest vice president of design Dana Cho said in a statement. “We're not simply delivering search results – we're curating a personalized journey of discovery that empowers individuals to find their unique style, and shop it too.\" There are other new AI features as well, including a new refinement bar that lets you tweak results on the fly. For instance, if you like a look but want to change its color or styling, you can use the refinement bar to filter for them or other elements like fabric. And if you spot something you want to use to start a visual search from within the app, you just need to long-press on it. Pinterest says it plans to expand the AI tools beyond women’s fashion eventually, but it makes sense that it would start there when it's such a major facet of the platform. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Pinterest's new tools don't mean it's entirely trusting of AI. The company has also begun adding new labels for AI-modified or AI-generated images and giving users the option to see fewer of them via topic filters. It’s a small but smart nod to the fact that inspiration is great, but that reality still matters when you're shopping for actual clothing. Still, it's an interesting approach to online shopping, and one that fits the way people shop in person by looking at clothes, not just describing them. The AI is like a personal shopper who understands most people rely on visual impressions and gut feelings to decide what to buy, rather than knowing stitch patterns and trend terms.

    "article_text": "Vulcan can feel the Amazon warehouse items it interacts with When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazonhas unveiled a brand-new warehouse robot that it's calling Vulcan, and it's a step closer to being human than many humans might feel comfortable with, but for good reason. Vulcan has the ability to 'feel' the objects it interacts with using force sensors and tactile feedback, which means Amazon can improve precision and reduce errors in its warehouses. The (thankfully not humanoid) robot uses two separate arms, one for rearranging items in compartments and another, equipped with a camera and suction cup, to be used for item retrieval. The companynotedVulcan was trained using physical data, including force and touch feedback, and it's already capable of picking about three-quarters of theecommercegiant's inventory, having already processed over 500,000 orders in pilot deployments across Spokane, Washington and Hamburg, Germany. Vulcan is also capable of self-improvement, learning from experiences much like a human child would do. Because of this ability to learn combined with touch sensors and tactility, Amazon says Vulcan mimics human dexterity, allowing it to manipulate tightly packed compartments without damaging items. It's also able to identify when it cannot currently handle an item, calling on a human for assistance. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Notably, in highly-stacked shelves and taller warehouses, Vulcan is able to access items more quickly than humans because it doesn't need to use a ladder, improving safety and efficiency. It's also said to work at speeds comparable to humans. \"Vulcan works alongside our employees, and the combination is better than either on their own,\" Amazon Robotics Director of Applied Science Aaron Parness explained. Amazon now has more than 750,000 robots already in use across its warehouses, which it stresses are there to support and collaborate with human workers rather than replace them. Other projects include Sparrow, Robin, Cardinal and Proteus – the company's first autonomous robot. \"Our vision is to scale this technology across our network, enhancing operational efficiency, improving workplace safety, and supporting our employees by reducing physically demanding tasks,\" Parness concluded.

The latest comes fromPlayStation Blog's hands-on impressions, which offers fresh insight intoDeath Stranding 2, including information about the game's story, gameplay, and newly added features. In terms of narrative, the sequel is set 11 months afterDeath Strandingand finds Sam Bridges living in Mexico in a quiet life with his BB Lou, until he gets caught up in an incident that brings him to Australia where he is once again tasked with traveling across the map to \"re-connect a fractured society\". Compared to the first game,Death Stranding 2's story \"unfolds at a faster pace\" and will give players access to new equipment and structures earlier on. The story will start in Mexico, but new footage of the Australia map showcases the expansive terrain. During travel, players will be able to switch to an \"aerial camera\" that will show Sam from a bird's-eye view, allowing a further look at the environment surrounding them. It's also said that the game will offer \"more choice and freedom in terms of strategy and decision-making\", which applies to the new equipment, as well as transportation, infrastructure, weapons, smoke grenades to avoid combat altogether, and more.

    "article_text": "Your glasses are always watching When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta’s next smart glasses might always be watching with a new AI that can track everything you do. That’s according to a leak fromThe Information(behind a paywall), which details two pairs of specs the company is working on, according to insiders. Internally codenamed Aperol and Bellini, the two pairs of specs would feature a new live AI. You start it with a command phrase, like “Hey Meta, start live AI,” and the glasses would start recording your every move. This includes being able to recognize people with facial recognition, and to remind you of things like your house keys if the glasses saw you forgot them. The currentRay-Ban Meta smart glassesmodels are apparently already packed with the sensors they’d need to pull off this same feat of AI. Unfortunately, those familiar with Meta’s tests with the existing glasses have said the feature cuts their battery life to only 30 minutes, which isn’t ideal. Meta’s current focus is reportedly to have its in-development glasses – and a pair of Meta earbuds that will supposedly also boast cameras and super sensing software – run for hours on a single charge with this feature switched on. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In many ways, I can see the advantage of this always-live AI assistant. Anyone who has locked themselves out wishes they’d had a little software assistant reminding them to pick up their keys before they leave home. At the same time, it sounds like a privacy nightmare. People who point somewhat nervously at my Meta Ray-Ban glasses and ask, “Are those recording us right now?” always seem to relax when I show them they’re switched off or explain they only record when instructed, like if I say, “Hey Meta, take a picture.” Now, imagine I instead say, “Yeah, they’ve been recording you the whole time.” I imagine I’d lose a few teeth. The Information's report also suggests Meta has reworked its privacy and safety policy to speed up innovation, which, in conjunction with the huge amounts of data this live AI will collect, isn’t something that fills me with joy. Personally, this seems like the time to tighten your privacy policies to ensure sensitive data isn’t shared in a way it shouldn’t be. I expect this AI would come with some of Meta’s existing safety features, such as the light on the glasses being on while you’re recording, and it is at least a feature you have to manually activate, but (call me old fashioned) I can’t imagine ever wanting a camera to record my every move. Others will probably feel similarly about these potential new always-on AI glasses. Just look at the backlash againstMicrosoft’s always-on AI feature, Recall– and that was an app that just took computer screenshots. As with all rumors, we’ll have to wait and see what Meta announces officially, but I’m hoping the final product isn’t anything as scary as it sounds right now.

    "article_text": "European investors are betting big on VSORA's purpose-built AI chip When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. French chip designer VSORA has raised $46 million in new funding as it aims to offer Europe’s main alternative to AI processors from the likes ofNvidia,AMD,Intel, and Google. The Paris-based startup is betting big on a custom-built inference processor called Jotunn8, which it plans to bring to silicon in the second half of 2025 using 5nm production at TSMC. While Nvidia’s GPUs dominate training workloads, VSORA is targeting inference with its chip which it says is faster and more efficient where it matters. The funding round was led by Otium and a French family office, with additional backing from Omnes Capital, Adélie Capital, and the European Innovation Council Fund. The investors are backing VSORA’s goal to carve out a space in a crowded and mostly non-European market. “In a market dominated by global giants like Nvidia, VSORA is a unique opportunity for France and Europe, home to world-class engineering talent,” said Gaspard de Veyrac, Principal at Otium. \"With this funding, VSORA has the necessary tools to reshape the future of AI computation and secure a significant position in the global AI chip market.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! VSORA’s chip isn’t trying to be everything for everyone. Unlike GPUs, which are built mainly for training models, Jotunn8 is designed just for inference so focuses on performance per watt, latency, and cost per query. The company claims Jotunn8 delivers more than three times the performance of current solutions while using less than half the power. It’s aiming for 3,200 teraflops of compute power and will target workloads like ChatGPT-style generative AI, autonomous driving, and edge devices. “This funding marks a pivotal moment for VSORA as we accelerate our mission to revolutionize AI chips and ensure Europe’s technological sovereignty in AI computing,” said VSORA founder and CEO Khaled Maalej. “It will drive the finalization of our technology and the launch of our production, enabling VSORA to play a crucial role as the sole alternative to non-European chip designers. We are grateful for our investors’ trust and look forward to continuing our collaboration with industry leaders to bring our chip to market.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "The disruptor is at it again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It’s always fun to see smartphone manufacturers taking playful jabs at one another, and the latest put-down from Honor targets its longtime rivalSamsung. In a promotional image announcing the May 22 release date for the Honor 400 series, Honor has included a suite of clues to excite fans about the phones’ most exciting features. Among these hidden pointers is a message reading “Not the same,” with ‘sam’ appearing in bold blue letters – clearly a reference to Honor’s competitor. This is the same typeface Honor used topoke fun at Samsung for the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s supposed lack of innovationback in January, so the brand clearly has a bee in its bonnet with Samsung, specifically. The Honor 400 is expected to rival the midrangeSamsung Galaxy A56, so “not the same” could be a reference to the uniqueness of Honor’s phone, or indeed an outright jab at the perceived recent sameness of Samsung’s affordable smartphone lineup. Spark Daily Wonder with HONOR 400 Series | Coming 05.22We've hidden some clues about our upcoming new device in this poster. Quote-rt this post - using the hashtag #HONOR400 - with what you think they are for a chance to WIN a new HONOR 400 device.#SparkDailyWonder… pic.twitter.com/0KcycsqaJAMay 7, 2025 Sure, that’s big talk for a company of Honor’s size, but the brand’s confidence in its own product could be well-founded. In a separate teaser image (below), Honor has confirmed that both the Honor 400 and Honor 400 Pro will boast a 200MP “ultra-clear AI camera”, which sounds like more than a match for the 50MP main camera on the Galaxy A56. The Honor 400 Pro could also have a dedicated telephoto lens, withrumorshinting at a 50MP sensor paired with the zoom – the Galaxy A56, meanwhile, has a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 5MP macro lens. We haven’t heard much else about Honor’s next mid-rangers, but the aforementioned teaser image does strongly suggest that one or both phones will feature some unique AI software and impressive water resistance. The May 22 release date for the Honor 400 and Honor 400 Pro will come a month after the Honor 400 Lite hit shelves. We described that budget-friendly model as a “solid handset with some appealing features” in ourHonor 400 Lite review, but Honor’s upcoming phones will have their work cut out if they hope to compete with Galaxy A56, which we praised for being an “impressive jack-of-all-trades” and one of thebest cheap phonesaround.

    "title": "Samsung can make the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as thin as it likes, I'm not buying a phone with a 22:9 screen",
    "article_text": "A wider cover screen would be ace When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As we recently reported here at TechRadar, theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7could become the world’s thinnest booklet-style folding phone at launch –the latest rumors suggest an unfolded thickness of just 3.9mm. The previous record-holder, the Oppo Find N5, boasted an impressive unfolded thickness of 4.2mm – and as I noted in my fullOppo Find N5 review, this formed a massive part of the phone’s wow factor. And across all phone makers, the progress of folding phone designs has been a pretty marvelous thing to witness.Samsungcertainly deserves due credit for taking the first step way back in 2019 with the originalSamsung Galaxy Fold– the difference between that early model and modern folding phones is simply night and day. However, I’m not so sure that Samsung should make a priority of releasing the thinnest folding phone possible – in fact, I’d go so far to say that there’s another crucial aspect of the Galaxy Z Fold design that needs attending to first. It goes without saying that a folding phone’s cover display will probably never look quite the same as the display found on a slab phone. To achieve a roughly square inner display, folding phones sport narrower, taller-looking cover displays intended for answering messages quickly and taking calls. With that said, phone makers have tended towards widening the cover display of folding phones as much as possible – apart from Samsung, which equips the current-gen Galaxy Z Fold 6 with a tall display that has a 22:9 aspect ratio. For comparison, the Galaxy S25 and most modern smartphones have a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. Let me quickly add that I’ve never used theGalaxy Z Fold 6for any substantial length of time – but I have briefly gotten hands-on with Samsung’s booklet-style foldable. I’ve also used the aforementioned Oppo Find N5, which has a 20.7:9 cover screen, and its older cousin theOnePlus Open, which has a 20:9 cover screen. Having used these phones as daily drivers, I can confidently say that I wouldn’t want to use a phone with an even narrower cover display. Though the key selling point and most technically impressive aspect of folding phones are their large inner displays, the experience of using the cover screen still matters. After all, there are plenty of use cases where opening the inner display doesn’t quite make sense – on a cramped train, at the gym, or checking something quickly on Google. I definitely noticed that articles, social media feeds, and games felt more cramped when using the aforementioned foldable phones, so I’m not convinced the experience would be much better on the Galaxy Z Fold 7’s expected 22:9 display.However, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 hasbeen tipped to get a larger cover display – a 6.5-inch panel, up from 6.2 inches on the current Galaxy Z Fold 6 – I’m certainly keen to see whether a larger panel at the same aspect ratio would be a satisfactory fix. As hopeful as I am for a wider cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it’s far more likely that Samsung will push ahead and release a thinner, lighter version of its iconic folding phone with few other design updates. And if the product strategy Samsung hinted at last year is anything to go by, we could be in for a few years focused on thin designs. TheSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeis set torelease on May 12, andas I wrote in a previous feature, I think Samsung is likely to keep this new product line running for at least a few years as phone makers split their product offerings into heavier performance and camera-centric handsets and ergonomic thin phones. I am a bit surprised that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would land in the latter camp, given Samsung’s framing of the Z Fold line as focused on productivity, but if the Z Fold is to play a part in the thin phone revolution, I reckon we’ll see most of Samsung’s design prowess spent on ergonomics, ie. thinness, with the next few iterations. So, that’s me sticking with OnePlus and Oppo when it comes to book-style folding phones – at least for now. Most of the above is based on rumors, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn’t expected to release until later this year, so be sure to keep an eye on ourSamsung Galaxy phonescoverage for the latest updates.

    "article_text": "Cyberattackers are targeting US critical infrastructure When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released a warning outlining an increase in ‘unsophisticated’ and ‘basic’ cyberattacks targeting Industrial Control Systems and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (ICS/SCADA) systems in critical infrastructure sectors - the oil and gas industries. This isn’t entirely unexpected, ascritical infrastructure has long been a top target for cybercriminals. The services that these industries provide are often key to the daily lives of many, so any downtime can be catastrophic and costly - meaning that attackers have serious leverage if they are able to gain systems access. The attacks that have been observed, particularly against Energy and Transportation Systems, often include ‘basic and elementary intrusion techniques’, CISA confirms - but even basic attacks can harm an organization in the right conditions. Poor cyber hygiene and exposed assets can escalate these threats, CISA warns, and can lead to “significant consequences such as defacement, configuration changes, operational disruptions and, in severe cases, physical damage.” Guidance for critical infrastructure on threat protection often includes robust detection capabilities, frequent and up-to-date patching of known vulnerabilities, enforcing strict password policies mandatingstrong and unique passwordsare used at all times, and training staff on all levels in the basics of cybersecurity. “The authoring organizations urge critical infrastructure entities to review and act now to improve their cybersecurity posture against cyber threat activities specifically and intentionally targeting internet connected OT and ICS,”CISA’s guidance fact sheet outlines. Critical infrastructure is facing a difficult set of challenges as rising geopolitical tensions see hackers increasingly target key industries, and developments in AI tools mean that the barriers of entry are now lower for cybercriminals, who are able to send out attacks at a much higher frequency and that require much less skill - perhaps explaining the increase in ‘‘basic and elementary” techniques.

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump expressed hope that Moscow and Kiev would soon agree on a month-long truce following his Thursday call with Vladimir Zelensky, amid a 72-hour Victory Day ceasefire that was unilaterally declared by Russia Starting at midnight on Thursday, Russian forces ceased hostilities and remained at previously occupied positions, only providing a“tit-for-tat reaction”to violations by Ukraine, according to the Defense Ministry in Moscow. Ukrainian troops reportedly carried out at least 488 attacks and attempted two incursions into Russia’s Kursk Region, according to the ministry. Zelensky, who had previously dismissed the Russian peace initiative as“manipulation”while Kiev intensified drone strikes on Russian territory, held a phone call with Trump later in the day. After the call, he claimed that“Ukraine is ready for a complete ceasefire today, right from this moment,”but insisted that the truce should last for at least 30 days. “Talks with Russia/Ukraine continue,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social after the call. The US calls for, ideally, a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. Hopefully, an acceptable ceasefire will be observed, and both countries will be held accountable for respecting the sanctity of these direct negotiations. Trump warned that if a ceasefire is reached but“is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.” Moscow has repeatedly stated its readiness to begin negotiations with Ukraine without any preconditions. In March, it agreed to a US-brokered 30-day partial ceasefire focused on halting strikes on energy infrastructure. However, according to the Russian military, Kiev violated the truce on numerous occasions. When announcing the ceasefire last week, President Vladimir Putin described it as a humanitarian gesture to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany – and one that could also serve as a catalyst for“the start of direct negotiations with Kiev without preconditions.” While calling for a longer“unconditional ceasefire”on Thursday, Trump stressed that the truce“must ultimately build toward a Peace Agreement,”reiterating his commitment to secure a“lasting”peace between Russia and Ukraine. “It can all be done very quickly, and I will be available on a moment’s notice if my services are needed,”he added.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he could seek China’s help in his efforts to facilitate peace between Russia and Ukraine. He believes Beijing could help bring the positions of Moscow and Kiev closer, making peace talks possible. “It is a natural thing to ask,”the president said when asked by a journalist whether he could ask China to help bridge the gap between Russia and Ukraine.“I think so, yes,”he replied. Relations between Washington and Beijing have recently been strained due to Trump’s decision to impose steep tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods. The president cited national security and trade imbalance concerns to justify the move. Beijing has accused Washington of“economic bullying,”retaliating with 125% tariffs on all US imports and implementing export controls. On Thursday, Trump expressed his hope that the two nations could resolve their differences and make a deal that would benefit both sides. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said last week that it was evaluating the possibility of trade negotiations with the US but reiterated that Washington must show“sincerity”by canceling its tariffs if it wants meaningful dialogue. Trump’s statement on Thursday came as Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia. Xi is among more than two dozen world leaders expected to attend events in Moscow commemorating the 80th anniversary of Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The Chinese leader also held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin which lasted more than seven hours. Before the talks, Xi praised the close relations between the two nations. China is ready to“jointly bear a special responsibility with Russia, as major world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council”in the face of“negative trends of unilateral actions and power-based coercion in the world,”he said.",

    "article_text": "Dozens of Germany’s most prominent enterprises have assumed responsibility for allowing Nazi tyrant Adolf Hitler to rise to power. In a letter published in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the corporations, including Siemens, Uniper, and Volkswagen, have admitted that their forebearers’ greed and silence contributed to Nazi crimes. “The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 would have been unthinkable without the failure of the decision-makers of the time in politics, the military, the judiciary, and the economy,”the collective statement marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe said. Many German companies“contributed to consolidating the Nazi rule”and were“complicit”in the Third Reich’s crimes as they were solely driven by the desire to make profit, the document added. The list of signatories included a total of 49 brands, including Adidas, Bayer, and BMW, as well as several major German banks, Deutsche Bahn, and Lufthansa. The companies stopped short of taking direct responsibility for the crimes of their predecessors and said instead that they“assume responsibility for making the memory of the crimes of the Nazi era visible.” “In 1933 and beyond, too many remained silent, looked away,”the companies said, adding that this past silence“imposes responsibility… for the past, the present and the future”upon them. The companies vowed to“stand against hatred, against exclusion, and against anti-Semitism”and called for the“achievements”made by the EU after the end of the Cold War to be protected. The murky Nazi-era history of the biggest German corporations and families that largely control them has repeatedly appeared in the media. In 2022, former Bloomberg journalist David de Jong released a book titled ‘Nazi Billionaires’, which detailed the ties of companies such as Porsche, Volkswagen, and BMW to the Third Reich. According to the book, Germany’s biggest automakers are still controlled by families that profited from Nazi rule. Some of their holdings include American brands ranging from Panera Bread to Krispy Kreme, in addition to luxury hotels across Europe. “Businesses and many families in Germany were never really de-Nazified,”de Jong said at the time, adding that companies are only transparent when they are no longer controlled by the families of former Nazi collaborators.",

    "title": "US and Russia discuss restarting gas flows to EU – Reuters",
    "article_text": "Moscow and Washington have held discussions about resuming Russian natural gas exports to the EU, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing eight anonymous sources. The talks are reportedly part of broader efforts to end the Ukraine conflict. The supply of Russian gas to the EU slowed dramatically three years ago, hit by sanctions related to the conflict and following thesabotageof the Nord Stream pipelines. Russia’s 40% share of European gas imports has fallen to 19%, currently consisting mainly of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with some supplies provided via the TurkStream pipeline. According to the news agency’s sources, the discussions touched on US firms buying stakes in Russian energy giant Gazprom or in existing pipeline infrastructure in Ukraine. American companies could also serve as buyers, purchasing gas from Russia and selling it on to Europe to bypass political opposition, Reuters cited several sources as saying. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the prospect of restoring Russian gas supplies a“mistake of historic dimensions”and stressed that“we would never let it happen.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has noted that Moscow is ready to negotiate restarting gas exports to the continent.“We know that some countries in Europe want to continue buying it from us,”he told Le Point in an interview last month. Russia has been seeking to diversify its energy export markets against the backdrop of Western sanctions and flagging European demand. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak announced on Thursday that Moscow and Beijing have agreed to speed up work on the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project. The conduit will allow Russia to export up to 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to China annually. “The final negotiations... regarding economic conditions are now underway,”he said. In addition to the Power of Siberia 2, Russia is looking into building an additional pipeline going through neighboring Kazakhstan, which combined would provide China with up to 100 bcm of gas annually.",

    "title": "Putin and Xi make progress on key gas pipeline – deputy PM",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have agreed to speed up the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project, according to Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Novak. The announcement on Thursday followed high-level talks in Moscow during Xi's official visit to Russia to attend the May 9 Victory Day celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany. The planned mega pipeline is expected to allow up to 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to be delivered annually from northern Russia to China via Mongolia. The project has experienced some delays due to deliberations on pricing and route. ”There were discussions, it is indeed an important project. A certain amount of work has already been done, including the feasibility study… The leaders gave instructions to expedite the process,”Novak, who had previously served as Russia's energy minister, said. Moscow is pursuing the project as it seeks to diversify its energy export markets amid Western sanctions and reduced European demand. For Beijing, the pipeline promises a stable energy supply to support its consumption needs. Russia currently delivers gas to Asia’s largest economy via the Power of Siberia pipeline, which is part of a $400 billion, 30-year agreement between Gazprom and CNPC which was clinched in 2014. Deliveries started in 2019, and the conduit reached its full operational capacity in December, making Russia China’s leading supplier of natural gas. Economic cooperation between the two nations has been steadily increasing despite unprecedented Western sanctions against Moscow. Bilateral turnover between Russia and China reached a record $245 billion in 2024. Gazprom projects that gas exports will grow further thanks to soaring demand. In December, Novak announced that Russia has begun developing a new gas pipeline to China via Kazakhstan. Once all pipelines are fully operational, he noted, the volume of Russian gas supplies to the Asian powerhouse could reach nearly 100 bcm annually.",

    "title": "US planning new thermonuclear bomb production",
    "article_text": "The US is planning to launch the first production of its newest thermonuclear gravity bomb variant next month, according to the country’s nuclear security agency. The B61-13 will be a modification using B61 warheads, which hit full production in 1968, modernized with newer electronics and control features like a tail kit, effectively turning it into a guided munition. The warhead’s maximum yield is around 360 kilotons, 24 times that of the bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima, according to Fox News. “The NNSA anticipates achieving the first production unit for the B61 Mod 13 later this month, almost a full year ahead of schedule,”National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) acting head Teresa Robbins told Congress on Wednesday. Full scale production is expected later in the 2025 financial year, she said. The bomb“strengthens deterrence and assurance by providing the President with additional options against certain harder and large-area military targets,”she added. In January, Washington began deploying the earlier variant of the bomb – the B61-12 – at US bases in Europe. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump named nuclear weapons as the greatest existential threat to mankind. In March, the US president called for nuclear powers to abandon their nuclear weapons. “It would be great if we could all denuclearize, because the power of nuclear weapons is crazy,”he told reporters.“I would very much like to start those talks.” During his first presidential term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the landmark 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing Russian non-compliance. Moscow has condemned the withdrawal and denied the accusations. In 2024, after Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to use US missiles in long-range cross-border strikes on Russia, Moscow revised its nuclear doctrine, and lowered its acceptable threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Under the new doctrine, any attack on Russia by a non-nuclear-armed state backed by a nuclear one will be treated as a direct attack by both, allowing Moscow to retaliate with nukes.",

    "title": "‘Father of neoliberalism’ dies aged 88",
    "article_text": "US political scientist Joseph Nye, who co-authored the international relations theory of neoliberalism together with Robert Keohane and coined the term“soft power,”has died at the age of 88, according to Harvard University. During his six decades as a Harvard professor, Nye helped develop the John F. Kennedy School of Government (HKS), where he served as dean from 1995 to 2004. The faculty’s graduates include many prominent US politicians. In a statement on Wednesday announcing his passing, HKS said that Nye’s“ideas on the nature of power in international relations influenced generations of policymakers, academics, and students and made him one of the world’s most celebrated political thinkers.” The scholar“developed the concepts of soft power, smart power, and neoliberalism,”the statement read. Nye introduced the theory of“soft power”in the early 1990s to describe the ability of countries to get what they wanted from other nations“through attraction, rather than coercion or payment.”He later came up with the concept of“smart power,”stressing the effectiveness of combining hard and soft power into a single foreign policy strategy. The term was frequently mentioned by the administrations of US presidents Bill Clinton (1993-2001) and Barack Obama (2009-2017). President Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) put Nye in charge of his administration’s nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Under Clinton, he chaired the National Intelligence Council and served as assistant secretary of defense. Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Nye as“a friend and mentor to so many, including me”in a post on X.“Few contributed as much to our intellectual capital, our understanding of the world and America’s place in it,”he wrote. Nye had recently been increasingly critical of US President Donald Trump, accusing him of neglecting soft power and“bullying”other countries, including America’s allies.“Extreme narcissists such as Trump are not true realists, and American soft power will have a hard time during the next four years,”he wrote in an article for the Financial Times in March.",

    "title": "Leo XIV becomes first American pope",
    "article_text": "History was made in Rome on Thursday, with Robert Francis Prevost, a 69-year-old native of Chicago, elected as pope – the first American ever to fill the role. Taking the name Leo XIV, Prevost emerged on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica to greet tens of thousands gathered in the Vatican.“Peace be with you all,”he said, offering“the first greetings of the resurrected Christ”and urging that his message of peace“enter our hearts and our families.” Prevost, a former missionary in Latin America, spent a decade serving in Trujillo, Peru before becoming bishop of Chiclayo. Elevated to cardinal in 2023 by the late Pope Francis, he was also appointed head of the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican body responsible for appointing most of the world’s bishops – a role that put him on many shortlists for the papacy. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his congratulations to Pope Leo XIV following his election on Friday evening. In his message, Putin stressed the importance of continued cooperation between Russia and the Vatican.“I wish Your Holiness success in fulfilling the high mission entrusted to you, as well as good health and well-being,”the message reads. Prevost succeeds Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88, just one day after presiding over Easter Mass in St. Peter’s Square. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, Francis was the first Jesuit and first Latin American pope. This week’s conclave saw 133 cardinal electors convene, with at least 89 votes needed to secure victory. Leo XIV was elected on the conclave’s second day, continuing a modern trend: Francis was elected after five rounds of voting, while Benedict XVI required four. A senior cardinal confirmed the news from the loggia of St. Peter’s with the traditional“Habemus papam!”before Leo XIV stepped forward to meet the world.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced that he plans to talk with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky in the near future. He has also confirmed that a minerals agreement between Washington and Kiev had been ratified by the Ukrainian parliament. “We just concluded the rare earth deal with Ukraine,”Trump told journalists in the White House on Thursday.“We appreciate that and I’ll be speaking with [Zelensky] in a little while,”he stated, without providing any further details about the date or the format for the upcoming talks. The two last met at the Vatican in late April on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. At that time, Zelensky allegedly tried to use the brief conversation to persuade Trump not to give up on his efforts to settle the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, according to The Economist. Trump’s statement follows the Ukrainian parliament’s ratification of the comprehensive bilateral minerals agreement with the US. The deal was agreed upon last week after months of difficult negotiations. It envisages Washington and Kiev establishing a joint investment fund as well as giving the US preferential access to its partner’s natural resources. The security guarantees which Zelensky’s government had long been demanding from the US were not part of the agreement, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal. On Thursday, Trump hailed the ratification by saying“we appreciate that.”According to the president, the US now has“access to a massive amount of very, very high-quality rare earths.” In February, Reuters cited estimates from two Ukrainian think tanks stating that about 40% of the country’s metal resources are now under Russian control. According to the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development (CIRSD), between 50% and 100% of the lithium, tantalum, cesium, and strontium deposits claimed by Ukraine are located in territory currently controlled by Russia.",

    "title": "AI is a perfect storm threatening humanity",
    "article_text": "The global economy was already navigating a minefield of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) when US President Donald J. Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs reverberated across international markets. This aggressive escalation of trade barriers, including a mélange of sudden rate hikes, retaliatory measures, and rhetorical brinkmanship, didn’t just amplify the chaos; it ignited the specter of a full-blown economic firestorm. The moment the tariffs were announced, markets convulsed. Stock indices plummeted, erasing$2.1 trillionin global market cap within days, while currency markets whipsawed as traders scrambled to price in the fallout. Supply chains, still reeling from pandemic-era disruptions, faced new shocks. Factories in Vietnam scrambled to reroute shipments, German automakers recalculated production costs overnight, and Chinese exporters braced for 145% retaliatory duties on key goods. The tariffs acted like a sledgehammer to an already teetering Jenga tower of global trade, with each blow amplifying volatility far beyond their intended targets. While volatility reigned, the tariff war between the United States and China introduced a deeper, more corrosive uncertainty. Businesses accustomed to stable trade rules now faced policy seesaws. Exemptions granted one day were revoked almost overnight while the constant threat of broader tariffs were dangled without clarity on timing or scope. CEOs delayed investments, fearing sudden cost hikes. The Federal Reserve, already grappling with inflation, found itself trapped in a Catch-22 situation: raise rates to tame inflation and risk recession, or hold steady and watch confidence erode. Meanwhile, allies like the EU and Canada retaliated with precision strikes on politically sensitive US exports, ranging from bourbon to motorcycles, threatening2.6 million American jobsat one point. The potential unemployment tallies just kept rising worldwide. The message was clear: no one was safe from the fallout. As the trade war escalated, the global economic order began to fracture. Nations abandoned decades of multilateralism in favor of ad hoc alliances. China fast-tracked deals with the EU and ASEAN and began to court rivals Japan and India. The US, on the other hand, found itself isolated. Companies, desperate to adapt, began planning redundant supply chains – one for tariff-free markets and another for the US. This only served as a costly and inefficient hedge against further disruptions. Regulatory labyrinths simultaneously emerged overnight. A single auto part might now face several different tariff rates depending on its origin, destination, and material composition. The system now groaned under the weight of its runaway complexity. Worst of all was the ambiguity. Trump framed the tariffs as a“negotiating tool”to revive US manufacturing, yet no coherent industrial policy followed. Were these temporary measures or a permanent decoupling from China? Would they actually bring jobs back, or simply raise prices for consumers? The administration’s mixed signals left allies questioning America’s reliability and adversaries probing for weakness. Geopolitically, the tariffs accelerated a crisis of trust. NATO allies doubted US commitments, Southeast Asian nations hedged toward Beijing, and the Global South explored alternatives to the dollar. The longer the ambiguity persisted, the more the world adapted to a reality where the US was no longer the anchor of the global economy. What makes these tariffs uniquely dangerous is their role as a VUCA multiplier. They don’t just create volatility – they lock it in. Uncertainty doesn’t subside – it metastasizes. Complexity isn’t resolved – it becomes the new normal. And ambiguity isn’t clarified – it is weaponized. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle: tariffs provoke retaliation, which fuels inflation, which strains central banks, which spooks investors, which forces more protectionism. Meanwhile, the dollar’s dominance erodes, supply chains Balkanize, and businesses lose faith in long-term planning. When the first round of tariffs was imposed by Washington DC, traditional economic models anticipated familiar disruptions in the form of market corrections, supply chain adjustments, and eventual equilibrium. What these models missed was the presence of a new wildcard – AI systems that don’t just respond to volatility but can amplify it. Algorithmic trading platforms and predictive logistics tools, operating on assumptions of continuity, struggled to adapt to the sudden, chaotic shifts introduced by trade barriers. In some sectors, this has led to mismatches between inventory and demand, not because of human misjudgement, but due to machine learning models which are ill-equipped to handle the cascading effects of cross-sectoral VUCA. AI is indeed accelerating the fragmentation of the global economic order. As nations implement competing AI systems to manage trade flows, we may see the emergence of parallel digital realities. One country’s customs AI might classify a product as tariff-free while another’s system slaps it with prohibitive duties. This isn’t just bureaucratic confusion; it represents the breakdown of shared frameworks that have enabled global commerce for decades. We used to worry about trade wars between nations; now we should worry about conflicts between the machines built to manage them. In a hypothetical future, trade wars will be fought by rival AI systems fighting proxy battles through markets, logistics, and information. Personally, I doubt this planet has scope for another crisis beyond this one, as Albert Einstein’s adage that WW4 will be fought with“sticks and stones”comes to mind. In the midst of the ongoing VUCA torrent, many clueless bureaucrats and executives have quietly turned to AI, particularly GPTs, to make sense of the myriad crises facing their nations and institutions. Many flawed decisions may have been made and sums allocated for“future-proofing.”Let me tell you why this is a recipe for disaster: one prominent GPT model gave me not one but five (5) erroneous and wholly-fictitious examples of how AI had messed up the post-Liberation Day geo-economic landscape. And here is the scary part: only those well-versed in complex systems, global risks and AI would have discerned those flaws. Otherwise, the scenarios generated by the GPT model were generally more accurate than most of those voiced by pundits on prime time television. Why did the GPT model make such mistakes? I am convinced that AI is being surreptitiously used to sift out the gullible from the indispensable, perhaps in preparation for a post-VUCA world. But that remains a relatively optimistic theory! AI and VUCA are rapidly converging to create the preconditions for the worst unemployment crisis since the Industrial Revolution. Back then, the West could resort to new markets in the form of colonies. This time, however, there are no new territories left to colonize – only the continued cannibalization of societies themselves. The accelerating spiral of global wealth inequality is not an anomaly; it is the clearest symptom of this internalized exploitation. The world is not merely staring at job losses in specific sectors. No, this is about the simultaneous breakdown of multiple stabilizing mechanisms that have historically absorbed economic shocks. Russia’s Digital Development MinisterMaksut Shadaevrecently claimed that half of his nation’s civil servants could be replaced by AI. Shadaev, however, noted that certain professions, such as doctors and teachers, cannot be replaced.Bill Gatesthinks otherwise. He predicts that AI will swiftly replace humans in nearly every professional sphere, includingteachingand medicine. For once, I wholly agree with Gates. So, what do we do with the“excess humans”? Institute a CBDC-mediated rationing system as a stop-gap measure? The VUCA-AI quagmire unfolding today is the consequence of decades of entrenched patronage systems that were perfected in the West and subsequently exported to the Third World. These were intrinsically corrupt systems that rewarded compliant mediocrity over critical thought. In sidelining genuine thinkers, these structures forfeited any real chance of forging a balanced, intelligent response to the collision between VUCA dynamics and artificial intelligence. In the end, we are left with a world designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys, to borrow a phrase from a disillusionedBoeing pilot.Many Third World pundits and policymakers, themselves products of the West’s neocolonial machinery, are now advocating a wholesale pivot towards the BRICS bloc. Like courtiers in a globalist brothel suddenly desperate for new clientele, these elites now decry the very“inequalities”that once elevated them to cushy posts – at the expense of the citizens they claim to represent. As far back as 1970, the Nobel LaureateAlbert Szent-Györgyihad warned of the consequences of the“terrible strain of idiots who govern the world.”Szent-Györgyi, who bagged the Nobel Prize in Medicine (1937) for discovering Vitamin C had however hoped that the youth of the future would save humanity from a gerontocracy that cannot“assimilate new ideas.” Little did he know that the same gerontocracy had already hatched a plan to create a new breed of“young global leaders”– evenchildren– who were more feckless and pliant than their predecessors. This may have been the realraison d’etrebehind the World Economic Forum. Personally, I can find no other justification behind the founding of this institution. In the end, individuals with real ideas – both young and old – have largely abandoned a system that no longer rewards insight, only compliance. Their views no longer appear on search engines as Big Tech had employed a variety of pretexts to shadowban their viewpoints. However, the day may come when the phones of ideators may start ringing again in the quest for“solutions”. It will be too late by then.",

    "title": "Fyodor Lukyanov: The West is dismantling the foundations of 1945",
    "article_text": "Eighty years is a long time. Over such a span, the world changes almost beyond recognition, and events that once felt close fade into legend. Yet while history may become distant, its imprint remains. The Second World War created a political order that shaped global affairs for decades – an order many assumed was permanent. But today, the world is shifting rapidly and irreversibly. The events of the first half of the 20th century are no less significant, but their role in contemporary politics is no longer the same. The war’s outcome, culminating in the defeat of Nazism, defined the modern world order. In many ways, it was seen as a near-perfect struggle: a battle against an unquestionably aggressive and criminal regime that forced nations with deep-seated ideological differences to set aside their disputes. The Allied powers – divided by political systems and long-standing mistrust – found themselves united by necessity. None of them entered this alliance out of pure goodwill; pre-war diplomacy was focused on self-preservation and maneuvering to deflect the worst consequences elsewhere. Yet when the existential threat became clear, those ideological rifts were temporarily bridged. It was precisely because of this that the post-war order proved so resilient. This framework weathered the storms of the Cold War and even lingered into the early 21st century, despite major shifts in the global balance of power. What helped hold it together was a shared moral and ideological narrative: the war was seen as a fight against absolute evil, a rare moment when the divisions between the Allies seemed secondary to their common cause. This consensus – centered around the defeat of Nazism and symbolized by milestones like the Nuremberg Trials – gave moral legitimacy to the post-war order. But in the 21st century, that shared narrative has started to fray. As it weakens, so too does the stability of the world order it helped create. One key reason lies in Europe’s own internal transformations. In the post-Cold War era, Eastern European countries – long vocal about their dual suffering under both Nazi and Soviet regimes – have pushed a revisionist interpretation of the war. These nations increasingly define themselves as victims of“two totalitarianisms,”seeking to place the Soviet Union alongside Nazi Germany as a perpetrator of wartime crimes. This framing undermines the established consensus, which had placed the Holocaust at the moral center of the conflict and recognized European nations’ own complicity in allowing it to happen. The growing influence of Eastern European perspectives has had a ripple effect. It has allowed Western Europe to quietly dilute its own wartime guilt, redistributing blame and reshaping collective memory. The result? An erosion of the political and moral foundations established in 1945. Ironically, this revisionism – while often framed as a push for greater historical“balance” –weakens the very liberal world order that Western powers claim to uphold. After all, institutions like the United Nations, a pillar of that order, were built on the moral and legal framework forged by the Allies’ victory. The Soviet Union’s enormous wartime contribution, and its political weight, were integral to this architecture. As the consensus around these truths crumbles, so too do the norms and structures that arose from them. A second, subtler factor has also contributed to the unraveling. Over eight decades, the global political map has been redrawn. The end of colonialism brought dozens of new states into existence, and today’s United Nations has nearly double the membership it did at its founding. While the Second World War undeniably affected nearly every corner of humanity, many of the soldiers from the so-called Global South fought under the banners of their colonial rulers. For them, the war’s meaning was often less about defeating fascism and more about the contradictions of fighting for freedom abroad while being denied it at home. This perspective reshapes historical memory. For example, movements seeking independence from Britain or France sometimes viewed the Axis powers not as allies, but as leverage points – symbols of the cracks in the colonial system. Thus, while the war remains significant globally, its interpretation varies. In Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America, the milestones of the 20th century look different from those commonly accepted in the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike Europe, these regions aren’t pushing outright historical revisionism, but their priorities and narratives diverge from the Euro-Atlantic view. None of this erases the war’s importance. The Second World War remains a foundational event in international politics. The decades of relative peace that followed were built on a clear understanding: such devastation must never be repeated. A combination of legal norms, diplomatic frameworks, and nuclear deterrence worked to uphold that principle. The Cold War, while dangerous, was defined by its avoidance of direct superpower conflict. Its success in averting World War III was no small achievement. But today, that post-war toolkit is in crisis. The institutions and agreements that once guaranteed stability are fraying. To prevent a complete breakdown, we must look back to the ideological and moral consensus that once united the world’s major powers. This isn’t about nostalgia – it’s about remembering what was at stake and why that memory mattered. Without a renewed commitment to these principles, no amount of military hardware or technical measures will ensure lasting global stability. Victory Day reminds us of the immense cost of peace – and the dangers of forgetting its foundations. As the geopolitical landscape shifts, it is this lesson that remains most vital.

    "title": "Berlin bans Soviet flags on 80th anniversary of Nazi defeat",
    "article_text": "A Berlin court has upheld a ban on displaying Soviet flags and symbols at World War II memorials during the city’s events marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, citing concerns over public peace and the Ukraine conflict. Moscow, has decried the“degrading”and“discriminatory”prohibition. Earlier this week, Berlin police issued a ban on the demonstration of numerous Soviet-linked symbols during the May 8-9 events in the capital, including singing Soviet songs in public. An unidentified local association filed an appeal against the ban, arguing that it unfairly restricted freedom of assembly for their planned commemoration at a Soviet Memorial in Treptow. Berlin’s Administrative Court ruled on Wednesday that the police prohibition, which applies to Soviet flags, the Victory Banner, St. George's ribbons, historical military uniforms, and even wartime songs, stands. The symbols, according to the court, could be“interpreted as an expression of sympathy for the [Russian] war effort”against Ukraine and“endanger public peace”. The Russian embassy in Berlin strongly criticized the ban, saying it violated the rights of descendants of Soviet soldiers and concerned residents to honor the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazism. Up to 27 million Soviet citizens died in their efforts to defeat Nazism. “We deem the ban unjustified, discriminatory, and degrading to human dignity and view it as clear manifestations of historical revisionism and political opportunism,”the embassy statement read. ”We are convinced that on these significant days, everyone… should have the opportunity, regardless of the current political context, to honor the memory and pay tribute to the fallen Red Army soldiers and victims of Nazism in accordance with established long-standing traditions. Any attempts to prevent this deserve condemnation. We urgently demand that the relevant decision be repealed,”it stressed. In 2023, Berlin police prohibited both Russian and Soviet flags during Victory Day commemorations, and in 2024 authorities outlawed Russian and Soviet symbols, including the red Victory Banner and the letters“Z”and“V,”associated with the Russian campaign against Ukraine. In both cases, some people defied the ban by wearing Soviet military attire and displaying the prohibited flags.",

    "article_text": "Slovak Prime Minister Rober Fico has accused the government of fellow EU member-state Estonia of trying to thwart his visit to Moscow for the Victory Day parade on May 9. The event marks the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union. Estonia closed its airspace to Fico’s plane on Wednesday. The Baltic state’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, claimed that“Russia is a country that launched and continues a war in Europe”and“participation in propaganda events organized by them should be ruled out”for EU representatives. “Estonia informed us that it will not allow us to fly over its territory despite the fact that Slovakia has a year-round permit to use Estonian airspace for our government wing,”Fico said in a video-message on Facebook later in the day. He described the actions by the Estonian government as“a deliberate attempt to thwart my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.” The airspace closure is“extremely disruptive,”Fico said, adding that it could prevent him from taking part in the celebratory events in Moscow scheduled for Thursday evening. According to the prime minister, the government in Bratislava is looking for an“alternative route”for him to be able to arrive in the Russian capital before the wreath-laying ceremony and the parade on Friday. The vice speaker of the Russian parliament’s upper chamber, Konstantin Kosachev, told Argumenty I Fakty newspaper on Thursday that the closure of the Estonian airspace for Fico was a“hostile”move by Tallinn aimed against Russia and its partners. According to Kosachev, the Baltic nations have not come to terms with the results of the Second World War, and for them,“May 9 is not a day of victory, but a day of defeat.” Earlier, Latvia and Lithuania denied their airspace to the plane of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who was also among the world leaders heading to the Victory Day parade. Vucic was forced to fly through Bulgaria, Türkiye, Azerbaijan and Georgia in order to make it to Moscow on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Poland drops demand for WW2 compensation from Germany",
    "article_text": "Poland will no longer demand reparations from Berlin for the crimes committed by the Nazis in the country during the Second World War, the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Wednesday after talks with new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Warsaw. Calls for Germany to pay compensation resumed under the previous Polish government led by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled the country between 2015 and 2023. In 2022, Warsaw estimated that Berlin would need to pay 6.2 trillion Polish zloty (around $1.5 trillion) for the damages inflicted by the Nazi occupation. When addressed on the issue during his joint press conference with Merz, Tusk replied by saying:“Has Germany ever compensated for the losses, the tragedy of the Second World War in Poland? No, of course not.” “I am a historian… I could talk for hours about what this bill looks like. It was never repaid, but we will not be asking for it,”he stressed. Merz also insisted that“the legal issues related to possible reparations have been resolved.”However, he added that“this does not mean that we cannot talk about joint projects and common ideas about how we see a future together.” Ties between the two EU nations had been strained under previous German Chancellor Olaf Scholz due to disagreements on reparations, migration and other issues. Despite acknowledging responsibility for the Nazi crimes, Germany had refused to pay reparations to Poland, arguing that the matter was resolved when Warsaw waived its right to restitution in 1953 under a deal with East Germany. According to Berlin, the compensation issue was definitively settled by the 1990 treaty on German reunification. The German invasion of Poland in 1939 marked the beginning of the Second World War. The country remained under Nazi occupation throughout the conflict, being liberated in 1945 by the Soviet Army and local forces.",

The jubilation turned violent, prompting riot police to intervene and use tear gas to control the crowds. Clashes with law enforcement erupted across the city, particularly around the Parc des Princes stadium and in central districts. Video footage shared on social media showed fans igniting flares and fireworks, damaging property, and confronting police officers. Tear gas was used to break up large, disorderly gatherings. One of the most serious incidents occurred near the Champs-Élysées, where a vehicle drove into a group of PSG supporters, injuring three people. According to authorities, one of the victims remains in critical condition. The car was later set on fire, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing.

    "article_text": "Beijing and Moscow have a duty to oppose unilateralism and coercion on the world stage, Chinese President Xi Jinping has said during a meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.Xi has arrived in Moscow to take part in festivities dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany on May 9. Before the start of the talks on Thursday, Xi praised close bilateral relations, stating that“China is ready to jointly bear a special responsibility with Russia, as major world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, to courageously defend the truth about the history of World War II”in the face of what he called“negative trends of unilateral actions and power-based coercion in the world.” The Chinese leader also noted that under his and Putin’s“strategic guidance,”the relations between the two countries had entered a new era.“Our political interaction is strengthening, practical cooperation is deepening, and cultural, humanitarian, exchange, and interregional ties are gaining momentum,”he said. Meanwhile, Putin noted that the cooperation between the two nations is not directed against any third party.“We are developing our ties for the benefit of both peoples and not against anyone. Our relations are equal, mutually beneficial, and not opportunistic. The intention to build good-neighborliness, strengthen friendship, and expand cooperation is a strategic choice made by Russia and China,”he said. Russia and China have enjoyed close ties for decades, with the two nations affirming a“no-limits”partnership in 2022. Moscow and Beijing have also increasingly shifted away from reliance on the US dollar, with both countries expanding trade in their national currencies. According to Russian officials, the share of bilateral transactions conducted in rubles and yuan now exceeds 95%.",

    "article_text": "Moscow and Beijing remain staunch defenders of the historic truth and remember the countless people their countries lost during World War II, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said during talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Xi is among the more than two dozen world leaders who are expected to attend the events in Moscow commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The Chinese president is also poised to hold negotiations with Russian officials. During a meeting on Thursday, Putin thanked his“dear friend”Xi for the visit and for joining him in celebrating a“sacred holiday for Russia.”“The sacrifices that both our nations made should never be forgotten. The Soviet Union gave 27 million lives, laid them on the altar of the Fatherland and on the altar of Victory. And 37 million lives were lost in China’s war for its freedom and independence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, this victory was achieved,”he said. Putin highlighted the significance of the triumph over fascism, adding that Russia and China“defend historical truth and the memory of the war and fight against current manifestations of neo-Nazism and militarism.” The Russian leader also thanked Xi for inviting him to his country’s celebrations of its victory over Imperial Japan in WWII.“I will be glad to come back to friendly China on an official visit,”he said. In echoing remarks, Xi emphasized shared historical memory and the strategic alignment between Beijing and Moscow.“The Chinese and Russian peoples, at the cost of heavy losses, achieved a great victory”and made an“indelible historic contribution to global peace and the progress of humanity,”he noted. Russia and China have long enjoyed close ties, with the two countries describing their relations as a“no limits”partnership where there are“no forbidden zones.”Beijing has also consistently refused to support Western sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine conflict.",

    "title": "Vance outlines changed US strategy on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Washington wants to move away from the“obsession”with a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Ukraine, US Vice President J.D. Vance has said. The US is more interested in shaping a durable peace agreement with Moscow, he told a Munich Leaders Meeting on Wednesday. Ukraine had floated a one-month ceasefire as a counter to Russia’s 72-hour truce proposal to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. However, Moscow has rejected Kiev’s plan, arguing that Ukrainian troops, which have been on the backfoot for months, would use it to regroup and strengthen their military posture. Vance stressed that the US remains interested in a“long-term settlement”of the conflict rather than a short-term one.“We've tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on the what would the long-term settlement look like? And we've tried to consistently advance the ball,”the vice president said. Vance also noted that the US has deemed Moscow’s initial negotiation proposals as excessive.“Certainly, the first peace offer that the Russians put on the table, our reaction to it was you’re asking for too much,”he said.“But this is how negotiations unfold.” Vance added that US President Donald Trump is prepared to abandon negotiations if there is no progress, urging Moscow and Kiev to engage in diplomacy.“We would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another.” Russia has repeatedly said it is open to talks with Kiev but noted that Ukraine has low credibility, especially when it comes to honoring ceasefire commitments. Moscow’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of sabotaging earlier efforts on this front, including a US-brokered 30-day moratorium on strikes on energy infrastructure and a Moscow-backed Easter truce. In light of this, she noted that Russia would view Ukraine’s conduct during the 72-hour Victory Day ceasefire, which went into effect on Thursday, as a test of good faith. Moscow earlier described the initiative as a humanitarian gesture and a move to pave the way for direct peace talks with Ukraine without preconditions. Meanwhile, Trump appeared to support the three-day ceasefire, noting that it“doesn't sound like much, but it's a lot, if you know where we started from.”",

    "article_text": "A group of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including two Germans, are planning to travel to Moscow for a two-day visit to take part in Victory Day celebrations and send a message of peace, the news agency dpa reported on Wednesday. The delegation will reportedly also include MEPs from the Czech Republic, Cyprus, and Slovakia. The visit will feature“talks with [Russian] parliamentarians as well as politicians and cultural figures,”according to German MEPs Michael von der Schulenburg and Ruth Firmenich. The two MEPs, who represent the left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), tolddpathey wanted to express support for the unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine announced by Moscow. “We also want to send a signal that we are committed to ensuring that the guns in Ukraine remain permanently silent,”they said. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Victory Day truce, which took effect at midnight on May 7–8 and is expected to last until midnight on May 10–11. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky dismissed the initiative as“manipulation,”as Kiev intensified drone attacks on Russian cities this week, including Moscow. Separately, two other BSW politicians – former German MPs Klaus Ernst and Sevim Dagdelen – told Der Spiegel on Wednesday that they would attend a reception at the Russian Embassy in Berlin marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The politicians said they wanted to demonstrate opposition to the“falsification of history”and the demonization of Russia. “Russia is not my enemy, and I don’t feel threatened by or at war with Russia,”Dagdelen stated, describing the occasion as an opportunity for“dialogue”and a“new beginning in German-Russian relations.”Ernst told the paper they were also alarmed by “the clearly visible signs of war preparations in Germany.” Their stance contrasts with that of Berlin and Brussels. The German Foreign Ministry had earlier advised organizers against inviting Russian and Belarusian representatives to WWII commemorations. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned in April that the bloc opposes any officials from member or candidate states attending Victory Day celebrations in Moscow. Meanwhile, Berlin authorities have banned the display of Russian and Soviet flags and symbols during commemorations on May 8 and 9, according to local media.",

    "title": "Trump proclaims US WWII Victory Day",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has officially proclaimed that May 8, which is not a federal holiday, should be celebrated as“Victory Day for World War II,”emphasizing the United States’ contribution as decisive – while completely ignoring the Soviet Union’s role and sacrifice in defeating Nazi Germany. In aproclamationissued by the White House on Wednesday, Trump claimed that“without the sacrifice of our American soldiers, this war would not have been won, and our world today would look drastically different.” “On this Victory Day for World War II, we celebrate the unmatched might, strength, and power of the American Armed Forces, and we commit to protecting our sacred birthright of liberty against all threats, foreign and domestic,”the US president wrote, emphasizing that“more than 250,000 Americans lost their lives”fighting for the“survival of Western civilization.” Trump previously announced plans to designate November 11 as“Victory Day for World War I,”a move that would effectively rename Veterans Day – a federal holiday honoring everyone who has served in the US military. The White House later clarified that such declarations would not create new public holidays without congressional approval. Trump’s push to“start celebrating our victories again”has drawn criticism from Russia and even some Allied nations, who accused him of distorting historical facts. General Lord Dannatt, former chief of the General Staff in the UK – which lost about 450,700 people in the war – called Trump’s remarks“extraordinary”and accused him of“rewriting history.” Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of his country’s Security Council, dismissed the remarks as“pretentious nonsense.” “Our people gave 27 million lives of their sons and daughters for the sake of destroying damned fascism,”he wrote.“Victory Day is ours and it is on May 9. That’s how it was, is, and always will be!” Russia is grateful to the US for its support during WWII, but the USSR would have defeated Nazi Germany even without the assistance – though“it would have been very difficult,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week. The Soviet Union received aid valued at around $200 billion in today’s terms through the Lend-Lease program – a US government initiative that provided allies with military supplies, equipment, food, and strategic raw materials. The assistance, however, was not free. Russia, as the USSR’s successor state, completed its financial obligations related to the Lend-Lease program only in 2006. Nazi Germany officially surrendered to the Allied forces on May 8, 1945, following the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops. However, the capitulation took effect after midnight in Moscow, so Russia commemorates the occasion on May 9. In 1945, the United States celebrated May 8 as ‘V-E Day’ (Victory in Europe) and September 2 as ‘V-J Day’ (Victory over Japan).",

Former US president Barack Obama congratulated the \"fellow Chicagoan\", and said: \"This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he hoped for the \"continued moral and spiritual support of the Vatican\", while Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is confident the \"constructive dialogue and cooperation\" between Russia and the Vatican will continue. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas sent his \"best wishes\" for success to Pope Leo XIV in maintaining the legacy of the late Pope Francis and his peace efforts. Israeli President Isaac Herzog looked forward to stronger ties with the Vatican. \"May your papacy be one of building bridges and understanding between all faiths and peoples,\" he said.

REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo TOKYO :Japanese real wages decreased for a third consecutive month in March, squeezed by relentless inflation although consumer spending beat expectations, government data showed on Friday. The mixed wage and spending data highlights Japan's challenging growth outlook, as the export-reliant economy faces tariff threats and uncertainty over monetary policy. Economists are expecting to see a contraction in first-quarter gross domestic product next week. Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key determinant of households' purchasing power, dropped 2.1 per cent in March from a year earlier following a revised 1.5 per cent fall in February and a 2.8 per cent decline in January, labour ministry data showed. The consumer inflation rate the ministry uses to calculate real wages, which includes fresh food prices but not rent costs, rose 4.2 per cent year-on-year in March, easing slightly from February's 4.3 per cent gain but still elevated due to rising food costs.

Mine have long been landmark staples such as Banana Leaf Apolo, MTR, Komala Villas and Madras New Woodlands. I know – so Singaporean, so… basic. Little India, after all, is home to a panoply of restaurants, from mamak sarabat stalls and salt-of-the-earth eateries to Italian trattorias and hipster cafes. There is no lack of choice, but that surfeit of options can get in the way of discovering the less obvious, more region-specific kitchens that thrive quietly within this colourful, cacophonic enclave. To get a different lens on the neighbourhood, I roped in my friend Vasunthara Ramasamy, a private dining chef and self-professed food geek who knows more about South Asian cuisine than anyone I know. With her taking the lead, we traipsed the neighbourhood, skipping familiar South Indian staples in favour of food from other parts of the subcontinent. The result of those jaunts is this short list, which should make for a great start if you are curious to explore a different side of Little India and discover how the enclave’s moniker is brought to life in the richly varied cuisines of the wider subcontinent. What started as a street-side parotta stall in Chennai has since grown into a beloved chain across Tamil Nadu and beyond.The Singapore outlet, open 24 hours a day, is a portal to that world. Its range of parottas is fascinating. Although resembling the Southeast Asian-style prata we know and love, the parottas are denser, flakier, and distinctly savoury. Start with the simple Border Parotta, a nod to the original stall that fed generations of bus drivers, toll collectors and hungry travellers crossing the Tamil Nadu–Kerala border. Then ask the waitstaff if Nool Parotta is on the menu. This crisp, thread-like parotta is deliciously intriguing and served with salna, a spicy, gingery-garlicky dip that somehow imparts a creamy, savoury complexity to the parotta. We also loved the pichi potta kozhi (shredded chicken), which came with the aromatic assertiveness of a good black pepper fry. 83 Syed Alwi Road. Tel: 6970 0596 A post shared by Shruti B (@saoji_rack_stories) Don’t be distracted by the quesadillas and burgers on the menu. You’re here for the Gujarati food. AtShivam, you’ll find dishes like undhiyu, a slow-cooked medley of winter vegetables, fenugreek and green masala, and khaman dhokla, a Gujarati steamed cake made of gram flour and topped with tempered coriander and grated coconut. The patra, colocasia leaves cloaked in sweet-sour gram flour paste, is another snack worth trying. If you’re unfamiliar with Gujarati cuisine, this is a great place to get an introduction. 87 Syed Alwi Road. Tel: 69082966 Thisunassuming stallsees a steady stream of regulars, mostly South Indian workers who come here for a proper cup of chai made the traditional way – with the milk and tea boiled separately before they are combined. A post shared by Madras Coffee House's SG (@madrascoffeehouses.sg) The brew is robust, comprising a mix of Red Label and Chinese tea leaves for extra depth, and sweetened with palmyra palm sugar, a distinctly Tamil ingredient with a mellow, earthy edge. The spice mix leans warm with dried ginger, cinnamon, and a flash of heat from black pepper. Ananda milk gives the chai here its rich body. There's also sukku coffee on the menu – a misnomer since there’s no coffee in the drink but rather an herbal tonic brewed with dried ginger and served as a warming drink. 20 Veerasamy Road, 54 Kerbau Road and 30 Race Course Road Fish and mustard oil are the signatures of Bengali cooking. Both flow freelyherein piquant dishes like fish paturi, a snapper fillet wrapped in banana leaf and steamed in a sauce of yellow, black and brown mustard. We also loved the mochar chop, a crisp fritter made with banana flower, served with a bracing Kashundi sauce that gets its sharp, pungent flavour from mustard. Although not all of us were at first keen on the Kolkata mutton biryani, we ended up demolishing the dish made with, we later learned, spring lamb rather than mutton. The whole thing was fragrant, moreish, and wildly good, with no trace of gaminess. The peas kochuriwas comfort food of the best kind – airy fried puffed breads stuffed with spiced peas and served alongside alur dum,a rich potato curry. There’s plenty more on the menu, for which we will soon return. 52 Race Course Road. Tel: 6291 5244 Look past the dive bar setting atNew Everest Kitchen, aka Kudil Bistro, and you’ll be rewarded with some amazing Nepalese food. “Our chef is a master,” offered the friendly waitress, to which we responded with sceptical smiles. She wasn’t exaggerating. The chilli momos, cloaked in a lastingly spicy, vivid red sauce, were exemplary – their skins thin and delicate, their vegetable filling juicy and full of flavour. “These were not made from frozen,” Vasunthara said, clearly impressed. If you order the plain momos, they’ll come with a bright, tangy chutney made of cauliflower, paneer, and a whisper of peanut, like a Romanesco sauce come alive with Asian verve. Even a simple chicken thukpa, Tibetan chicken noodle soup, featured discernibly fresh sliced chicken thigh meat in a tasty, hearty broth. “Everything was great!” we tell our waitress enthusiastically. “That’s why I say,” she replied proudly, “chef is a master.” 55 Chander Road. Tel: 9895 9493 We stopped byMonsoon Masalafor its Keralan offerings, homing in on more unique dishes like the chicken pothi biryani made with a tapestry of spices woven through short-grain rice (rather than basmati) that yields a “wetter” and sweetly fragrant biryani. Accompanying it was a duo of chutneys: A bright, herbaceous chammanthi and a sweet-tart date chutney, which brought delicious contrast to the spiced rice. Another dish that caught our attention was the kappa biryani, a home-style dish of cassava cooked with spicy, sun-dried beef curry. A Kerala speciality rarely seen in restaurants, the kappa biryani was notable for its comforting earthiness, the kind of dish that tastes like someone’s grandmother made it. The menu spans a generous range of regional Kerala fare: assorted biryanis, grills, curries, and a morning snack selection that includes ullivada (onion fritters) and pazham pori (fried ripe banana). 22 Sam Leong Road. Tel: 8904 2244 ThisSingapore outpostof a beloved Pakistani chain is known for its grilled meats. The menu is built around smoke and spice, with dishes that reflect the robust, coal-fired flavours of Pakistani barbecue. We ordered the half barbecue platter, a heaving spread of biryani, lamb ribs, prawns, reshmi kebab, Afghan chicken boti, malai tikka and fish tikka. Each tasted clearly of their own marinades – some redolent of coriander and cumin, others saturated with the flavour of onions and green chillies. All were beautifully succulent, tender, and smoky from the breath of the grill. 10 Roberts Lane #01-01. Tel: 6299 5210 Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "When Barry Keoghan arrived on theJimmy Kimmel Livelot in Los Angeles this week, he looked comfortable—if not spiffier than usual—in a golf jacket, red rugby polo, cargo pants, and duck boots from Thom Browne, which he paired with a bright red New York Yankees cap. (Turns out thatThe Pitt’s Noah Wyle wasn’t the only guygetting fits offon Kimmel’s set this week.) Keoghan always looks most like himself when he’s wearing some sort of luxury streetwear, a stylehe admitshe’s “always been really into.” But ever since the real-life Ringo Starrspilled the beansthat Keoghan would be portraying him in an upcoming slate ofBeatles biopics, the Irish actor—with the assistance of his longtime stylist, Ilaria Urbinati—has been channeling his innerSgt. Pepperthrough his clothing. In late March, when the films’ hunky cast (with Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Harris Dickinson as John Lennon, and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison rounding out the fictionalized Fab Four) took the stage together at CinemaCon in Las Vegas,Keoghan went metain a militaryish Alexander McQueen jacket. Then, at the Met Gala on Monday, the actor graced the steps in an embroidered, Mandarin-collared Valentino jacket cinched with a red sash belt that looked like it could have been sourced straight from the Beatles’ spiritual phase. Keoghan, in aSgt. Pepper’s-esque Alexander McQueen jacket, while presenting at CinemaCon in March. Barry Keoghan, in embroidered Valentino, at the Met Gala on Monday. Indeed, Kimmel even said as much to Keoghan during their on-air chat. “This, I’d say, has maybe a Japanese feel to it,” the late-night host told Keoghan, referring to the Valentino ensemble. “Also maybe kind of a Beatles,Sgt. Pepper-y thing.” “It really does, right?” Keoghan replied. “It’s funny that you mention Beatles, because…” And thus, a perfect segue to discuss one of several projects Barry’s got in the works right now. What’salsofunny is that this sort of meta-dressing has become a trend throughoutthe music-biopic boomof the last few years, as theyoung actors rewiring their soulsto portray famous musicians (and, ideally, scoring an Oscar nomination in the process) seek out new ways to honor their muses. Timothée Chalamet starteddropping sartorial hintsearly on in his process of preparing to play Bob Dylan, andhas yet to stopsince. Whether or not this actually aids in the creative process is unclear, but I guess a broader sample size can’t hurt.",

    "title": "12 Best Packing Cubes of 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Best Overall Packing CubesAntler Packing CubesRead more Antler Best High-End Packing CubesCarl Friedrik The Packing CubesRead more Carl Friedrik Best Designed Packing CubesBriggs & Riley Carry On Compression Packing Cube SetRead more Briggs & Riley No matter how hard you may try, chances are you're not the best packer. Disorganized, last-minute bag-stuffing with a ratio that skews far too much in favor of taking too many pairs ofunderwearand not enought-shirts? Just admit it! It's the first step to finding a cure for the inability to sort your own luggage out (and you're certainly not alone). The second step? Investing in the best packing cubes to transform the way you think about packing for your long-overdue vacation, business trip, or weekend getaway. Expandable compression packing cubes are miniature organizational bags which fit neatly within your cargo of choice, dividing your luggage into manageable chunks that slot easily into your suitcase or carry-on luggage. These cubes are infinitely better for keeping the same type of clothes, or pre-plannedoutfits, together—not only saving on space but making it easier to unpack and often eliminating the need to iron out the creases of crumpled clothes once you arrive at your destination. Hopefully, you’ve already taken on our guidance on investing in a quality bag from one of thebest luggage brandsaround, but if you’re still hunting for ways to turn your last-minute stress pack into an organizational dreamscape, check out our pick of the best packing cubes below. Antler Antler Antler's range of British-made mid-tier suitcases and travel bags are often high on our lists, but the compression packs on offer here are, in our opinion, among the best. The four-piece set of cubes has three different sizes to fit in all your fashion fits snugly, with a strong compression zip to clamp it all down and open up space for more gear in your bag. The mesh window on top is a window into what each bag contains for easy access, and you can fit a surprising amount in each, though the smaller bag is perhaps a tad too small to be useful for anything other than as atoiletries bag, adapters, or as a laundry bag forsocksat the end of the trip. The polyester material is water resistant and durable and only ways less than 0.4kg in the biggest bag, so won’t scupper you at the check-in weighing desk. Carl Friedrik Carl Friedrik Among the most high-quality travel packing cubes is Carl Friedrik’s luxury set, which will elevate your packing experience from bland to brilliant. There are four total sizes in the set of four that range from the larger bag ready-made for shirts to the small cube which is perfect for chucking your toiletries in, or a selection of socks and ties. It’s a fair way pricier than some other options on this list, but CF has pedigree when it comes to luxury travel, having features as the luggage brand of choice in HBO’sSuccessionandWhite Lotus.The mesh top covers the entire side of each bag so you can see exactly what’s in each cube, making the unpacking process significantly easier when you arrive at your destination. Briggs & Riley Briggs & Riley We know packing cubes don't really get seen by anything other than the inside of your case, but that doesn't mean they can't look good. Briggs & Riley's packing cube set has one of the most pleasing designs we've come across in the world of packing cubes, and they're available in a selection of sophisticated colors. There is no large option in the set, with two medium and one small instead, so you'll need to leave your jumpers out, but the medium is big enough to keep your t-shirts crease free and compartmentalized. This set is kind to the environment, too, with the fabric made from 14 recycled bottles. Paravel Travel Amazon Purveyors of sustainable high-end travel gear, Paravel has got an excellent answer to your packing headaches with this quadruple offering of space-saving genius. Wrought from 100 percent post-consumer recycled polycarbonate, it's kind to Mother Earth, and also lightweight, which is ideal for long-haul trips where every gram counts. What we love here is the broad range of bright color options available, from an acrid yellow to a luscious safari green that adds a pop of personality to your luggage. Half Day Bespoke Post Stop sitting on your suitcase to squash down your over-stuffed luggage—The Compression Cubes from Halfday are perfect for maximizing the space in your duffels, suitcases, and carry-ons to cut down on hassle and make more room for souvenirs. Plus, the mesh top makes it easy to see what's inside, so you won't have to rifle though your cubes to find thatperfect white T-shirtyousworeyou packed. Rimowa Rimowa You know we had to put them in here.Rimowais as ubiquitous in the airport as an ill-advised early-morning pint, but this brand is where we’d place our loyalty. Yes, they are immensely expensive for what they are—this particular medium-sized packing cube is over $100 on its own—but if your budget can stretch to such heady heights, it’s well worth your consideration. Crafted from weather-resistant, water-repellent materials that are both sustainably sourced and durable, the lightweight cube is capacious enough for a two-week trip with absolutely zero issues. It’s an upsetting prospect that the cubes don't come in a pack—you must buy them all separately—but get over that hump and you’ll be organizing your tech and clothes with one of the best in the biz. Amazon Basics Amazon Sometimes Amazon just get's the job done for this sort of thing. Cheap, easy to order and keeping your packing neat, tidy and in perfect order, this five-pack of bags caters to most needs you might have when traveling. A smaller bag is perfect for liquids or toiletries, while three mid-sized bags (that do increase in size) can take care of t-shirts, underwear, and socks. A larger one is perfect as a “dirty clothes” bag at the end of your trip or to store larger items like jumpers. It's worth pointing out that, as it's a cheap product on Amazon, the build quality is nothing to write home about, but given the affordability, you can always buy another set when the first one fails. Tumi Tumi OK, so before we get into it, spending $95 (or more if you pick a larger one) on a single packing cube might not be in the realms of possibility for most. It's expensive, and it's not particularly versatile, but if you can spend the money, you won't find many options better than this one. Best placed for someone who travels light with just a carry-on, any of the three available sizes are capacious enough for a range of t-shirts or some light clothes to separate in your smaller cases, and work exceptionally well as dirty laundry bags for your return. They are a hardy bit of kit, capable of withstanding plenty of journeys across the nations you may have coming up. Osprey Osprey Osprey has long been a trusty companion for hardcore travellers, backpackers and adventurers alike, largely because the brand produces some of the best luggage for any who travel on the rough side. The Osprey Ultralight packing cube set is an exceptional travel companion because each bag only weighs three ounces, barely impacting your limits for carry-on luggage. However, be warned that the zippers don’t open the entire way around the bag, offering only a small opening to slot your gear in. Perhaps not one of the best options for over-packers who don’t know when to stop, as you only get three cubes in the set, but for everyone else who can control the urge to pack too many socks, it’s a solid option. Monos Monos Monos has some of our favourite carry-on luggage options and, if you've treated yourself to one of its suitcases, its set of Compressible Packing Cubes is a logical follow up purchase. The set of four will fit perfectly into all of Monos' Carry On options, while the set of six fits all Check In options from the brand. They are well-structured, the mesh windows let you see which one has your pants and which has your socks with ease, and the interior of these cubes is made from a soft and supple anti-microbial fabric. There are anti-catch zippers, too, which will make sure your Calvins don't get caught up in a quick close. Thule Amazon There are a couple of different options when it comes to Thule's packing cubes; you can buy them as a set with a small and medium cube, or you can buy those sizes individually. There's no mesh window like many others, but the fabric is semi-transparent so you can see what's inside if you do a bit of squinting. The design is one of our favourites around for packing privacy, and both the small and medium cubes offer ample space. We've found we get four small cubes in our carry-on, or two small and one medium, in case you need an idea of what sizes you should select here. Away Away Looking for a top travel brand to accompany you on your journey across the globe? Away is well-known as a welcome choice for your next trip, but make sure you pick up the packing cubes, which may well be on the high end of the affordability scale but are well worth the asking price. Made of nylon, these cubes are stretchy and waterproof, so you can fit plenty in and then wash them once your trip is done to ensure they stay fresh. However, they don’t have any expandable options or have a compression zip to unlock more storage on your travels, so keep that in mind. Peak Design Peak Design You may have seen pro photographers and hobbyist snappers lugging their camera gear in a Peak Design bag, but it’s not just reserved for the creatively possessed. We adore these cubes because they are among the most rugged, functional and tenacious sets that are prepared for all trips and travel on your horizon. The packs themselves are ultra-durable, made of a recycled polyester/nylon combo that’s weather-resistant and will repair itself if you happen to snag or puncture it during your journey. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, and we wouldn’t be surprised if you never needed another pack after you purchase this one. There are plenty of options open to you, from a single pitch to an eight-pack, but be warned that stock is often limited and it may take a while for your order to ship, so keep in mind if you’re planning any last-minute journeys. Many luggage brands are getting on the packing cube hype train, producing a huge range of options for all types of travel, and our travel-savvy senior commerce writer,Owen Gough, has been testing as many as he can to ensure you, too, pick up the best packing cubes for your upcoming trip. He has taken them on multiple journeys, both short and long-haul trips to test out the space-saving on offer for each. In all cases, he used all sizes available from each brand, testing out how durable they are, how easy they are to pack and fill, and any other additional features they have. Aside from his findings below, here are a few key things to think about before you buy. Number of packing cubes:In most cases, a set of packing cubes will include at least two bags, but pricier options will include three cubes or more. If you’re heading out on longer journeys that last longer than a week, you might want to invest a little more and go for four to keep all your clothes organized and then have one left over for dirty clothes on the way back. Size:Most sets will have various sizes to organize your various clothes, so you’ll want at least one larger one for t-shirts and one smaller one for other clothes. Some will also come with one or two much smaller half-sized cubes to fit into carry-on luggage or for packing your toiletries, so think about the suitcase you’re packing and how many clothes you’ll be taking. Material:You want your packing cubes to be breathable, made of durable materials, expandable, and flexible to squash down your clothes into tight bags for the optimum space-saving solution. The best compression options will squash your clothes down neatly without mashing them together. Most will be made of either polyester, nylon, or a mixture of the two, with a mesh panel on one side to allow air to circulate around your clothes. Some may come with a divider to separate clean and worn clothes. Zip type:Top-spec options will have compression zips that put pressure on top of the clothes when closed to squash them down as much as possible, providing more room for extra stuff on top. You’ll want to ensure your choice has expandable storage too in case you’re overzealous with packing too many shirts for your trip. What is a packing cube? We’re always looking for ways to make travel smarter, easier and more comfortable, but one of the most vital travel accessories we’ve used so far is a great packing cube set. They essentially act like smaller bags with additional functionality that can be organized strategically inside your main suitcase or luggage, compressing your clothes into manageable groups in breathable bags of different sizes. The best way to use packing cubes is to collect your clothes into the same category and store them all in the same bag. For instance, most come in a range of sizes, so use the large packing cube organizer to roll all your t-shirts and extra-large clothes, a medium cube to roll up shorts or your underwear, and then the small packing cubes for socks or toiletries bag. Once your clothes are neatly organized, you can place them in the base of your suitcase like a jigsaw puzzle, taking advantage of all the space available and squashing everything down with the compression zipper to allow more room for the bigger stuff like shoes, towels or jumpers to go on top. Once your trip is over, you can then use them as a bag for dirty laundry, separating them from your other clean clothes to make it easier to do your washing once you’re home. Can compression packing cubes also reduce wrinkles in clothes? While packing cubes for travel are excellent space savers in your suitcase, they can also go some way to keeping wrinkles at bay thanks to their compressive powers. Few things are as frustrating as unravelling a creased t-shirt and jeans as soon as you unpack at the hotel, and no one is saving space for an iron or air steamer, are they? However, the best compression packing cubes crunch the space down to stop clothes wriggling around inside your bag and therefore reduce the risk of wrinkles, so long as you pack the clothes in properly. As our mother always said, fold your clothes well, keep them packed tight, and then instantly unpack them and hang them up as soon as you arrive at your destination. That's the three-step plan to combat travel wrinkles. What are the most durable packing cubes for backpackers? As all long-distance backpackers and travelers will know, capacity and durability come at a premium in your backpack. Trekking with only one bag and a selection of clothes means you've got to take gentle care of what you pack, and how you pack it—and you should keep in mind that replacements for broken gear can quickly spiral into a headache. Therefore you'll want to grab some packing cubes that will save space in your pack and will last the distance, so you don't have to hunt for a bag on your trip. Thankfully, many packing cubes are made of hardy, durable nylon or polyester that hold up well against the rigors of long-haul travel. Are packing cubes worth it? In our eyes, packing cubes are an essential part of preparing for any trip, and we are fully onboard the hype train of these useful travel hacks. Suppose you travel frequently or struggle to stay organized when packing for any sort of journey. In that case, they are exceptional for organizing your clothes, reducing space waste in your bag and keeping check of where specific items of clothes are so you don’t have to go rummaging round the bag to find a spare pair of socks. Our travel editors swear by them to smooth out the packing process, regardless of the length of your journey. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "7 Best Hair Brush for Men Options for Good Hair Days in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. What makes the best hair brush for men worthy of the status? (It's just a brush, right?) Well, that depends on a few factors. What type of brush is it? (Abeard brushcan differ substantially from one you'd use on your head.) What are its bristles made out of? (Boar bristles are the premium option, but nylon bristles are more than up to the task.) It's all to say, there's a surprising amount of information to bear in mind when brush-shopping, especially if yourhairstyleis the type that demands constant attention, or at least, like, some effort each morning. We'll save you the work: Since there's so many hair brushes on the market right now, we took the liberty of sorting through them all to find the very best hair brush for men, regardless of how you intend to use it. One final caveat here: It really doesn't matter how expensive your styling brush is if you're not using the right hair products—styler,shampoo,conditioner, etc.—in tandem with it. So while you're scooping a new brush, make sure the rest of yourgrooming situationis up to par, too. Tangle Teezer Amazon Tangle Teezer's brush has been a drugstore mainstay (and an Amazon best-seller) for years because it's so damn reliable. Sure, it's cheap, but it also provides results, detangling your hair—wet or dry—with the formidable styling power of brushes that cost ten times its price. This one is the original, the product that launched the Tangle Teezer brand, and after all these decades it's still the one to turn to if you're in dire need of smooth, tangle-free hair. Mason Pearson Nordstrom On the opposite end of the price spectrum is Mason Pearson's best-selling hair brush. Let's be blunt here: This guy ain't cheap. But spend a second thinking about what you're getting. Each of Mason Pearson's brushes are painstakingly assembled and finished by hand outside London, a labor of love that yields a product engineered to separate and smooth your tresses with as little breakage as possible. This one is made with both boar bristlesandnylon tufts, an atypical—and highly effective—combination designed to strengthen and protect your hair with each effortless brush. Wet Brush Amazon Thick hair folks will appreciate Wet Brush's nylon bristles for its ability to work its way through the tightest tangles, no matter whether the hair is wet or dry. Thanks to the super-flexible bristles, the brush is able to worm its way through locks with ease, and it's more likely to resist breakage so this less-than-$10 haircare tool can stay in rotation for way longer than you'd expect it to. AIMIKE Amazon Trying to go for a gravity-defying pomp or some enviable curls? This round brush helps to style your hair into the exact shape you want, with bristles that easily break through tough tangles and thin or thick hair. The honeycomb barrel allows for hot air to go through when you're using it with ahair dryer, which is great for reducing the time your hair comes into contact with hot air while giving your 'do the definition you want. Zeus Amazon Anyone, and we meananyone, with even a shadow of a beard needs to buy a beard brush. Having a beard is great and all, but you risk an accumulation of dandruff underneath that scruff, so a beard brush will help to exfoliate deep under that forest on your face, plus, it'll control flyways and evenly distribute the hair's natural oils from root to tip. We like this one for its easy-to-hold pear wood handle and its tough-on-tangles bristles. Kent Amazon Kent has been selling its German-made brushes since the 18th century—the brand's pedigree is very real. Its military style brush is its most popular, and it's easy to see why: It offers a handsome polished olivewood body with genuine boar bristles specially designed to tidy up your mane, all wrapped in a compact design you can easily toss in adopp kit. Machete Machete We're big fans of Machete's combs, and its luxe brush is no exception in the hair care department. The Everyday hair brush is made with boar bristles, all attached to a lightweight acetate handle that's sure to be a standout on your bathroom counter. Bristles: Look at your hair—is it fine or thick? If it's on the thicker side, you'll probably want a brush with nylon bristles, which are stiff enough to get through those strands for detangling purposes. Boar, on the other hand, while more expensive, are great for finer hair to more delicately smooth out the hair. Boar bristles are also better for distributing product more evenly through the hair, while nylon bristles can more aggressively target the scalp for promoting blood flow (great for potentially encouraging thegrowth of hair). Round or Flat: Flat hair brushes are great for smoothing out hair, distributing products, or detangling, while round hair brushes are more likely to be used as a styling tool to add volume to a coif. Price: You can easily find a hair brush for $5 or even cheaper, but that'll most likely tug at your hair, scratch your scalp, and probably break in about a week. If you're ready to invest in your haircare (which you should) find a hair brush made from a sturdy material, and while bristles should depend on your type of hair, higher-end bristles will last longer and keep your hair from falling out in clumps. What is the best hair brush for men? In terms of effectiveness and value, we found theTangle Teezer Detangling Hairbrushto be the best hair brush, not just for men, but anyone with hair. Are nylon bristles or boar bristles better? One type of bristle isn't better than the other, as it depends on your hair type. Fine-haired folks will prefer boar bristles, while people with thick hair should opt for nylon-bristled brushes.",

    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterPulling Weeds With Chris Black,in which the columnist weighs in on hot topics in culture.Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday. Time does not exist in a Buc-ee’s. A few minutes in the popular gas-station-on-steroids can feel like breathing the fumes of sausage, bacon and flammable souvenirs for a full year. ButMercedeshas partnered with Buc-ee’s to offer their signature charging station on site, and I had a vehicle to power up—a Mercedes EQS sedan. Mercifully, it didn’t take long. I can’t say I’m passionate about driving. My travel kinks don’t show themselves on I-95 South; what I’m into is efficiency. I like arriving at my destination quickly and with as little friction as possible. The open road doesn’t do much for me; I don’t have the patience. Another thing I have trouble paying sustained attention to isFormula 1—but like most people, I watched a few seasons ofFormula 1: Drive To Surviveon Netflix and enjoyed it. But last week, when I was asked if I wanted to drive an EQS sedan from my hometown ofAtlanta, Georgia toMiami, Florida, to attend the Miami Grand Prix, an F1 race weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, I said yes. Since the drive would clock in at over 10 hours—far too much for me to do in one shot—I needed a co-pilot to take shifts at the wheel and keep it interesting. My friend Ryland Blackinton, a songwriter and producer in Los Angeles, was the first person to hard sell me on F1. I called and asked him to join me for the drive and the race weekend. We met in Atlanta. I picked up our fully charged electric chariot from Mercedes HQ in Sandy Springs, had dinner at El Myr, hung out with my parents, and woke up the next morning to hit the road. We stopped in St. Augustine, Florida, a beautiful city with a rich history. The local gym was shockingly good, and the hotel was charming even though theZyn-and-Celsius-powered college valet took his sweet time. We made great time to Miami, and Ryland gave me an expert-level breakdown of the players, the setup, and how the weekend might play out. The car allowed for something I had never seen: the ability to toggle between two phones, both connected to Bluetooth seamlessly. It was a revelation. Before long, we were valeting in Miami and I slid into the hotel room desk chair with five minutes to spare before recording an episode ofHow Long Gone. Saturday was the qualifying round at the Grand Prix, but first we took the new G Class for a spin through a rainy Key Biscayne and Coconut Grove, which ended up being quite therapeutic. Sitting up high and stopping only to check out a cool independent grocery store, Counting Crows on the speakers, is not a bad way to spend a morning. The drive to the stadium for qualifying was brutal, but once we arrived and I scanned two barcodes and showed a sexy die-cut backstage pass, we were ushered into the Miami Club, overlooking the treacherous Turn 5—think Delta One Lounge meets humid tropical day party. Drinks were flowing, treats were consumed, and all the action was narrated live by a chipper expert. The cars were shockingly loud, but I could follow if I kept one eye on any of the well-placed TV feeds. Saturday night, Mercedes hosted a big party in Wynwood, and we got to build with George Russell, the handsome (and tall!) driver manning the Mercedes car. The seven-time Formula One Grand Prix winner snacked on a curated fruit bowl and told us about spending time in Spain and free diving to chill out. The guy was a fucking pro. Sunday was the big day. I had to do some work and record, so I showed up an hour before start time. The coffee program at the Miami Club was surprisingly good. Ryland saved me a prime seat, and I plopped down with a cortado to watch the action. I followed as best I could; the race is quick, done in an hour and a half, and the rain stayed away for all 57 laps. Our man Russell made the podium, so the energy in Mercedes-land was high. We left the track, past the rammed merch tents, and got into an Uber. We had a delicious late dinner at Walrus Rodeo, and the trip was over. I started the journey as a skeptic of electric cars; it seemed tedious, and I famously don’t care about the environment. But I was won over; the comfort, speed, and technology left this weary road warrior feeling pretty good. Formula One, I still don’t understand, but I’m not here to yuck anyone’s yums. If you want to watch little European guys drive fast in circles in Monaco, who am I to judge? I watch everyReal Housewivesfranchise.",

    "title": "15 Best Men's Underwear 2025: Boxers and Briefs for Every Budget",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. God gives his stinkiest, swampiest battles to his strongest soldiers. The battle? A dank groin. The soldiers? The best men's underwear. You might not realize it, but the least visible thing you’re wearing is also the most crucial. Sure, you could enlist a basic pair to fight the good fight against putrid nether regions, but you would certainly come out scathed and chafed. Whether style you prefer, underwear must be comfortable and made from quality fabrics that are soft to the touch and breathable against the skin. They should also offer you sufficient support without a shred of discomfort, because no one has time for bunching or chafing. And that’s before we even get to how they look on you. In a word: Flattering—they’vereallygotta be flattering. To help you refresh your drawers, we relied on years worth of collective testing and assembled a new panel ofGQstaffers with different preferences and body types to test an arms-full of undies based on fabric, fit, and function. If you’re interested in pledging your allegiance to one label and one label only, be sure to read our guide to thebest underwear brands for men. Skims Skims Kim Kardashian might not be the first person you associate with men’s underwear, but ignore her burgeoning pedigree in the space at your own peril. Ever since Skims debuted itsfirst collection of undies specifically designed for guys in 2023, the brand's collection of ultra-soft and supportive underwear, offered in an array of subdued and refined colorways, has run away with the title ofour favorite underwear for men. The boxer brief is cut from a mid-weight cotton, and receives high marks for its softness and all-day wearability. The mid-weight cotton does have some heft to it, so if you're looking for something more breathable, we suggest looking intoSkims' Sport Brief,which offers the same cut in a breezy four-way stretch fabric. Calvin Klein Amazon Calvin Klein’s genre-defining boxer briefs tend to dominate our rankings for good reason: when the brand introduced them in the early ‘80s, they made designer underwear athing,ushering in the era of the celebrity campaign in the process. Forty-odd years after their debut, the brand’s megawatt briefs still set the standard—and they look just as great on Average Joes in need of a jolt of everyday confidence. According to our testers, CK’s cotton-stretch underwear is as good-looking as it is comfortable. The fabric comes imbued withjustthe right amount of stretch, solid support in the pouch, and more breathability than our best overall pick from Skims—a major win for the old guard. Even testers unconvinced by the boxers’ comfort and fit were quick to concede their value, especially when you buy them in bulk. Are there cheaper options on the market? Absolutely. But few offer as much bang for your buck, let alone the quiet satisfaction of shimmying into designer underwear from the designer that did it first. Uniqlo Uniqlo The rigor we’ve devoted to our testing might’ve clued you in to a little secret: we’re not entirely sure that the perfect undies exist. But thereareoptions that consistently impressed us across a range of crucial factors. Exhibit A: Uniqlo’s AIRism boxer briefs. Our testers noted their support, breathability, and moisture-wicking abilities—all three of which make them solidgym buddies—but really emphasized their overall value. According to our panel, Uniqlo’s famously breezy briefs weren’t the best in any given category, but at $15 a pop, the combination of properties they offered was too good not to mention.GQ’sskivvies braintrust liked the lightweight-but-smooth feel of the fabric, a matrix lesser brands struggle to approximate. They’re more expensive than Calvin Klein's boxer brief, but when you factor in the gym-ready benefits they start looking like a steal. CDLP CDLP When the time comes to nix the 12-pack and upgrade your skivvies drawer, there’s only one brand for the job. That brand, according to our testers, is CDLP, the upstart Swedish label that emphasizes fit and fabric above all else,and charges accordingly for its expertise. These days, plenty of brands hawk undies adorned with billboard-sized logos or done up in gaudy colorways, but CDLP’s approach is a lot more subtle, and in our opinion, a lot more effective. CDLP CEO Andreas Palm says that Tencel fabric is a great, eco-friendly material that performs exceptionally in fit, fabric, and feel. “What truly sets it apart is its luxurious softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties, keeping you cool and fresh throughout the day,” he adds. One thing to note: CDLP crafts almost all of its briefs from that silk-like lyocell jersey, which feels decadent (and is plenty durable), but can run a little snug. Size up judiciously. Sunspel Mr Porter Sunspel How do you do, fellow boxer short apologists? We see you, we hear you, and we have not forsaken you. That’s mostly thanks to the efforts of Sunspel, the generations-old British label responsible for some of the crispest, classiest skivvies on the planet. Sunspel tees were worn by Daniel Craig as James Bond, so naturally, the brand's underwear is endowed with an inimitable sense of retro Hollywood flair. And just like the clothes of that era, its basics are made better. In this case: Long-staple cotton that’s light, smooth, and far more durable than most of the newfangled schlock. I'm an avowed boxer shorts-wearer, and I swear by Sunspel for one detail: a back panel that’s actually cut and shaped. Not only does it make for a better fit, it means they don't bunch at all. At the end of the day, they're very well made, super comfortable, and actually elegant. And while some boxer shorts include a button fly, the majority of our testers preferred Sunspel’s open-fly alternative. They might be multiple factors more expensive than the big-box store fare, but who says you need to replace your underwear drawer in one fell swoop? Uniqlo Uniqlo We tested plenty of mid-range skivvies, but generally speaking, expensive underwear is much better than the stuff you buy in bulk. “Generally speaking” being the operative words here, of course—and Uniqlo being the exception to the rule. The Japanese juggernaut’s boxer briefs earned top marks in our value category, and its impeccably crisp boxershortsare poised to do the same. Like its rainbow of straight-aheadsocks, Uniqlo’s range of woven boxer shorts (which they insist on calling “trunks”), is a great value proposition. I swear by them on the days I'm not wearing Sunspel. The cotton fabric is soft, the fit is roomy, and the elastic waistband is noticeably pinch-free. I've been wearing them for years, and haven't noticed any of the telltale sagging that defines cheapo boxers. All that room does have a slight downside, though—when some of our testers wore them with slimmer pants, the extra fabric was prone to laying a little funny. Mack Weldon Mack Weldon If you love the feel of a knitted material but want the freedom to go with it, a pair of knit boxer shorts are the underrepresented undies you need. Our favorite pair comes from the meticulous fabric nerds over at Mack Weldon. GQ associate commerce director Michael Nolledo alternates between Mack Weldon’s24/7 Woven Boxerand the AirKnitx Boxer, noting that he likes the latter for its traditional fit and tailored look. “They’re cut in a way where I have full range of motion throughout the day,” he says, adding that they're “easily the most comfortable boxers\" he's ever worn, “no contest.” With Mack Weldon’s proprietary AirKnitx material, these boxers have even more breathability than traditional cotton boxers and can wick away more moisture, too. Derek Rose Mr Porter When we say that expensive underwear tends to be better than its cheaper counterparts, Derek Rose’s ridiculously luxe boxer shorts are exactly what we’re talking about. The version our testers tried was cut from 100% cotton with an eerily silk-like feel—augmented by a downright regal sheen befitting the brand’s generations-long pedigree. Even the staunchest members ofGQ’s“never boxer shorts” crowd walked away impressed, praising the extra top buttons and the second-to-none quality. A word to Mr. Rose: our intrepid undies experts would love to see a couple of side seams for added comfort. At $70 a pop, would they buy a pair themselves? Well, that’s a slightly more complicated question—but if youdon’tlive on a writer’s salary, and refuse to compromise when it comes to your skivvies, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more worthy splurge. Lululemon Lululemon In a not-so-shocking development, Lululemon’s Built to Move boxers scored highest marks amongGQ’sresident fitness buffs. According to that lovable crew, who swear they're “totally natural,\" the brand’s signature boxers outperformed the competition by a healthy margin, providing reinforcements at every hard-earned PR. They supported our testers more ably than an eagle-eyed spotter; wicked away sweat while allowing crucial airflow; and protected against the inevitable odors associated with “slanging massive numbers” in the squat rack—without bunching, chafing, or riding up. Unsurprisingly, they were also among the most breathable undies we tested, largely thanks to Lululemon’s proprietary Luxtreme fabric, a silky-but-dry miracle blend that conforms to the body like memory foam without constricting your range of motion. Two downsides: If we were designing them from scratch, we’d probably opt for a functional fly—and make ‘em twenty bucks cheaper. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Ten Thousand’s boxers perfectly teeter the line between supportive boxer briefs and compression liners—they're tight but not too tight where your nether regions are screaming for room. They're also designed to be stink-free thanks to silver ion technology, and the modal construction feels slick and smooth against the skin. Under Armour Shop at Amazon For an affordable pair of athletic underwear UA’s tried-and-true Boxerjock has no side or back seams, and a wide and comfortable waistband. We’ve tested both the 6” and 9” lengths for HIIT and MetCon sessions, and our panel applauded the supportive fit and moisture-wicking prowess. “Between the waistband and bottom hems,” one tester noted, “these will never roll up on you.” SAXX Underwear Co. Amazon If support is what you’re after, Saxx’s “Ballpark Pouch” will certainly deliver. Our panel loved the feel of the Non-Stop Stretch Boxer Briefs, with a tester appreciating the fact that the fabric pouch is designed to keep the legs and the balls separated, which resulted in “much less sweaty conditions.” The skivvies lost marks for its loud branding, but if that’s not bother you, this could be a winner. Tommy John Amazon Tommy John hasn’t been around as long as some of its counterparts, but in the time since we started our annual ranking of the underwear market, its name has surfaced again and again. More than oneGQstaffer swears by the brand’s Second Skin briefs, which come equipped with a signature internal pouch and what Tommy John endearingly calls a “quick draw” fly. Our testers’ verdict: not bad! But also a smidge too expensive for a modal-spandex blend, no matter how precisely designed. Mack Weldon Mack Weldon While Mack Weldon’sAirKnitx fabric underwearis among our favorites, the brand’s jersey fabric is worthy of honorable mention. The cotton-modal blend is breathable, comfortable, and stood up well to our testing. While the boxer was a favorite in our testing, the brand also uses the material forboxer briefsandbriefs. Calvin Klein Amazon If nothing comes between you and your Calvins—least of all your penchant for boxer shorts—the first name in designer skivvies has you covered in superlative fashion. CK’s knit boxers were a quick favorite among GQ’s testers, satisfying both the prodigiously-thighed among us and the fellas who’d sooner go commando than adorn their waistline with the name of any other brand. And the price is so right. Choosing underwear is a very personal decision. While our preferences may vary, there are several common threads that every guy can agree on. Whether it’s boxer shorts, tighty whities, trunks or jock straps, underwear should be comfortable, soft to the touch, and breathable. Hitting those marks comes down to triangulating fit, fabric and feel to come up with the right combo to make for a perfect pair of underwear. David Telfer, Design Director of Sunspel, says that long-staple fibers are key to ensuring softness and durability, even after extensive launders. “When it comes to construction,” he says, “flat seams are key to maximizing comfort and ensuring a smooth feel against the skin.” Fit can often be overlooked. After all, few people will ever see you in your underwear. Even then, it matters a lot. “The fit is key to ensuring comfort and confidence,” says Andreas Palm, CEO of CDLP. Comfort is the obvious reason to focus on fit, but confidence is that secret sauce that can turn a plain pair of boxer briefs into the reason you feel like a Hollywood heartthrob. There’s another secret ingredient, too. “Beyond that, underwear should match your personal style, make you feel sexy, and be crafted from high-quality, responsibly sourced materials,” Palm says. “It’s a category that’s often overlooked, but when done right, the difference is undeniable.” Personal style, as we’re wont to remind you, is just that: personal. Nowhere is that more true than your underwear, the first piece of clothing you put on in the morning, and the last piece you (or a lucky someone) removes at the end of the day. The right underwear for Jack isn’t the right underwear for Joe—especially if Jack swears by all-cotton boxer shorts, and Joe prefers silky, thigh-hugging trunks. So with that in mind, we designed our months-long underwear-testing process to encompass as many preferences,body types, and lifestyles as possible. In doing so, we enlisted a who’s who of GQ staffers—including key members of our Recommends team—to subject the underwear in question to the rigors of daily life; we shimmied into them before work, squatted in them at the gym, and generally wore ‘em to pieces day in and day out until our laundry machines cried uncle. And then, finally, we got our crack (heh) team of testers together in a room and asked them to assign each pair a score, evaluating its comfort, breathability, fit, quality, support, value—and, perhaps most importantly, overall style. Based on those evaluations, we ran the numbers, collated the anecdotal evidence, and emerged with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best underwear for men right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the cheap multipacks to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) solo buys. Whatever your preferences, whatever your lifestyle, there's bound to be a superlative pair of skivvies on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) What's the difference between boxers and boxer briefs? The main difference between boxers and boxer briefs is fit. Boxers typically provide a relaxed fit with more coverage, while boxer briefs are form-fitting and offer more support. Which is best for you comes down to personal preference. What material is best for underwear? The fabric should be stretchy enough to curve to your body without restricting your range of motion (high kicks all day, baby!) and keep its shape all day long. That fabric should also be breathable and soft and should also last a long time without pilling. To achieve those main objectives, manufacturers use a variety of different fabrics. While materials like lyocell, rayon, and micromodal fabric provide an insanely smooth feel, the supreme all-natural breathability of a pair of Supima cotton boxer briefs also makes for a great pair of undies. More often than not, the best underwear uses a balanced blend of materials, usually with some amount of elastane for stretch and recovery. Are boxer briefs bad for sperm count? You’ve probably heard about the hubbub surrounding male fertility and underwear. Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health have observedlower sperm countson average across those who wear tighter underwear (a.k.a. boxer briefs, trunks, briefs, etc.) versus those who wear loose-fitting underwear (boxer shorts). Naturally, your testicles function better at a lower temp than the rest of your body, which is why they hang away from you. Tighter underwear tends to lift the testicles closer to the body, causing them to be warmer than normal thereby slowing sperm production. All that sad, it's important to keep in mind that that doesn't necessarily impact fertility.",

    "title": "7 Best Organic Mattress Picks in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Snagging the best organicmattressfor your sleep style is one of the most impactfulupgrades you can make to your bedroom. Unlike traditional models that can be made with petroleum-based foams, flame retardants, and synthetic fabrics, organic mattresses use materials like natural latex, wool, and cotton that are grown, harvested, and processed with fewer chemicals. They tend to be more durable and less likely to off-gas gross fumes into your bedroom. Shopping for an organicmattresssounds simple—until you realize the word “organic” doesn’t mean much without a stack of certifications to back it up. One brand might tout its use of organic cotton while layering it over synthetic foam. Another might advertise latex, but leave out the part where it’s mixed with chemical fillers. If you care aboutwhat you’re sleeping onand breathing in, the fine print matters. Certifications likeGOLS,GOTS, andGREENGUARD Gold(which we’ve dissected at the bottom of this article) help you sort the actual organic products from good marketing tactics. Below, we tested and broke down the best organic mattresses that are legitimately cleaner, greener, and actually comfortable to sleep on. Helix Birch Living Type of Mattress:Hybrid (latex + coils)Firmness:Medium Firm (6/10)Trial Period:100 nightsCertifications:GOLS and GREENGUARD Gold Certified If you're after the kind of mattress that checks most eco boxes and still feels like you’re sleeping in a fancy boutique hotel, the Birch Luxe Natural pulls it off. It layers GOLS-certified latex over individually wrapped steel coils, with organic wool and cotton on top to keep things breathable and temperature-regulated. Translation: supportive without being stiff, cushy without being swampy. Perfect for all sleeping positions and body weights. The “Luxe” part isn’t just branding—this version adds a quilted Euro top which adds a sweet sink-in feeling, extra wool layers for comfort, and extra edge reinforcement, which makes it feel more substantial than a lot of bed-in-a-box options. If you want something natural that doesn’t look or feel crunchy, this is it. Brooklyn Bedding Brooklyn Bedding Type of Mattress:Hybrid (latex + coils)Firmness:Medium Firm (7/10)Trial Period:120 nightsCertifications:GOTS and GREENGUARD Gold Certified Don’t let the price fool you—EcoSleep holds its own against the $2,000+ competition. It pairs natural latex with sturdy coils, tops it with a layer of certified organic and fire-safe wool, and wraps it all in an organic cotton cover. It’s not GOLS-certified latex (so technically not “organic” latex), but it is GREENGUARD Gold certified, meaning it’s been tested for low chemical emissions—so you won’t wake up wondering what that weird smell is. Our tester switched to this mattress after months of waking up with back pain, and within a few nights, noticed a major difference. The medium-firm feel took a little getting used to, but ultimately delivered the kind of no-frills support that made their previous foam mattress feel like an unsupportive hammock in comparison. Saatva Saatva Type of Mattress:LatexFirmness:Dual-sided: Luxury plush (4/10) or Gentle Firm (7/10)Trial Period:365 nightsCertifications:GOTS, GOLS and GREENGUARD Gold Certified Saatva takes sustainability seriously, and it proves this point with the Zenhaven mattress. It’s crafted entirely from GOLS-certified latex and wrapped inorganic cottonand wool, but the real twist? It’s flippable. One side is soft and springy; the other’s firm and stabilizing. You don’t have to pick a side before you buy—quite literally—which makes it a great option for sleepers who haven’t quite nailed down their preferences yet. You also don’t need to lug a heavy, unwieldy box up your apartment stairs. Saatva delivers and sets it up for you, which is exactly the energy this mattress gives: eco-conscious, but luxurious. Bonus points for the long trial window (a full year), and for racking up more certifications than most mattresses on the market—this one plays no games when it comes to clean credentials. Nolah Nolah Type of Mattress:Hybrid (latex + coils)Firmness:Medium firm (6/10)Trial Period:120 nightsCertifications:GOLS and GREENGUARD Gold Certified If you want a mattress that feels as bouncy as it does breathable, the Nolah Natural delivers. It layers GOLS-certified latex over zoned coils for pressure relief and spine alignment, then tops it with organic cotton and wool to help withtemperature regulation. The result: a buoyant, responsive feel that’s especially great for combo sleepers or anyone who changes positions a lot at night. However, it might not be good for those who share a bed with a restless partner, as it transfers motion quite easily across the bed. Unlike foam, this latex doesn’t trap heat or sag over time. And unlike some other latex hybrids, it doesn’t feel like a trampoline. It’s that rare middle ground between structure and softness, with just enough give in the right places. (Although, it just might be too soft for sleepers over 230 pounds.) Naturepedic Naturepedic Type of Mattress:HybridFirmness:CustomizableTrial Period:100 nightsCertifications:GOTS, GOLS, MADE SAFE, GREENGUARD Gold Certified Plenty of organic mattresses check the boxes for clean materials—but it can be tough to find one that actually feels like something youwantto sleep on instead of a hunk of cardboard and springs. The EOS Pillowtop, however, is built with thick layers of latex and coils for support, topped with a plush, cloud-like surface that wouldn’t be out of place in a high-end showroom. But what makes it stand out is the customization: You can choose the firmness on each side, so yourmattressdoesn’t have to be yet another thing to compromise with your partner on. It’s also one of the few models that hits all four major certifications—so you're not just getting a comfortable bed, you're getting one that's rigorously vetted for low emissions, organic sourcing, and chemical safety. Parachute Parachute Type of Mattress:InnerspringFirmness:Firm (8/10)Trial Period:100 nightsCertifications:None— wool sourced from the Wool Integrity New Zealand Program Parachute’s Eco Mattress skips the latex entirely for an innerspring design: dense coils, breathable wool layers, and an extra-firm feel. It’s one of the few organic-certified mattresses that’s truly firm—ideal for back sleepers, stomach sleepers, or anyone tired of sinking halfway into their bed. (If you’re aside sleeper, you may find this far too firm as it would likely cause pressure points on your hips and shoulders.) Instead of foam or latex, Parachute fills in the gaps around the coils with New Zealand wool for natural temperature regulation and edge-to-edge support that keeps you lifted and aligned. If most modern mattresses feel a little too “melt-into-it,” you’ll like the firmness of this one. Coyuchi Coyuchi Type of Mattress:Hybrid (latex + coils)Firmness:Medium Firm (7/10)Trial Period:100 nightsCertifications:GOTS and GOLS Coyuchi, a small brand with a strong commitment to sustainable home goods likebath towels, brings its eco-conscious ethos to the bedroom with its first mattress, the Natural REM Mattress. Crafted from GOTS-certified organic cotton and wool, GOLS-certified Dunlop latex, and over 2,400 individually wrapped coils in the queen size, this mattress offers a solid blend of comfort and support. The seven-layer design ensures breathability, temperature regulation, and motion isolation, catering to various sleep preferences. Notably, the mattress is free from harmful chemicals, synthetic foams, and glues, and like all of Coyuchi’s products, the materials feel high-quality. If you're shopping for an organic mattress, don't stop at the word “organic” on the label. There’s no regulation around that term in the mattress industry—so unless the materials are certified, that word is often meaningless. Here’s what youactuallywant to see. Not every mattress needs to check every certification box—certs can be cost-prohibitive, especially for smaller brands—but having at least one or two is a solid sign the company’s taking material safety and sustainability seriously: Are all organic mattresses made of latex? Most of them are, but a few aren’t. While many use natural latex as an easy-access organic material—and for its durability and responsiveness—some organic mattresses (like the Parachute Eco) skip latex altogether in favor of coils and wool. If you’re latex-sensitive, double-check the specs before buying. Is latex the same as memory foam? Nope. Latex is bouncier, cooler, and often more durable than memory foam. Organic latex is made of sap harvested from rubber trees, while memory foam is synthetic (and almost never organic). But latex’s buoyancy keeps you lifted, and it doesn’t offer that classic contouring feeling of memory foam. How long do organic mattresses last? Latex mattresses tend to last longer than traditional foam models—usually around 10 to 15 years. Their structure holds up well over time, and the natural materials resist sagging and deterioration better than polyurethane-based foams.",

    "title": "Nate Bargatze Owns Darth Vader’s Cartier Tank",
    "article_text": "Leave it to America’s hottest standup comedian to own one of the world’s most interestingCartier Tanks. We’re accustomed to late-night shows promoting the guest’s projects and sharing interesting anecdotes, but it’s rare that a watch becomes the centerpiece of the conversation. However, not everyone owns a watch that once belonged to Darth Vader. That is until Tuesday night when comedian and collector Nate Bargatze brought a fascinating Cartier. In possibly the most deadpan exchange in the history of comedy, Nate Bargatze showed off “Darth Vader’s watch” to host Jimmy Fallon. “This is Darth Vader’s watch?” Fallon asked as he handled Bargatze’s gold ‘Jumbo’ Tank Louis Cartier. “It’s an investment,” Bargatze replied. “It’s a good thing.” Of course, Bargatze clarified that the famed voice-modulated Sith lord did not, in fact, wear Cartier during his campaign to annihilate the Jedi. In fact, it didn’t even belong toJames Earl Jone, the actor who voiced Darth Vader. Rather, it belonged to David Prowse, the English actor and bodybuilder who portrayed Vader (in physical form) in the original trilogy. In perfect Bargatze form, he then produced aprintoutof a Getty image of Prowse wearing the watch in question. “You didn’tbuythe image?” Fallon intoned. “I got thewatch, Jimmy—why would I buy the image? It’s$375!” Despite the sarcastic exchange, this Tank does in fact have an incredible story. According to Prowse’s autobiographyStraight from the Force's Mouth, it was gifted to him by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Jumping into a pool in Dallas and forgetting the watch was on his wrist, he only just managed to exit the pool in time to rush the watch off for a quick service. The crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Darth Vader, Nate Bargatze…if this Tank doesn’t have the strangest provenance of any Cartier wristwatch to ever leave the brand’s atelier, I don’t know what does. The Tank must have been a fairly recent acquisition. In May of 2024, Sotheby’s actuallysold this very watchfor £19,200 (roughly $24,258). Bargatze told Fallon he got it “from a guy,” but it’s not uncommon for professional dealers to buy what they see as undervalued watches and then sell it to clients like Bargatze. A ‘Jumbo’ Tank Louis Cartier ref. 17002, it has a slightly larger case than a standard Tank Louis Cartier and is automatically wound, with a slight protrusion in the caseback to fit the movement’s winding rotor. (Prowse was 6’6”, meaning a larger-than-average Tank would have suited him perfectly.) It’s otherwise a standard Tank, with a white dial, chemin de fer minute track, blued steel sword handset, blue cabochon crown, and yellow gold case from Cartier's Paris operation. Classically styled and ever beautiful, it’s the perfectdress watch. Conversation about watches extended beyond Vader’s Tank, too. Bargatze revealed himself as the type of collector that likes to buy pieces for special occasions. ““I like watches. I usually buy them for a special thing, like [comedy] specials,” Bargatze said. Fallon even gave the comedian a watch when he hostedSaturday Night Live. “I like to buy them as a [memento]. This is a little outside of it. This is movie memorabilia,” he said as he handed over his Tank. “It’s a beautiful watch,” Fallon said. “I have a similar one.” He then rolled up his sleeve to reveal hisownCartier Tank. “Oh wow,” replied Bargatze. “Where’s yours from?” “Do you know the showAlf?”",

    "title": "How Short (or Long) Should Your Shorts Be This Summer? 6 Menswear Experts Weigh In",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The arrival of summer guarantees a few things. Like clockwork, the vibrant-hued spritzes beginappearing on patios, the noisy blockbusters run rampant over movie theaters, and the days grow gloriously longer. And among the menswear set, the Great Shorts Debate is once again reignited anew. Is it a faux pas to wear shortsout at nightorto the office? What length is consideredtooshort ortoolong? Is it cooler to dress like a youngHarrison FordorGiorgio Armani in the 1990s? It’s all enough to make your head spin. At a time when the hottest menswear is all about freaking proportions—think of thepumped-up tailoringandsleekly slim sneakersthat dominate this style moment—the debate over the proper length and volume of shorts remains as top of mind as ever. In recent years,men’s shortshave cranked up todelightful extremes; some slouch well beyond the knee, while others are skimpy enough to rival the mid-century cuts inThe Endless Summer. Only time will tell where the Great Shorts Debate will land this summer, but we’ve tapped both industry insiders and menswear enthusiasts for their predictions. “I know a lot of people havemajor problems seeing men in shorts…” menswear’s reigning champ of street styleNick Woostersays while mentioning Fran Lebowitz’sfamously hot takeon the garment. “But we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. I fucking love shorts. They're my favorite category of dress.” Wooster is not exaggerating—his collection boasts over a hundred pairs. “I understand that that’s a ridiculous amount of shorts,” he concedes, before explaining how he’s assembled a wide-ranging array of different lengths and volumes in various configurations of pockets and pleats. The key tolooking stylish in shortsisn’t about committing to one specific inseam length but to play into what the outfit calls for. “It has nothing to do with the shorts and it has everything to do with everything else. You have to elevate the things around them.” This could mean pairingshimmering shortswith aplain black T-shirtand ablazeror coordinatinga patchwork setwith tonalsneakersandsocks. (Wooster warns never to underestimate the importance of socks when wearing shorts; he recommends the Japanese brandTabio.) While Wooster loves a statement short from the likes ofDries van NotenorComme des Garçons, the biggest section of his rotation belongs to black tailored shorts, often made from tropical wool, from brands like Sacai, Kolor, orEngineered Garments. Sacai SSENSE Jil Sander SSENSE Greg Okawachi, who runs the carefully curated Los Angeles boutiqueBrother & Brotherwith Gary Indjian, is ready to move past debating the specifics of short length. “The inseam conversation has raged on for far too long,” he says. “The ultimate deciding factor should be the overall fit the wearer is going for.” Okawachi notes that “the shin-length jean short dude” will never disappear, but he expects many style-inclined guys to opt for a more balanced look this summer. He also predicts to see vintage outdoorsy and preppy styles surge. Okawachi points toPatagoniabringing back the brand’s original Stand Up short (in five- and seven-inch inseams) and how Yellow Rat’s midcentury-inspired styles look mighty contemporary. While he hailsthe nylon baggieas the “do-all” short of summer, he suggests exploring different fabrics, such as corduroy shorts from classic surf brands likeOcean Pacific, Makaha, orKatin. Patagonia Patagonia Yellow Rat Yellow Rat Much like Wooster, the uber-stylish record exec Sameer Sadhu is loyal to his black shorts. Sadhu’s foundational summertime look is black shorts, socks, and loafers. “When I can’t think of anything else to wear, I just throw that on, and everything else becomes very easy to wear on top of it,” he explains. Sadhu shops for shorts of various lengths, but steers clear of cuts that areDonald Glover-level shortorculotte-level long; his collection boasts tailored shorts from The Row,Stòffa,Willy Chavarria, andBode. He’s big on texture, mentioning how the material and construction can imbue a different look on a pair of tailored black shorts. “It’s so easy to peacock and go wild with shorts...but I know what works for me,” he says. His latest addition (from Comme des Garçons) features a polyester-linen blend that delivers a luxurious satin-esque sheen. Sadhu also mentions a deep reverence forBode shorts, which often offer a shorter inseam with a wider leg opening—the best of both worlds. Comme des Garçons Homme Très Bien Bode Bode David Hellqvist, a stylist, editor, and brand consultant, believes the loose and comfortable silhouette will prevail this summer. “Not baggy or oversized, just loose,” he clarifies. Theultra-short shorts of last summer, he says, “felt like a trend, and trends come and go.” To his eye, the elegance and structure of a longer cut offer a more formal look for men, while notingthat a well-designed contemporary cargo shortcan still play into more streetwear-centric looks. Two short styles from the Swedish brandOur Legacycaught his eye as emblematic of what he expects men to gravitate toward this summer. Our Legacy Our Legacy Our Legacy Our Legacy Pete Macnee foundedAdsuma decade ago, but the New York brand’s mission remains the same today: create supremely stylish and highly functional menswear that works as well in the city as it does in the great outdoors. Over the years, Macnee and team have designed and produced several of what he calls “kick around” short styles, but the label’s Site Short has been a bona fide best seller. “We wanted the build to be a little better than similar shorts on the market, like Patagonia baggies,\" he explains. So Adsum covered the front pocket zippers with a placket and added stitching to the front to make it look more structured. The fabric is abrasion-resistant and quick-drying. The cut is comfortable, airy, and offers a shorter inseam. (But as Macnee points out: “It’s not European swimsuit short.”) Another Adsum style resonating right now is the CIL short, which the brand introduced last year. The goal was to design a \"classic and simple\" short after Macnee felt that many menswear twill shorts were too short or skinny. Adsum’s riff on the style offers a relaxed fit made from mid-weight cotton twill with minimalist finishing details. Macnee summed up the two shorts as follows: the CIL short is what you’ll find him wearing Monday through Friday, but once the workweek is over, the Site Short can handle whatever the weekend brings. Adsum Adsum Adsum Adsum Colin Stokesis playfully serious about his shorts. He started buying what he calls “interesting shorts” about a decade ago, and his collection now runs the sartorial gamut. Some standouts include a rare René Magritte design from Opening Ceremony, a crochet pair from the rising label Harago, and a lace-covered pair fromSimone Rocha. “I have a sort of generally maximalist aesthetic,” he says. Stokes found that as a category, shorts can make as bold a statement asthe eye-popping camp shirtsthat have denominated summer menswear over the last few years. “It’s all about going down the rabbit hole and finding the short that actually works for you.” Like some of our other panelists, Stokes isn’t limiting himself to one specific silhouette or inseam length. This summer, he mentions that he'll be avoiding the boring “middle” zone. “I would either go short or go long unless the short is doing something really special,” he says. But even Stokes, perhaps the most adventurous shorts enthusiast I spoke to, occasionally runs into a pair that not even he could crack. “I used to have a pair of leather shorts that I couldnotmake work, but I wished that I could,” he adds. A few minutes later, however, he mentions having his eyeon some furry Comme des Garçons shortsfrom a few seasons ago, proving another eternal menswear truth: the quest for perfect shorts never ends.

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Longevity Guy Bryan Johnson, Who Wants You to Have as Much Sex as Possible",
    "article_text": "Even if you don’t fancy yourself as a wellness person, you’re probably familiar with Bryan Johnson. The 47-year-old first gained fame in 2021 when he used his son as a donor for a series of plasma transfusions, one of many projects he’s undertaken in the name oflife extension. Johnson is no longer doing theplasmatransfusions, but he is tracking his (and his son’s) nighttime erections in hopes of gleaning somelongevity wisdomfrom the data. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Johnson recently sat down for a fast-paced Zoom interview about that and a number of other hot-button wellness topics. Johnson’s company, Blueprint, has a new longevity-focused protein powder designed to optimize energy, digestion, and metabolic function, but the man himself says he doesn’t particularly care what youeat for breakfast, as long as you’re intentional about it. Among other things I asked Johnson, whose health extends to hissense of humorandself-awareness, include weed, sex, and Celsius. Bryan Johnson:The misunderstanding is that getting high-quality sleep requires you to build your life around sleep. Most people have a relationship with sleep where they think if they just put their head on the pillow and tuck themselves under the covers, that somehow it’s going to happen. That’s not the case. You have to workreallyhard to sleep well. If you re-frame your identity as a professional sleeper, you take it as seriously as you would your job. That means you show up on time and treat it with a certain level of professionalism. There’s a few other habits you could do. For instance, your last meal of the day matters a lot. If your bedtime is at 10, you want to have your last meal done at least by 8, if not 7, 6, 5. Then you want to have a wind down routine where your screen is off. You’re doing some sort of journaling, breath work,meditation, or reading a book. If you perform well as an athlete, you’d have to do the same type of training to perform well as a sleeper. The way I approach these conversations is not to comment on anyone’s protocol and simply encourage them to measure. Typically, if a person has a given routine—a whole bunch of eggs, or some meat or something—they’re usually pretty convinced they’re right, and most of the time they’re not open to new ideas. The path for that is to encourage them to measure themselves. Get a blood panel, see where the various levels are, and see if you’re good or not. That’s the best way to assess the efficacy of your program. Otherwise, if you try to enter this conversation by saying what you’re doing is bad and what I’m going to suggest to you is right, no one’s going to listen. You have to let them go through a self-discovery process. That’s what I’ve been doing. I’m going through my own self-discovery process. Looking at the evidence, adopting that protocol, measuring myself, again and again and again. That way we just follow the evidence and the science. That’s what I think people would benefit from doing. A lot of people make a calculation that skipping sleep is worth it, either because of socialization or relaxation time, ordebauchery—going out drinking with friends. The first observation was that the investment in sleep is worth it. Whatever cost you pay, socially or professionally, is worth it. Youperceivethat to be a cost. It’s actually not! Two is that the concept of a cheat day is just an awful idea. Cheat days become cheat weeks and cheat weeks become cheat months and cheat months become cheat years. This idea got into the zeitgeist, and it’s just a really bad one! Three is that the bad stuff—junk food, fried food,smoking, drinking—is just not worth it. These are very basic things we all know, so it’s just reconciling [ourselves with the fact] that they’re not worth it. Photo courtesy of Bryan Johnson Yeah! I had one like three years ago. My son was like, “Dad, do you really think this is real? Are you just making this up? Can you actually eat junk food and be just as healthy?” I thought I’d give it a shot. He got me some chili cheese fries and ahot dogor hamburger or something. I ate a few bites and was like,I’m feeling sick. I could feel the sickness happening. I just can’t do it. Extra virgin olive oil. It’s not consumed in America as a staple food. I consume more extra virgin olive oil than any food source. I add it to all food. Sweet and savory, it’s just great. I’m down to 40 or so. We’ve dramatically dropped. Yes, 2.5 milligrams. I started taking that—Cialis tadalafil, and I wrote this up publicly—for longevity benefits. It has evidence of potential longevity benefits. It also has somebladder healthpromises. After that, I started my erection protocol. I started taking that, if I’m not mistaken, somewhere around June 2023. It’s really long-term—endothelial cell function and things like that. It wouldn’t be something you necessarily feel. It’s a really small dose. Erections are as powerful a biomarker as cholesterol, blood pressure, anything else you measure in your body. If you’re not having nighttime erections, you’re 70% more likely to die prematurely. It’s a really big risk factor, because nighttime erections are looking at psychological, physiological, and cardiovascular health. It’s a culmination of whether your body is functioning. For example, an average 18-year-old has something like two hours and 30 minutes [of nighttime erections.] Mine are above three hours. My body is functioning better than the average 18-year-old. Even if you say they’re boosted by Cialis, it’s a very marginal amount. Even if you say Cialis adds some benefit to that, and you subtract that out of my measurements, I’m still better than the average 18-year-old. It’s really a good biomarker showing the efficacy of what I’m doing overall. No. It has nothing to do with sexual performance. No. I think sex is tied to longevity. There’s no upper bounds, but it seems like the more you havesex, the better off you are. Cool. I wouldn’t do it. I don’t think there’slongevity benefits, and also I’ve never seen someone do it routinely that is reporting out vibrant health. It doesn’t seem like it’s a real health booster. So, just like the previous questions about what people eat for breakfast, just measure it. On those nights, look at your REM, look at your deep, look at your resting heart rate, and look at your heart rate variability. Just see how you’re doing. Look at the data. I will tell you that if your bedtime is typically 10 pm, then you go to bed at 2 am, you’re going to miss the majority of your deep sleep, which happens in that first window. Deep sleep is when the trash collector rolls through the body and collects trash. If you don’t hit that deep sleep window, trash accumulates in your body. People think if you go to bed at 2 and wake up at 11 that you somehow make up for lost sleep. You don’t. The sleep patterns are different, that’s why being on time—and consistent—is so important. Yeah. I think those things are going to make you less happy, less robust, less emotionally vibrant, and dull your senses. Not really. I have in years past, just tried it a little bit, but really no. Mmhmm. I sipped one once and thought it was crazy. I don’t. But it’s clearly an acquired taste. It’s not like it hits the tongue and you’re like, “Damn, this is beautiful.” I do a little bit of matcha. For decades, Americans were covering their bodies with more and more tattoos. Now, they’re getting them removed as fast as they can. We speak with the patients going under the laser, the tattoo-removal technicians whose business is booming, and the tattoo artists whose work is being erased to understand how something so permanent became so ephemeral. Yeah. I got this years ago before I started this endeavor. Large tattoos increase your risk of skin cancer and lymphoma by 137% and 173%, if they’re larger than the palm of your hand. Tattoos generally, about a 33% increase. But, that was a study with 2,600 Danish twins, and only 16 or so were discordant behaviors. It’s a relatively small study, so it’s suggestive, not conclusive. But yeah, tattoos with bad inks create cancer risk. There are safe inks to use. If you’re going to get a tattoo, just do it smaller than 2x2 and get a safe ink. 37. 24? You look great. The resolution is so bad. The lighting is bad. It’s very, very hard to say. I’m not afraid of death! It’s going to be just as painful as before I was born. I’m not going to know. So, I have no fear of death. I havelove for life.",

    "title": "I Went to the SSENSE Store, and All I Got Was $20,000 of Designer Menswear",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Spend enough timeshopping on the internet, and your URL bar eventually bends towards SSENSE. Since launching in the early 2000s, the Canadian e-tailer has emerged as a digital Goliath, thanks to a staggering assortment of brands both household and hard-to-find, from thecashmere kings of Solomeoto thefresh-out-of-fashion-school kids of Seoul. (For those too shy to ask, the platform’s name is pronounced “essence”—as in, “The essence of a man is measured by how many Balenciaga sweatsuits he owns.”) You’re likely familiar with the pull SSENSE’s site has on your scrolling thumb. What you might not know, though, is that SSENSE has operated a single brick-and-mortar store since 2015, not far from its Montreal corporate HQ. It’s the sole physical expression of the retailer’s expansive digital presence, and the reason I wound up at LaGuardia Airport one sunny April morning, aiming for SSENSE’s monastic flagship, a five-story triumph of chrome and concrete wrapped in a historic 19th-century facade. Over the course of six hours at the store, I ignored Montreal’s sleepy charms to hole up in a dressing room with $20,000 worth of clothes, sourced directly from SSENSE’s elite global Rolodex. Here’s what I saw. One rack, three colors, 20K. These did not stay neatly aligned for long. SSENSE’s physical store mostly functions like any other, though its purpose remains strategically downstream of the online emporium. Inventory at 418 Rue Ste-Sulpice is technically limited and rotated often, and personal appointments are encouraged. Eyeing a shirt on ssense.com? Save it to your wish list, schedule a visit, and the store’s sales team will ensure it's trucked in from a nearby warehouse and waiting in your dressing room when you arrive. The “limited” selection becomes limitless, so long as you plan ahead. Which is why, at around 1 p.m. on the day of my visit, my reserved dressing room was guarded by a formidable rack ofspring menswear, plucked from a wish list I’d compiled less than a week prior with the joy of a kid in a candy store—if that candy store stockedDries. Items that are now sold out have been replaced by similar picks. Eyeballing a suit onlineis kind of a crapshoot, but I was optimistic about Copenhagen brand Sunflower's double-breasted number, a corporate-macher standby imbued with a jolt of bad-guy sleaze. In person, it looked downright dangerous—ready to lead a shadowy crime syndicate into battle in the nextJohn Wickspin-off. Thelabelspecializes in boxy jackets and baggy jeans, but its suit looked right at home with Rier’s crisp poplin button-up and Yohji Yamamoto’s star-crossed silk tie, which dutifully prevented the whole getup from veering too far into rent-a-henchman territory.Damn, I whispered to my reflection in the mirror.I might need a catchphrase. Sunflower SSENSE Sunflower SSENSE Rier SSENSE Yohji Yamamoto SSENSE When my colleague Yang-Yi Goh noticed that Soshiotsuki—a decade-old label with limited availability outside of Japan—hadpopped up on SSENSErecently, he sent up a flare. “You certainly know what you like,” a kind-vibed SSENSE PR maven said to me with a wink, as I sheepishly rifled through a half-dozen Soshiotsuki pieces on my rack.

Which is how Ylève’s eggshell-hued coverall jacket, which I’d been ogling from across the digital ether, was waiting for me when I landed. Draped over a Taiga Takahashi sweater and Rainmaker trousers, that jacket felt like a countryside staple reimagined foraSuccessioncharacterwith immaculate taste. The mid-thigh silhouette threw me for a loop at first, but I spent enough time admiring it in front of a floor-length mirror that Googling “helipads near me” felt entirely appropriate.This is getting dangerous, a small voice in my head with access to my banking app whimpered.You’re not serious people, a much louder voice responded. YLÈVE SSENSE Taiga Takahashi SSENSE Rainmaker Kyoto SSENSE Adieu SSENSE I needed to ground myself a little. Warmer days were coming, and a guy can’t survive all those park hangsin Birkenstocks alone. So when I worked up enough moxie to shuffle out of the dressing room in Auralee’s leather flip-flops, a sawed-off vintage tee I had grabbed from my own pile of clothing on the floor, and Soshiotsuki trousers the color of a summer wheatfield, Manhattan’s prolonged cold spell felt like a personal insult. To the endless credit of the SSENSE sales associates, nobody so much as snickered when I emerged. A rule I like to apply: If you’re going bum up top—like, say, a threadbare Hawaii tee you chopped into a tank—balance out the vibe with a touch of elegance down below.

Any lingering members of the SSENSE team were possibly one more exposed toe away from reporting me to the Service de Police de le Ville de Montreal, but over six hours, everybody was so accommodating I almost started to believe I was a high roller. For my final look, I'd pulled a killer suit from Carter Young, aLondon-by-way-of-Detroit labelwith a mere handful of stockists stateside. Young himself pulls inspiration from formative years spent in the Midwest, and his broad-shouldered tailoring skews gloriously used-car-salesman. The jacket fit perfectly. If the trousers had a little more room in the thighs, I would’ve ponied up the cash and walked out wearing both. Instead, I pulled out my phone, found ’em on SSENSE, and ordered the size I needed. By the time I landed back home, they’d be halfway to my doorstep. The cost of pants I’ll wear until it’s time to finesse another trip to Montreal? Roughly $300.

    "title": "The Utah Mammoth Are Real—and Their Jerseys Are Spectacular",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. I am a simple man. I see a sports team wearing powder blue, I like that sports team. And the newly-christened Utah Mammoth—theNHLteam that, until Wednesday, was known simply as the Utah Hockey Club—are the latest example of why powder blue is the best uniform color. During the 2024-25 season, the franchise’s first in Utah (following 28 years inArizonaas the Coyotes), they wisely opted to incorporate powder blue into their color scheme. But without an actual team name to inform a logo, both the home and away jerseys simply read UTAH across the front, with no iconography. The 2024-25 Utah Hockey Club home uniform The 2024-25 Utah Hockey Club away uniform But with the team now officially going by the Mammoth—notMammoths—they were able to cook up a unique identity. The design firm Doubleday & Cartwright was tapped to create the new aesthetic, and the whole look is very strong. Photo courtesy of NHL/Utah Mammoth Utah’s new primary logo, a fierce-looking wooly mammoth with giant tusks and a mountain-shaped head, is immediately distinct. Combining imagery of Utah’s mountainous terrain with a creature that once roamed those lands makes for afun final product. There’s very little prehistoric-era representation across the four major American sports (shoutout theRaptors), and it makes sense that a team from Utah would lean into it.Mammoth fossils have been unearthed all over the state, including a complete skeleton in 1988. When the Mammoth face Nashville for the first time next season, they’ll go tusk-for-tusk with the Predators, one of the only other franchises whose moniker delves that deep into the past. Who would win in a fight? The Nashville Predator or the Utah Mammoth? Unlike the Predators and their lurid shade of yellow, though, the Mammoth color palette is much easier on the eyes. The road jersey remains mostly the same—and for good reason! Last year’s version had UTAH written diagonally across the torso, a tried-and-true hockey uniform motif. The new and improved version adds the wooly mammoth logo to both shoulders, replacing a placeholder crest commemorating Utah’s inaugural season in the NHL. The font also got an upgrade, but the color scheme—officially dubbed ‘Salt White,’ ‘Rock Black,’ and ‘Mountain Blue’—has stayed put. As for the home jersey, the Mountain Mammoth logo takes center stage. Plastered on a black sweater, the logo takes up the entire front side of the uniform, with white and baby blue stripes at the bottom providing a killer accent. Instead of overloading the top with the same logo, the shoulders of the home sweater instead feature a badge shaped like the state of Utah with ahockey stickplaced inside. With both the home blacks and the road whites, the Mammoth will wear black pants. When they’re at home, they’ll wear black socks; on the road, the socks will be white.

Mammoth, a name chosen through a 13-month fan voting process, is definitely better than Hockey Club. Per the team, there’s also some historical meaning behind it! “Evidence suggests mammoths charged in herds at speeds exceeding 25 miles per hour,” the team’s press release reads, “comparable to the speeds reached by the fastest skaters in the NHL.” The threads spawned by this name are definitely in the top half of the NHL uniform rankings, and all the secondary and tertiary logos are sharp too. It’s all very tusk-forward, which is fun. This being 2025, there’s also a team hashtag (#TUSKSUP). Prior to Utah moving from Phoenix, both of the NHL’s other newest teams—the Vegas Golden Knights andSeattle Kraken—made the playoffs in their second years of existence. (Vegas also had a postseason run—all the way to the Stanley Cup Final—in its inaugural outing.) That bodes well for the Mammoth, who, regardless of what happens in the win and loss columns, will be one of the best-dressed teams in the league. NHL Fanatics NHL Fanatics",

    "title": "11 Best Cowboy Boots in 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. You might think that cowboy boots are a privilege reserved for ranch hands and folks who can actually ride a horse. But with a little hutzpah, the best cowboy boots are just as adept on a saddle as they are on the subway. Is that so surprising? Before they blossomed into their fashionable forms, much of menswear’s most riffed on garments were rooted in function: cargo pants, work jackets, even suits. With enough time, they were adopted by civilians and adapted to their second lives as symbols of self-expression and creativity, not just job uniforms. Cowboy boots are no different. Though the exact origins are a tad fuzzy, cowboy boots are believed to come from vaqueros, or Mexican cattle herders, which itself traces back to Spain. The vaqueros would influence American cowboy culture, including their shoes which were built for horseback riding. The tall shaft kept riders’ legs safe from brush while the angled heel helped to stabilize their feet in the stirrups. Fast forward to today andcowboy style is at its peakwith morerunway showslifting inspo from the wild west than ever before. The classic move for western boots is to lean into their rougher side. Toss them on with some well-fitting jeans (preferably vintage boot cuts) and with a snap shirt. But open up your mind and step outside of the saloon and your possibilities are practically endless. A slick pair of exotic leather cowboy boots matched with a ‘70s-inspired suit screams filthy rich oil tycoon if not Alessandro Michele-era Gucci. Or why not mix up a preppy pair of chinos with a grungy graphic tee and some roughed-up suede ropers? The point is, you don’t have to pretend to be a cowboy to wear their boots (but you can). So treat them like any other pair of shoes in your closet and wear them however you want. Hell, we’d go so far as to call them an essentialpair of bootsfor every wardrobe. And if you’re having trouble, well, that’s why you’re here. We’ve wrangled together the best cowboy boots west—and east—of the Mississippi from the budget-friendly to the ostentatious and every pair in-between. Tecovas Tecovas The good folks at Tecovas are living, breathing proof that direct-to-consumer brands aren’t all operated by algorithms tasked with solving imaginary problems. The DTC upstart might be the youngest of the bootmakers on this list, but it's quickly endeared itself to budget-strapped swashbucklers with a hankering for democratically-priced kicks. Take, for example, the Cartwright, a handsome riff on a classic western silhouette made in Leon, Mexico, a bona fide cobbling capital of the world with over a century of expertise to draw on. It boasts hand-laid cording at the shaft, a resoleable Goodyear-welt construction, and a slew of colors and leathers to choose from, including genuine cowhide and goat leather. They’re not the cheapest boots on this list, but the relatively approachable price belies the craftsmanship involved. For $345, they’re one small step up from our favorite budget cowboy boots—but one giant leap in overall quality. Rhodes Huckberry You can think of roper boots as the chilled-out version of the average western boot. Originally designed for calf roping, roper boots feature a shorter shaft and a shorter, squared off heel. These details made it easier for cowboys to dismount their horse and run after the calves they roped. Coincidentally, they also make roper boots easier to walk in which is why some people prefer them over other cowboy boots for everyday wear. Our pick for the best roper boots goes to Rhodes. They’re made in León, Mexico using local premium cowhide and feature Goodyear welt construction so you can have them resoled and keep ‘em going for a long time. Plus, if you’re just dipping your toes into the cowboy boot world, the minimalist uppers forgo the decorative western stitching which makes them easier to style. Ariat Ariat Amazon If you’re after that western look but need a pair of boots that can handle the demands of a jobsite, a lot of guys will tell you to look to Ariat. That’s because they manage to blend classic cowboy style with modern-day features, and a palatable price point in perfect proportion. While they do offer a range of work boots in lace-up styles, their Groundbreaker boots are a standout with classic cowboy boot looks. They’re made of full-grain leather, include a supportive and comfortable insole, and meet ASTM standards for slip resistance and electrical safety. Because it’s among Ariat’s most popular styles, it’s also available in a wide range of colorways, toe shapes, and even steel toe versions. Some more traditional cowboys will poo-poo the fact that these aren’t made stateside, but if you’re on a budget, you’ll get more than what you pay for. Tony Lama Amazon Cowboy boots aren’t all rough-and-tumble affairs. In fact, the right pair can easily strut the red carpet or waltz into a fancy restaurant with panache. You’ll want a pair with leather that shines up well and in a darker colorway. For date nights and more formal affairs, these Tony Lamas will impress thanks to the exotic lizard skin uppers and low-key embroidery. They’re the kind of boots that can play well for the in-laws with a tailored suit or play a rock-’n’-roll star with some vintage jeans and a tight white tee. Lucchese Lucchese These days, most boot brands walk in the shadows of one brand: Lucchese. They’ve been outfitting American presidents, high-profile celebs, and the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders for decades and it’s all thanks to their commitment to high-quality craftsmanship. Though any pair of Lucchese’s would earn you more than a few approving head nods, the most coveted are the boots that they make in their Texas workshop. Using a range of full-grain leathers and exotic leathers like caiman alligator and pirarucu fish skin, each pair is crafted by master bootmakers using time-honored techniques. The Summer is a picture-perfect style featuring American calf leather uppers with intricate embellishments, welted construction, and lemonwood pegs—made the old-fashioned way, basically. They’ll cost you a pretty penny, of course, but the drip you’ll get in return is priceless. Justin Boots Amazon Even more stripped down than our favorite dressy boot, Justin’s Tobias boots feature a slick, smooth full-grain leather upper sans embroidery for the minimalist cowboys among us. And with a super durable and grippy Vibram sole, they can take a beating just as well as they can take to some shoe polish. Rhodes Huckberry For fellas whose style skews a little more regular-guy than rodeo,  we usually recommend roper boots—the cowboy boot's street-ready sibling. Thanks to its resoleable Goodyear welt and Vibram outsole, Rhodes' riff on the silhouette is one of the best bang-for-your-buck options on the market. RRL Ralph Lauren From Ralph Lauren’s western-inspired sub-label, these RRL boots meld high-end materials with old-world craftsmanship and feature American-tanned leather uppers, Goodyear-welted construction, and vintage-style rubber soles—all crafted in a multi-generational Texas bootmaking factory. Maison Margiela Nordstrom There’s no escaping the tabi boot, even in the wild west. Margiela incorporates the traditional Japanese-style tabi toe with an iconic western boot silhouette and gives it a slouchy fit, as if you needed another hint that these aren’t really for riding horses. Wythe Wythe Wythe's playing-card-inspired boots feature all the bells and whistles, including premium leather inside and out, hand-applied details, lemonwood pegs, and second-to-none construction all-around. While some brands tap the expert bootmakers in Léon, Mexico to pump out high-quality mass-appeal boots, Wythe tapped these artisans to really let them cook. Celine Homme Mr Porter Though Michael Rider's taken the reigns at Celine Homme, Hedi Slimane's indelible designs remain core to its identity and its herd of cowboy boots are a centerpiece of its universe. With a sexy sleek silhouette, luxurious calfskin uppers, and Spanish craftsmanship, these are a grail for any fashion nerd. The classic move for western boots is to lean into their rougher side. Toss them on withwell-fitting jeans(preferably vintage bootcuts) and asnap-button shirt. But open up your mind and step outside of the saloon and the possibilities are practically endless. A slick pair of exotic leather cowboy boots matched with a '70s-inspired suit screams filthy-rich oil tycoon—if notAlessandro Michele-era Gucci. Or why not mix up a preppy pair of chinos with a grungy graphic tee and some roughed-up suede ropers? The point is, you don’t have to pretend to be a cowboy to wear their boots (though you certainly can). So treat them like any other pair of shoes in your closet and wear them however you want. Hell, we’d go so far as to call them an essentialpair of bootsfor every wardrobe. Peter Middleton knows a thing or two about the lifestyle having cut his teeth at Ralph Lauren and used it as a springboard for his own western-inspired brand, Wythe. “To me the beauty and shape of the Cowboy Boot (and a lot of the original design intent) lies in its curves and that’s what makes a great boot SEXY. There isn't a lot of men's footwear that has these dramatic curves, leather, and a high heel but the right cowboy boot has them all.” He says that good cowboy boots should be made with natural leathers that age well with wear, mould to the wearer’s feet, and can be recrafted repeatedly. His non-negotiables include full leather construction from the insole to the outsole, linings, uppers, and heels. Look for Goodyear welted construction which will allow you to have the boots resoled and extend their life. The toe bug (the fancy stitching at the toe), should sit right where your foot flexes to help cover up the crease that comes with each step. Preferably, this would be corded by hand, of course. Price points will vary, and you can get some well-made boots for around $300. The really great stuff will often be twice that much. Middleton says, “the best thing to do is wait and save up until you can buy the version you actually want because its impossible to cut corners and still deliver the product you want.” So if you can be patient, save up. If you can’t, try buying secondhand. But if you simply can’t wait, you’ll do well enough with plenty of the mid-tier brands until you’re ready to upgrade. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyestaffordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you.",

    "title": "Adam Duritz Is Just Happy to Be Anywhere",
    "article_text": "Adam Duritz keeps his platinum plaques in his half-bathroom, just past the front door of his labyrinthine fifth-floor Manhattan condo. Actually, they are mostly gold records—at least one for each of the first four albums by Counting Crows, his band that, depending on your particular perspective, either helped define or destroy what was best about ’90s radio rock. There is another forAcross a Wire, the double-disc live set they recorded forMTVand VH1, and another for the soundtrack toShrek 2, which yielded what may forever be the last legitimate Counting Crows hit, “Accidentally in Love,” in 2004. Oh, and there’s a beautiful piece of painted glass from the Netherlands, commemorating a Counting Crows greatest-hits set that sold 80,000 copies there two decades ago. That was, at least so far, the final time the Crows received this sort of industry laurel. It hangs now on the back of the bathroom door, a morning-time reminder of former glory that has been dutifully offloaded. “I went for the gold ones, because I always liked the first ones I got,” Duritz tells me near the end of 10 hours of the most candid conversations I’ve ever had with someone who could be considered a rock star. “The number of sales just didn’t seem as important to me as making the record, but the gold ones meantsomeonewas listening. There may be more somewhere, but I don’t know.” Duritz sits deep in the cushions of the grey couch in his living room, whose wood floors are blanketed by an enormous rectangle of Astroturf. He moved here 20 years ago, threadbare from the celebrity lifestyle he’d built in Los Angeles and hoping to be nearby to support his longtime best friend, the actress Mary-Louise Parker, then pregnant with her first child. Robert Kahn, the New York architect they shared, agreed to convert this level of a former music-publishing magnate’s century-old headquarters into Duritz’s homeifhe finally got those plaques off his basement floor and onto a wall. “I’ll put them up,” Duritz relented, “but they have to go in the bathroom.” Even with the plaques out of sight, the rest of Duritz’s place is a sort of reliquary for a life devoted to and probably saved by music. A globe and a tambourine rest on his blonde grand piano, opposite a CD collection so massive that one of the two walls it occupies is reserved entirely for bootlegs. The coasters on the glass table between us are prints of Crows album covers, mirrored by several enormous paintings that line the entrance. There are two wall panels, salvaged from the California home the Crows turned into a studio to record 1994’sAugust and Everything After, an album that was then so ubiquitous that one of its bathroom plaques boasts seven platinum platters. There are black-and-white art prints of the band, framed tour posters, and an MTV Moonman for “Mr. Jones,” the video that made a dreadlocked white man one of rock’s most recognizable and ridiculed singers for a quarter-century. (We’ll get back to those dreadlocks soon enough.) “Our career has been really successful and really frustrating for me. We started off well and did a lot of really great work for 10 years that got swept under the rug,” Duritz says, sighing and pushing his hands through light brown, dread-free hair that stops just above the collar of his Badfinger T-shirt. “I’m really bitter about how people treated us, how people disregarded the music and wrote about me as a celebrity. But most of my friends, at one point or another, broke up their bands. We’re still here.” Duritz is incontrovertibly correct. Very few bands have ridden a rock ’n’ roll roller coaster so extreme and then withstood the ride for three decades, especially with so few membership changes and such an unwavering focus—to make emotionally epic American rock ’n’ roll.August and Everything Afterinspired an inevitable and unrelenting backlash. The week Kurt Cobain died in a Seattle greenhouse, the seemingly sunny “Mr. Jones” sat at No. 2 on the MTV charts, just behind “Gin and Juice.” In the wake of Cobain’s death, Duritz became and remained a popular punching bag, the earnest roots-rock revanchist seeming to lead the retreat from grunge’s irony and edge. A string of celebrity flings made him a ready target for why-that-guy jealousy. Their second and best album—Recovering the Satellites, a riot of spring-loaded riffs and soft ballads—sold only two million copies, the equivalent of a college basketball team winning the national championship one year and struggling to make the second round the next. Yes, there were other hits, including one thatThe Village Voice, headquartered 400 feet from Duritz’s current front door,vilified as the worst song of the ’00sin a hyperbolic 2009 blog post. Counting Crows were considered a potentiallygreatband for, at a very generous maximum, seven years; ever since, they’ve seemed to just be hanging around. And yet: Their forthcoming eighth album, curiously entitledButter Miracle, The Complete Sweets!, is not only their best work since 1999 but also a smart and sophisticated rock record by most any standard. The Crows’ longtime hallmarks are here—loving references to Mid-American cities, sepia-toned American optimism, a singer who moves with an urgency that makes it clear he both needs and means every word. But there’s something new for Duritz here, too: happiness. At 60, he is in year eight of the longest relationship of his life, the sort of partnership he forever believed was impossible. His lifelong struggles with mental health—long hidden and understated due to an admixture of shame and the fear that it could overrun everything he’d built—also finally seem manageable. We’ll get back to all that, too. When I began telling friends, especially musicians, that I was profiling Adam Duritz, I expected chuckles and suspect questions. Instead, a stylish singer-songwriter sent awkward teenage photos of herself at a Crows gig in Bryant Park. The young owner of a legendary studio told me how starstruck he was the first time Duritz visited his place. A pal in a popular shoegaze band told me he had started listening to the band only recently but that he loved it, that he too wanted to write with that much feeling. He wanted me to send Duritz his record, so I did. Indeed, in the span of six weeks starting late last year,MJ Lenderman,Karly Hartzman, andGracie Abrams(alongside super-producer Aaron Dessner) each covered “A Long December” live. For decades, Duritz has been a sentimental and stylistic touchstone in emo and metalcore; Dashboard Confessional’sChris Carrabbatold me he kept his Counting Crows adoration a secret until he learned so many of his peers shared it. “I wasn’t drawn to any of the genre bullshit. I didn’t make the distinction between indie rock and ’90s alt-rock, because there wasn’t any social currency in it,”Gang of Youthssinger David Le’aupepe says. Being Polynesian in Australia, he had little reference for what was hip in the States, anyway. “Counting Crows just sounded fucking cool.” The us-versus-them, Cobain-versus-Duritz claptrap has eroded, it seems, leaving only a lot of very good songs. “Of the people that come up to me, as many want to talk to me about Counting Crows andAugust and Everything Afteras they doNevermindand Nirvana,” admits Gary Gersh, the A&R executive who helped make stars of both bands when he signed them to Geffen Records. He even facilitated a budding friendship between Cobain and Duritz. “That record changeda lotof people.” I am, of course, one of those people—a rural teen when the Crows hit their peak of popularity, my sense of scale and scope in music permanently shaped by, say, the panoramic yearning of “Round Here” or the agile anxiety of “Angels of the Silences.” Duritz wrote not about the light at the end of a very long tunnel but instead about the glittering vision he expected to find waiting for him there. It felt irresistible. I can trace the lines from my adolescent enthusiasm for Duritz’s band to my subsequent love of The Hold Steady or Nick Cave, The National or even Joanna Newsom, even if I cynically denied the foundation for a long time. When I tell Duritz about how many friends of mine were excited about me visiting his home, he stops talking for the first time in a long time. He wipes his eyes twice, stares out of the big windows that being a rock star bought him, and then smiles. “Look, I don’t know if we’ll ever be a big band—areallybig band—again, make any sort of comeback,” he says in a sudden rush. “But every time we make a record, I think we will, because I’msoproud of them.” I ask if it matters to him—being famous, riding a rollercoaster so cruel it could have killed him, for a second time. “Fuck yeah, and I’ve got good reasons for it, too. For one, fuck all those people,” he says of three decades of critics and naysayers. We both laugh, but the real reason? Maybe for the first time in his life, he’s feeling OK. The Duritz family arrived in Berkeley the week that Adam turned 10. He was more than ready to stay put. His parents had met in Baltimore, where his father was in medical school and his mom was working on a liberal arts degree. Duritz was born there in 1964 but soon moved to Boston, where his dad began his medical residency. But the Vietnam War was raging, so his dad reluctantly enlisted in the U.S. Army, dragging the family to a base in El Paso when Duritz was five. “I talked really early, and I probably sounded like a cartoon character in Boston,” Duritz remembers, dropping into his best Boston brogue. “That was not cool in West Texas, and I was so determined to befromTexas, to not get the shit kicked out of me. I don’t drawl much anymore, but if I’m drunk, I do.” The Duritz family bounced between Colorado and Texas for the next five years, but Duritz mostly remembers hot, lonely trips through the Southwestern deserts. East Coast liberals living in a seemingly exotic environment, his parents loved indigenous American art and spent summers and weekends driving to reservations to admire and buy it. “Maybe my dad was not meant to be a cowboy,” he grins, “and so he was more interested in ‘Indians.’ We didn’t have much money, but it didn’t cost much money back then.’” Duritz was too young to understand the oppression that led to poverty on reservations, but he certainly felt it. In the backseat of a station wagon, he pined for an ICEE but mostly escaped into books. He read 170 of them in first grade, 218 in second. He loved comics and theater and music, obsessed with his parents’ James Taylor and Fifth Dimension records. At a Texas rodeo, The Jackson 5—“long legs, wearing suede, fringe jackets, a live wire”—electrified him. As a shy kid who’d lived in five major cities by the time he was nine, steady friends and stability eluded him, but art proved dependable. “I loved Edgar Rice Burroughs and went to Mars reading his books,” Duritz says. “All those things were escapes. It all had to do with feeling like there was a gap between me and everybody else.” In the Bay, though, he finally began to find his place back on Earth, especially alongside a group of smart kids who dreamt of living like outlaws. They got really good at finding drugs—mostly pot, maybe some shrooms and coke—and Duritz got pretty popular, too, even becoming class president his sophomore year. Then, though, his mom said it was time to go again, this time to Mexico. She’d always loved science and wanted to attend medical school, but she was also an older mother. In spite of her outstanding test scores, no American school accepted her. She had, however, been accepted in Guadalajara. Duritz had passed some tough years with his mom, as she struggled with the hope of being more than a married mom amid feminism’s second wave while he struggled to stake out an identity. The house subscribed toMs., and his dad often told his only son why feminism mattered. But Duritz fretted over the new rift it was creating in his life. He not only refused to go to Mexico but decided to one-up his parents by shipping across the country to The Taft School, in Connecticut. “It was a big rejection of everything—‘If you’re leaving, I’m leaving, too. You can’t leave me, because I’m leaving you,’” he says. “I’m going to start becoming a grown-up right now.” On the plane ride from the West Coast to the East, he readCatcher in the Ryeand was shocked to see that the romantic notion he’d had of boarding school—“like summer camp with books”—did not comport with Holden Caulfield’s experience. Still, the night before he arrived at Taft, he told his dad just how many drugs he’d been doing, as if cleaving his future from his childhood with a final cut. Duritz hoped to go to Harvard and become a lawyer or writer—anything that indulged his burgeoning interest in rhetoric. Taft quickly dispelled that notion. The schoolwork was brutal, and making friends was only slightly better. (Phish’s Trey Anastasio, by the way, was briefly a classmate.) Worst of all, Duritz began to feel like he was losing his grip on reality. He would look in mirrors and not recognize himself, as if he were a spectator in someone else’s life. His emotions became volatile. That gap he’d long felt between himself and the world had become a gulf. Over Christmas break during that first year, he watched Robert Redford’sOrdinary Peoplein a theater with his father. In the film, a suburban family of four has already lost one son, while the other navigates PTSD, suicide attempts, and stints in a psychiatric hospital. It was like Duritz suddenly saw himself in that mirror. “I remember sliding down off the chair and onto the floor in the movie theater and thinking, ‘I am in alotof trouble,’” he says with a deep groan. Back at Taft, he started therapy with some shame, but things got worse. His music teacher and adviser had dropped him as Duritz’ emotional distress grew. He eventually gave Duritz an F in Music Theory, prompting a letter that suggested he not return for the year’s fourth quarter. He went back to his old Berkeley school, back to his old Berkeley ways. Duritz enrolled in the University of California–Davis, his Ivy League ambitions ruptured by his aborted boarding-school year. He didn’t know what he wanted to do, but his childhood escapist passions remained—music, reading, theater. During his first semester, he obsessed over R.E.M.’s first EP,Chronic Town, and Carolyn Forché’s second book of poetry,The Country Between Us. One day in class, he scribbled a poem for his sister, struggling with her own realities of being an American teenager, in his chemistry notebook. He knew enough about theory to know the difference between major and minor chords. He returned to his dorm, sat at the piano in its lounge, and put words to music for the first time. He called it “Good Morning, Little Sister.” “When you’re young, the one thing you aren’t is defined,” Duritz tells me. “When you leave high school, the big job is figuring out how to become an adult. How are you going to make yourself into a person? But I wrote a song, and I was a songwriter. That was done. I was way ahead of everybody else all of a sudden. I knew what I was going to be for the rest of my life.” David Immerglück needed to relax. It was January 12, 1993, the day the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame was set to induct a very elite class, including Cream, Creedence, The Doors, Etta James, and Sly & the Family Stone. One inductee, Van Morrison, had decided not to show, meaning someone would need to perform one of his songs. The Band’s Robbie Robertson knew just the crew, even if they hadn’t finished their first record: Counting Crows. The request came on a Sunday. On that Monday morning, Duritz’s father picked up his son’s band, stopped at a Tower Records so they could buy a bunch of Morrison CDs, and drove them to the airport to catch a flight to rehearsals in Burbank. What they saw there was surreal: Bruce Springsteen, palling around with drumming great Jim Keltner. Eddie Vedder singing“Roadhouse Blues”with the remaining Doors. When the famously cantankerous Ginger Baker arrived, the entire hall was cleared so he could play with Cream for the first time in a quarter-century in privacy. At soundcheck the next day, Immerglück’s mandolin wobbled badly out of tune. As he wrestled with his strings, he looked into the empty house to see Eric Clapton watching him, pointing and whispering. He escaped upstairs, found an electric guitar in a dressing room, and began self-soothing by playing a soft, spectral drone. “That’s one of the great things about the guitar, that it can be medicinal,” Immerglück remembers. “I’m calming myself down—‘This is gonna be great, this is gonna be fun.’ I hear this noise, and I look up. It’s Eric Fucking Clapton, again. How long has he been checking me out? He just gave me this nod, then disappeared.” But itwasmostly fine. Duritz signed his first-ever autograph that day, for George Clinton. Helocked into Morrison’s “Caravan”so deeply that he got a little lost coming off stage, a budding professional blinded by several minutes in very bright spotlights. With his hands in his pockets, he tripped. “Right now,” he thought, “I’m going to break my fucking face during the greatest moment of my life.” Instead his face came to rest between the breasts of Etta James, sitting side-stage as she awaited her own honors. “And she says, ‘Are you alright? You suresanggreat,’” Duritz says, quaking with laughter. “It was one insane thing after another happening to me, and I thought it wouldneverstop being insane.” The Rock Hall scenario epitomized the suspicion and whispers that shrouded the Crows: How had a band without a record gottenthatgig? If the phrase “industry plant” had existed back then, it surely would have hounded them. Only a year earlier, after all, the Crows had been just another Bay Area band with an overly long demo. But that tape landed in the cassette deck of Gersh’s rental car during a vacation with his wife, Maria. “We couldn’t stop listening, and we both fell in love with it,” says Gersh. “We both went to San Francisco and met them. The songs weresoamazing.” Nevermindhad just upended the music industry, so Gersh’s enthusiasm was essentially a blank check. A rapid-fire bidding war ensued, with Gersh and Geffen winning. They enlisted T-Bone Burnett, a producer whose own astounding CV—Elvis Costello, Roy Orbison, stints with Bob Dylan—amplified the feeling that the big time had come too quickly. So many music moguls seemed invested in their future that their hometown press dubbed and snubbed them as “Accounting Crows,” a very good pun that ignored what was obvious: No matter how new Counting Crows were as a band, its members, including Duritz, had done their time as local grunts. To wit, Immerglück, a Berkeley native, had been playing in bands there since he was 12, resigned to a fate, as he puts it, “of working with a bunch of other arrested development guys for the rest of my life.” After a European sojourn in the mid-’80s, he returned to the Bay to hear hubbub about a new band, Mod-L Society, with a striking singer. Immerglück stopped by a church that could be rented for shows to listen for himself. He didn’t love the music, but he instantly recognized the vocalist’s rare conviction. At a house party later that night, Immerglück raved about Miles Davis while the singer praised Springsteen. “So a week later, there’s a knock at my door at 11:30 in the morning, and it’s Adam. He’s got this pile of Bruce Springsteen records he just boughtfor me, every Springsteen record: ‘Listen to these,’” Immerglück tells me, laughing. “I was not a convert, but I stopped being so passionately aggro against it. But I knew I loved this guy, Adam. He was one ofmyguys.” They became fast friends, Immerglück often sitting in with Mod-L Society. That’s how Mary-Louise Parker first encountered Duritz, too. She remembers a small bar, a few dozen people sitting at tables with buckets of popcorn, playing cards and paying very little attention to what was happening onstage. But Duritz delivered Billy Preston’s“Will It Go Round in Circles” with absolute abandon, then sat on the corner of the stage for“Feline,”a very deep Bobby McFerrin cut she happened to love. “It was like being hit by a wave, that strong,” she remembers. “I knew there was no way this person wasn’t going to take that as far as they conceivably can.” Maybe Duritz sensed the same? Despite a skosh of local momentum, Mod-L’s bassist, Marty Jones, says the band began to stagnate. When he told Duritz he was leaving, the singer didn’t argue: “I’m there, too,” Duritz told Jones. “If that’s what you wanna do, I’m ready to let go.” Duritz took a break from bands, decamping to Europe and keeping in touch via the occasional postcard in his cramped script. He told Jones about being on a Greek beach with an Australian beauty named Anna, massaging her shoulders. (Yes,that“Anna.”) Duritz also said he was ready to try again. Jones was already in a new band back home, and they happened to be looking for a lead singer. When Duritz returned, Jones insisted they let him try out, though the rest of the band worried he was too committed to folk-rock. The tryout was another of those Duritz epiphanies, just like Immerglück and Parker had experienced. “He was just making shit up, but it sounded like a song,” Jones remembers. “He has that gift—a good writer and melody maker. It felt magical.” Duritz had just entered the second half of his 20s, inching toward an arbitrary deadline he’d set for himself to make something happen with music by 30 or do something else. One night, he and Jones went to a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco’s Mission District. Jones’ father, the flamenco guitaristDavid Serva, was playing. He’d split for Spain when Jones was 11, complicating the kid’s relationship not only with his father but with the idea of making music a career. But Duritz didn’t have those hangups, evidenced by the song he soon wrote about the night’s after-party at a bar called New Amsterdam, an evening supercharged with sexual tension and career ambition. Duritz brought the song to practice. It was named for the bassist and old friend who had invited Duritz to join this project in the first place—“Mr. Jones,” of course. “Adam didn’t have a fallback plan. He was all in and getting good feedback. ‘How far is this thing going? Who knows?’” Mister Jones, now 64, tells me on a Sunday afternoon during one of the only interviews he’s given about a moment he rarely even mentions to his friends. “He would get ahead of himself with it, and I would dampen that. Let’s stay grounded and letthemdecide if it was great.” That band never got around to recording “Mr. Jones.” Duritz was already moving on—with Himalayans, and with another new band, an acoustic duo he’d started with a local guitarist named Dave Bryson. They would record “Mr. Jones.” Thinking of an old nursery rhyme about magpies, Duritz named the band Counting Crows. No musician had ever asked Patti Galluzzi to stop playing their video on MTV before. By the summer of 1994, Galluzzi had been at MTV for six years, rising to the position of senior vice president of music and talent—meaning, essentially, she decided which videos aired and which faded into oblivion.August and Everything Afterfirst felt like it would do the latter. Released in September 1993, there was no single until Geffen finally issued “Mr. Jones” in December. (They wanted to release the album’s finale, “A Murder of One,” because of what Duritz calls “that Jesus Jones beat,” but he refused to make a radio edit of the nearly six-minute-long track.) No one thought “Mr. Jones” was a hit. But in the first week of 1994, Galluzzi plopped the clip into MTV’s star-making Buzz Bin. By month’s end, it was the fifteenth most popular video on MTV. By the start of April, only “Gin and Juice” beat it. The real Mister Jones had told Duritz to let people decide if his songs were good, and the verdict on this Van Morrison-like version of their night together at New Amsterdam was an emphatic yes. In mid-May, Duritz and the rest of the Crows stood beaming behind their first Platinum plaques inBillboard, beneath the headline “Something to Crow About.” (No, that plaque isn’t in Duritz’ bathroom, but its Gold predecessor is.) For Duritz, that might have been the top of fame’s roller coaster, just before the plunge began. “They were playing in town, not too far from our offices, and we were psyched to meet them. We went to soundcheck, and their manager introduced me,” Galluzzi remembers of a show Duritz insists was the first date of a three-night stand at the Beacon Theatre, July 1994. “And he says, ‘Oh my god, are you the person I can talk to to stop playing our video so god damn much? I can’t walk down the street anymore. It’s really messing me up.’” Duritz’s handler dismissed it as a joke, but it barely was. And “ourvideo” was a stretch. The other Crows looked like extras in the clip, like Any Band, U.S.A., but Duritz was unmistakable—a mess of brown shoulder-length dreadlocks to match his brown fringe jacket, big, pale-blue puppy-dog eyes. He’d been onSaturday Night Liveand was about to share the cover ofRolling Stonewith his band before opening eight shows for the actual Stones. He was unmistakable, but, at 29, he wasn’t ready. The song about how everyone will love the rock star had backfired. “I wanted to be a rock star, because I wanted to do this with my life,” Duritz says slowly, staring at me with those same puppy-dog eyes but without the dreads. “But I didn’t know what that was going to be. It’s just scary to have everybody looking at you.” He had, as he puts it, issues. A decade earlier, during the final days of his first year at UC–Davis, Duritz had almost broken his brain. At a party one night, he confessed a crush to a woman, who felt the same, but she had a boyfriend. Correctly recognizing that Duritz was in danger of spending all summer moping, his roommate suggested they drop acid the next morning, a first for Duritz. It was a hellish 14-hour trip, andeverytime he did any hard drug after that, he was right back inside of it. When he finally decided to quit drugs altogether two years later, after he’d transferred to Berkeley, his brain seemed to revolt. (He drinks, but, otherwise, he has smoked pot just once in the last 40 years.) For a year and a half, he says, he was stuck in a severe acid flashback, waking up every day at 5:30 to more warped shapes. He moved in with his dad. Friends would come over, essentially to babysit him. He learned to steady his breath, to stave off concomitant panic attacks. Doctors put him on an extreme regimen of pills. “I was 21 and 22, and I thought that was the end of my life,” he says, sighing. “Friends would take me places, because I couldn’t be alone. I remember going to a couple of Cal basketball games and my friends sitting with me, because the crowd freaked me out so bad.” Forty years later, he still feels that way sometimes. The experience amplified the symptoms of the dissociative disorder that had set in at Taft; in 1994, sudden fame certainly didn’t help. He had been a boy who didn’t recognize himself in a mirror, and now he was dealing with the world’s perceptions of him. Gersh remembers sitting with Duritz at a red light one day, alongside the convertible of a just-married couple. When the bride recognized Duritz, she rushed out of the car in a wedding dress and demanded a photo. That was funny, at least. Parker recalls being lost in conversation with Duritz during a drive down Hollywood Boulevard around the same time when two dudes pulled up alongside them. They yelled “Counting Crows suck,” burst into laughter, and sped off. “If I had a nickel for every time someone has said ‘You can’t take that seriously,’” says Parker, trailing off. “But you cannot understand that until you’ve had complete strangers slap you out of nowhere. It cancels out so much.” Duritz admits he did very little to ameliorate the problems, whether it was too much attention or people’s view of him. He developed a reputation for being precious and stubborn about his work, as with that vetoed edit for “A Murder of One.” In January 1994, just as the band began to climb the charts, he quarreled withSaturday Night Liveproducers about the order of songs they played. Sure, “Mr. Jones” was becoming the hit, but he rightly believed “Round Here” was the statement that needed to go first. They said no. “What difference does it make to you? You have a million bands, a million shows,” he remembers saying. “This is the biggest day of our lives.” When he heard a staff member mocking him around a corner, he knew he was reaching a level of celebrity where his feelings about his own work mattered less than industry demands. (They played “Round Here” first.) He subsequently refused to perform onTop of the Pops, because he’d be required to lip-sync while his band pretended to play. “I was so worried about being fake,” he says. “You don’t know whether these things are right or wrong. You’re just trying to keep some credibility in your head.” Of course, the prevailing image of Duritz—the blessing and curse that made him so recognizable—was his hair. Sometime in 1993, just before Counting Crows hit the road to support the debut that would become gargantuan, he spotted the extensions somewhere and simply liked the idea. He headed for a salon. “I remember walking down the street, looking in this art gallery’s big picture window, and seeing my reflection. I felt unfettered and free,” he says, laughing when he realizes he’s almost quoted theJoni Mitchell standardabout the guy who founded his record company, David Geffen. “It finally felt like I got the right haircut. It was the first time in my life I looked like how I felt inside, like the time I wrote my first song.” For the rest of his life, he would be known as the white Counting Crows singer with dreadlocks. His own hair soon grew into dreads as well, and he would alternate between stints with and without extensions. (When I ask him if the dreads were ever a full-on wig, as has been alleged, he winces; no.) I wonder aloud if he realized the irony of being the guy who was terrified of the fame he found but also had one of music’ most polarizing and recognizable looks. Like, did he ever consider just cutting them out? “I felt like I was finally not hiding behind stuff, like maybe that was the mask I needed to wear to be myself,” he says. He mentions the unguarded person he sees if he watches footage ofSaturday Night Live, because he had finally found himself. “I’m not un-self-conscious for much longer. But the hair just felt like this expression of me that I had been waiting to be there all along.” By January of 1995, a year after “Mr. Jones” entered the Buzz Bin, Berkeley was breaking Duritz. The Crows had mostly lived on the road since the album’s fall 1993 release, rising from the band that opened for Cracker to the band for which Cracker opened to one of the most ubiquitous rock bands in the entire world. Duritz had a nervous breakdown on tour, but they kept at it, anyway. Dan Vickrey, the guitarist who had enlisted just after they’d recordedAugust, wondered if that perpetual tour would also be the end. “I remember thinking if it was better to have gotten to the peak and know what it was like than to have never gotten there,” Vickrey tells me, “with the idea that this would be our one and only record.” Berkeley proved no easier for Duritz than the road. He’d walk down the street of his hometown and be hounded, mostly by supporters but also by occasional strangers who wanted him to know he sucked. The juxtapositions with the late Cobain stung, too—through Gersh, they’d become loose friends, sharing meals and hanging out backstage in San Francisco. And when fans figured out where he and Vickrey lived, they began camping on his lawn, making it almost impossible to even gettothe street. That was when Johnny Depp and Sal Jenco, who had opened The Viper Room in Los Angeles a month beforeAugustwas released, called to tell him about the 21stbirthday party they were throwing for supermodel Kate Moss. They could hear his stress. They had a hotel room for him and demanded he bail on Berkeley, at least for the party but maybe longer. “I had never been to anything like that—Tom Petty was there, Billy Gibbons, maybe Allen Ginsberg,” he says, delighted by the memory. “These were fucking fascinating people, and I was talking to them. They were talkingto me.” Duritz remained in Los Angeles for the next nine years, and The Viper Room became his de facto second home. It was a place where he could feel comfortable, because nearly everyone was more famous than he was. He sat and watched Adam Ant talk to Wiliam Burroughs while he ate Mexican food. Gibby Haynes taught him to grill ribs using Dr. Pepper as a marinade. When Charlie Gillingham, the Crows’ keyboardist, called to ask if they should work on songs soon, Duritz told him he wasn’t in a band, at least for the next few months. “I loved Berkeley, and then it was just impossible,” he admits. “That place saved me.” One day, a bartender friend at The Viper Room, Shannon, asked him to watch the register while she had a smoke outside. After that he began working there sporadically, urging the elite crowd to cough up bigger tips for his coworkers. Mostly, though, he was delighted to talk to such cool people without having to introduce himself. “It was what I imagined the Left Bank must have been in the ’20s, with Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Picasso,” says Duritz, the former Berkeley English major who wrote his college thesis on the astounding avant-garde poetHilda “H.D.” Doolittle, of the conversations he witnessed. “I was getting chased all over Berkeley, but who gives a fuck about me when Jack Nicholson is walking down the street?” He might have overestimated his anonymity. As he began to work on new songs, the band would sometimes play the Viper under pseudonyms. One night, while the first season ofFriendswas airing, Jennifer Aniston came to listen. Their pals conspired, telling each of them that the other had an enormous crush. Their short-lived relationship became tabloid fodder, affirming some popular sentiment that he made music only for money and glory. “There is nothing more flattering than someone who likes you. I thought, ‘I am popular now, not the geek I was,’” he says. “You get lambasted for selling out for just dating a girl. I have nothing but regrets about it, but I think that’s unfair to say, because it’s not her fault.” But then, well, he did it again. He’d met Courtney Cox, of course, through Aniston, herFriendsco-star. While the band was working on its second album, Cox’s roommate and Duritz’s friend got hit by a car. He was recording at night, so he’d go sit with her in a hospital room until the mid-afternoon. Cox would join him bedside, and they fell into a romance that was barely better than the circumstances of its start, maybe worse. “It wasn’t the best relationship, at all,” he tells me, frowning. “We were both deep in our own troubles.” (Cox’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment.) At least one absolutely perfect thing, though, emerged from that fractious spell: “A Long December.” One night, amid his days of hospital stays, Duritz left the Viper Room late and headed to a friend’s house until four in the morning, eventually driving to his place in Laurel Canyon and heading straight for the piano. By the time the sun appeared, he had written what has become a cross-generational hymn, the last two exhausting years escaping him through one glorious exhalation. He slept for a few hours, drove to the Geffen offices, and played it for Tony Berg, the band’s new rep there. Berg told him no one wanted to hear “Hollywood” sung that many times, but the band cut it that night anyway, in seven takes and with almost no overdubs. Then Duritz drove to The Viper Room and, after closing, made friends and coworkers sit in his red 1971 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia convertible and listen to the track. “It’s the most perfect song I ever wrote, the only one I never get tired of,” he says. “The moment I wrote it is just crystalline to me somehow.” “A Long December” is a contemplative exception on a record that drastically rewrote the rules of what Counting Crows were supposed to sound like. Duritz recruited Gil Norton to helmRecovering the Satellites, because he loved the three records he’d made with the Pixies and the way he seemed to solicit such feeling on tape. (We agree that aSteve Albini/Counting Crows collaboration would have been disastrous) He also told Vickrey to cut loose, to play guitar like this wasn’t some folk-rock record. “Adam leaned on me during theAugusttour, because, if you’re a singer, you’re so exposed. When you have a foil, there’s a minute you don’t have to bethatguy,” remembers Vickrey. “Going into the studio, I knew that was my job, and I got to do things on that record I haven’t done before or since.” Recovering the Satellitesis indeed a righteous guitar rock record, led by the screaming old Telecaster that Vickrey bought after obsessing over Keith Richards’ collection during that stint with the Stones. “Angels of the Silences” is maybe a half-step away from thrash metal, while “Have You Seen Me Lately?” galvanizes any vestigial touches of Van Morrison in self-doubt and electricity. “These days, I feel like I’m fading away/Like sometimes, when I hear myself on the radio,” Duritz roars during that second song, as if fighting the very ideas of himself that fame had fostered. He was stoked about whatSatellitessaid about the band’s possibilities. “Everybody wanted us to make anotherAugust and Everything After. The label said, ‘Why don’t you make another record with T-Bone?’” Duritz remembers. “But we didn’t give a shit, and I was so excited about it, honestly. It wasn’t a retro record.” He was stunned, then, to read his own reviews, as whenEntertainment Weeklyagain brought up the usual reference points—The Band, Bob Dylan, and, somehow, Bruce Hornsby.MOJOasked a lot about Cox (“This is not a fun situation,” he said of the relationship and, just maybe, the interview, too), andThe New York Timestrotted out his list of fucks and friends like it wasRolling Stones’ gossip-laden “Random Notes” column. That piece’s headline seemed to sum up the prevailing critical sentiment concerning the dreadlocked white man who had dated one-third of the cast ofFriends:“When Fame Glows Bright, It’s Hard to Be Tortured.”Duritz still resents these conclusions. “To me, I’d gone through all this stuff with fame and written this really good record about it,” he says in a rush. “And people were angry at me for writing a record about being famous and complaining. What are you complaining about the plot for? The plot is the plot, and it has nothing to do with the art.” In truth, he admits, he just wasn’t ready to talk about the way he was really feeling. “‘You’re fucking all these women, so what are you so bummed about?’” he says. “Well, I’m suffering with serious mental illness, and I’m trying to cope with it while I’m doing all this other stuff. That’s what these songs areactuallyabout.” The day Duritz checked himself into UCLA Medical Center, Mariah Carey was on her way out. Starting in the summer of 2001, Carey had spent time in a series of treatment centers on both coasts. There had been court orders, rambling online missives, and some suggestions that she had tried to harm herself. Duritz saw the headlines—“Mariah’s Meltdown,” went theLos Angeles Times’ alliterative bid for attention—and thought he’d done the right thing by mostly keeping quiet about his own lifetime of mental illness. “They roasted her for being ‘a fucking crazy chick.’ I realized that you couldn’t talk about this stuff until you’re not going to make a public clown of yourself,” he says. “It’s not that people are bad, but we have a mob mentality.” Still, Duritz needed help. His love life had become a miserable series of dead ends, and he was beginning to accept the notion that a sustainable partnership just may not be possible for him. “A lot of these problems in my head made relationships difficult. I would intellectually still know someone, but I would lose all my feeling for them,” he says. “I just had these shutdowns. It must have been so painful to be with me.\" What’s more,This Desert Life, the 1999 album that tried to recapture some of the pastoral pep ofAugust, received another critical drubbing, and barely broke the one-million mark despite the seeming ubiquity of its single, “Hanginaround.” When he started cutting himself, he knew he was in danger. “I just didn’t have a handle on it at all,” he says. “I was circling the drain.” When he too left UCLA, he was at least ready to work. The Crows had recruited Steve Lillywhite to produce their fourth album, and Duritz surprised the veteran by talking so specifically about the Lillywhite albums he loved, from Travis to U2 to XTC. They converted another house in the Hollywood Hills into another studio and made a shimmering summertime record,Hard Candy, from the radiant Byrds guitars of the opening title track to the late-night haze of “Miami.” Lillywhite now says he should have demanded the band write a better riff for the first single, “American Girls,” but it was still a winning example of Duritz’ stubborn romanticism, and his belief in the possibility of infatuation.Hard Candywas wistful and mature, exactly the sort of record a songwriter nearing 40 should have made. And then, it accidentally and infamously backfired. Thanks to a scheduling snafu, half the band skipped a weekend recording session, meaning only Duritz, Immerglück, Vickrey, and the rhythm section of Matt Malley and Ben Mize were around. They cut a handful of covers for pure fun—an arcing and aching take on Sparklehorse’s“Someday I Will Treat You Good”and a reverent and simple rendition of Joni Mitchell’s “Big Yellow Taxi.\" Mitchell was makingTravelogueat Ocean Way Recording as the band mixed their take, so Duritz endured her listening to his cover in front of him; she returned the favor by walking him down the hall to hearTravelogue—“still one of my favorite records ever made,” he says. Duritz had long been interested in working with hip-hop producers to do something interesting with old songs. They’d scrapped a UK garage version of “Hanginaround,” but he wondered if he might do something with this “Big Yellow Taxi” cover instead. “I love hip-hop and funk and all this music I don’t necessarily play,” he says, sitting feet from rows of records that offer the receipts. “I wanted to collaborate with these different artists from these different words.” But after false starts with both Pharrell Williams and Jimmy Jam, they let Ron Fair—a record-label executive who also boasted a background in engineering—try adding a beat of his own. He had just finished cutting the debut of a young singer-songwriter named Vanessa Carlton, so he suggested she sing harmonies. It didn’t comport with Duritz’ vision, but he thought it was fine, so long as it wasn’t the single. But when it was picked up for the soundtrack of a Sandra Bullock rom-com, it became not just a single but by far the album’s biggest hit, even though it was a hidden track. “Doing cover songs to get a hit,” says Lillywhite, “is a bit like building a house on sand. You’re not putting down a good foundation for the rest of your career.” Though Duritz and the Crows hadn’t intended it to be a hit, they still treated it like a new coronation—at last doingTop of the Pops(and singing and playing it all), releasinga half-dozen different physical versions, and making amusic videothat felt like its own rom-com. It was, at least for me, the moment where I took my leave of Counting Crows, a band that seemed to have traded in music about believing in possibility for a Top 40 bauble that did nothing new. “That song was a fucking huge hit in an annoying fashion. It seemed like we’d changed completely who we were to have a pop hit,” Duritz says, voice raised slightly, albeit through a smile. “It was so ripe for the picking for everything everybody was getting ready to hate about us or already did. But it doesn’t represent us because it’snotus.” If the smash suggested a victory lap, though, Duritz’s private life did not. In 2003, he finally decided to leave California for New York. Parker had been starring on Broadway, so he was visiting often, anyway, palling around the city to see theater with her and her boyfriend, the actor Billy Crudup. When the pair told him they were expecting, he looked forward to having a little New York family. But Crudup left Parker two months before their son was born. The day after a December 2003 performance onGood Morning America,Duritz moved within a minute’s sprint of her, should she need him. “What she went through was hell. It’s very hard to get over someone when their child is growing in your belly, and I was worried,” Duritz tells me. “And I thought moving to New York was going to be great for me—and it was, but not in the way I thought. With Billy gone and her a new mom, so much had changed.” Just four months later, he stepped off stage and got to his Perth hotel room only to receive two devastating phone calls—his mother’s mother was dead, and his girlfriend was leaving him. Punch-drunk, he scrapped the shows and flew from Adelaide to Sydney to Tokyo to Baltimore, arriving at the funeral 10 minutes before it started. Road dogs for a decade, the Crows limited their dates for the next four years. Duritz rode an extreme rollercoaster of prescriptions, trying to find the cocktail that made reality make a little more sense. Though he was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was prescribed pills for it—essentially, extreme mental guardrails. There was Valium and then brutal Valium withdrawals and another prescription that forced him to chew 20 powdery orange-flavored pills at one time, because the child’s formulation proved more effective than the adult’s. It made him look like he had a fun case of rabies. Each new drug came with its own set of side effects, from lethargy and weight gain to a case of anomia that cost him his vocabulary. All bad, of course, for a verbose songwriter and kinetic performer, let alone a human trying to enjoy life. By the time the band reconvened in the summer of 2006 to record the first half of 2008’sSaturday Nights & Sunday Mornings, he saw the album as his exit. He’d tried to shield the band from his mental illness for a dozen years, but he was losing that battle now, too. “I was at the end of my rope, and I thought that was the last bit we would ever do. It was getting worse and worse,” he says, frowning. “Suicide’s really scary, a real final thing. I can’t even get tattoos because I’m that afraid of commitment. But there were times where it was just so hard.” At last, though, he saw a new doctor who said Duritz had been misdiagnosed and, so, wrongly dosed for years. He started to feel a little lighter, a sense he funneled into the record’s second half. He felt OK enough to begintalkingmore about his struggles in thepress, to do anything other than simply sing and bear it. He’d met what he understood as the Mariah Carey threshold, finally allowing himself to be open. And for one of the first times in his career, he began to see celebrity and success with gratitude, because they afforded him the space and money to get better. That, he knows, is a rare American privilege. “One thing that’s a real problem with mental illness is, ‘How am I going to grow up and take care of myself?’” he says. “Music and art gave me a whole life, and I was afforded a lot of flexibility to be mentally ill because I was really successful. I don’t think that fixes mental illness, but I have time to be myself.” Sometime near the end of the last decade, Dan Vickrey—the guitarist who joined the Crows between the sessions for and seemingly endless tours behindAugust and Everything After—heard some surprising news onstage: Maybe his band of 25 years was breaking up? Vickrey had always been surprised at how long and well Counting Crows had lasted, especially since he worried during those dizzy early days that they may never make a second record. Still, Duritz’ proclamation on stage shook him. “At the end of the show, Adam always says, ‘Hey, thanks for coming. Don’t worry: We will be back,’ a reference to one of our songs,” remembers Vickrey, alluding to“Come Around,”a bittersweet tune fromSaturday Nights & Sunday Mornings.“But he was starting to say, ‘I don’t know if we will be back around.’ Well, that’s different.” In many ways, Duritz was just skating to where the puck was headed. Though he had a terrible time makingSaturday Nights & Sunday Mornings, he liked the album itself. Still, he recognized that it was too late, that most momentum and good will the Crows had ever enjoyed was squandered in a dozen years of tabloid drama, withering reviews, and, finally, “Big Yellow Taxi.” So they did the things that legacy bands do: a live album documenting a full-length performance ofAugust, a covers record that seesaws between delight and drudgery, and a touring festival where they functioned as elder folk-rock statesmen. They released only one album of original material the entire decade. “When I left California, I was 29 years old,”he sang on that record’s bluegrass homage, referencing the moment he met fame and nearly collapsed from dizziness, “and the world just spun me ’round.” Duritz, I should say, is an absolute head. When he learned thatI’d produced a 5-LP box set by a long-defunctband, he ordered a copy, digested it all, and asked me a series of questions so incisive I wondered if he should have been a music journalist. He saw a lot of Dead shows as a kid in California and even has a few good Pigpen jokes. He will dive as deep into the works of Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Maria McKee as you want to go. But he realized his band would likely never be treated with that sort of esteem. “When I go see Springsteen, I get so excited when he plays ‘New York City Serenade’—not a very popular song, but I love it,” Duritz says, noting with some shame that he still can’t form a competent sentence in Springsteen’s company. “For us, I wish ‘Palisades Park’ was like that. I wish it meant the world to our fans, the obscure songs. The singles were not special to me.” Around the time of that on-stage pronouncement, then, he got rid of the thing that had visually tied him to his band and the world for a quarter-century: those dreadlocks. He was on his way to a friend’s farm in England, with a post-flight stopover in London. He wanted to shower and shave before climbing into bed when he had a stray thought: Did he really need these things anymore? Nope. The beard went, too. (By the way, when I asked Duritz if he’d ever considered the cultural implications of sporting dreadlocks as a famous and wealthy white man, he was as sheepish as he ever got in our talks. “People could tell me that’s not me,” he finally managed, “but I just felt right.”) “I decided that I was just going to look at myself for a while,” he says. “I don’t want to be hiding behind anything now. And then, after a couple of years, I realized I could hide a little bit, so I put the beard back on.” He has not missed the dreadlocks a single day. In fact, for years, he would walk past any sink in any friend’s home and stick his head under the faucet, just to feel the sensation of water running against his scalp and how quickly it would dry. He’s over that compulsion now, but he still mostly enjoys one other benefit: relative anonymity. He can saunter down the street now or go to a restaurant without having to be the guy from “Mr. Jones” or “A Long December.” It is a bit of a mixed blessing, however, since he has to introduce himself to people again, a reminder of that fraught period when his parents kept shuttling their young wallflower to new cities. In March, for instance, Duritz and his friends Keegan-Michael and Elle Key went to the Beacon Theatre, where Duritz had once asked MTV to stop playing his video, to see Mike Birbiglia perform. After the show, he was telling Michael McKean backstage about how muchThis Is Spinal Tapmeant to him in college. Elle asked McKean if she knew who Duritz was, that he was a musician, too. McKean hadn’t recognized him sans dreads. “Now that I know you’re famous, let me shake your hand a second time,” McKean quipped. “I don’t think I realized what a crutch it had become, being famous and recognizable. I had these 30 years of my life where everybody came up to me. I could talk to people,” he says, laughing. “I’m back to being the new kid in school again—in my head, anyways.” Early in our conversations, Duritz said something that seemed like an implicit refrain in the rest of our time together, something I’ve already quoted once: “When you’re young, the one thing you aren’t is defined.” He had been defined for decades—by mental illness, by the kind of music he made, by his hairdo. And now, without it, he seemed open again. At that friend’s farm in England, he began using a rented Yamaha keyboard to compose a series of songs that spilled into and out of one another, a four-piece suite that seemed to double as the score to a musical that’s yet to be made. The band cut the songs just before Covid-19 began and released them as an EP in 2021. Duritz was motivated to keep writing. He went back to the farm, back to its quiet and its six-mile walks through the woods. On “Under the Aurora,” he harnessed the existential yearning that had animated the Crows from the start, a little like Nick Cave sequestered in the basement of Big Pink. For “Spaceman in Tulsa,” he tapped the panoramic sense of American fantasy that once made hits of “Mr. Jones” and “Rain King.” He worked and worked on the songs, convinced by the work of his friends in Gang of Youths that the material could always get better. “I’d never done that before, where I wrote stuff and thought it wasn’t good enough. It’s literally never happened to me,” he says. “If I don’t think something’s good enough, I don’t finish it. But I was embarrassed by these.” He called his band, and they gathered in his living room, near the Astroturf rug, with Duritz behind the piano. For the first time in two decades, they made real demos. He knew he had it. “We were so excited coming out of that,” he says, leaning forward on the couch and bouncing his knees. “We knew how it went.” A few hours before I took the elevator to Duritz’s condo near Astor Place for the first time, my phone rang. It was his publicist, Jessica, calling with a friendly final request: Duritz was worried I might say too much about Zoe Mintz, the actress and writer who happens to be his girlfriend of the last eight years. That is the longest relationship of Duritz’s life by an astonishing factor of four. He was cooking us dinner, after all, so she would be there. As you well know by now, he’s learned during the last three decades to keep some space between his personal and professional lives, or gossip about the former will overrun the latter. She had also recently taken part ina forthcoming HBO documentary about the band, where, as Duritz puts it, she seemed more like a plot point than a human being, and he didn’t want a repeat of that. These requests happen, because celebrities deserve the same dignity of privacy as everyone else. I said yes. But 10 minutes after I arrived, I realized that to not talk about Zoe and their relationship would be a lie. They share the easy camaraderie of a couple who have seen the best and worst of each other and, in turn, inspired change. As Duritz checked the roasting chicken for the tenth time and Zoe dressed a salad, she ribbed him for how much he complained aboutnoteating ice cream after dinner these days, part of a new diet. He beamed when he talked about the forearm tattoo that seemed to embarrass her—“You’re a Genius all the time,” Jack Kerouac’stwenty-ninth bit of insight for writers—and mocked himself for lacking the commitment to even get one. They giggled, batted hands, praised one another’s work, and agreed that the length of their relationship can be measured by how many times they’ve rewatchedSeinfeld. They seemed, in a word, happy. When I told Duritz after dinner that I had to mention this, thatnotnoting that a guy who had always been so unlucky in love had finally found it would be wrong, he beamed again. He told me about how, after meeting on Tinder, he asked her to move in soon after their first date and how he never wanted either of them to leave. (I should say now that Zoe opted not to be interviewed, which increases the chances she is a plot point rather than a human here, too, but I’m doing my best.) He told me that, in the first two years of their relationship, fights were frequent, and he feared the same romantic collapses of his past. But during the pandemic, she suggested couples therapy. He was resistant, especially since he already had a regimen of his own. Relenting, he says, was one of his best decisions ever. “I thought it was such a shitty idea, but we came out of the pandemic completely in love,” he says, as Edward Albee, the more gregarious of their two tuxedo cats, hops on the couch. Moustache, the other, occasionally eyes us from afar. “Before that, I wouldn’t have made the effort to really understand another person and be understood by another person. I’m finally interested in another person’s success, invested in it.” During the next two days, he slips in and out of a series of anecdotes that feel like parables for finding adult happiness. We talk about the livestream of theBig Bear bald eaglesthat’s been on their television almost always for the last few years, how Zoe has begun to study the birds’ habits and tell him all about it. For a few minutes, he narrates the broadcast like the Super Bowl. He tells me about taking Zoe to seeBecoming Led Zeppelin, though she wasn’t a devotee. (Immerglück, the Crows’ multi-instrumentalist, has about 250 Zeppelin bootlegs.) “I thought she might be bored, but she looks at me after the first song and says, ‘Holy shit, this bandsmokes,’” he says with the tone of a proud parent. Most important, though, is the encouragement she provided for him to grow up. She is younger than Duritz, who was in his early 50s when he met her, so she wanted him to get healthier, even if it meant just using a treadmill. He spends an hour a day on the treadmill in their condo now, staring out of its enormous windows. He’s down 12 pounds and thinks, with a little more, he may start running, too. He’s worried over his weight for years, has even seen that struggle turned into content on gossip sites. But he feels good about it now. And he’s finally starting to remember to empty the litter box, a small domestic chore that he’s now increasingly aware of because it makes Zoe’s life easier. “She stuck with me through a lot. There’s a strength in having someone who cares, and I feel capable now in ways I was never capable before,” says Duritz, taking a sip of the Diet Coke he keeps ever-ready in an insulated bottle. “You can go through your life thinking that getting up’s kind of hard. But these days, I can get up, go over there, and empty that shit. I feel very able and excited about doing a lot of shit for Zoe.” Jessica, the very publicist who’d asked me not to mention his relationship, looks up from a nearby couch: “It’s love.” Duritz grins and nods: “Yeah, I think itis.” Later, as I thought about this exchange, I kept considering “Mr. Jones,” the song and the man for whom it’s named. Duritz wrote that tune when he sang in a mostly unknown Berkeley band, drunk-dreaming about the day everyone would know his name. “When everybody loves you/You can never be lonely,” he opined, a line that came to be so ironic and barbed for him he spent decades altering it onstage. Marty Jones didn’t get famous, but he’s been married to his high-school sweetheart, Suzanne, for almost two decades. She loved him before he became a song. (Jones, I should note, was also in a Third Eye Blind precursor; he laughs when he tells me that the name of his current band is Spanish for“The Nobodies.”) And only now that Duritz is almost unrecognizable and nearly 30 years removed from cultural ubiquity has he found the kind of love he always wanted. “I never thought he would have this kind of relationship,” admits Parker. “There were all these girls, and they were just everywhere. He became so wedded to this image of himself, and he couldn’t bear any more disappointment.” I do think, though, that Duritz is in for at least a little disappointment once again. He is excited aboutButter Miraclein the way he has almost always been excited about new records, convinced it is the music he has been wanting to make his whole life. And he wants a massive hit, something that makes enough money that he can fund retirement accounts for the crew members who have followed his vision around the world for so long. It is, after all, a smart and sophisticated album, as emotionally nuanced as it is structurally audacious. But it’s probably arriving a quarter-century too late, long after the mainstream musical conversation left the Counting Crows’ form of classic folk-rock behind. They remain a massive influence on artists now consideredau courant, but they themselves are only a very good version of the band they’ve always been.MJ Lenderman,Noah Kahan, andBon Iverfans will likely not convert to this particular sound of the pasten masse. In the end, I also don’t know if Duritz cares that much. “Music was all I had for a long time, all that mattered. That’s changed now,” he says, hands folded between his knees. “I still love making music, and tour will be great and exhausting and grueling and great. But I have a much more three-dimensional life now. It’s changing.” Duritz wrote only one song onButter Miracleentirely at home—the opener, “With Love, From A-Z,” a squawking and sidewinding epic whose strident guitars and ascendant piano suggest a stopover betweenRecovering the SatellitesandThis Desert Life. It offers a fragmented vision of the United States and, as the title suggests, a love song from Adam to Zoe. “I may leave you a lot, but I won’t leave you alone,” he promises in the refrain with the athleticism and urgency of a much younger singer who is thrilled to have now found his future, no matter the time and toil it took. This is, at last, the glittering vision at the end of the long tunnel in which every previous Counting Crows album has existed. “With Zoe, it’s a whole different thing now. I have a lot of satisfaction in my days now, a lot of happiness,” he tells me, his voice cracking like he’s singing one of his standards. “I wake up in the morning and sit here and feel great, knowing that I’m not alone.”",

    "title": "Our Legacy and Emporio Armani Are Back With Another Dreamy Menswear Collection",
    "article_text": "Back in 2023, Emporio Armani and Our Legacy Work Shop shook up the menswear world byjoining forces for a well-received collection. Now, after two long years, the king of Italian tailoring and the cult Swedish label are back in cahoots for the sequel. “A partnership is like a relationship, when you know each other, everything becomes easier,” says Jockum Hallin, co-founder ofOur Legacy. “Cristopher [Nying], my founding partner and creative director, really wanted to explore new territories on this one, including womenswear. That’s not a small thing for our Milanese partner, but everyone at Armani really trusted us on it and gave full support.” As with the first drop, this collection dives deep into the Emporio Armani archives, but with the sort of modern elegance that's made Our Legacy a cult brand proper. The fabrics, too, are exact recreations of vintage Armani materials, revived exclusively for this partnership. But, unlike the first collection, this one leans into a breezier, sun-soaked vibe—something made for the Cote d’Azur or a languid summer hungover in Taormina or Positano. It’s been a cultish brand for years, but now Our Legacy is finding success that its founders never imagined—and facing a slew of new challenges. “First time around, our audience really responded hard and went all in on the “real” Armani bits like the tailoring, the overcoats, the shirts, and the leather,” says Hallin. “So with the confidence from that experience, we have explored that even more in-depth for this one. It's really the perfect summer version of our first joint.” This collection also borrows a move or two from traditional East Asian style. The Toga Coat—a loose-fitting, robe-like piece inspired by the Japanese kimono—served as a conceptual starting point. Elsewhere, styles like the collarless Sciovolo Shirt and the Ampolla Blazer are on a similar vibe. Ultimately, though, the collection's also about just putting your feet up and chilling. “We picked up on a lot of East Asian influences that Mr. Armani has had over the years and merged that with retreat dressing, the kind of pieces you get when checking into your favorite beach hotel,” Hallin expalins. “But we’ve tried to perfect them and make them more elegant. It’s something that Armani would have in his vacation wardrobe, maybe worn in his personal summer getaway on Pantelleria, where we later shot the campaign together with Alasdair McLellan.” There’s hotelbathrobesand there’sslippersand there’sloafers. There’s alsoshort-sleeve shirts, elasticated-waist trousers, and hoodies that can be dressed up (or down) when needed. And the best vacation companion of them all: an Our Legacy Work Shop x Emporio Armani deck of cards. Because, of course! For Hallin and Nying, the collaboration marks a full-circle moment. Back in 2023, Hallin toldGQ,“When we were young, Armani was really the mark of complete financial success and good taste—something almost unattainable.” Now they’ve joined forces. Not just once, but twice. “It’s how we imagined an Italian homecoming,” he adds. “Full of people, full of energy. A beautiful world for us reserved Stockholmers to step into.” The Emporio Armani x Our Legacy Work Shop spring-summer 2025 collection will be available on May 16 at Our Legacy and select stockists like Mr Porter and SSENSE. It will also be accompanied by a special installation at the Armani/Manzoni store in Milan, as well as the Dover Street Market locations in London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, and Ginza.

Kendrick Lamar is no stranger to great Nike sneakers. During his landmark Super Bowl performance in February, he laced up thelegendary Nike Air DT Max 96. He’s also collaborated on seven sneakers with the big Swoosh, and been spotted in other hot shoes likeMartine Rose’s Shox MR4 orVirgil Abloh’s Air VaporMax. And while heading to the studio yesterday, K.Dot pulled out another banger: the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam ‘Flax.’ The ‘Flax’ was one of the first colorways to hit theZoom Vomero Roamline. Released at the very end of 2024, this silhouette mashes up the cultyZoom Vomero 5with atrail shoe-coded vibe. Up top, the trainer works on top of a lightweight nylon base and it's overlaid by smooth leather across the lacing system and vamp. As you move further and further down, you'll notice a ‘Flax’ shroud that's designed to keep water out. There's a pull tab along the tongue and the heel, and the usual Vomero lacing system has been replaced with a toggle switch setup for extragorppoints. Unfortunately, the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam ‘Flax’ sold out in most sizes ages ago, but you can still nab a pair right now on StockX right now. (Or, you can grab ’em in a few other colorways at Nike proper.) These were originally $180 when they first released, but certain sizes are going for below retail at the moment—you can get a 10US, for instance, for just $160 right now.

    "article_text": "Want more insider watch coverage? Get Box + Papers, GQ's newsletter devoted to the watch world, sent to your inbox every Friday.Sign up here to get it free. Even by my greedy standards, I was blown away by the sheer number of incredible timepieces on Monday night’s Met Gala red carpet—not to mention the creative ways that many of them were worn. Janelle Monáe was a standout in that category. She paired a motorized clock monocle with her Thom Browne look. The watch hands on her eyewear spent the night zipping around the dial, and the singer really made a meal of the accessory. “It’s Time,”she wrote on Instagram, alongside a closeup of the monocle. Cameron Hughes, the craftsman behind the piece, explained how he made it in justsix dayson his Instagram. Hughes used tiny 6-mm micro motors and, rather than focusing on spinning the hands individually, he made it so that the whole face spun, mimicking the movement of a watch. He went through several prototypes and only ended up hot-gluing the watch to Monae’s hat while on the floor of the Met. Rihanna, meanwhile, shared some big news during the Met: she isalsoa fan of innovating new ways to wear a watch. The singer-slash-empire-builderpaired her Marc Jacobs look with Cartier jewelry, including two pieces embedded with watches—a long pendant with a teeny clock and a string of diamonds underneath it, and a gem-set watch brooch. The latter is like a reversible watch built for maximizing opulence rather than utility. Rihanna had hers flipped to the side set with diamonds, but the out-of-sight reverse face is a clock (you can seea similar watch here). Meanwhile, Chris Rock wore a brooch as a tie from Fred Leighton.Back in the early 1900s,watchmakers would put time-telling devices in practically everything: lighters, tie bars, money clips, rings, pens, letter openers, you name it. It’s very cool to see Rock embrace that tradition with his own tiny clock accessory. What was most exciting about the timepieces at this year’s Met Gala is the creative ways they were baked directly into the outfits. Rather than simply being an additional accessory strapped to the wrist, they were essential bits of the outfit, whether it was Dapper Dan’s clock pendant necklace or Monáe’s monocle.",

    "title": "The 6 Best Exercises for a Brawnier Back",
    "article_text": "A broad, well-defined back is a cornerstone of any well-rounded physique. But that’s not the only reason to pump up your posterior—it’s also a critical way of improving posture, reducing back pain, and preventing injury. “A lot of times when people come in with shoulder pain,” says Alex Corbett, PT, DPT, a physical therapist atBreakthrough Physical Therapy, “what we look at first is the development of their back.” \"One of the reasons training the back is so important is not just back development, but [because] there's just so much muscle tissue there, and when you stress all that muscle tissue, all these other benefits of strength training, from hormone production to increased basal metabolic rate, they're all amplified,\" says Luke Carlson, founder and CEO ofDiscover Strength. Back exercises don’t always get as much of our attention as they deserve. “We have this thing where we tend to train the muscle groups that are visible in the mirror. Most guys focus on biceps over triceps, pecs over back, quads over hamstrings,” says Carlson. But, he continues, “There's so much potential for what we can do with the back for most people. Even people who have trained consistently for years, they probably haven't maximized the training of their back.” Here are the best exercises to do on back day, according to Dr. Corbett and Carlson. “The pullover is probably the single most magical exercise in all of strength training, and yet most people have never done a pullover before,” says Carlson, who admits the pullover machine seems to have fallen out of fashion over the past few years. “In the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, that's all anybody used to develop their lats,” he says. “We've just gotten away from it, but it’s truly the magic back machine.” The pullover excels in its ability to target your lats directly and minimize the need for supporting muscles that may fail out before your back. “Almost every other exercise we’re going to talk about—chin-ups, rows, pull-downs—there's a limitation,” Carlson says. “The limitation is that our biceps and our forearms are much weaker than our powerful back muscles. And so when we reach the point of fatigue or muscle failure, we're almost always failing because our biceps or our forearms are the weak link.” The pullover bypasses those weak links, allowing you to concentrate all your effort on your lats. How to do it: Trainer tip: If you don’t have access to a pull-over machine, you can get by (albeit slightly less effectively) with a dumbbell. “You would lie on your back, holding a dumbbell in your hands, with arms extended above your chest. And then you're bringing your arms back behind your head,” says Carlson. Of course, by including your hands and forearms in this version, you miss out on some of the key isolation benefits of the pull-over machine, and choosing the right weight can be tricky. “That dumbbell is going to feel so easy when it's above your chest, and then as you come further back, it's going to feel really, really heavy,” he says. “So it's just not great, but if you don't have a machine, you should do it.” Hoisting your body weight up to a bar is one of the best (and mostfunctional) exercises you can do for your back upper. Gym bros like to debate the benefits of various grip options, but Carlson says it makes basically no difference. “The research is pretty clear: It is so darn similar,” he says. “Whether you have a narrow grip, a wide grip, palms facing you, palms facing away, palms neutral, it is like splitting-hair similar.” But if you’re targeting your lats primarily, there are a few reasons to opt for the classic, supinated-grip chin-up. For one, this is the only grip that naturally puts your hands at the optimal distance apart to target your lats, says Dr. Corbett. Also, the supinated grip recruits the most biceps muscle, compared with pronated or neutral grips—hence why you’re always able to get more reps with chin-ups than pull-ups. Beyond bonusbiceps gains, this means you’re able to work your back for longer before your arms give out. How to do it: Trainer tip: Leaning back slightly while pulling yourself up can help place more emphasis on the lats, Dr. Corbett advises. “You'll see people tend to lean backwards a little bit,” he says. “As you lean backwards, what you're doing is you're making more of a horizontal rowing motion, which means you shift that focus more to the upper back.” “My number one choice for this would be a chest-supported row, either using a cable or regular machine,” says Dr. Corbett. Like the first two moves, this one also targets the lats (and just as well as the lat pull-down machine, by the way), but places extra emphasis on the trapezius, rhomboids, and some of the smaller musculature of the upper back, says Carlson. There are a lot of different kinds of machines that allow you to perform the seated row; or you could even do it on the floor using just a cable pulley. Either way, the key is to minimize any swinging or movement of the torso, so Carlson recommends finding a machine with a chest pad to give you that extra support. “You should not be rocking forward or back, which is why a machine where you're leaning up against a pad is a great way to do it,” he says. How to do it: Trainer tip: While this looks like a straightforward back exercise, there’s a subtle but critical movement of the shoulder to keep in mind. “As you pull the handles backwards, you want to squeeze your shoulder blades together,” says Dr. Corbett. Then, over at the other end of the rep, “you should actually let your shoulder blades completely protract and go forward,” he says. “A lot of times people want to keep those shoulder blades static and held backwards. But if you don't get that full protraction, you're not getting the stretch on the middle upper back.” The posterior deltoid is technically part of your shoulder, but rear delts can make a huge impact on the overall look of your back. “The shoulder has three parts: the anterior deltoid, which is the front; the medial head of the deltoid, the thick part in the middle; and then the posterior deltoid is the back,” says Carlson. “Developing this muscle is so important when you look at someone's back. You might think, ‘Wow, they have a great back,’ but you're not just looking at their back; you're also looking at their rear deltoids.” If the reverse fly isn’t already part of your rotation on back or shoulder day, there are loads of gains to be had here. “This is an underdeveloped muscle in most people, because people do plenty of pushing movements for their chest and their shoulders, but those really don't involve any rear delt,” says Carlson. “And so when you actually isolate it with a reverse fly like this, that can have a pretty powerful impact on someone's physique and the look of their upper back.” How to do it: Trainer tip: If you don’t have access to a reverse fly machine, you can still get the job done with a bench and a set of dumbbells. \"The most common way to do it [without a machine] is to sit at the edge of the bench, lean way forward, and then lift your arms out to your sides,\" says Carlson. The trapezius, or “traps” as they’re affectionately known in weight rooms around the world, are one of your only back muscles that people can see from the front. You don’t have to train your traps to the point where it looks like your body is growing an extra set of shoulders, but a little attention can go a long way in improving the appearance of your back by just taking aim at your traps. “This is such a huge muscle, and there's just so much muscle tissue that can be developed there,” says Carlson. The seated cable row already handles a good portion of the middle and lower traps, and the shrug is one of the best ways out there to target the top, says Carlson. And with a small form tweak, you can make it even more effective. “With a little more shoulder retraction, you can hit the upper traps more effectively,” says Dr. Corbett. “So, rather than pulling your shoulders completely vertically, go up and diagonally, so you're getting the shoulder blades pulled backwards.” How to do it: Trainer tip: \"This is one of the classic exercises where almost everyone uses too much weight,\" says Carlson. \"And by too much weight, I just mean they use so much weight that they're not getting very much range of motion. If someone really wants to really develop their traps, I would say to cut the weight literally in half and get your shoulders up higher. As high as possible. Really exaggerate an isometric hold up there. The weight might feel light in the first few reps, but when you go through that really good range of motion, you're going to have improved trap development as a whole.\" The lower back isn’t as flashy as something like the lats or traps, but there’s no getting around its importance. There’s more to your core than the abs you can see in the mirror, and about half of it is on your back. The lower-back erector spinae muscles run parallel with one another down either side of your spine, says Dr. Corbett. One of the reasons we know so much about them is because of back pain. “As you could imagine, there's just a tremendous amount of scientific research on this topic, because we know that training the lower back is a great way to mitigate lower back pain,” says Carlson. “And so there's a lot of medical research on this, and the back extension is a great way to target those muscles.” The version Carlson is referring to is called the “Roman chair” back extension, but most people at your gym probably just call it the back extension. You might have used one in college with a plate against your chest. “It’s the best, and that's one where the research is pretty clear on that,” says Carlson. How to do it: Trainer tip: “There are a lot of ways people are trying to target their back, and unfortunately most of those exercises probably work the glutes more than the back,” says Carlson. “The key to doing [the back extension] is you want your feet pigeon-toed—your toes together and your heels out. What that will do is it will take the glutes out of the equation and focus more on the lumbar extensor muscles.”",

    "title": "Why ‘Poker Face’ Creator Rian Johnson Doubled Down on Standalone Episodes in Season 2",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. “I find myself at a place that feels like an ending,” Natasha Lyonne’s Charlie Cale muses in the second season of Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson’s streaming hitPoker Face, “but it’s really the middle. Kinda stymied. Where does one begin when they’re looking at a blank slate the size of a country?” Those lines could be the show’s mission statement, or a sophomore-season state-of-the-union report.Poker Facestarted out as a pandemic-era lark. After diving into Peter Falk’s classic police-detective seriesColumboas a lockdown binge, Johnson fell hard for both the star’s performance and the comforting, repetitive, self-contained structure of episodic television from the 1970s. InColumbo—and virtually all other non-soap-opera TV dramas of the era—there’s no broader mythology, grand mystery, or superstructural narrative hanging over each episode’s plot. Each week begins with a new murder and ends with a resolution and a reset, setting the show up to do it all over again next time. ButColumboalso had a somewhat unique structure—rather than a “whodunit,” in which the audience works toward a solution to the mystery alongside the detective, the series was a “howcatchem,” in which we see the murder happen and then watch the killer squirm as Columbo unravels their seemingly-perfect crime. For Johnson, who at the time was working onKnives Out—a classic whodunit in the Agatha Christie tradition—the show was a refreshing respite. Going from that to a true howcatchem likePoker Facewas a natural move for Johnson, who over two decades in Hollywood has displayed a rare knack for finding unique angles on well-thumbed genres, from hard-boiled noir to time travel to theStar Warsuniverse. Season two ofPoker Facecontinues Johnson’s project, doubling down on the show’s raison d'etre. As in season one, Natasha Lyonne is our wry, squinting non-cop Columbo, wandering the American countryside with a smirk as her sidearm, righting wrongs and protecting the weak from the strong, inhaling nicotine vapor and exhaling charisma. But this batch of episodes pointedly throws out the cursory serialized plot left over from the first season and finds more pleasure in each individual story, which makes for milk-and-cookie TV of the highest order. As Charlie says, “Maybe I’m figuring out how to finally start enjoying this journey, you know?” Johnson stepped out of an editing room at Industrial Light and Magic's San Francisco campus (he's putting the finishing touches on the nextKnives OutfilmWake Up Dead Man,which hits Netflix later this year) and jumped on Zoom to discuss his lone directing credit from the new season, form dictating function, and howPoker Facefits into his oeuvre. This interview has been edited and condensed, and contains some light “spoilers” for a show that very intentionally is difficult to spoil. GQ: Stock question, but what were the challenges of the second season in terms of design? Rian Johnson:Well, I mean, starting with the writing, the challenge is also the fun part. We didn't want to repeat ourselves. We also didn't want to start leaning on building up some kind of bigger mythology for Charlie or getting into doing a bigger story arc that was going to take attention. From the very start, I wanted to keep it meat-and-potatoes. Let's make every episode its own thing. Let's make every episode super fun in its own way. And let's find something genuinely different with each of these episodes that we're excited about, so that when the credits come up at the beginning of each episode, in a fun way, the audience doesn't know exactly what they're going to get. And that's both really thrilling and fun for a room full of writers. It's also what the challenge is when you have 12 more episodes to come up with. You can definitely feel the superstructure of the show being thrown out this season. It’sa conscious uncoupling from “The Big Plot.” It was very, very intentional and something that I was looking to do. When we came into the second season writer's room the first thing that we started talking about was the trajectory of season two with theBeatrix Haspcharacter and blah, blah, blah. For me, the question was “How do we offload from this and really define for audiences what this show is about as soon as possible?” I didn't want to repeat the thing of another mob boss. We also realized for Charlie Cale, reality is the scariest thing we can throw at her, to not have the defining purpose of being chased and to tell her,This is now up to you. Where do you want to go?And to see that this is actually part of who she is, this notion of not being able to really find a home, a place to place, but looking for it. That seems like more fertile ground, like you said, away from the superstructure of it, and back to what the show is really supposed to be about, which is each week, let's have a fun mystery. There's an explicit cinephilia that permeates this season. Last season there were more references to the television history that was informing the structure of the show, but this season there are a lot of both overt and subtle film references, which felt very Natasha. I think it's Natasha. I think it's the writers feeding off of Natasha's energy and the things she digs. But also, to a certain extent, just what we were talking about earlier in terms of the show becoming much more episodic this season, which allows every episode to have its own identity and its own style, and a shorthand for defining the style of each episode can be pop culture and movie references. How did you decide to direct the first episode of season two? I mean, honestly, the schedule picked it for me, because this season almost exactly overlapped with the production ofWake Up Dead Man. I would have loved to have directed more of them, but that was the one that I was able to get there and do. I liked that it was a very complicated script and a very complicated challenge production wise. And also, I really wanted to work with Cynthia, and there were a lot of things I loved about Laura Deeley’s script. There are echoes ofthe Andi/Helen plotlinefromGlass Onion. It was hard not to think of that on set, although it was a little bit of a different game just because with Andi and Helen, it was always near misses, and we never had the two of them playing off each other, on screen together for obvious reasons, but there was definitely an echo of that. It gave it a screwball, or new Hollywood version of aWhat's Up Doc?-style, farcical element we got to lean into. And I mean, the fun thing is playing with Cynthia and Natasha, who were clued into that and were totally game for it. I don't know if I'm reaching, but…. Reach! Reach! [Laughs] Along with the Helen/Andi device, the Martha Cabreas bit from the originalKnives Out, where she has the physical inability to lie, feels like a mirror inverse of Charlie’s internal lie detector. IsPoker Facelike a gym where you can work out iterations of ideas fromKnives Out, or vice versa? It's both a gym and—oh, God, I'm trying to think of another analogy for it. Kind of an island of reject toys. It's like if there's a fragment of an idea or—I told the writers at the beginning of the season in the room, if there’s something you’ve always wanted to do, maybe you usually write comedy, but you’ve always wanted to do an attic horror type thing, this is the place to try that out. So there are ideas that haven't found their way into other things, or I've always had in the back of my head but never had something to land them on, and this is a playground to try those out. When I rewatchedGlass Onionfor this, I noticed there’s a really brief Stephen Sondheim appearance in Benoit Blanc’sAmong Us Zoom call, along with Natasha, Angela Lansbury, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Can you explain his appearance and your relationship with Sondheim’s work? He’s informed my work on so many levels, beyond just being a massive fan of his musicals, he was also a very intensely devoted puzzles and mystery guy. Obviously, he co-wroteThe Last of Sheila, whichGlass Onionowes quite a lot to. One of my favorite films, which is the adaptation ofSleuth, and this might be apocryphal, but the part that Lawrence Olivier plays is supposed to have been based on Sondheim's love of games. There's a lot of different ways in for me, and there's a lot of connections between Sondheim and this genre, but also just as a storyteller, with that second movie, I was listening toMerrily We Roll Alongwhile I was writing it. There's a bunch of quotes from that movie hidden in the dialogue ofGlass Onion, because the notion of a group of old friends and how they got from where they were to where they are now and how everything fell apart was on my mind. And for this new movie,Into the Woodsended up being an influence in that deeply buried way. I guess the short answer is he has an intense connection to the genre itself, but he's also just been a lifelong inspiration for me. And I got to get on a Zoom with him to record his cameo, which was one of the highlights of my life. He was really sweet about it. For the last few years, one half of your brain has been dedicated to whodunits, and the other half has been dedicated to howcatchems. What are the positives and negatives of each structure? For me, the positive of the whodunit is the size of the cast of characters. The reality of the howcatchem is it's really a two-hander, or a three-hander with our structure, because the detective gets to know the victim as well. That's very, very good for a 45 minute episode of television. Whodunits are fun because you have a full cast, and you have to build each one of them out into a suspect, to be able to get a full meal of working with a whole ensemble of actors. But other than that, I feel like howcatchem is the much stronger narrative form. Just as a writer, that's the strongest engine in the car, because it's based on tension as opposed to surprise. And I feel like 90% of the work I do in writing the whodunits is trying to find an engine in them that takes it away from being “just” a whodunit, and trying to figure out, “How how do I find something more muscular to drive this thing, that's going to keep an audience engaged?” Because you learn very quickly that clue-gathering and the surprise is not going to keep an audience in their seats. You have to find an actual tension-based element to drive the plot. That’s really interesting because my next question was, “Is it harder to maintain tension in a howcatchem?” From my perspective, as someone who's never had to write either of one, what I would think is, you know who killed the person. You know that by the end of the episode, the detective figure/protagonist will come out victorious and live to fight another day. With a whodunit, at least you have this overriding mystery that you have to solve. But it sounds like what you're saying is the opposite. It’s exactly the opposite, and this fascinates me. This has been one thing so interesting about digging into this specific form. On paper, you would think exactly what you said. It makes complete sense, but the reality is completely flipped. And it took me… it's almost like a magic trick, whatLevinson & Linkclued into with that howcatchem formula. I still don't completely understand why it works, but the fundamentals of it are what I think I talked about before. The tension—it’s the Hitchcock thing, that if you have two characters talking across the table, they talk for three minutes, and then a bomb goes off, the audience gets one moment of surprise. Compared to, if you go down beneath the table at the beginning of the scene and see the bomb there, now, the audience is nervous and are paying attention. So, I think giving them that information, having it be the tension of how the detective is gonna catch this son of a bitch, that drives a whole episode and never gets boring. In a way, the firstKnives Outis probably the cleanest example of this. In that movie, it's kind of a false move, but I take away the whodunit, supposedly early on, show you that Marta did it, and then the tension it really is a howcatchem. You think, “God,Blancis the good guy, and we know the detective always wins, but I love Marta. How is she gonna get away with this?” And clue-gathering—that's the other thing you learn really quickly, is how boring clue-gathering is for an audience. That definitely applies inPoker Faceas well. You always have to have some fun thing driving a story, just figuring something out is not ever going to be that interesting to watch. With howcatchems, you have a villain, you can develop that villain, and it becomes a chess match as opposed to watching—I don't know, I'm running out of analogies. Subversion is a clear throughline in all of your work, and it's something that you bring up in conversation a lot. What draws you to it? If subversion means not handling anything that you take on with the reverent kid gloves of nostalgia, then, yeah, I'll absolutely take the label “subversive.” But “subversive” to me means the opposite of chucking something out the window just to be an impetuous imp. To me, anything that you take into your hands, any type of story, whether it's something that you're making up wholesale, or whether it's something that's paying homage, or whether it's something that you're reworking from the past, you always have to take it out of the box and play with it. And you gotta get your hands around it. You gotta be, you know—when I was young, I played with my toys without fear of breaking them. I wasn't a collector, I had toys that I played with. I don't want to sit down and watch any movie where the filmmaker isn't approaching the material with that same fearlessness.",

    "title": "How Viral Video Star Benito Skinner Made the Sitcom of the Summer",
    "article_text": "It’s a gloomyweekday afternoon in Manhattan but inside Boxers, a neon-lit watering hole that bills itself as “America's gay sports bar,” it might as well be last call. The reggaeton’s blaring, the pool table’s buzzing, and our bartender, Javier? Stripped down to his boxers, welcoming the clientele with bedroom eyes, a half-fade, and abs you could grate a wedge of pecorino on. “Where’s your husband?” Javier asks a regular, a beefy unc in a plaid shirt and horn-rimmed glasses. “Don’t you want alone time with me?” the customer parries coyly. There’s a Mets vs. Marlins game on TV, but no one is watching. It’s into this cabaret of masculinity that the comedian Benito Skinner makes his perfectly timed entrance, just as the opening strains of Jennifer Lopez’s “Waiting for Tonight” play over the speakers. “Hey, baby,” he greets me, with an exuberant quiff straight out of aYMmagazine spread and a goofy-handsome boy-band mug Lou Pearlman would scam for. Benito Skinner, the creator and star of the series, plays a college freshman inching his way out of the closet. Skinner, who’s wearing a Celine shirt, JW Anderson jeans, and Noah loafers, is riding high from recording an episode ofThe Drew Barrymore Show.But it wasn’t exactly his first appearance on the program. In 2021, as his sweet-but-bristly celebrity impressions made him a social media star, Skinner appeared on the show dressed asBarrymore fromEver Afterand a year later, he returned infull TV Host Drew cosplayfor a segment where the real Drew interviewed the fake Drew about his impressions. “You are pioneering something and this will get traced back to you,” Barrymore told him, presciently. Today, Skinner was on the show as himself, Instagram’s favorite impressionist finally invited to the party. It’s a heady time for the 31-year-old. Next week,Overcompensating,the half-hour comedy series he created, wrote, and stars in, will premiere on Prime Video with cosigns from industry giants like A24, Jonah Hill, and Charli XCX. The show has been a lifetime in the making, a hilarious piece of autofiction that also functions as a big career leap forward. Emma Chamberlain, Owen Thiele, Charli XCX (the show's executive music producer), and Benito Skinner. Overcompensatingtells the story of Benny, a closeted college freshman still smarting from high school years spent as a jock and the valedictorian, inching his way to self-discovery. Skinner drew inspiration from his own time in high school, when he was a secretly gay teenager in Boisie, Idaho, playing on the football team to keep up hetero appearances. “I mean, I distinctly remember a few moments where someone would pull me aside and be like, ‘You better like pussy,’” he says. “In those spaces, it's like,Well, be anything, but don't be fucking gay. Literally, the term ‘Don't be gay’ was said all the time.” Skinner sits up straight, doing his best Josie Grossie, imaginary fluffy pen in the air: “I'm like, all right, I'll take that note. Thank you.” In college, he remembers getting drunk at parties in straight boys’ houses and finding himself in fratty bathrooms with posters of aughts-era bombshells like Megan Fox and Kate Upton on the walls around him. “I'd be like, ‘Hey, girls, I can't believe we're all here right now…” he recalls. “‘What a fucking bust.’” Now, of course, we find ourselves sipping soda water in the inverse of that situation: a gay bar that’s also a sports bar, where no one’s really watching the game but a few Lady Gaga deep cuts have already played. Corteon Moore plays Gabe, a quintessential bro. WritingOvercompensating,Skinner looked to iconic teen movies likeAmerican PieandMean Girlsas some of his inspirations: “I wanted that kind of classic American world—but now let's fuck it all up and let's tell different stories.” Similar to those coming-of-age classics, the show is a true ensemble piece, with an assortment of hilarious, endearingly flawed characters that reinvigorate all the usual cafeteria archetypes. Mary Beth Barone, the cohost of Skinner’s podcastRide,plays Benny’s uptight sister Grace, a college queen bee who draws her authority from her association with her frat king boyfriend. The frat king in question is Peter, a villainous douchebag played byThe White Lotus’s Adam DiMarco. Wally Baram, a writer on the Jason Segel/Harrison Ford seriesShrinking,nails her first ever acting role as Carmen, a wise if sometimes wide-eyed freshman. And the boy of Benny’s dreams?Ms. Marvel’s Rish Shah as Miles, the sweet, gorgeous film bro who our hero can’t seem to pin down. “All of them showed me things in the character that I thought were unexpected,” Skinner says. While none of them are household names now, there’s a sense that they’re one of casts that are destined to be everywhere very soon—like how it felt like watching that first season ofSkinsor the arrival ofGirls. As Grace, Mary Beth Barone plays a queen bee who draws her authority from her association with her frat king boyfriend. Benito Skinner stock is looking bullish in general, with what feels like half of Hollywood betting onOvercompensating. Acting heavyweights Kyle MacLachlan and Connie Britton hilariously play Benny’s parents on the show, while other stars—from James Van Der Beek to Bowen Yang to Kaia Gerber to Megan Fox—appear in rip-roaring cameos. Instead of period specificity, the show reaches for a feeling, the jagged vulnerability of coming of age, a time that can feel both like a raucous house party and a midnight drive alone that never ends. “I never wanted the comedy to get too big for how sad the emotions at times could feel in college,” he says. Fittingly,Overcompensatingis getting the kind of white-glove rollout that the season’s hot new show deserves, with a Coachella house (seen in the photographs here) and a multi-week college tour to help promote it. “It is literally feral,” is how Skinner describes the tour. “People are obsessed with getting me shots. I'm like, ‘Daddy doesn't drink like that.’” “I'm thriving again,” Skinner says, about being back in college. “Not that I thrived the first time, but I can kind of rewrite it this time.” Skinner becamea social media sensation during the COVID pandemic, part of a new class of comedy stars borne out of the algorithm. They churned out scrappy, front-facing comedy when many big productions were derailed and provided a gloriously low-stakes distraction during a time when the whole world was doomscrolling. Skinner was well positioned, thanks to a conversation he had with his boyfriend Terrence O’Connor—the digital strategist behind last year’s zeitgeist-definingBratSummerand thepap picture–referencingrollout for the new Haim era—years prior. When they first met, Skinner confessed that he wanted to be an actor. “He was like, ‘Well, why is your Instagram private?’” Skinner says. “‘Trust me, you don't know anyone at agencies, your daddy is not in the industry, my daddy's not, no one around us is. You have no other entry point. But you clearly love doing something here.’” Skinner’s social media alter ego—Benny Drama, the Sasha Fierce to his Beyoncé—became the couple’s art project, their literal labor of love. Nell Verlaque as Emily, a popular girl from Carmen’s hometown. Skinner, a twunky Carol Burnett for the TikTok generation, thrived with impressions that were often cuttingly accurate but executed with the reverence of a true stan. Before long, the stars he was impersonating—from the Kardashians to Shawn Mendes to Barrymore—professed themselves fans of his comedy, and he earned follows from the likes of Madonna and Dua Lipa. In 2021, Skinner was even enlisted by the Biden White House fora video encouraging Americans to get the COVID vaccine. But he soon found that the industry still had trouble envisioning him outside an iPhone screen. “I think I've reached my max here,” he remembers thinking, after auditioning for countless gay assistant roles. “I just think there are more stories to tell and more queer stories to tell.” So Skinner went to work on a script that would tellhisstory and lean intohissensibilities, one that saw his experiences as a closeted gay teenager as the main story and not the B-plot. “I had this community that felt like it was rooting for me on the internet,” he says. “I was like, Fuck it, I can do it. Let's go.” The first version ofOvercompensatingdebuted in 2018 as a comedy skit about his time in the closet and all the ways he tried to remain in it, at the New York Comedy Festival. Like many queer people, Skinner is still grappling with the lasting effects of that time in his life. “The amount of internalized homophobia that I had to really untrain out of my body…” he says. “I remember on my first date with my boyfriend. I was like,Oh, his voice is higher than I thought.And I'm like, I can't believe I thought that…. This addiction to masculinity is so ingrained in all of us.” It’s also what’s given his comedy a purpose and an urgency. Overcompensatingactor Owen Thiele with digital strategist Terrence O’Connor, Skinner’s boyfriend, who helped him grow @bennydrama7 online. As he got to work on the script that would eventually becomeOvercompensatingthe TV show, he realized the story he wanted to tell was actually about the friendship between gay men and straight women. He thought about his best female friends and the version of him they met in college. “This is exactly the moment where I was overcompensating and someone caught me,” he says. “It's those first people that you meet in college where you're like,Oh, you might love me even if I don't do this.” For a lot of gay boys, those girlfriends provided a safe space that allowed them to tiptoe outside the closet. And for the girls? A loving male friendship that had no ulterior motives. “They allow themselves both to feel emboldened in their sexuality,” Skinner says. “It feels very, rooting each other on.” The 1997 Julia Roberts rom-comMy Best Friend’s Weddingwas his proof of concept. The hat trick ofMy Best Friend’s Weddingis its ability to find a happy ending for Roberts’s Julianne, a character the audience has already seen commit ugly, selfish acts in a desperate attempt to win the guy of her dreams. At the end of the film, we see Julianne at a wedding, defeated and alone—only to be saved by a dance with her gay best friend George, played by Rupert Everett. “It’s the worst moment ever,” Skinner says. “Like, ‘Oh my God, I just got my heart broken, who do I want to see right now?’I’ve got to see this gay guy. I’ve got to be with my girl.That scene clearly changed me chemically, I think, as a kid.” Benito Skinner and Wally Baram play the show’s central duo Benny and Carmen. InOvercompensating,the Julia Roberts to Skinner’s Rupert Everett is Wally Baram’s Carmen, a fellow freshman Benny befriends, their bond forged by playing the video gameSlut Slayer: Berlinand lip-synching to Nicki Minaj’s “Super Bass” in a Domino’s parking lot. Carmen is the unexpected heart of the show, the person who sees our protagonist at his ugliest and most insecure and loves him anyway. Skinner wrote the character as a tribute to his godmother, who passed away when he was in college. “Her name was Carmen,” he says. “That was maybe the first woman in my life who really saw me and wanted to preserve the things I was as a kid.” One of the many paths to showbiz success is that of the auteur—those who write their way to their own breakthroughs, crafting projects that lean into their idiosyncratic points of view. It’s no coincidence that some of the best examples of this archetype are talents from marginalized communities—thinkCole Escola,Issa Rae,Quinta Brunson—who sprinted through the rat race only to realize the lane they’re given has a dead end.Overcompensatingis that for Skinner, a real showcase for his skills and sensibilities. “I think I have a different way to give myself this chance and to also give the people who I'm really inspired by a chance,” he says. “Maybe I get to show you something that you didn't know was there, thatIreally know is there.” Of course,putting the story down on the page is just one part of it. Next was building the team that would allow Skinner’s universe to come to life. After finishing his script, he began the process of bringing in his collaborators—one of the most crucial ones being Charli XCX. Skinner ended up pitching the show to the pop star at a party they were both at. “I had like two drinks that night, so I was fucking shit-wrecked,” he says. “She's like, ‘That's random as fuck, send me the script. Like, I can't believe you're telling me this at a party. Weird.’” Charli ended up signing on, as an executive producer, music producer, and as one of the show’s most memorable guest stars, playing a petulant diva version of herself begrudgingly playing a set for drunk college kids. “I'm going to make you a psycho bitch,” Skinner remembers telling her about the role. (His dream pop-star cameo next season? Lorde. “That's my hero,” he says. “The songwriter of our generation.”) Around the same time, he landed crucial partners in A24 and Jonah Hill’s Strong Baby Productions, eventually finding a network and coproducer in Amazon Prime Video. Rish Shah steals hearts as Miles, the sweet British film bro of Benny’s dreams. AsOvercompensatingwent into preproduction, buzz around the show and its hot script began to build in LA. “I just remember there were some rumblings around town,” Rish Shah, who plays Miles, says in a video call. “Everyone I know was talking aboutOvercompensating. Literally everyone I know was taping for it, everyone was going up for it and excited about the scripts—which is rare…. This was just so refreshing and it had a very specific stamp on it.” Baram remembers first reading Skinner’s script. “The pilot script that I read is such a perfect pilot script,” she says over a video call. “When I have friends in the future that are like, ‘I'd like to write a script,’ I'll definitely send them that script.” Though Baram was initially referred to Skinner by A24 as a potential writer, after seeing her perform stand-up, he had a totally different vision in mind. “I went,that's Carmen,” he says. For her part, Baram never thought it was a real possibility. The only real acting credit she had to her name was a Comedy Central sketch where she had a small role as a jogger who yells, “Get out of the way!” She calls herself “chaotically unprepared to act,” especially as the female lead of a TV show that was quickly shaping up to be a hot commodity. “You do this enough times where you're like, there's no way,” she says. “And then it came to fruition and I was very much stunned.” (She also ended up in the writers’ room.) “That used to be what TV was all about, launching people,” saysPEN15veteran Daniel Gray Longino, who directed half of the season. “You'd start a show and you'd know them as their characters, and then they would become huge stars.” Barone, meanwhile, gets the honor of playing this production’s Marnie Michaels—Benny’s sister Grace, a pretty, prissy know-it-all with major gaps in self-awareness. And true to form, Barone’s Grace gets her ownMarnie-singing-“Stronger”moment. OnOvercompensating,that comes in the form of a scene where Grace, back in their hometown and facing the peers who shunned her, tears into a cathartic karaoke performance of My Chemical Romance’s 2006 hit “Welcome to the Black Parade,” finally coming alive through the emo classic’s operatic emotion. Owen Thiele plays George, a proudly out gay student. Barone, who on the show carries herself with the bearing of ’90s Gwyneth Paltrow, even when dressed as Alice Cullen fromTwilight,confesses that she has control issues. “My comedy is very controlled. I'm always presenting myself a certain way,” she says. “So for me to purposely look bad or scream-sing a song that I am actually not good at singing, he was just like,I know you can do this, and I can't wait to watch. And having his confidence in me meant the world.” Baram was similarly impressed by Skinner’s taste and willingness to collaborate. “I've worked with a couple of first-time showrunners, and I've never worked with someone like him,” she says. “Obviously, your first show is your baby. He was so willing and excited to bring in new ideas, and he trusted the people that he worked with—which is not an easy quality for a first-time showrunner” Shah, who had the task of creating chemistry with the person he technically reports to, says Skinner’s generosity made the set a dream environment. “It was really special to go to a set where every single day I would forget that he's also my boss and this is his baby and his story. We all met as equals,” he says. “Everyone showed up every single day with a smile on their face. And I think that's why the show has these absolute zingers…. Benny has this ability to bring out the best in people.” As the nightprogresses, the music gets louder in Boxers. We’re about halfway through Madonna’s 2015 track “Bitch I’m Madonna” when two bearded men start making out at the pool table, sipping beer between sloppy kisses. Back at the bar, Javier keeps the drinks flowing, dishing out tequila and pouring beer as his clientele gets more and more restless. (It’s still only, like, 6:30 p.m.) Skinner is telling me about acting with the legendary Kyle MacLachlan when, suddenly, the unmistakable opening bars of Britney Spears’s “Crazy”—massive Max Martin piano chords like a jackhammer—plays over the speakers. Skinner is suddenly activated, fighting the impulse to give in to the song. “Can you imagine that?” he asks me, motioning to the stripper pole to our right. “Two seconds…I'm on!” “That used to be what TV was all about, launching people,” saysOvercompensatingdirector Daniel Gray Longino about the show’s cast. “You'd start a show and you'd know them as their characters, and then they would become huge stars.” Toward the end of our time at the bar, I tell Skinner that this moment in his career reminds me of Tina Fey’s viral “I Don’t Think So, Honey” monologue fromLas Culturistaslast year. “I regret to inform you that you are too famous now, sir,” Fey advised Bowen Yang, months away from his turn in the blockbusterWicked,about being too honest in his work. “Sshhhh, quiet luxury…. Authenticity is dangerous and expensive.” It’s a quandary many superstar comedians find themselves at a certain point: So much of the best comedy comes from being an outsider, from the perspective of someone who didn’t have a table in the high school cafeteria, who stands right outside the velvet ropes. What happens when a comic is no longer on the outside? When the celebrities you used to impersonate are now peers? For now, being incredibly busy has become a Band-Aid solution for Skinner. With all the work making and now promotingOvercompensating,he just hasn’t had the time to dip back into his elaborate impressions. “I haven't really done one in a while—and I do kind of feel like I sleep better at night,” he says with a laugh. In any case, in this phase of his career he’s more interested in mining his own life for his art—and enjoying being able to be himself, no props required. “We've stopped overcompensating a little bit,” he says.",

    "article_text": "Imagine Luchino Visconti and Coco Chanel talking about cinema at Villa Erba in Cernobbio, Italy. That atmosphere inspired theFrench fashion house's Cruise 2025-26 collection shown at Villa d'Este last month. While taking in the sights and the new designs, actors and directors, friends and ambassadors of the maison in attendance, told us about the looks of their lives. \"As a child I had a pink and white plaid dress. It was my favorite, one of those you want to wear every time something important happens. My wedding dress, signed Chanel, really had that power: to make me feel stronger. Today, every time I can keep a costume, I do. FromHoney Don’t!, which will be presented at the next Cannes Film Festival, I managed to take home a pair of pants and a shirt tailored by an old Los Angeles tailor.” \"I’ve always liked clothes, ever since I was a little girl. I remember a dress my father brought me from Paris: I was eight years old and it’s one of my happiest memories. I still keep a sweater worn byElle Fanningwhen she was little, on the set of my filmSomewhere. A fuchsia dress I adored, instead, I gave toKirsten Dunstso she could wear it to her high school prom.” \"I like a dress to mark my life, to be sleeveless and below the knee. I know my body, I know what I want. I don't keep anything from the set: the costumes don’t speak about me, but about my characters. Except for Elizabeth Bennet’s striped stockings inPride & Prejudice. In the film you almost never see them, but they were there. To Coco Chanel, I would ask about her relationship with Luchino Visconti. When I watch his films I think: ‘What could we possibly add that he hasn’t already done?’” \"I spent so much time in Eunice Facciolla’s shoes, inI’m Still Here, Best International Film at the latest Oscars, that I ended up taking them home. They still inspire me. Just likeGiulietta Masina’s gaze at the end ofNights of Cabiriaalways has. I had never been to Lake Como. It’s a place that leaves something on you. Leonardo da Vinci, Pliny, Hannibal, Caesar, Volta, Napoleon passed through here: now I understand why.” \"I feel free when I wear a swimsuit and dive into the sea of Sicily. From the series 1992, I still keep a trench coat: I wore it in a scene where I exploded, and I didn’t want a stunt double. For the daughter I might have one day, I’ve set aside my wedding dress. In the role of Oriana Fallaci, I interviewed Coco Chanel, but if it were up to me today, I would thank her for freeing us from the corset.” \"I’ve loved many of my movie costumes, but the one I’m most attached to is a yellow sundress worn inLittle Monsters. We tried dozens of shades to find the right one for my skin tone, as well as the pattern design: it had to tell the story of a woman who brings sunshine to many children. What struck me about Lake Como was the light. I never imagined I’d visit the very place that was the backdrop to the friendship between Gabrielle Chanel and Luchino Visconti.” Original story fromVanity Fair Italia More from Vanity Fair Contact ©2025Condé Nast.

    "article_text": "Withthe 78th Cannes Film Festivaljust a few days away, many of us are eagerly awaiting to see what celebrities from all over the world will be wearing to honor the art of film. Until then, do you remember the semi-transparent Prada ensemble worn byUma Thurmanat the presentation ofPulp Fictionin 1994? OrPrincess Diana's triumphant arrival in 1987, draped in a flowing bluish gown? And what about those couples, now separated, with perfectly synchronized looks? Every year, Cannes remains the scene of a parade of gowns and jewels signed by the greatest fashion houses, to be admired on site or from the comfort of your sofa. But beyond fashion, the red carpet is a veritable showcase for the self. Each outfit tells a story. The story of a director, producer, screenwriter, actor or actress who never gave up. And for the audience, it's a suspended moment that feeds the dream, where cinema meets haute couture. Original story fromVF France.

    "title": "Which Conclave Character Is New Pope Robert Prevost Most Like?",
    "article_text": "It only took roughly 24 hours forRobert Prevost,the first American-born pope in the Catholic Church’s 2,000-year history, to be namedPope Francis’ssuccessor. That suggests the realpapal conclavewas a lot less dramatic thanthe Oscar-winningConclave,the 2024 film thatgot non-Catholics newly engagedwith this year’s selection process. It’s also been reported that some cardinalseven watched the moviefor tips on how to navigate their own sequestered voting period. And all that alleged research led 133 red-robed cardinals to 69-year-old Prevost, who took the name papal name Leo XIV from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica about an hour after white smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney. Prevost hails from Chicago, graduated from Villanova University, and served as a longtime missionary in Peru. Given those scant biographical details, it is totally plausible that Prevost can quoteFerris Bueller’s Day Offby heart or has accidentally walked by filming ofThe Bear. But there is an even more pressing pop cultural question to ask in light of Prevost’s selection: which character fromConclaveis the new pope most like? Before any sacrilegious objections can be made,an actual BuzzFeed quizto determine which cardinal best matches your character already exists. (I’mStanley Tucci’sBellini, a character BuzzFeed brands “a spineless American liberal” whom God will “probably forgive.”) And if every single woman of legal age must ask herself if she’s a Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, or Charlotte, then this question is only fair to ask of the man set to lead the Catholic Church. In truth, Prevost isn’t a perfect match for any of the film’s fictional contenders—but there are similarities for those who choose to look for them. (Or are asked by their editor to do so.) Given his American background, Prevost was considered a total dark horse candidate and labeled an “outside insider” byTimemagazine. That brings to mindLucian Msamati’sCardinal Adeyemi from Nigeria, theConclavecharacter who would have become the first African pope in history—had his messy personal life not interfered. AsTimereported, Prevost has been called “the least American of the Americans” for his international ties, particularly to South America, where he did missionary work for a decade in Trujillo, Peru. He was later designated bishop of the Peruvian city of Chiclayo, where he served from 2014 to 2023, as reported byCNN.Prevost also holds a Peruvian passport and has been a Peruvian citizen since 2015. Like Tucci’s Cardinal Bellini, Prevost served as a trusted confidant of his predecessor: Pope Francis, who appointed him head of the Vatican office that picks and manages new bishops across the globe. According toCBS News,Prevost “is considered a centrist, but on many social issues he’s seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor.” Prevost has also beencritical on social mediaof another American wholobbied for the job of pope:PresidentDonald Trump. But while Bellini’s liberal views proved too polarizing for the fictional papacy, Prevost is viewed as more of a bridge between Francis’s more liberal ideologies and those of conservative cardinals—represented in the film byJohn Lithgow’sCardinal Tremblay andSergio Castellitto’sCardinal Tedesco. Described as “a balanced alternative” byThe New York Times, in a 2012 speech before bishops, Prevost lambasted Western news media for promoting “sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,” citing the “homosexual lifestyle” and “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children.” As for whyfront-runnerCardinalPietro Parolin(the rough equivalent ofRalph Fiennes’sCardinal Lawrence in this dream scenario) wasn’t chosen,Daniel Rober,associate professor and chair of Catholic studies at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, toldNewsweekthat Prevost may have been seen as “less kind of tainted by the Vatican bureaucracy.” Taking all of that into account, as well as Prevost’sreportedly“reserved and discreet” nature, one can only conclude that, as luck would have it, our new pope is most like the fictional pope who comes out on top inConclave:Carlos Diehz’sCardinal Benitez, a dark horse who was secretly appointed to his position of power in Kabul by the movie’s late pope before his death. Both men were long shots for the title but had the faith of their leaders. Each spent long periods serving in areas far from where they were born (in the film, Benitez gives a moving speech about leading his ministry during wartime in Congo) and symbolize unity for an institution that can be ideologically divided. ConclavedirectorEdward BergerpreviouslytoldVanity Fairthat Benitez ultimately wins because “everyone seems to have seven agendas, egotistical agendas, except him. He comes to it from a place of purity and clarity and faith and love, and all these wonderful elements that a lot of the others have lost—including Ralph’s character.” Perhaps this spirit is best illustrated by Prevost’s own words, given to the Vatican’s official news site, perThe New York Times, last year: “The bishop is not supposed to be a little prince sitting in his kingdom,” but is “called authentically to be humble, to be close to the people he serves, to walk with them, to suffer with them.” MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Alan Aldaon Life With Parkinson’s,M*A*S*H,and Carol Burnett Why Are Americans So Obsessed WithProtein?

    "title": "Cynthia Erivo Went All In to Create 5 Distinct Characters in ‘Poker Face’: “The Script Looked Insane”",
    "article_text": "“Five personalities, 11 days—go,” saysCynthia Erivo.That was the mission that theWickedstar was given when she was cast in five different roles onthe season two premiere ofNatasha Lyonne’s Peacock series,Poker Face. In the episode, titled “The Game Is a Foot,” Erivo plays not one, not two, but a grand total of five different sisters—Amber, Bebe, Cece, Delia, and Felicity, with the latter being a secret sister— former child stars who each went down wildly different paths. Years after their days starring onKid Cop,Amber’s now a failed artist, Bebe a DJ, Cece a faux-French grad student, Delia an apple picker, and Felicity Price a successful artist living off the grid. Erivo had the gargantuan task of bringing each of these eccentric sisters to life. “I wanted to figure out what it would be like to compartmentalize and play different characters all at once,” Erivo says. “To see how that felt, and to challenge myself to see if it was possible.” Erivo began by focusing on each sister’s aesthetic reality, getting granular about their personal style. “Style-wise, hair-wise, and makeup-wise—what’s the journey they’ve been on?” Erivo remembers thinking. To help differentiate the sisters in her head, Erivo color-coded her script so that she knew who was speaking to whom. “The script looked insane,” she said. But even the color-coding didn’t make things that much easier. “You’re moving a mile a minute,” she says. “You’re going very, very fast, because you’re switching back and forth from characters throughout the whole entire day.” Below, Erivo breaks down her specific approach to each of the five sisters, from their hair to their voice and everything in between. Cynthia Erivo as Cece inPoker Face Vanity Fair:How did you approach creating five distinct, nuanced characters who are also siblings? Cynthia Erivo:I needed to know who each person was. As I read the script, they revealed themselves. One of them is sort of, like, over everything. One is a complete airhead and is in her own world. I knew that I wanted one to feel really grounded. And then our sweet Amber, who is totally unhinged but is trying to hold it together. Each one had a tic that was different to the other. Once I knew what it was, I could build from there. The most helpful thing was finding out what they would wear—finding out what their personality was like within those costumes. The look, the hair, the makeup, all of those sorts of things keep people very, very specific. Underneath the base of it all is my face. So they would be similar, they would be twins, but they would each be very separate and individual. How did you figure out the style for each of the sisters? Each one of them had a story to tell with the way they looked, with the wigs they wore, with the hair they had. Cece isn’t French but wants to be. I felt, in my mind, that she was very, very vain. So the hair was very, very proper. It’s very quaffed, long but wavy. The makeup is just so, as clean and tidy as possible. The dark lipstick is just right. Bebe’s more adventurous. So you had the bleached eyebrows, and the dreads, and the gold lipstick, and the makeup. I felt like she was one of those rave kids. She became a rave kid after herKid Coptime. Amber is just trying to figure it out. She’s the little harebrained artist that doesn’t really have a style of her own. Her hair, it’s grown, and it’s long, and it’s an Afro. Then you have Felicity, who ends up cutting it all off. She has no need for long hair. But she’s still very aware. So her makeup best be done. She has her piercings, and she has the cut hair, but it’s still less maintenance than everybody else. Delia, who’s just trying to keep it together, you don’t really ever see her hair. It’s always under her hat. She’s just practical. Erivo as Amber impersonating Felicity Price inPoker Face How did you figure out each character’s voice? I wanted to make sure that each one of them had a tune. Amber’s pitched up higher; it’s like her feet are never on the ground. She’s always wanting something. She doesn’t quite know who she is. She’s always trying to please. It’s that interesting thing that we do with our voices when we don’t want to offend. We send it up into the head, because we don’t want to offend. And Amber is that. Whereas someone like Cece—she’s so in her body. She’s so “I’m French, I don’t want to please everybody. I want to be here as someone who’s very chic.” Someone that takes her time with the way she says things. Delia is so on the ground because she has to be. There isn’t really any pretense around her. It just is what it is. She’s very connected to who she is. And that goes for Felicity, who is even deeper because she knows who she is. She isn’t trying to please. In fact, she lives on her own, so there is no one to please. There’s no one around her a lot of the time. She’s given up a bunch of things to find out who she is. And then you have Bebe, who is like air. It’s very Valley Girl. It’s like, “I don’t really care. I’m sort of bored by everything.” Which of the sisters was your favorite to play? I loved Delia because she was so sweet. You can’t help but root for her. You really want her to win. But those two silly sisters, Cece and Bebe, are just ridiculous. I loved playing them because they’re so far away from me. They’re just so diametrically opposed to who I am that being in those characters and those bodies just felt really fun and crazy. I would love to explore what they become and what their lives are. I can’t imagine that they’re not fun. Erivo as Bebe inPoker Face What was it like working with Natasha? She was so sweet. She would be in the room, and I would leave and then come back as someone else. She’d just be like, “This is insane, to see you come in and fully be the other person.” The idea that she was always able to interact with whichever new character came into the room, just so openly and easily, was so much fun. It was really, really cool to be able to work with someone who had that much room for that many characters coming from one person. We still joke about it today, she and I. Like, “What the heck? How did that even happen? How did it get pulled off?” What was it like diving into comedy? It was nice to stretch the comedy chops. It was nice to play in that space, because I haven’t really had the opportunity to do that. And it was nice to feel out the style. I didn’t realize that sort of vaudevillian, broad farce was going to work. It felt really good and really natural to do. It was great. You are a very talented artist, but you had to play a particularly bad artist in Amber. What was that like for you? I know. I felt so bad for her. You have to have real empathy, because I don’t thinkshethinks she’s a bad artist. I think she thinks she’s amazing. I think she thinks what she’s doing is wonderful. That’s where you have to have empathy for her, because you know it’s absolutely horrific, terrible. But she’s put so much energy into them, and she believes that she is just as good as Felicity and should have just as much praise for her work. She’s really dedicated to all those spangles. She thinks they have just as much of a place in the world as her art. And it’s so deeply sad. Like, poor little Amber.

    "title": "Joe Biden Still Thinks He Could Have Won in 2024",
    "article_text": "It’s been fewer than four months sinceJoe Bidenoccupied the highest office in the land, but so much has changed in the time since that it feels like much longer. The only thing thathasn’tseemed to change, in fact, is the former president’s act. Appearing onTheViewThursday, alongside former first ladyJill Biden, the Democrat nominally took responsibility forDonald Trump’s return to power: “I was in charge, and he won,” Biden allowed. But he continued to stubbornly insist that he could have beaten his rival—and that, at 82, and declining in the public eye, he was still up for the job of the presidency. “He still got seven million fewer votes,” Biden said of Trump, when asked if he still thinks he would have won the 2024 race, which he exited after a disastrous debate performance that underscored public concerns about his age. About that debate: “I had a bad, bad night,” Biden maintained. But “we were not going to let 90 minutes of a debate define his presidency and all those years of service,” his wife added. Of course, that’s precisely what happened. For his decades in public life, for his initial triumph over Trump in 2020, and for the successes at the beginning of his term, his legacy will be defined by a hubris that paved the way for Trump’s even more destructive return. That hubris was on full display Thursday, as he was asked by co-hostJoy Beharwhy Trump so frequently invoked Biden’s name: “[Because] I beat him,” Biden quipped, doing his bestClint Eastwood. “I’m used to dealing with bullies.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Biden's interview was reminiscent of the “watch me” defiance he showed during the second half of his presidency and the end of his campaign, as he downplayed his own negative polls and public perceptions about his capacity to serve. That was tone-deaf at the time. But it's even more so now, with Trump exerting his expansive vision of executive power from the White House and more robustreportingon the extent of Biden's senescence. “There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said of his reported decline. “If you look at things today,” the former first lady added, “give me Joe Biden any time.” Therein lies the issue.Of courseJoe Biden would be preferable to what we have now. But that’s a reflection of how catastrophic Trump has been—not of Biden’s deservedness of a second term. Many in the Democratic Party—reeling from the 2024 losses they suffered downstream from his failed candidacy—have begun reckoning with that, seeking to present a more affirmative case for their party beyond Trump’s obvious awfulness. Biden and his circle do not seem to have absorbed any such lessons. The former president’sViewappearance Thursday was the second stop of his burgeoning “Miss Me Yet?” tour, following a BBCinterviewin which he rehashed a familiar criticism of Trump from his campaign: “That’s not who we are,” he said. It was orchestrated, Politicoreported, by a former member of his press office,Chris Meagher, whom he is said to have hired to burnish his reputation, amid criticism over thedifficult positionhe putKamala Harrisand the party in last cycle. “If Biden goes and does the interviews, we see a rested and relaxed and thoughtful Biden, that could play very well,” Democratic consultantCaitlin Legackitold the outlet. And Biden did seem relaxed, even getting off a couple zingers at his successor’s expense, as when Behar noted that Trump had claimed the pardons he issued at the end of his presidency were “vacant”: “Oh, he’s vacant,” Biden said. But so, too, is this legacy project of his: Biden is not running for office. He’s not likely to be a particularly effective surrogate for future Democratic campaigns. The only person to benefit from this image-rehabilitation effort is, of course, Biden. And, after a bruising campaign that hinged in many ways on his own pridefulness, perhaps it is time to move on: “There are a lot of young and dynamic leaders in the Democratic Party who are focused on the path forward,” as one Democratic operative told Politico. “It’s better we focus on them, instead of an old man trying to convince himself and America he isn’t responsible for Donald Trump’s reelection.” MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Alan Aldaon Life With Parkinson’s,M*A*S*H,and Carol Burnett Why Are Americans So Obsessed WithProtein?

    "title": "The New Pope, Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, Is the First American Pontiff",
    "article_text": "“Peace be with you all,” saidRobert Francis Prevost,the first US-born pontiff, on Thursday, after he was elected the 267th pope of the Roman Catholic Church, taking the name Pope Leo XIV. “I would like peace to reach your families, all peoples, the whole earth.” Cardinal Prevost, speaking in Italian and Spanish and not in English, embraced his fellow cardinals, who chose him as the successor ofPope Francis, and was quick to quote his predecessor. “We still retain in our ears the voice of Pope Francis, who blessed Rome, and the whole world, on Easter Day. Allow me to follow up on that same blessing. God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail,” he said. “The world needs his light. Humanity needs him as the bridge to be reached by God and his love. Help us to build bridges with dialogue, to always be at peace. Thank you, Pope Francis.” Prevost was born in Chicago on September 14, 1955, into a family of Spanish, French, and Italian descent. He studied at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, graduating with a degree in theology. His story will likely resonate with and unite the entire American continent, which has the largest number of Catholics. In 1977 he entered the novitiate of the Order of St. Augustine, in the province of Our Lady of Good Counsel, in St. Louis. At the age of 27, he was sent by the Order to Rome to study canon law at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (the Angelicum). Then, in August 1981, he made his solemn vows. He received priestly ordination on June 19, 1982, received his licentiate in 1984, and was then sent to work in the mission in Chulucanas, Peru. In 1987 he received his doctorate with the thesis “The Role of the Local Prior of the Order of St. Augustine.” In the same year he was elected vocations director and missions director of the Augustinian Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel in Olympia Fields, Illinois. In 1988 he was sent to the mission of Trujillo as director of the common formation project for Augustinian aspirants from the vicariates of Chulucanas, Iquitos, and Apurímac. In 1999 he was elected prior provincial of the Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel in Chicago. After two and a half years, the Ordinary General Chapter elected him prior general, a ministry the Order entrusted to him again at the 2007 Ordinary General Chapter. In October 2013 he returned to Chicago to be teacher of the professed and vicar provincial, positions he held until Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of Peru’s Diocese of Chiclayo in November 2014, elevating him to the episcopal dignity of titular bishop of the Diocese of Sugar. He took canonical possession of the diocese on November 7 in the presence of Apostolic NuncioJames Patrick Greenand was ordained as bishop on December 12 at the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, in the cathedral of his diocese. He has been bishop of Chiclayo since September 2015 and has served as second vice president of the Peruvian Bishops Conference since March 2018. Pope Francis had appointed him a member of the Congregation for the Clergy in 2019 and a member of the Congregation for Bishops in 2020. On April 15, 2020, the pope appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Callao. And since January 30, 2023, Prevost has been prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Then, on February 6, 2025, Francis promoted him to the Order of Bishops, assigning him the title of the Suburbicarian Church of Albano. Original story fromVanity FairItalia.

    "title": "Trump Thinks His Interiors Mirror Versailles. This Expert Says They’re Giving Robber Baron.",
    "article_text": "“Nothing gold can stay,” an American poet once wrote. But Robert Frost?Donald Trumpdoesn’t know him. “You see the new and improved Oval Office,” the president said to Canadian prime ministerMark CarneyTuesday in between “friendly” threats toannex his country. “As it becomes more and more beautiful with love—you know we handle it with great love—and 24-karat gold, that always helps too.” He showed off the gilded renovations toLaura Ingrahamin March, pointing at the cherubs on the walls, saying, “They’re gold, all gold, look.” Trump’s love of all things ormolu is not breaking news. Earlier this year he boasted about his Mar-a-Lago ballroom, famously one of the places where he stored boxes of allegedlyclassified White House documents, saying, “I’ve got more gold in that ballroom than anybody’s ever had in a ballroom before.” But as his loud appreciation of rococo-esque decor coincides with sweeping tariffs, abillionaire boys club, and rising economic panic, Trump’s White House has been drawing comparisons toVersailles, and the president to its most famous residents—King Louis XIV and his descendant-in-law Marie Antoinette—from detractors and acolytes alike. Versailles Mirrored: The Power of Luxury, Louis XIV to Donald Trump Bloomsbury In April, Trump special envoySteve Witkoff—the longtime friends share a history of real estate investments andPutinapologia—left a table of European officials all but speechless as he sat in the 18th-century Élysée Palace’s Salon des Ambassadeurs, gazed ceiling-ward and mused, “You know what this looks like? This actually looks like President Trump’s club at Mar-a-Lago.” Trump had his own Marie Antoinette “let them eat cake” moments last week when he scoffed at his constituents’ concerns over high-priced daily items, saying that Americans should limit themselves to five pencils, that children should acceptfewer dolls, and that, falsely, the only items that have hiked in price are “the thing that you carry the babies around in.” (Strollers.) Robert Wellington,director of the Centre for Art History and Art Theory at the Australian National University, and an expert on the court of Louis XIV, has been tracing the links between Trump and the palace of the Sun King since 2016. This fall, he’ll publish the fascinating historyVersailles Mirrored: The Power of Luxury, Louis XIV to Donald Trump(Bloomsbury). And while Trump has said that he modeled$7 million of gold leafin Mar-a-Lago’s ballroom off of Versailles, Wellington sees Trump’s aesthetics somewhat further removed. “Rather,” Wellington writes inVersailles Mirrored,“they belong to an American tradition for the newly rich to signal their social ascension by quoting and collecting the art and design of old-regime France.” His hotels “appealed to a certain kind of buyer who was keen to cultivate the appearance of wealth,” and in Trump’s hands, historic codes flatten into a stylistic endeavor “that looks expensive above all else.” The result, Wellington tells me, gives an impression less Versailles than “Nouveau Gilded Age.” “The sense of the robber baron gets closer,” he says of Trump’s aesthetic, “than the sense of the prince.” Here, Wellington discusses what he sees as the historical precedents closest to Trump’s aesthetic endeavors: kitsch, dictators, and a striving social class system. Vanity Fair:You write in the book that Trump is far from the first American to fall in thrall to the aesthetics of Louis XIV’s court. Who are some of his American predecessors? Robert Wellington:It’s very hard to pin down a Versailles style, but the first person to bring it to the East Coast of America, or at least this is the credit, is Alva Vanderbilt, who’s an absolutely brilliant figure. The main character in the popular TV showThe Gilded Ageis based on Alva. Alva came from a Southern family, the Beaumont family. She traced her ancestry back to France. She was a Francophile through and through. She marries one of the scions of the Vanderbilt family, and her mission in a way is to bring the Vanderbilt family a brilliant reputation. She makes the connection to the fact that patronage can be a way to make your family have the prestige to be remembered in history, like the Medici. So she employs Richard Morris Hunt, who is an American architect who studies over in Paris in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, [and] they build the Petite Chateau, which is this famous building on Fifth Avenue, which is gone now, but it has a French Renaissance staff façade. She famously pulls one over Mrs. [Caroline] Astor and the Four Hundred by throwing the most glamorous ball that New York has ever seen; [it] apparently cost her $1 million in that day. She knows how to create a scene, not only through events, but also through architecture. And by the way, Morris Hunt goes on to design the façade of The Metropolitan Museum. So these figures that create the grandeur of New York come through this historicist moment in France. There’s so much more you could say about the Gilded Age and French style, because of course Alva’s a trendsetter, but then it takes off, and then everybody’s building in this style and they’re employing this firm Jules Allard et Fils, an American French company that specializes in historical recreation. All the rich people start using them to deck out their places with a mixture of antiques and reproductions in these historical styles. The grand style of New York, I argue, comes through that. Because you’ve got these palaces, the townhouses of the rich in New York, but there is this moment at the end of the 19th century when you get the first apartment buildings, and then the first luxury hotels. In my mind, that’s where I’ve come to with the Trump aesthetic, if you can call it that, is that it’s part of these codes of luxury that are part of the fabric of New York. Robert Wellington That’s so interesting. The fact is that he’s actuallybuyingthese hotels, and not really doing them justice. Even though he makes claims to loving the Louis XIV style and all of those sorts of things, he doesn’t preserve Gilded Age places when he buys them. It’s kind of obvious that he’s not somebody who’s looking in a scholarly way at the history of style, but the codes are there. It’s the surface codes that he reads into [to determine] what’s a glamorous, beautiful hotel foyer. But the interesting thing for me as an art historian is, well, the history of why these hotel foyers look glamorous. It’s because they’re trying to look like palaces, the palaces of the Gilded Age that reflect the palaces of the Old World. Having just watched the Oval Office tour with Laura Ingraham, and watching Trump point to things and say “gold, gold,” that couldn’t really be further from the kind of historical interest that it sounds like all of this is grounded in. The trinkets that he’s putting around, the little cherubs above the doors, the little appliqués—I mean, these have been picked apart. You can get copies of these pretty cheap from Temu, or whatever. And he’s also got this thing about telling us how much gold costs. Well, I don’t think he really knows, because gilding isn’tthatexpensive—obviously there’s a lot of it. But it’s taking the surface and trying to reconstitute it as the thing. So he’s imagining that these thingsaregold. I think you’ve just called that straight-up kitsch before. Yeah, the kitschification…that’s really the definition of kitsch: that you’ve taken the high and you’re bringing it into the mass market. Value judgments aside, I think probably this will be familiar to people [from] their granny’s house. [Granny] might have a little gold frame, a little gold cherub, things like that. Now, is granny’s gold cherub gold leaf? Maybe not, maybe it is. But the point is that it’s pretty, it’s alluring, it’s charming, it has a sentimentality. All of these things feed in, and what perhaps might be a gildedputtion the ceiling of Versailles that represents the spirits in heaven venerating the great king becomes something very different in that context. I think Trump would hope for the spirits in heaven to venerate the great office of the president, but it becomes more like your granny’s kitsch, I would say. The Hall of Mirrors at Versailles Trump famously hung his own mug shot outside the Oval Office, and elsewhere has hung a painting depicting himself raising his fist following the September 2024 assassination attempt. How does the tenor of those images mirror or differ from the aim of portraits commissioned by Louis XIV to hang in Versailles? The portrait of the king in Versailles shows his history, but it also—my argument is, ina previous book I’ve written—does so not just for now, but also for posterity. There’s an idea of capturing history because posterity was very important for the early modern prince, this idea of how you would be remembered in history. I didn’t know about the post-ear-clip fist [portrait]. That tracks in a funny way, because it is a moment of Trump’s history, and it’s sort of heroic, or at least it’s pictured as a heroic moment. There’s a really interesting correlation there. I think it’s certainly a style of representation that I’m not sure how many other American presidents would have images of their history in the Oval Office. Now, portraits are fascinating. There’s this famous quote from Vasari, from the Renaissance: They make the absent present, they make the dead come to life. I’m paraphrasing wildly. But they have a power to them. They have an embodiment. And actually, in the time of Louis XIV, the king’s portrait, you couldn’t turn your back to it. It represented the king to such a great degree that if he wasn’t there, you had to treat it like the king. Portraiture has a lot of power, certainly in royal representation, and we certainly see that Trump uses his own portrait in interesting ways. The recent image of the pope, for example. That’s the funny thing though, isn’t it? Because it’s so glib that it de-powers. That that surface and that glibness, is [where] we can see a common trend. Taking these things and sort of throwing them out there in a way that touches upon something that we all kind of collectively understand. But there isn’t the supporting argument behind it. That’s the same with the decorative schemes that Trump uses. He wants these symbols of power, symbols of magnificence, symbols of success, and yet all of the things to back it up aren’t there. It’s like the 140-character version of Versailles. That’s ultimately the position I come to in the book, is that it’s all surface and no substance. If I’m taking a more scholarly approach to this, I would relate it to how, if you’re using cultural critical theory, the idea that in our society there are ways of—it’s actually sort of a Marxist idea—but the mystification that allows us to continue to naturalize the idea that certain people should have lots of money and power, and other people don’t. For example, Versailles is one of those forms of mystification that tries to raise the king and the court up to bemorethan, to be superlative humans, naturalizes the idea that they ought to have that power, they ought to have that kind of control because magnificence is a mystification of a system of power. What we have in the 20th and 21st century is, rather than disguising economic capital that sits behind things, and the desire to have more, rather than disguising that through all these kinds of myths of magnificence, we just have plain excess and capital. Trump obviously has this ongoing joke—or not a joke?—that he’s going to have a third term. It struck me that Louis XIV is the longest-reigning monarch in European history, at 72 years. I’m not sure that Trump is making that connection. The fact is that if we’re thinking about the history of dictatorships in the more modern world, the dictators have raised themselves up to be prince-like. The system of monarchy has to work by primogeniture, which is a way of concentrating and keeping the wealth and power in one spot. And it’s also a natural lottery whereby it’s quite clear who holds that power. After the time of the divine right of kings, you have tyrants who will take this on, who want to naturalize the order of their own power by mimicking those princely codes and suggesting that they have the office for life, and they’re kind of ordained to continue this thing. Trump, if I was to take a guess—because I don’t know that I can get inside his mind, or if anyone can—I would think that it’s simply the feedback system he’s sucked into. He’s got this base who venerates him. Given his personality type, which I think he makes very evident by the way that he talks about himself as being the greatest, he feeds on that. Note that when people say, “What about a third office?” he says, “Well, a lot of people are telling me that they really want this.” It strokes the ego. I’m not sure that he’s making the direct connection to monarchy. I think we, politically, would like to make the connection more to an unfair, undemocratic kind of system. The fact is he’s assuming that if he went up for a third term, that he would be elected again. I think he might have lost quite a few people given the policies around tax. Obviously, [the] cost of living around the world is the key point at the moment. And no matter the mystification of things getting better, it clearly isn’t.

    "title": "Lea Michele Debunks the “Crazy” Rumor That She Can’t Read",
    "article_text": "Lea Micheleis in on the joke, and apparently over it. While appearing onJake Shane’sTherapusspodcast, theGleestar addressed the long-standing internet joke and “crazy” rumor that she doesn’t know how to read: “It’s so sad and so frustrating.” Michele has spent the better part of the last decade as the subject of a persistent internet rumor turned meme that claims she never learned to read. But onTherapuss,Michele set the record straight about her impressive reading—and writing—abilities. “For everyone who thinks that I can’t fucking read, I was on the debate team,” Michele told Shane. “I would write speeches.” For the record, Michele has had some fun with the joke in the past. In February of 2023, she expressed her excitement toread her idolBarbra Streisand’s memoir,My Name Is Barbra,in a cheeky TikTok message. Michele’s post showed her looking overwhelmed in front of a screenshotted book announcement, with the caption: “265 days to learn to READ!!!!” Still, that doesn’t necessarily mean she’s a fan of the bit. After Shane asked Michele if she loved or hated the joke, theFunny Girl star said that “it depends on the day.” “Sometimes I think it’s crazy that people care enough about me that they would make up something. That someone has so little to do in their life—in their day—that they would waste it on me is hilarious to me. And then there are moments where I fucking get so frustrated by it because I’m one of the only women in my whole family to get accepted to college.” Michele explained that her mother’s side of the family was “extremely poor from the Bronx” and “not very well educated,” and that her parents moved from the Bronx to New Jersey in order to give Michele access to a better education. “For someone to minimize that, it’s so sad and so frustrating,” she said. “It’s wild. It’s really wild. It’s a crazy thing.” Michele was eventually accepted into New York University’s prestigious Tisch School of the Arts, but she decided not to go because of, you know, her budding stardom. Michele recalled the first time she heard the rumor. “I’ll never forget—the same day that that all came out,Donald Trumpsaid he was gonna punch John McCain in the face or something like that,” she said. “It was 2015 and he said something so wild, but what was trending online more was ‘Lea Michele can’t read.’” She then received a phone call fromGleeproducerRyan Murphy.“Ryan Murphy called me and he was like, ‘Have you heard this rumor?’ And I was like, ‘No, what’s going on?’” To prove once and for all that she could read, Michele grabbed Shane’s notecards and began reading them aloud. At one point she pretended not to know how to pronounce one of the words. “Oh my God, the theories,” she said. “They’re gonna be like, ‘Jake called her in advance. This doesn’t prove anything. She memorized it. She saw the cards in advance. This proves nothing.’” She name-checked best friend andSpring AwakeningcostarJonathan Groff,referencing an interview in which he addressed the rumor for her: “Jonathan did a podcast that someone was like, ‘Can Lea read?’ and his response, to me, was so funny. He was like, ‘Do you really think she can’t? What the fuck does that say about you?’” Michele added: “I have photographic memory too. How do you think I memorized all those Rachel Berry speeches?” In case you’re thinking that Michele’s photographic memory helped her cheat somehow: Stop. Move on. Lea Michele can read. Case closed.

    "title": "Daniel Lurie’s San Francisco Playbook Could Be What Democrats Need",
    "article_text": "In the past few months, San Francisco residents have been noticing small changes in their city. They’ve seen more law enforcement patrolling their notoriously troubled neighborhoods, such as the Tenderloin and South of Market. What’s more, police are making arrests for crimes like theft and selling drugs. Some say life feels safer, a sign of change that’s met with cautious optimism. “I am continuously shocked by how much cleaner the city is,” saidSam D’Amico,a tech entrepreneur who has lived there for more than a decade. “Democrats need to look at what is working in San Francisco as the model for the rest of the country.” In the 2024 election, few cities loomed larger in the Republican imagination than San Francisco. It was cast as a hellscape overrun by crime, fentanyl, and homelessness—a “cesspool,” asDavid Sacksdescribedit during the Republican National Convention, of “open encampments and open drug use.” Never mind thatKamala Harris’s campaign for presidential office was broadly moderate—her association with the Golden City, where she served as district attorney more than a decade earlier, ledDonald Trumptocondemnher as a “San Francisco radical.” Following Harris’s defeat, the prerogative for Democrats to reconsider how they were governing at a state and city level was urgent: “The first step for Democrats,” wrote theWashington Post’s editorial board ina November op-ed, is to “fix blue states.” This is a mandate that San Francisco’s new mayor,Daniel Lurie,who is front and center of many of the new changes within the city, has seemingly taken to heart. Lurie, 48, is trim and mild-mannered, with a no-nonsense approach to governing that is already shaking up the city’s entrenched bureaucracy. On the campaign trail, the moderate Democrat made bold promises, vowing to build housing, dismantle homeless encampments, revive the city’s downtown, and hold the city’s various government departments and nonprofits accountable. “We have great challenges ahead but also incredible opportunities,” Luriesaidshortly after winning the election. “[We] are going to turn around a great American city.” Lurie, who has just wrapped his first 100 days in office, is still basking in his political honeymoon. But his largely enthusiastic reception in San Francisco shows the first signs of optimism not only for a blue city that may be on track for real changes, but for the beleaguered Democratic Party at large. In Lurie, some Democrats see a model for what the party should prioritize at the national level. “There is a growing school of thought that the best thing for Democrats nationally is to show they can govern and keep people safe—that they are not obsessed with identity politics or canceling someone who disagrees with them,” saidTony Winnicker,a political adviser who, in addition to working with Lurie’s team, has advised former San Francisco mayors Ed Lee andGavin Newsom.“I don’t think Daniel Lurie is seeking this role, but the pragmatic and heads-down approach he takes to the office could be a good example when it comes to leading Democrats out of the political wilderness.” Part of Lurie’s appeal is that he is not a creature of government: He has spent the majority of his career working in the private sector, where, for nearly 20 years, he founded and oversaw a philanthropic organization that funds Bay Area nonprofits. Lurie’s political inexperience is evidenced by one of his most ambitious campaign promises: a vow to dismantle San Francisco’s bloated bureaucracy. For years, the city has been caught in a power struggle emblematic of the Democratic Party’s deeper ideological rift: between progressives determined to dismantle a system they see as rotten to its core and moderates willing to tolerate its flaws for the sake of getting things done. These were tensions that, when compounded by the pandemic, triggered paralysis. “I don’t want to use the term ‘deep state,’ but within the San Francisco bureaucracy, there is definitely an entrenched status quo,” said Winnicker. (Symptomatic of the city’s absurdist policymaking was a 2023 city-appointed reparations committeerecommendingthat San Francisco give Black residents $5 million and homes that cost $1 per family, and aproposalfor a 150-square-foot public toilet that would have cost taxpayers $1.7 million and take more than two years to build.) Whether or not Lurie can unwind the city’s sclerotic tendencies for good remains unclear. During his campaign, he repeatedly pledged to build 1,500 new beds for the homeless within his first six months in office—a goal that, while relatively straightforward, revealed his political naivete: “To make that campaign promise in the first place shows that Lurie genuinely did not understand the machine he was getting into and the weaponized incompetence he would be up against,” a San Francisco writer who covers city policy told me. “There is a sense that Daniel Lurie has no idea what’s going on and does not know how the levers of power within the city work.” (Lurie has sinceexpanded his timeline for delivering the beds, and his campaignhas broadened its definition of what constitutes a bed.) In response to this, Lurie’s press secretary pointed me to a line from Lurie’s 100-day address in which he said that building the 1,500 beds was still a goal that was within his “line of sight. It won’t be easy, but I’m never going to apologize for setting ambitious goals…We may not always hit them, but we will never stop trying.” Still, Lurie’s greenness could serve as a strategic asset. “Lurie was not a known quantity,” saidSteven Bacio,who cofounded the organization GrowSF, an advocacy group that produces deeply researched voter guides. “He has been absolutely blessed,” he adds. Lurie has been blessed, too, by organizations like Bacio’s, which supports public safety and additional housing, and which paved the way for moremoderate leadershipby helping flip the board of supervisors to a moderate majority in 2024. Yet another advantage for Lurie is the political upheaval of 2022, in which San Francisco ejected some of its most left-leaning candidates. “The city had a reckoning over which direction it wanted to go in, and it voted to have a new district attorney,” saidBrooke Jenkins,who was reelected as the district attorney in November. Jenkins is referring to her predecessor,Chesa Boudin,who, in the two-and-a-half short years he served as district attorney, came to personify the sort of whimsical progressivism that the city appears now to be rejecting wholesale. (Many city agencies—especially the police—felt that Boudin’s push to divert offenders into rehab and mental health programs clashed with his duty as the city’s top prosecutor.) To Jenkins, San Francisco has long been governed on the “staunch belief that ideology was more important than results. That’s where the party has gone wrong. You can take an ideological position, but if you can’t govern within the basic functions of that ideological framework, people will not be pleased.” On the surface, many of Lurie’s policies aren’t all that dissimilar from those of his predecessor,London Breed,a fellow moderate, who, in her final days,laid much of the institutional scaffoldingupon which Lurie is now capitalizing. (When I suggested toCharles Lutvak,Lurie’s press secretary, that many people had told me that Lurie and Breed had similar policies, he scoffed: “I don’t think anyone is seriously saying that to you.”) But there are key differences. For one, Lurie has a more congenial relationship with his board of supervisors. And he is affable: “If you didn’t endorse Mayor Breed, she wouldn’t talk to you,” saidJim Araby,a veteran labor organizer in San Francisco. In contrast, when Araby told Lurie that his labor union would not endorse him, Lurie was unfazed. “He said, ‘That’s okay. After I win, we’ll work together.’ And that’s literally what happened,” said Araby, who joined Lurie’s administration as a senior adviser on labor relations in November. Oh, and another thing: Lurie is rich. As an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, the jeans company born in San Francisco, he may be the richest person to ever run for city mayor, which, as more than one person pointed out to me, makes him “so rich that you can’t buy him.” Lurie’s mayoral bid—the most expensive in recent city history—was largely self-financed, giving him a rare degree of political independence: “He can afford to piss people off,” said Winnicker. Perhaps Lurie’s greatest advantage, though, is that he has friends in high places—especially within the tech industry. As part of his plan to revitalize the city, Lurie has assembled many of the industry’s most influential power players ina committeethat includes DoorDash cofounderTony Xu,Airbnb cofounderBrian Chesky,and OpenAI CEOSam Altman.“Daniel Lurie is encouraging tech companies to stay in San Francisco,” saidRyan Petersen,the CEO of the supply chain management company Flexport, which has offices along San Francisco’s troubled downtown Market Street. “Lurie has called me. He texted me. He shows up when companies sign a new lease. He puts in the effort.” Petersen said he was attacked twice on Market Street outside his company’s offices, which led him to stop hiring employees in San Francisco. While he is still considering leaving the city for good, he is optimistic that the new mayor will curb street violence and revitalize the city’s downtown. While the mayor has made it clear that he has no intentions to run for higher office, some, like Petersen, are hopeful. “Whoever cleans up San Francisco becomes the front-runner to be the governor of California, and whoever becomes governor of California goes on to be the front-runner to be the president of the United States,” said Petersen. “So it’s an incredible opportunity for somebody to become a national figure. I don’t know if Daniel Lurie is the guy, but I hope so.” MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Alan Aldaon Life With Parkinson’s,M*A*S*H,and Carol Burnett Why Are Americans So Obsessed WithProtein?

    "title": "Seth Rogen Can’t Believe He Got Away With the Golden Globes Episode of 'The Studio'",
    "article_text": "Seth RogenandEvan Goldbergmined many of their own experiences when creating their hit Hollywood satireThe Studio.The show features characters pulled from their own lives, likeCatherine O’Hara’s ousted studio chief—and there are plenty of true Hollywood moments, involving things like wildnotes from studio execs. But the eighth episode of the season, which aired on Apple TV+ on May 7, centers a storyline so silly it seems as though it couldn’t possibly have a basis in truth. It follows Rogen’s studio executive, Matt, as he attends the Golden Globes, where he’s obsessed with the idea of his name being mentioned in an acceptance speech. He goes to great lengths to convinceZoë Kravitz(playing herself) to name him if she does indeed win. And as it turns out, that scenario unfolds onscreen exactly as it did in real life. Rogen and his longtime collaborator Goldberg did in fact attend the Globes one year as producers on a film that ended up winning. “At the party afterwards, one of our executives was in tears. We assumed they were in tears because our film had won a Golden Globe,” Rogen tellsVanity Fair.“But after talking to this person, we realized they were in tears because they had been neglected to be thanked during the acceptance speech.” While doing research forThe Studio,Rogen and Goldberg discovered that the exec wasn’t alone. “It hadn't really even occurred to me in that way—that their names are not on the actual movie, and that there’s no official record that they contributed to the movie,” says Rogen. “It was a really prevalent theme throughout the interviews we did that you really want to be thanked by first and last name specifically—and that if you’re not, then there’s a chance that history will never associate you with these things that you feel you deserve association with.” The Golden Globes episode is also eerily accurate in many other ways, from shooting at the Beverly Hilton—where the Globes take place every year—to precisely recreating the red carpet and ballroom. Even the presenters and winners (with cameos fromJean Smart, Adam Scott, Zack Snyder,andAaron Sorkin) felt authentic. Here, Rogen talks toLittle Gold Menabout the lengths he and Goldberg went to recreate the Globes, that shockingTed Sarandoscameo, and if his friends have been reaching out when they see their stories pop up on his show. (Read on or listen below). Vanity Fair:You really captured the craziness of the Globes in very specific detail. How important was it to capture that landscape accurately? Seth Rogen:It was really important to me. When we thought of doing this episode, I could really only picture it being at the actual Beverly Hilton, in the actual room that the Golden Globes are in. We wanted it to be really immersive, and to really put the audience into the shoes of someone attending the Globes. On the grand scale of awards shows, it’s had itsups and downsas far as how reputable it is—how meaningful winning a Golden Globe actually is. But when you’re there, it’s so thoroughly realized, and the pomp and circumstance of it is so heightened that you get swept up in it. That’s something we also really wanted to show: what an endeavor it is to enter one of these award shows. How grandiose it is, and how glamorous it is, and how you would give anything to be a part of it in an official capacity. Unless you’ve been to the Golden Globes, you really don’t understand the lengths that we went through to recreate them. There was a moment where they were like, “If you want to shoot at the Beverly Hilton, it’s gonna be incredibly hard. Do you really think it’s worth it?” And we were like, “Absolutely.” Did you have to get any sort of sign-off from the Globes’ organization? No. To this day, I’m confounded and amazed by what we need legal clearances on and what we don’t. They’ll come back at you with the weirdest stuff of what you need clearance [for], but like, Kool-Aid? We didn’t get legal clearance on that and the Golden Globes. We couldn’t use it in marketing, and we had to remove some of the signage for some of the ads and stuff like that. But for the actual episode, they were comfortable with it. Which was shocking to me, honestly. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve had to get clearance for? There was a joke we did onPreacher,where we blew upTom Cruise.That was like a running gag. We exploded Tom Cruise, and they really wanted us to get legal clearance from the Church of Scientology and Tom Cruise. We told them we didn’t want to go down that road, and ultimately they let us do it. So that’s what I’ve learned: If you push back hard enough, they’ll let you do almost anything. The Studio's Golden Globes episode One of the biggest cameos in this episode is Ted Sarandos. Oh, for sure. That’s probably the biggest one in the whole season. You have this whole storyline about how he gets thanked for every project he works on, and he admits that he has that written into Netflix’s contracts. I’m assuming that’s not true? That is not true. I don’t think anyone’s actually done that. But studio heads have called the publicists and managers of people who were going to win awards and been like, “You better thank this person.” So it’s one degree outside the realm of reality. But no, I was shocked that Ted was willing to do it. I’ve known him for a really long time. I know he’s a real fan of movies. When we were makingThe Fabelmans,I would see him lose his mind when he was aroundSteven Spielberg.So he’s someone that I thought would relate to the joke of the show in a lot of ways, but is put in a position at times where people question their devotion to film. What’s funny is I was at the actual Golden Globes a few months ago, and it was after we had filmed this episode. Ted was sitting literally like seven feet away from me. AndZoe Saldañawon very early on in the evening, and as she was thanking people, she was clearly getting down the list and he hadn’t been thanked yet. And he looked back at me and gave me a look like, “Oh no, is it gonna happen?” And then like, right at the wire, she thanked him, and he gave me a look of immense relief. Seeing him is a huge surprise, since he runs a competing streamer. Was he also aware his scene would be at a urinal when he signed on? It was really funny. I just sent him the whole episode. I was like, “You’re a part of this big running joke where every time someone mentions your name, it’s like a nail in my brain.” And he emailed back within like half an hour and was like, “Yes, this is wonderful.” Zoë Kravitz has this storyline about how she pretends she doesn’t care about winning, and then obviously very deeply does. I’m sure that’s inspired by real life. It’s inspired by me. [Laughs] I mean, the truth is I’ve actually seen people with my own eyes physically practicing acceptance speeches backstage—like to an emotional T. It was so funny watching Zoë do it because we had the feed of the actual video cameras that they shoot the show with up on the wall. I was looking at it and just being like, This is indiscernible from what it would actually be like if she won the award. There is literally no difference between this performance she’s giving and what an actual award winner looks like. I’ve seen a lot of people downplay their desire to win awards, and be seduced by the desire to win. At the end of the day, I think every actor wants to win an award. You have a habit of calling out awards shows while you’re onstage. During COVID, you pointed out that the Emmys were not exactly feeling supersafe, and even at this last Globes, you pointed out how awkward the camera angles were. Have you gotten into any trouble for your off-the-cuff thoughts while you’re presenting? The Emmy people were not particularly thrilled with me that year. I for sure have not been asked to present again since that happened. I’m not a stand-up comedian by any means, but as someone who works in comedy, I think what you’re always trying to do is say the thing that hasn’t been said, but everyone is thinking. Awards shows, to me, are an especially potent opportunity to do that. At the Golden Globes, you could just see everyone in the room was like, “What the fuck is going on with this fucking camera angle?” And so if anything, I’m just praying nobody else does it. Years ago, I stopped telling them what I was going to say. I think at the 2008 MTV Music Video Awards, I got in a big argument with the people backstage about this bit we were doing. We were pretending to smoke weed onstage, and I think ever since then I’m always like, “Leave it blank. I’ll just do my thing.” Which they don’t like either. Has anyone reached out to you to accuse you of using their story as inspiration? Definitely. I think more [often] people have not wanted to accept that we have based things off of them, rather than claiming that we have based things off of them. If anything, people are like, “That’s not me though.” But I think in general they really see that it comes from a place of love.

    "article_text": "King CharlesandQueen Camillaled England in two minutes of silence at Westminster Abbey on Thursday to mark the 80thanniversary of VE day. Prince WilliamandKate Middleton,Prince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, andSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh,Anne,Princess Royal, her husbandSir Timothy Laurence,Prince Edward,the Duke of Kent, andPrince Richard, Duke of Gloucester andBirgitte,Duchess of Gloucester, all joined veterans and politicians for a Service of Thanksgiving to honor those who served in the Second World War. Catherine, Princess of Wales receives a bouquet of flowers, with Prince William, Prince of Wales after attending the Thanksgiving Service to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day at Westminster Abbey on May 08, 2025 in London, England. The King and Queen, joined by members of the Royal Family, will take part in events from May 5th to May 8th to commemorate the 80th Anniversary of VE Day, which signalled the end of the Second World War in Europe. It was 80 years ago Thursday when the nation celebrated Victory in Europe Day, now known as VE Day, and jubilant crowds gathered on the Mall at Buckingham Palace to see King George VI, the Queen Mother, and the Princesses Margaret and Elizabeth. Parties and celebrations took place around the country and the royal family made an unprecedented eight balcony appearances to mark the end of the war, with Britons calling out for the king and queen who had remained at Buckingham Palace during the blitz. King Charles III and Queen Camilla leave after attending a Service of Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey in London on the 80th anniversary of VE Day. In commemoration on Thursday, both King Charles, who served in the Royal Navy, and the Prince of Wales, who served with the RAF, wore military medals during the service and laid wreaths at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. Artifacts from the war, including a gas mask and an air raid warden’s helmet to represent the Armed Forces, were processed through the abbey. Queen Camilla, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Lancers, wore her Lancers brooch while Princess Kate was dressed in a black and white polka dot dress by Alessandra Rich, which she wore to an Order of the Garter event in 2023. The royals have been front and center of the VE day commemorations, which started on Monday with a military procession involving 1300 servicemen and women and a fly past at Buckingham Palace. Britain's King Charles III, Britain's Queen Camilla, Britain's Prince William, Prince of Wales and Britain's Catherine, Princess of Wales attend a service of thanksgiving to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, or Victory in Europe Day, marking the end of the Second World War in Europe, at Westminster Abbey in London on May 8, 2025.

The King and Queen, joined by Members of the Royal Family, will take part in events from May 5th to May 8th to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day, which signalled the end of the Second World War in Europe. On Tuesday, Queen Camilla visited the Tower of London to inaugurate a new installation of ceramic poppies being planted in the Tower’s moat in honor of those killed in World War II, while buildings across the capital were lit up. On Thursday evening, a “VE Day 80: A Celebration to Remember” Concert will take place at Horse Guards Parade. The royal family has always had close links to the Armed Forces and played a central role in the nation’s rejoicing of VE day. These are the first VE commemorations to take place without the late Queen Elizabeth II who served with the ATS during the Second World War and memorably joined the victory celebrations in the streets when the end of the war was announced by Churchill. In 2020, the Queen delivered her famous “We’ll Meet Again” speech during the COVID-19 lockdown to mark the 75thVE Day Commemorations. Dame Vera Lynn’s war time song was played at the close of Thursday’s service.

    "title": "First Look: ‘Mare of Easttown’ Creator Heads Back to Pennsylvania for ‘Task’",
    "article_text": "It turns out youcango home again. ScreenwriterBrad Ingelsbycreated one of the biggest hits of 2021 with HBO’s seriesMare of Easttown,starringKate Winsletas a detective investigating a murder in a small town outside Philadelphia. The critically acclaimed series earned 16 Emmy nominations and won 4, including best actress in a limited series for Winslet. It also earned acclaim for its accurate portrayal of this specific area of Pennsylvania, from theaccentsto the production design. Now, Ingelsby has decided to return to his home turf with his new HBO drama seriesTask. “It’s where I live now, it’s where I grew up, it’s where I was raised, and it’s where a lot of the important relationships in my life were formed,” he tellsVanity Fair.“It’s also a place that I feel like I can speak about and write about with some conviction and authority.” Task, set in working-class suburbs outside of Philadelphia, follows FBI agent Tom Brandis (played byMark Ruffalo) as he heads up a task force to end a string of drug-house robberies led by an unsuspecting family man. A true two-hander,Taskalso follows Robbie Prendergrast (Tom Pelphrey), the small-town garbage man who’s been robbing the drug houses while trying to manage his broken family life. Ruffalo's Tom Brandis is dealing with family drama in the series. Pelphrey's Robbie Prendergrast also has challenges in his family life. The story was inspired by Ingelsby’s uncle, a former priest who left his position after meeting a woman. “I’m really close to my uncle, so I’m always asking him questions,” he tells me. “Essentially, why did he leave? What’s his relationship like with God? How has that changed, evolved over time?” Ingelsby discovered that priests sometimes help out the FBI, assisting them at mass casualty events. Suddenly, he had the foundation for a character who could anchor a show: an ex-priest turned FBI agent grappling with his own loss. “That was a character that I was interested in—a man whose faith is challenged by events in his life. How does he react and respond?” An FBI source suggested that Ingelsby consider using mail carriers and trashmen as characters as well. “Those are two people that know a lot about your life, but you kind of ignore them,” says Ingelsby. “They’re invisible. But they get your bills and your mail, and they go through your trash.” A gripping drama,Taskslowly unravels two men’s troubled pasts and grief as they head toward a showdown that will have deadly consequences. That aspect of the show recalls one of Ingelsby’s favorite films: the 1995 thrillerHeat,which pits a Los Angeles Police Department detective (played byAl Pacino) against a thief (Robert De Niro). “It was a collision course of these two men, and you loved and cared about both of them,” he says. “And you knew those things couldn't coexist. That is the tension of the movie: When are they going to collide? And when they collide, what’s going to happen?” Tom Pelphrey and Raúl Castillo play good friends and garbagemen who rob drug houses inTask. Ingelsby is meticulous about details, largely because he feels a responsibility to represent his hometown accurately. “The aggregate of all those little decisions is profound,” he says. “I think in that way, I can be on set and say, ‘I don’t know if that T-shirt is right,’ or ‘I don’t think this music would be playing.’” To get it all right, Ingelsby brought a slew of technical advisers ontoTask—including an FBI agent who had formerly been a priest. He also brought in the chief of police from Easttown Township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, as well as an adviser who had been a part of a biker gang. That culture plays a significant role in the story as well. “It’s really just trying to get the audience to feel like they’re in safe hands,” he says. “I think that’s really what it’s about, so the audience can sit back and go, ‘All right, I’m comfortable with these guys. I’m going to let them build the house here.’” A biker gang is upset that their drug houses are getting raided. Tom Brandis was a particularly tricky role to cast. The audience has to believe that “there is an intellectual side—that he was a reader, that he was seeking something as a younger man, and now he’s an FBI agent,” says Ingelsby. After he’d written two scripts for the series, he met with Ruffalo and walked the four-time Oscar nominee through what Tom would do in the following episodes. Ruffalo signed on after that dinner, to Ingelsby’s relief. “He’s such a versatile actor, and what we were looking for in this part was someone that could be a dad, an FBI agent, an ex-priest,” he says. “It’s hard to do all of those. It’s very, very specific.” Martha Plimpton and Ruffalo as FBI agents inTask. To capture Tom’s state of mind, Ruffalo decided to gain weight for the role. “He’s kind of let it go in these last few months, and he wanted to tap into how that would happen in the wake of a tragedy. He is eating junk and he’s drinking, and he’s doing things that normally he wouldn’t do,” says Ingelsby. “Also, I think it helps the character to be a guy that starts out, and you don’t have a lot of faith in him as a cop.” Though Pelphrey, who plays Robbie, auditioned for his role, Ingelsby knew instantly he was the right actor for the part. He had the physicality needed for a man who would be able to break into drug houses and rob them, as well as the necessary emotional depth. “Tom grew up in Jersey. He knew these people,” Ingelsby says. “He knew this way of life. He had an understanding of the rhythms and the feel of life in this part of the world, which I think is important.” Alison Oliver and Thuso Mbedu star are members of the task force. Ruffalo and Fabien Frankel, who plays another member of the task force. Pelphrey also looks quite different here than he has in projects likeOzarkandOuter Range. The actor grew out his beard and hair to play Robbie—which wasn’t initially part of Ingelsby’s plan. “As soon as we saw him in that look, we thought, Well, we can’t tell him to shave it. He looks too good. We believe him in this part,” the creator says. Pelphrey also picked out tattoos that would specifically speak to his character. Task features a strong supporting cast that includesFabien Frankel, Emilia Jones, Thuso Mbedu, Raúl Castillo, Jamie McShane, Sam Keeley,andAlison Oliver.In many ways,Task—which hits HBO and Max later this year—is more ambitious thanMare,with gripping action scenes as well as powerful emotional moments. What matters most to Ingelsby, though, is getting the small stuff right. “It gives the audience a sense of comfort that the people who have told this story know these people, and they care about them enough to make them really layered and honest characters,” he says. “And that, to me, is important. Because I have to live here, so I better get it right.” Emilia Jones plays Maeve, Robbie's niece.

    "title": "Molly Jong-Fast Reflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame",
    "article_text": "My mother coined an expression for casual sex: the “zipless fuck.” Now think about being the offspring of the person who wrote that phrase. And pour one out for me. I grew up with Erica Jong everywhere—on television, in the crossword puzzle, in the newspaper. She was a kind of second-wave feminist, a white feminist, and (a highly educated, wildly affluent, Jewish, and somewhat out-of-touch) Everywoman. But she wasn’t an actual Everywoman, of course; she was too famous for that. Too famous, and too special. She was famous for her bookFear of Flying,and then later she was famous for being famous, and then eventually she wasn’t famous anymore. Because fame, like youth, is fleeting; it deserts you when you least expect it. The wheel of fortune is always spinning. My mother never got over being famous. Even years after people stopped coming up to us in stores, even years after she slipped from the public consciousness, the virus of fame had made her someone different. Becoming normal like the rest of us, the journey to unfamousness, was for her an event so strange and stressful, so damaging to her ego, that she was never able to process it. I’ve always floated around like some kind of Erica Jong Rorschach test. I am a repository for people’s feelings about my mother, about feminism, about the sexual revolution. My grandfather, the writer (and Communist) Howard Fast—his most famous novel wasSpartacus,adapted into an even more famous movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring my grandfather’s nemesis Kirk Douglas—had the curse too: He was unable to become unfamous, to slip back into the world the rest of us occupy, the world of emptying the dishwasher and picking up your prescriptions, and the world of not having people stop you on the street to tell you every detail of their lives. My grandfather was a best-selling author who published more than 80 books, but now no one—other than a very narrow subset of the elderly—has heard of him. I never knew my mother or grandfather in the height of their respective fames, but I did know them at the end, when they were desperately trying to claw fame back from the writers who, they believed, had taken it from them. Watching my mother’s failed metamorphosis back to normal made me a sort of fame hobbyist, like a bird-watcher without the birds. Mother and daughter in France around 1981. For the addictive personality, the junkie itch from coming off celebrity can never ever be cured, not with all the adoration in the world. Mom was never a normal person again. My stepfather, Ken, tried to keep her in the style to which she was accustomed, tried to treat her like a queen. Maybe it worked? I don’t know. I never knew her when she was unfamous. She would always say that I was everything to her. She would always tell anyone who listened that I was her greatest accomplishment in life. I always knew that wasn’t the truth. I wondered if other people had the same connection issue with her that I did. I found her distracted and disinterested. Impossible to connect with. I always just assumed this was some personal failing on my part, just assumed the problem was me, but maybe other people felt the same way—they also assumed they were the problem. It would have been helpful to have a sibling to commiserate with, but I was my mother’s only child. Everyone told me she loved me so much, but I never felt all that loved. Later on, I realized that I never felt thatanyoneloved me. ‘How to Lose Your Mother’ by Molly Jong-Fast Amazon Bookshop For my entire life, random people have come over to “talk” to me about my mom. They wanted me to know how much they lovedFear of Flying.They wanted me to know how important her work was to them. They wanted to t alk about her fame, about her inflammatory comments about sex. Sometimes they’d tell me some embarrassing thing she’d said about me on television. Sometimes they’d tell me about some embarrassing thing she’d written about me. But, starting four years ago, when I was writing forTheDaily Beastand obsessed with tweeting, things started to change. People were no longer coming up to me to tell me they had seen her onCharlie RoseorGood Morning America.(And Charlie Rose didn’t have a show anymore; he’d been canceled.) Now people were coming up to me for a different reason, for one of those hard conversations. They would seem almost apologetic. They would pause before they spoke, their voices heavy with a kind of shame, a deep kind of embarrassment. It’s always been hard for me not to find the discomfort of others deeply unpleasant. I’d encourage them to say whatever it was they wanted to—but did I want to hear it? Their voices would inevitably be hushed and perhaps a bit halting. Sometimes the person would take my hand. “How is your mother?” they would ask. And then they would offer up one of the following comments: “Is your mom…okay?” “Are yousureshe’s okay?” “She seems off.” “She can’t remember anything.” “There’s something really wrong with her.” Everywhere I went in my little neighborhood, I found myself surrounded by people who wanted to talk to me about my mother’s failing memory and her increasingly erratic behavior: at the bookstore, at the hair salon, on the corner. Everywhere I went, my mother’s condition followed me. I went to a British restaurant for dinner with my husband and a famous poet—which is kind of an oxymoron, I know—and the poet’s wife, a novelist. At the end of the dinner, the wife told me she had something to say that might upset me. “No, it’s okay,” I said. Wasit okay? Who knows. I’ve always floated around like some kind of Erica Jong Rorschach test. I am a repository for people’s feelings about my mother, about feminism, about the sexual revolution. And then, of course, there is the little issue that my mother has never had a filter. She’d always say the worst possible thing. That was one of her trademarks. Sometimes when I’d be sitting at a dinner, or watching her give a talk, a thought would pop into my mind: What is the worst possible thing she could say? And without fail, she’d say it. I remember watching in horror as someone live-tweeted her appearance at a book festival. I couldn’t control what she said or what people thought about her, but at least I could control one thing: When I was young, I decided not to read her books. I braced myself for whatever the poet’s wife was going to say. Molly Jong-Fast and Erica Jong at a 1997 film screening. She explained that she had posted a photograph of her deceased father on Instagram. She picked up her phone to show me the post. I considered the picture of the woman’s father. He looked like all deceased fathers: old. “Your mother posted a comment on the photo,” she said. “Okay.” I was so past feeling embarrassed by things my mother said and did. I lived in this kind of perpetual post-embarrassment state. I could take this. “The comment your mother wrote was ‘Neat.’ ” The woman looked as if she were going to cry. I thought about my mother commenting on a picture of someone’s dead father with the wordneat.And then it became difficult for me to think about much of anything else. I called my stepfather. He had been a divorce lawyer. He was always ready to have a disagreement—not a fight exactly, but a sort of conflict, the kind I always hated. “Hi, Ken,” I said. “Moll,” he replied. He always called me Moll. “We have to talk about Mom.” He laughed. It was a pained laugh, an uncomfortable laugh. “Mom is acting strangely,” I said. Ken cleared his throat. “Mom is losing her memory,” I said. I could hear my mother’s two poodles barking in their apartment. I’ve known Ken since I was 11 years old. I knew the throat clearing meant that he was getting prepared to lecture me about the thing everyone was telling me was true. Ken was one of those people who became a lawyer because he liked to fight, and he fought with anyone he could find. One of my more crushing childhood memories occurred when he yelled at a waiter because the restaurant didn’t have his preferred mustard brand. He gave the waiter a 20 to go to the nearest deli and buy his stupid mustard. The waiter actually did it. That’s how terrifying Ken was, but he could also be very kind. He often did my friends’ divorces and undercharged them, or didn’t charge them at all. He was never cruel to me. I did, however, feel that he believed he was put on this earth to protect my mother from me. “Look, Moll, this is a hearing problem,” Ken said. I had spent so many years arguing with him about what reality was and what reality wasn’t, and each time he would tell me my reality was wrong and his was right. I hated arguing. I hated it. “She just needs hearing aids.” “Ken,” I said. “This has nothing to do with hearing. She has dementia.” “Ah, Moll,” he said. “You know she’s just thinking of her next book.” But Mom hadn’t written a book in a long time. The last thing she’d published was a book of poetry with a publisher that seemed like a vanity press. They had asked her for a donation. I’m not an economist or anything, but I think the publisher is supposed to pay the author. And suddenly I was 13 again, begging my stepfather to get my mother to stop taking diet pills, or to have her slow down on the drinking. Everyone told me I was crazy in that case too. They would tell me that my mom didn’t drink too much; she was just tired. She was just passed out on the bed, eye makeup smeared all over her face, lipstick everywhere. She was just working on another book. She was just under a lot of pressure. Ken would inevitably declare, “Once she gets her book done, then she’ll be back to normal.” Thirty years later, and I was having the exact same conversation with him. But this time, at 44, I finally knew my reality was right and his was wrong. There was no book. There would never be another book. HerLast Tycoon,her swan song, was to be an autobiography calledSelfie.She had gotten the idea thatSelfiewas a good title because, at a memorial service for a friend, she had run into David Remnick, the editor in chief ofThe New Yorker.She had told Remnick the title, and she had decided he had liked it. It was not completely clear if this had actually happened, or happened in the way my mom was reporting it, but it didn’t matter. That was her version of the story. It was always her version of the story. “I think she’s fine,” Ken said calmly. One of the interesting things was that you could say anything to my mom and stepdad, likeanything,and they wouldn’t get mad at you. Ken did love fighting, but part of the reason he loved it was because he never got really angry. I told him that this was bordering on insane. I told him that everyone could see what was happening here. “She wrote ‘neat’ on someone’s Instagram post about her dead father. Like, ‘Gee whiz, that’s so neat that your father died.’ ” “Eh,” Ken said. That was one of the many baffling things about both of them—when presented with evidence that perhaps they were wrong, they would just ignore the evidence and continue on their merry way. This habit of theirs always made me feel insane. Ken was starting to display early symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. He was in denial about that too. One big difference between Mom and Ken: When Ken started losing his mind, he knew it. About 10 years ago, he had told us. He wanted us to know because he had a job, which was nominally still being a lawyer but was really taking care of my mother. He was in his 70s when he started forgetting. Found himself to be less sharp. He started going to doctors. Doctors told him he was fine, but he knew. Soon after, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Then he sort of forgot about the anxiety that he was losing his mind and devoted himself to ignoring his Parkinson’s. This tactic was a stark contrast to my mom, who was now unable to remember if she’d fed the dogs or if she’d had a phone call. Everyone who talked to Mom knew that there was something deeply wrong with her. I don’t know how many people suspected dementia. Given her dreamy nature, she had never seemed sharp per se, but—slowly, and then all of a sudden—she seemed completely lost. When confronted with this obvious fact, she would cover herself. She had many strategies. I’d misheard her; I had misunderstood her. She’d repeat a story she’d told me five minutes before, and I’d say, “You already told me this, Mom.” Her response might be a defensive “Iknow”—as if the problem were mine for not appreciating that this story was important enough for her to keep repeating. Or she might try to change the subject by distracting me. Or she might just space out. She had a whole bag of tricks. I texted my cousin Harold, who’s a doctor. I wanted to know what the symptoms of dementia were. He texted back: Repetitive questions of things discussed and answered Short term memory loss Lack any deep thought and therefore quality of conversations diminished Facts that were shared on events etc became forgotten Well, there you go. Check, check, check, check. Confirmed. One evening a couple of months later, I understood that her awareness of her condition had changed. She was sitting at the dining room table, drinking coffee and reading the paper, when I came in the room. “Hey,” I said. “Hi, darling.” She got up. Her silk robe was open and you could see her naked body. (She was never good at keeping her robe closed—this was true both metaphorically and literally.) She hugged me, she kissed me, she told me she loved me in an effusive way that was clearly not the way her own cold, mean mom did it. We sat down at the dining room table. I tried not to look at her boob, which was unfortunately somewhat visible. I spent way too much time thinking about getting older and about how ruthless the march of time was on the body. I asked her if she wanted a cappuccino. She said she was okay. “Mom, guess what?” I asked. “I saw your friend Judy at an event.” I’d just run into her old pal, the folk singer Judy Collins. Judy looked great—very thin and elegant, and dressed all in black. She smelled great too. Judy asked me how my mom was, because everyone always asked me how my mom was. I did not want to lie to Judy about my mother’s increasingly demented condition, so I just made a face and said, “Meh.” “Who?” Mom asked. “Your friend Judy. Thesinger.” There was a faraway look in her eyes. “Judy,” she said. “Judy?” I reminded her that she made Judy sing the Joni Mitchell song “Both Sides, Now” at my wedding. (Collins had a hit with it in 1968.) “Judy!” Mom declared. “Of course.” But I could tell she was lying. She had no clue who Judy was. Her voice always changed when she lied, became just the slightest bit more tentative. And then she said, “I don’t remember who that is.” That was the moment I realized she knew she couldn’t cover anymore. She still wouldn’t admit that she had dementia, but she would now occasionally admit that her memory wasn’t what it used to be. And then she kept slipping away—less and less of her in my life, less and less of her on the page, less and less of her. Soon she would be just a faint fragment of a once-great woman. She had been a force, a powerhouse, and now she was becoming an echo. But it’s very important for you to understand that Mom is one of those people who is constitutionally incapable of being honest. (She’s been in denial about her drinking since I was born, for example.) Mom couldn’t accept that she had dementia until she was so far gone it was no longer a question. But even then, she remained not convinced. Neither did Ken. “Well, we just don’t agree,” Ken told me on the phone. “I’m taking her to the dementia doctor,” I said. Erica in 1980, hard at work. My mother is just a body now. She has dementia. She has breath and hair and pretty blue eyes, but Erica Jong the person has left the planet. My grandmother, my mother’s mother, also had dementia and died at the exceptionally advanced age of a hundred-plus, running through her money with a nurse she thought was some kind of family member or friend. But that nurse had her own family. I wasn’t good about visiting Grandma. I was one of nine grandchildren, and I used that as an excuse—diffusing the responsibility—but the truth was I just hated the idea of my grandma sitting in that bed, in a state between living and dead. Or maybe I was just a bad, selfish person? Or maybe I just didn’t like old people, the reminder that death was around the corner, inching toward us. Grandma died, then Mom will die, and then I will. That’s the best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is that these things are out of order. Like my grandmother, my mother will likely continue on for the next 25 years in a state of dreamy, distracted unreality. She will become increasingly unreachable. I recently gave an interview to NPR about my mother. The interviewer and I spoke in that weird, slightly halting NPR way. I kept flipping from the present to the past tense: “She was”; “sheis.” I couldn’t quite agree with myself about if she was still on this planet or already gone. I was a bad daughter. I am a bad daughter. The horrible irony is that she has always seemed a bit demented. Maybe not demented, exactly, but distracted: dreamy, head in the clouds, and detached. When I was a little red-haired girl—like Little Orphan Annie, but fat—I would yell at my mother for “spacing out.” I used to beg her to focus, to pay attention to me. “Where did you go?” I’d ask her as she stared into space. My mother has these very glassy blue eyes. I would look into them and wonder if she saw me at all. Sometimes I’d wonder if I was real. Years later I would interview a journalist about Elon Musk, and the journalist would tell me that there was evidence to support the supposition that Musk believed he was in a simulation. The journalist continued, “A lot of rich and famous people believe that the world is a simulation for their benefit, because otherwise how could things have worked out so well for them?” I’ve been thinking a lot about this idea, that the entire world is just a simulation for your benefit. Eventually Mom would answer, but never the question I asked. She always seemed to have a sort of stock answer for even my stupidest, simplest questions, as if she were following her own script. She was always performing. Her father was a performer too—a drummer in the Catskills before he became an importer, before he started his company, the Seymour Mann Connoisseur Collection, and sold his collectible dolls on QVC. (About him, my mother said in an interview with Charlie Rose, “He had put all of his vaudeville ambitions into me.”) She would run her fingers through my hair and ask me if I knew how much she loved me. Did I know how much she loved me? Did I know how brilliant I was? How talented? I wish I’d asked her why, if she loved me so much, she didn’t ever want to spend time with me, but there was no way she’d have ever given me a straight answer. And besides, in her view, shedidspend time with me—in her head, in her writing, in the world she inhabited. Iwasthere. I may have felt that she was slightly allergic to me, but to her, she was spending time with the most important version of me. Disassociation has always been her magic trick, her way of remaining in the world but also not. Was it her chronic dreaminess that made it impossible to tell if she was merely distracted, or if she was disappearing?

    "article_text": "Consumer Council earlier accused private hospitals of a lack of transparency over pricing information and charging mechanisms Hong Kong’s health authorities proposed a raft of measures to improve price transparency among private hospitals and clinics earlier this week, in a bid to attract more people to use their services and relieve pressure on the public sector. The Post looks into why the government is taking a bolder approach to the local private healthcare sector. The Consumer Council earlier accused private hospitals of a lack of transparency when it came to pricing information and charging mechanisms, and published a study in March that looked into problems faced by patients. The consumer watchdog also said that not all day procedure centres disclosed their prices online, and the information they did share was often not very comprehensive. The information provided by the private hospitals could also be difficult for ordinary consumers to understand, according to the council. There were also discrepancies in prices for the same type of treatment in different private hospitals. For example, the bill for surgery for removing haemorrhoids varied from HK$33,881 (US$4,370) to HK$85,387.",

    "title": "Hong Kong scientists make breakthrough on needle-free flu vaccine with more protection",
    "article_text": "Professor Leo Poon says long-lasting protective effects of potential new vaccine may reduce need to receive yearly jabs Hong Kong scientists have made a breakthrough in developing a new flu vaccine that is needle-free and has the potential to induce a more robust immune response against various virus strains. The University of Hong Kong’s Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine said on Thursday that it had developed two novel vaccine approaches, each with its own characteristics and advantages that were expected to be used together to create a new flu jab in the future. Professor Leo Poon Lit-man, chair of public health virology, said the long-lasting protective effects of its nasal vaccines could reduce the need to receive yearly jabs, with more research to be done to determine the exact frequency. “On mice, the protection given by the vaccine was very satisfactory compared with other live-attenuated influenza vaccines and inactivated vaccines,” he said. “We can also see that the mice had a great immune response against different types of influenza, including human and avian ones. We believe our vaccines are not required to be received every year.” Poon added that further clinical research would look into factors such as the amount of antibodies generated and how their levels declined over time.",

    "title": "Irish broadcaster requests discussion over Israel’s Eurovision participation",
    "article_text": "Ireland’s public broadcaster has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for a discussion about Israel’s inclusion in theEurovisionsong contest, as 72 former contestants called for the Israeli broadcaster Kan to be banned from next week’s event in the Swiss city of Basel. The director general of Ireland’s RTÉ, Kevin Bakhurst, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was “appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages”. By asking for a discussion over Israel’s inclusion in Eurovision, Bakhurst said, he was mindful “of the need to maintain RTÉ’s objectivity in covering the war in Gaza”, as well as “severe political pressure” on Israel’s public service broadcaster Kan from the Israeli government. Israel has been part of the world’s largest live music event since 1973, when it became the first participant not to be geographically located inEurope. There were calls for Israel’s exclusion at last year’s event in the Swedish city of Malmö, and the Irish contestant Bambie Thug was asked by the EBU to remove Ogham script from their face and legs spelling out the words “Ceasefire” and “Freedom for Palestine”. At this year’s contest, running from 13 to 17 May, Israel will be represented by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old singer who survived the Hamas massacre at the Nova music festival near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. Hamas’s attacks on Israel that day killed 1,200 people and led to the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed more than 52,000 people. In an open letter to the EBU this week, 72 musicians, lyricists and performers associated with the contest called for Kan’s exclusion, alleging the broadcaster was “complicit in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza and the decades-long regime of apartheid and military occupation against the entire Palestinian people”. A document linked to in the letter cites several incidents of Kan journalists allegedly endorsing military action or boasting about the destruction of Gaza as evidence of the broadcaster’s complicity. The performers said Kan’s inclusion would “allow music to be used as a tool to whitewash crimes against humanity” and would amount to double standards since the EBU has banned Russia from the event since 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine. Signatories included former Eurovision winners such as Portugal’s Salvador Sobral and Fernando Tordo and Ireland’s Charlie McGettigan, as well as the British singer Mae Muller, France’s La Zarra, and last year’s competitors Ásdís of Iceland and Gåte of Norway. Six European foreign ministers – from Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia and Spain – made a joint statement on Wednesday expressed their “grave concern about the reported Israeli plans to expand its military operations in Gaza and to establish a prolonged Israeli presence in the strip”. The EBU has previously said none of its members had publicly opposed Kan’s participation in Eurovision. A spokesperson said in a subsequent statement: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. The EBU is not immune to global events but, together with our members, it is our role to ensure the contest remains, at its heart, a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music. “We all aspire to keep the Eurovision song contest positive and inclusive and aspire to show the world as it could be, rather than how it necessarily is.”",

    "title": "The Dune: Awakening team is confident servers won't implode at launch: 'This is not our first rodeo'",
    "article_text": "\"Rest assured, there will be thousands of servers grouped together in hundreds of Worlds available at launch,\" Funcom said. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's something we've seen happen so many times previously it's now an expected part of gaming: the launch of a highly-anticipated multiplayer game and the immediate failure of that game's servers to handle the massive influx of players on day one. Survival MMODune: Awakeninghas aweekend betabeginning tomorrow and a full launch planned for June 10. Will it suffer the same server issues as so many other games before it? Developer Funcom wants to preemptively settle your nerves. \"We’ve seen several comments expressing concerns about server load and queues,\" Funcom said in apost on Steam. \"We certainly expect heavy loads at launch, and that is why we are preparing accordingly.\" Noting that full servers are \"impossible to completely avoid,\" the developer said \"there will be thousands of servers grouped together in hundreds of Worlds available at launch,\" spread out across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, adding that it'll be able to \"spin up more\" servers if necessary. \"This is not our first rodeo, we’ve launched several MMOs and survival games over the past 25 years, and we have a robust set of tools and processes in place, managed by an experienced live operations team,\" Funcom said. I love the confidence, but I feel like I've heard other developers and publishers claim they have systems in place that can handle things if more players show up than expected. And to my memory, no matter how good the plan is for day one, things can and usually do go awry. In fact, day one server woes seem to be getting more common instead of less over time. We even deemed 2024 \"the year of server issues\" because it happened again and again: the launch of a big game followed by players gnashing their teeth because they couldn't get online. We saw it with games like Helldivers 2, Last Epoch, Palworld, Nightingale, and Microsoft Flight Simulator: they all quickly faltered under the strain of a massive influx of players and had to scramble to get the problems fixed. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That can take time. It was a couple of weeks before Helldivers 2 sorted itself out. Microsoft Flight Simulator was completely unplayable for nearly everyone for its entire launch day. Last Epoch had been playable in early access for years and was still caught off guard when one of its services unexpectedly failed during its 1.0 launch. Even with a plan in place, Funcom is already warning players of potential issues, particularly one that every player dreads: \"you will join a server queue when logging in\" if a player concurrency cap is reached, Funcom said. Funcom also suggests maybe that isn't a bad thing? \"Commonly, survival games don’t offer this, and you are left having to wait and hope you are able to click fast enough when a slot opens up,\" Funcom said. \"By adding a server queue functionality, you can simply click once and rest easy knowing that you will get in when a slot becomes available to you.\" We'll see how the beta goes this weekend: Funcom has released \"tens of thousands\" of beta keys which sounds like a healthy amount for a real stress test. But even that probably won't come close to the full launch in June, which could attract potentially hundreds of thousands of players. Even if it's not your first rodeo, you can still get thrown off your horse. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "German companies acknowledge responsibility for Nazi rise to power",
    "article_text": "Dozens of Germany’s most prominent enterprises have acknowledged their responsibility for allowing Nazi tyrant Adolf Hitler to rise to power. In a letter published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the corporations, including Siemens, Uniper, and Volkswagen, have admitted that their forebearers’ greed and silence contributed to Nazi crimes. “The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 would have been unthinkable without the failure of the decision-makers of the time in politics, the military, the judiciary, and the economy,”the collective statement marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe said. Many German companies“contributed to consolidating the Nazi rule”and were“complicit”in the Third Reich’s crimes as they were solely driven by the desire to make profit, the document added. The list of signatories included a total of 49 brands, including Adidas, Bayer, and BMW, as well as several major German banks, Deutsche Bahn, and Lufthansa. The companies stopped short of taking direct responsibility for the crimes of their predecessors and said instead that they“assume responsibility for making the memory of the crimes of the Nazi era visible.” “In 1933 and beyond, too many remained silent, looked away,”the companies said, adding that this past silence“imposes responsibility… for the past, the present and the future”upon them. The companies vowed to“stand against hatred, against exclusion, and against anti-Semitism”and called for the“achievements”made by the EU after the end of the Cold War to be protected. The murky Nazi-era history of the biggest German corporations and families that largely control them has repeatedly appeared in the media. In 2022, former Bloomberg journalist David de Jong released a book titled ‘Nazi Billionaires’, which detailed the ties of companies such as Porsche, Volkswagen, and BMW to the Third Reich. According to the book, Germany’s biggest automakers are still controlled by families that profited from Nazi rule. Some of their holdings include American brands ranging from Panera Bread to Krispy Kreme, in addition to luxury hotels across Europe. “Businesses and many families in Germany were never really de-Nazified,”de Jong said at the time, adding that companies are only transparent when they are no longer controlled by the families of former Nazi collaborators.",
