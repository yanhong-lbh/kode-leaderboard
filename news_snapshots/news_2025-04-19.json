    "title": "Rap sheets, photos of suspected Tren de Aragua gang members Trump admin tried to deport before SCOTUS ruling",
    "article_text": "Victor Avila, a former HSI supervisory special agent, joins ‘Fox Report’ to discuss the latest news coming out of the Trump administration’s illegal immigration crackdown. The Trump administration on Saturday released the rap sheets and photos of alleged Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members detained in Texas who the administration is trying to deport. The suspects of the violent Venezuelan gang were going to be deported using the recently reinstated Alien Enemies Act of 1798 before theU.S. Supreme Court(SCOTUS) ruled Saturday morning against deportations under the 18th century law. In a decision in favor of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, the administration was barred from removing Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order of this court.\" Following the ruling, Trump administration lawyers filed an opposition to the request to block the deportations, noting the government provided advance notice to detainees prior to removals, and they had adequate time to file habeas claims. At a minimum, attorneys argued the court should limit the administrative stay to removals. 5 ALLEGED TREN DE ARAGUA GANG MEMBERS CHARGED IN RETAIL THEFTS, INCLUDING 1 SEEN SOBBING IN POLICE INTERVIEW DHS Secretary Kristi Noem toured the El Salvador prison holding hundreds of alleged members of Tren de Aragua deported from the U.S.(Credit: Pool) SCOTUS previously ruled the president could conduct deportations under the Alien Enemies Act as long as suspectedillegal alienswere afforded due process to challenge their removal from the U.S. \"These are some of the TdA gang members detained in Texas that we are trying to deport,\" a senior Trump administration official told Fox News.

LAS VEGAS –Oba Femi and Stephanie Vaquer walked into NXTStand & Deliverat the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas Saturday as champions and exited the arena with their belts still strapped around their waists. In high-octane, multi-person matches, Femi and Vaquer remained dominant. Femi defeated Trick Williams and Je’Von Evans in a triple-threat match. Femi somehow managed to power through Evans’ high-flying style and survive multiple cutters and splashes. The champion showed his strength and managed to throw Evans through the barricade at one point in the match.

Williams entered the ring and got Evans with a trick shot. Femi slammed Williams onto Evans. As Williams rolled out of the ring, Femi used the pop-up powerbomb to finish off Evans and get the three count to retain the title. Vaquer needed to dig a little deeper and fend off three dangerous women in the ring — Giulia, Jordynne Grace and Jaida Parker — each capable of taking the title away from the Chilean superstar. The match started with Vaquer and Giulia working together to take care of their opponents in the ring. Then, they went after each other. Giulia nailed Vaquer with several headbutts at one point to take advantage.

    "article_text": "Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a ceasefire in Ukraine on Easter Day. UkrainianPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyyexpressed skepticism over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement Saturday that Russia would observe a temporary ceasefire during the Easter holiday. After the announcement, Zelenskyy posted on X that air raid alerts were ringing outacross Ukraine, adding that Russian attack drones were detected in the skies. \"Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin’s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life,\" he wrote.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that Russia would observe a temporary ceasefire for Easter.(Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) \"That is what will reveal Russia’s true intentions, because 30 hours is enough to make headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures,\" he said. \"Thirty days could give peace a chance.\" FORMER CIA STATION CHIEF SAYS HE DOESN'T SEE PUTIN STOPPING ‘ONSLAUGHT’ AGAINST UKRAINE Zelenskyy lateradded on X, \"As of now, according to the Commander-in-Chief reports, Russian assault operations continue on several frontline sectors, and Russian artillery fire has not subsided. Therefore, there is no trust in words coming from Moscow. We know all too well how Moscow manipulates, and we are prepared for anything. \"Ukraine’s Defense Forces will act rationally — responding in kind. Every Russian strike will be met with an appropriate response.\" Late Saturday, Zelenskyy wrote that the \"Easter statements by Putin did not extend to\" the Kursk and Belgorod regions of Ukraine, where he said \"hostilities continue, and Russian strikes persist. Russian artillery can still be heard in certain directions of the front, regardless of the Russian leader's promise of silence. Russian drones are in use.\" He acknowledged, \"In some areas, the situation has become quieter.\" Zelenskyy said the \"proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table — the answer to it must come from Moscow. Ukraine, together with our partners, is ready to move toward peace as constructively as possible, but same readiness is required from Russia.\" The war has raged for more than three years and cost the lives of tens of thousands of people on both sides after Russia invaded the sovereign country in February 2022.

    "article_text": "Dr. John Whyte, WebMD's chief medical officer, talked to Fox News Digital about tips for protecting against measles transmission during the recent outbreaks. TheVirginia Department of Health(VDH) recently reported the state's first measles case of the year, identifying the patient as a child under 4 years old who recently traveled internationally. While the department released limited information about the patient, it confirmed the child lives in the northwest region. Health officials are coordinating efforts to identify anyone who might have been exposed, according to a news release from VDH. Measles outbreaks have been declared in eight states, the most recent announced Thursday in Michigan. MEASLES OUTBREAKS NOW DECLARED IN 8 STATES, INCLUDING MICHIGAN'S FIRST IN 5 YEARS A patient with measles(iStock) TheMichigan Department of Health and Human Servicesand Oakland County Health Division confirmed the first case of measles in Oakland County March 14, and the state is up to eight cases detected this year. \"This first case of measles in Virginia this year is a reminder of how easily this highly contagious disease can spread, particularly with international travel,\" said VDH epidemiologist Laurie Forlano. Forlano said theMMR vaccinationremains the best defense against measles and is \"safe and highly effective\" at protecting people and preventing outbreaks. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. \"We urge Virginians, especially those planning to travel, to check their vaccination status, talk to theirhealth careprovider and get the MMR vaccine if needed,\" she said. MEASLES OUTBREAK CONTINUES: SEE WHICH STATES HAVE REPORTED CASES A measles advisory is shown on a bulletin board outside Gaines County Courthouse in Seminole, Texas.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Anyone who was at the Kaiser Permanente Caton Hill Medical Center Advanced Urgent Care from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday or at the Kaiser Permanente Fredericksburg Medical Center Pediatrics Department from noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday may have been exposed, officials said. Those who received a measles-containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine available in other countries), may be at risk of developing measles. However, those who received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine or were born before 1957 are protected and do not need to take any action. In Virginia, about 95% of kindergartners are fully vaccinated. IS MMR VACCINE SAFE FOR KIDS? DR. NICOLE SAPHIER ADDRESSES CONCERNS AS MEASLES CASES RISE A child receives a vaccination in Los Angeles March 25.(Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) However, infants who are too young to be vaccinated and others who are not vaccinated are susceptible to measles. Infants 6 months through 11 months of age who will be traveling internationally or to an area wherean outbreakis reported should receive one dose of MMR vaccine prior to travel. Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the VDH. Symptoms usually appear in two stages, with first-stage symptoms seven to 14 days after exposure being a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough.

(Credit: @pslnational via Storyful / The Associated Press) As families gathered for Easter egg hunts Saturday,thousands of protesterstook to the streets in what organizers called \"A National Day of Action.\" From Anchorage to Atlanta, demonstrators rallied in all 50 states and U.S. territories, targetingPresident Donald Trump's policies. The protests by the \"50501\" movement — 50 states, one capital — were loud, sprawling and carefully choreographed, complete with Google Maps for local events and printable posters. More than 700 events were held nationwide, one of the largest single-day protest efforts since President Trump returned to office in January, The Washington Post reported. LGBTQ CHRISTIANS CRUSADE AGAINST TRUMP'S RELIGIOUSLY 'HOSTILE' POLICIES DURING HOLY WEEK In Washington, D.C., demonstrators marched and gathered just steps from the White House, waving handmade signs and chanting slogans under the watchful eyes of the Secret Service. Some held placards that said \"Hands Off Our Rights\" and \"Stop the Power Grab,\" echoing concerns over the administration’s recent use of executive orders and agency-level cuts. Protesters rally against President Trump's policies in front of the White House Saturday in Washington, D.C.(Thomas Müller/picture alliance via Getty Images) One group even distributed pocket-size copies of the Constitution, urging passersby to \"read what we’re fighting for.\" Many participants pledged to keep returning \"as long as it takes.\" The protests were timed not just for impact, but for symbolism because April 19 also marked the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the dawn of the American Revolution.

People protest in front of the White House Saturday in Washington, D.C.(Thomas Müller/picture alliance via Getty Images) One recurring protest theme was \"Hands Off!,\" referencing an earlier nationwide action April 5 and emphasizing opposition to the Trump administration. Protesters say they’re responding to Trump’s expanded use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, agency budget cuts and attempts to curb protections for groups like immigrants and transgender people. The movement has decentralized leadership and has intentionally focused on the long term. \"We’re not here for just one march,\" an organizer told The Washington Post. \"This is about building community infrastructure to withstand what’s happening in Washington.\" Elon Musk didn’t escape criticism, either.

    "title": "Illinois trans athlete policy brewing conflict within state",
    "article_text": "Nicole Georgas and Stephanie Lundquist-Arora discuss the controversy in American school districts on 'The Ingraham Angle.\" Illinois has become thelatest blue stateto ensure transgender athletes can play girls sports. Republicans in the state are aggressively trying to change that. The Illinois High School Association (IHSA) announced it will not comply with President Donald Trump'sexecutive orderto keep trans athletes out of girls and women's sports. In a public letter to state GOP lawmakers, the IHSA said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois Department of Human Rights have declared that state law requires that transgender athletes be allowed to participate based on gender identity. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Illinois is using a similar playbook to the one being used by Maine in its ongoing feud with the Trump administration over the issue, citing the state's human rights laws as a barrier to banning biological males from girls sports. \"As a result of the foregoing, compliance with the Executive Order could place the IHSA out of compliance with the Illinois Human Rights Act and vice versa,\" IHSA Board President Dan Tully wrote in the letter. Tully added that the IHSA finds itself in \"an untenable position\" as the organization seeks clarity on conflicting directions from state authorities and the Trump administration. \"There is a growing narrative seeking to politicize the IHSA’s response. However, as it plainly explains in the copy of the letter provided below, the IHSA is seeking clarity on conflicting state and federal law so that we can remain in compliance,\" an IHSA statement said. Illinois GOP lawmakers sent their own letter to the IHSA in March asking what the body will do to change policy after Trump’s executive order passed. Transgender athletes have been permitted to compete in girls sports in Illinois since 2011. TEEN GIRLS OPEN UP ON TRANS ATHLETE SCANDAL THAT TURNED THEIR HIGH SCHOOL INTO A CULTURE WAR BATTLEGROUND In response to the IHSA's recent announcement, several prominent state GOP lawmakers have spoken out in opposition to the rule. Rep. Blaine Wilhour, who led the initiative to send the first letter to IHSA over the issue, told Fox News Digital he is calling on Illinois school districts and school boards to pass local resolutions banning trans athletes from girls sports. \"I think every school district needs to make it clear that we are protecting the sanctity of girls sports, and we believe in local control of those decisions,\" Wilhour said. \"I would demand that all of your local districts take this stand and do that. Because when push comes to shove, we win on these issues, but we just need people to be bold and step out there and do the right thing.\" Wilhour condemned Gov. JB Pritzker and the Democratic majority in the state's legislature for the state's laws that enable trans inclusion in girls sports. Wilhour added that he is calling on the Trump administration to intervene and potentially cut funding in response. \"The whole policy is sick. Either you believe in fair competition or you don't. The Democrat Party today, and specifically JB Pritzker, does not believe in fair competition. They put their woke ideology over protecting girls in sports,\" Wilhour said. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER \"[The Trump administration is] going to have to engage here, and the leverage that they've got is federal funding. We take millions in federal funding from the government every year. And we don't really savor the situation where that would be withheld. … But I'll take my chances with doing the right thing. … Banning boys from participating in girls sports is the right thing to do, so we need to do the tough things to make it happen.\" Wilhour also encouraged the IHSA to overrule the state government's direction and ban trans athletes from girls sports anyway. Maine has already seen the type of intervention that Wilhour is calling for, both internally and federally. Maine School District 70 moved to ban trans athletes from girls sports and comply with Trump, defying state law, earlier this week. Maine has also already seen its federal funding cut by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Justice has launched a lawsuit against the state for its continued defiance of Trump's order. A federal Title IX investigation is already underway in Illinois after a Deerfield mother alleged her daughter was forced to change in front of a trans student. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Deerfield Public Schools District 109 is facing a probe by the U.S.Department of Education'sOffice of Civil Rights after Illinois mother Nicole Georgas brought light to the situation. She filed a civil rights complaint with theU.S. Department of Justiceafter alleging school administrators attempted to force her 13-year-old daughter to change in front of a transgender student in the girls locker room last month. She revealed the complaint during a board of education meeting forDeerfield Public School District 109last week, claiming the incident happened last month after her daughter refused to change into her uniform during physical education because a biological male student had been present.

    "article_text": "Democratic strategist Mo Elleithee warned his party against making Kilmar Abrego Garcia a \"martyr\" and suggested they focus their energy on the Trump administration \"chipping away at our rights.\" Former MSNBC host Chris Matthews told Jim Acosta on \"The Jim Acosta Show\" podcast Friday thatPresident Donald Trumpis doing the same thing Hitler did \"during the Holocaust\" by deporting alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia. During their discussion, Matthews told Acosta he had \"a nasty one\" for him after Acosta mentioned that he had to ask him \"some newsy questions\" before the two spent the rest of the show \"reminiscing.\" \"What did Hitler do in the Holocaust? He took people from Germany to other countries,\"Matthews said, to which Acosta responded, \"Yeah.\" OREGON LAWMAKER LATEST DEMOCRAT TO VISIT EL SALVADOR FOR DEPORTED ILLEGAL MIGRANT ABREGO GARCIA Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 and was issued with a deportation order in 2019. Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13.(Alex Peña/Getty Images; Fox News) The former MSNBC host continued: \"Where there was no German law. There was not even a pretense of German law, they took them to Poland or Hungary, and they kill them.\" Acosta responded by asking Matthews if there was a parallel between what he had just explained about the Nazis and the Trump administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia. \"And so when you see what’s happening right now with this El Salvadoran Gulag, I mean, this CECOT Gulag, he’s basically taking a page out of that playbook, you think?\" Acosta asked. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Matthews replied, \"Well it gets them out of the country,\" before elaborating on what he would have asked Trump and El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele during their meeting on Monday if he was present. Matthews compared the Trump administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia to tactics used by the Nazis during the Holocaust.( (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)) Later on in their discussion, Acosta accused the Trump administration of \"inflicting cruelty\" on Abrego Garcia to make an example out of him. \"There’s a component here that is deeply disturbing because it seems to be all about inflicting cruelty. It’s all about making an example out of this person and saying, ‘We’re going to be cruel to this guy, and so you better not come here. We’re going be cruel to you too,'\" Acosta claimed. \"Is that what you see in this?\" Matthews agreed with Acosta and alleged that the Trump administration is also using \"cruelty\" as a negotiation tactic with the nation's allies. \"Big time, we do that to Canada,\" Matthews alleged. \"'They’re all coming to me. They have to come to me and, quote, kiss my a--.’ I mean, that’s what he says. Why does he keep saying that? Why does he use that phrase? Because he wants to humiliate people.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. SomeColorado football alumniare scratching their heads at Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter having their numbers retired. The dynamic duo, who put the university back on the map, are having their numbers, 2 and 12, respectively, retired this weekend, less than a week before they are taken, likely in the top five, in theNFL Draft. The conversation has become polarizing, and former CU star Chad Brown weighed in. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado Buffalos quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) with wide receiver Travis Hunter (12) against the Arizona Wildcats at Arizona Stadium.(Mark J. Rebilas/Imagn Images) \"Everything's black or white — either I am a jealous, old hater who needs to cry in my old man tears, or I'm exactly right in ‘I can’t believe Coach Prime would do this,'\" Brown told TMZ Sports. But he believes \"the truth is somewhere in the middle there.\" Brown made it clear both athletes should be considered as all-time program greats. \"While Travis certainly deserves his flowers and deserves to have his number retired, to forget the greatest era in college football at CU, which I was a part of when we won a national championship, it also feels like a slight,\" Brown said. \"So, two things can be true at once. These guys deserve their flowers, but guys in the past also deserve those. Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter(Imagn) \"I'm not saying they don't deserve it. I'm saying there's lots of other deserving players who probably should come first.\" Brown also noted that the bar for Colorado isn't necessarily low. Only four numbers had previously been retired by the program. The most recent was Rashaan Salaam's No. 19 in 2017. Before that, Bobby Anderson's No. 11 was retired in 1970. UNC EMPLOYEES 'NOT LOVING THE BILL BELICHICK EXPERIENCE', LONGTIME BOSTON REPORTER SAYS \"If we were a program which handed these things out all the time, I think myself and a lot of other former alumni would look at this through a very, very different lens,\" Brown said. \"But considering how incredibly conservative we have been, and now to do it to two guys who are both on campus still — their graduating class hasn't even left campus yet — it feels a bit odd, a bit premature. And to not have some kind of waiting period, to not do any type of procedure, established norms with this, it just strikes a lot of folks as very, very odd.\" Brown added that he believes \"most\" former Buffaloes \"feel the same way that I do.\" Sanders and Hunter followed Sanders' father, Deion, from Jackson State, and while their first campaign ended in disappointment, the second season was much better. Late in the season, the Buffaloes controlled their own destiny for the College Football Playoff, but a loss to Kansas helped kill those hopes.

In a recent interview with independentjournalist Nicholas Ballasy, Wayans referred to cancel culture as a societal construct that he and many other \"real comedians\" have chosen to ignore and have kept their careers. \"I’ve never succumbed to that.

Vitamin D is widely known for boosting bone health, muscle strength and immune function, but it also has a range of other benefits — including cancer prevention. A new study published in the journal Nutrients suggests that thecommon vitaminis effective in preventing and treating colorectal cancer. Hungarian researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 50 previous studies that included more than 1.3 million participants, focusing on vitamin D’s potential effects on cancer risk, immunity and inflammation. COMMON VITAMIN SHOWN TO REDUCE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE \"The most important finding is that vitamin D plays a critical role in the prevention and treatment ofcolorectal cancer,\" study author János Tamás Varga, PhD, associate professor at Semmelweis University in Budapest, told Fox News Digital. Vitamin D is widely known for boosting bone health, muscle strength and immune function, but it also has a range of other benefits — including cancer prevention.(iStock) \"Our research clearly supports the strong correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the primary form of vitamin D) levels and cancer outcomes.\" Cancer patientswith low vitamin D levels showed poorer prognoses.

VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY LINKED TO DEMENTIA IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS WHEN LEVELS ARE VERY LOW: STUDY \"These mechanisms significantly influence the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer,\" Varga noted. In addition to prevention, vitamin D supplementation was also shown to improvesurvival ratesamong patients with advanced-stage colorectal cancer, according to the research. \"The results suggest that the effect of vitamin D may depend on factors such as the dosage, the individual condition of the patients and the duration of treatment,\" Vargas added. The primary source of vitamin D is exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.(iStock) The American Cancer Society (ACS) has previously referenced studies suggesting that vitamin D could lower cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer. \"However, large studies have not found that vitamin D supplements lower the risk of colorectal polyps (pre-cancerous growths) or cancer,\" the ACS stated on its website. \"The optimal dosage should be tailored to the individual’s health condition and current vitamin D levels.\" One important limitation of the research is that the studies included in the analysis used different vitamin D dosages and involved patients at various stages of cancer, the authors noted. They called forfurther researchto accurately determine the optimal dosage and \"therapeutic efficacy.\" \"Based on our research, we recommend that individuals at high risk ofcolorectal cancermonitor their vitamin D levels and, if necessary, take a daily vitamin D supplement of 1000–4000 IU, especially for those with low vitamin D levels,\" lead study author Dr. Monika Fekete, medical doctor at Semmelweis University, told Fox News Digital. \"The optimal dosage should be tailored to the individual’s health condition and current vitamin D levels.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For physicians, the researchers suggest routinely measuring and supplementing vitamin D levels for both prevention and treatment purposes. \"Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the treatment and prevention ofcolorectal cancer, but further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and the specific role of genetic factors,\" Fekete added.

Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas announced a temporary Easter ceasefire in his country’s war with Ukraine, the Kremlin said Saturday. The war has raged for more than three years and cost the lives of tens of thousands of people on both sides. \"Guided by humanitarian considerations, today from 18:00 to 00:00 from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side declares an Easter truce,’\" Putin said in a video posted by the Russian ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    "title": "Iran’s long trail of deception fuels skepticism over new nuclear deal as talks continue",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on President Donald Trump's positioning with Iran on its nuclear program and Secretary Marco Rubio's warning over peace talks in Ukraine. Saturday's talks in Rome between theTrump administrationand the Islamic Republic of Iran over the rogue regime’s failure to dismantle its illicit nuclear weapons program have raised pressing questions about whether Tehran will adhere to a new deal. Speaking on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" retired Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News senior strategic analyst, said Iran is reintroducing its \"playbook\" that [was] used to secure the JCPOA from Obama and termed its strategy a \"bold-faced lie\" that led to the \"disastrous 2015\" agreement. Keane said Iran is repackaging the lie that it will reduce highly enriched uranium down to a low percentage and not use it for a nuclear weapon. Instead, it will employ it for civilian commercial nuclear power. Kean added that the Iranians \"think the Trump administration is going to buy this. After all, in 2018, Trump pulled out of that very deal.\" In 2018, President Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the formal name for the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration, because, he argued, it failed to stop Iran’s ambitions to construct an atomic bomb. AHEAD OF TRUMP ADMIN-IRAN TALKS, NEW REPORT SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT RISES TO 'EXTREME DANGER' Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and President Donald Trump(West Asia News Agency, Reuters; Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images) Fox News Digital sent a detailed press query to the State Department regarding the Islamic Republic’s history of cheating and lying when dealing with its previous pledges to not build a nuclear weapon. A spokesperson for theState Departmenttold Fox News Digital, \"This, along with many other issues, will be decided at the negotiating table. The president has been clear: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon or enrichment program. As we continue to talk, we expect to refine a framework and timetable for working towards a deal that achieves the president’s objectives peacefully.\" Speaking Friday, President Trump told reporters, \"I'm for stopping Iran very simply from having a nuclear weapon. They can't have a nuclear weapon.\" Enrichment of uranium is the key process that enables Iran’s regime to advance its work on a deliverable nuclear weapon. \"Iran’s enrichment is a real, accepted matter,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday. \"We are ready to build confidence in response to possible concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable.\" Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, views Iranian nuclear achievements on June 11.(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA/Reuters) Mark Wallace, the CEO of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) and a former U.N. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, told Fox News Digital, \"Under the Bush administration, zero enrichment was enshrined in U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Obama administration changed that position, allowing enrichment up to 3.67%, and this paved the way for the failed JCPOA that has allowed Iran to extort the international community ever since.\" The Obama administration's concession to Iran to permit it to enrich uranium to 3.67% has created new problems for Trump to halt Tehran's drive to build a weapon. Iran has exploited the right to enrich uranium to speed up its weapons program. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency announced in February that Iran has produced dramatically more uranium that can be used in six atomic bombs and stressed that Tehran has made no progress on resolving outstanding issues. Iran's medium-range ballistic missile Hayber after a launch during a promotional program organized with the participation of high-ranking military officials in Tehran, Iran, May 7, 2023.(Iranian Defense Ministry/Hanodut/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Trump said in late March he would launch military strikes against Iran if it failed to agree to his demands for a new nuclear pact. Prior to Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA,Fox News Digital reportedin 2017 that Iran tried to obtain illicit technology that could be used for military nuclear and ballistic missile programs, raising questions about a possible violation of the 2015 agreement intended to stop Tehran’s drive to become an atomic armed power, according to three German intelligence reports. TRUMP HAS A TIMELINE IN MIND FOR IRAN NUKE DEAL, TAPS ISRAEL TO LEAD ANY POTENTIAL MILITARY ACTION The Trump administration has outlined a two-month framework to reach a deal with Iran, John Hannah, asenior fellow at JINSA, said during a briefing about Iran’s nuclear weapons program Thursday. Hannah served in senior advisory roles with former Vice President Dick Cheney and was intimately involved in developing U.S. strategy toward talks with Iran over Afghanistan, Iraq and the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program throughout President George W. Bush’s two terms in the White House. Traditionally, military pressure has influenced the Islamic Republic of Iran’s recalcitrant and anti-American leaders to make concessions. The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 reportedly compelled the clerical regime’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei,to briefly pause his country’s workon nuclear weapons. Khamenei feared American military action at the time. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, left, meets Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr Albusaidi before negotiations with U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat, Oman, April 12, 2025.(Iranian Foreign Ministry via AP) Hannah said Trump’s \"military threat is what brought Supreme Leader Khamenei to the table\" because it \"put his own regime at risk.\" Hannah outlined what dismantlement \"with a capital D\" would mean for Iran. He said \"all of their enriched uranium leaves the country,\" and the centrifuges are destroyed and taken out of the country. Hannah said Iran’s secretive underground Fordow nuclear fuel enrichment plant and Natanz nuclear site were where Iran was caught digging tunnels in the mountains. Hannah's organization, JINSA, released aninfographic Wednesdaythat focused in on Trump administration officials' comments on verification and dismantlement. According toa Reuters report, a senior Iranian official said Friday that Iran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed watertight guarantees President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact. Tehran's red lines \"mandated by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\" could not be compromised in the talks, the official told Reuters, describing Iran's negotiating position on condition of anonymity. He said those red lines meant Iran would never agree to dismantle its centrifuges for enriching uranium, halt enrichment altogether or reduce the amount of enriched uranium it stores to a level below the level it agreed in the 2015 deal that Trump abandoned.

    "article_text": "Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn speaks to Fox News Digital about his view on the Trump-Harvard battle over free speech and antisemitism. The president of a prominent Christian college in Michigan reacted Thursday to PresidentDonald Trump’sbattle with Harvard University — and the billions it stands to lose due to a federal funding freeze over its response to on-campus antisemitism. \"We all have a right to free speech, but if you join the academic community, you don't get to say whatever you want. You can't go to physics class and talk about English Lit. Also, you can't spit on people because they're Jews or denounce them… because that breaks down the friendship that is necessary to the partnership of a college,\" Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"Now, having said that, of course — you shouldn't say ‘dirty Jew.’ It's perfectly legitimate to say, 'I don't agree with it.' But to say, ‘Israel took that land, and they don't have a right to it,' and the response would be, ‘OK, see if you can prove that.’ That's an academic undertaking,\" he said. TRUMP ADMIN SLASHES OVER $2.2B IN FUNDING TO HARVARD AFTER SCHOOL DEFIES DEMANDS \"Shouting, preventing people from going to class, threatening them personally. That breaks down the academic community. They shouldn't be doing that. And it's, you know, because the [1964] Civil Rights Act is written in a certain way; if they permit that kind of activity, Harvard is in violation of that act, and that act applies to every organization in America.\" A college, being an incubator of learning, should especially be an organization to prohibit such virulent behavior outright, Arnn added. 5 CONTROVERSIES EMBROILING HARVARD UNIVERSITY AS TRUMP SEEKS TO CUT FUNDING Earlier this month, the Trump antisemitism task force froze $2 billion in grants to Harvard, and Trump later floated stripping its tax-exempt status after the school’s administration released a statement saying it would not comply with demands. Arnn said that, antisemitic behavior or not, there are thousands of stipulations a college must agree to in order to receive funding from the federal Department of Education. \"The government has changed so much since 1960, and it's all over everything now, including education. And Harvard doesn't like some recent things it's been demanded to do, but it's obeying hundreds of pages of rules that are detailed, and they have to comply with because they have a lot of money from the government,\" he said. Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn is criticizing Harvard University.(Getty) \"So the obvious solution would be, don't take the money from the government, which is what we do,\" he said, referring to Hillsdale. Arnn said Hillsdale, founded in the mid-19th century in part by friends of then-Illinois attorney Abraham Lincoln, has never been as wealthyas Harvardbut remains an exceptional institution. \"The fact that they are defending [themselves] is good, and maybe they should have the complete courage of their convictions and just give [the funding] up,\" he said. If the frozen funds account for the school’s annual federal contribution, it would calculate to $90,000 per student, Arnn added, noting the school also has a large endowment. \"Maybe they could make it on their own,\" he said. \"Every transaction at Hillsdale College… is a voluntary transaction… [N]obody comes here unless they want to, they have to sign an honor code to come.\" President Donald Trump froze federal funding to Harvard University.(Getty Images) Arnn compared Hillsdale’s connections to a politically budding Lincoln toHarvard’s titleas the oldest college in the country, and Princeton University’s ties to Founding Fathers like President James Madison. \"If James Madison had come to college here, I would never shut up about it, right? Frederick Douglass spoke on our campus twice. I never shut up about that,\" he said. Arnn cited how the first Trump administration investigated Princeton after figures there publicized its supposed racist structures. \"[Madison] personally took pride in the fact they had kept the word ‘slave’ out of the Constitution, because although they had to make a compromise and not abolish it in certain ways, and that compromise is for a very big reason,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harvard University has been the subject of criticism over its response to antisemitic protests.(Reuters) \"The problem is, we have a set of principles that are perfect, but we will never serve them perfectly,\" said Arnn. \"[T]he attempt to do so can do a lot of harm depending on what the attempt is.\" \"My suggestion[to Harvard]would be to go in the right direction. It's written in your own history. And you should probably do it with your own resources if you don't like bureaucrats in Washington telling you what to do,\" he said. In a statement, Harvard President Alan Garber said Harvard will \"not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" and \"no government… should dictate what private universities can teach, who they can admit and hire…\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke to Ohio AG Dave Yost about his campaign for governor against Trump-endorsed Vivek Ramaswamy WASHINGTON, DC- Ohio Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, who is running for governor against tech entrepreneurVivek Ramaswamyin the primary, spoke to Fox News Digital about his campaign and what he sees as the key difference between the two campaigns. \"We do agree on an awful lot of things,\" Yost, who was in Washington to celebrate with the national champion Ohio State Buckeyes college football team at theWhite House, told Fox News Digital about the gubernatorial race. \"The difference is that I'm running on a record of results, not just rhetoric.\" Part of that record, Yost explained, is his time as the state auditor in Ohio, where he helped uncover$260 million of efficiency savings. SCOOP: RAMASWAMY SCORES ENDORSEMENT FROM A POWERFUL HOUSE MEMBER IN OHIO GOVERNOR RUN Vivek Ramaswamy (Right) and Dave Yost (Left) are running for governor as Republicans in Ohio.(Getty Images) \"I was DOGE before DOGE was cool,\" Yost said, adding later that \"virtually nobody\" he talks to in Ohio is opposed to the fraud and waste spending that is taking place with DOGE amid vocal Democratic pushback. Yost also touted his record on crime and public corruption as the state’s attorney general since 2019 and suggested his experience differentiates him from Ramaswamy. \"We've been fighting for the Constitution, for the rights of Ohioans, fighting public corruption,\" Yost said. \"More than 170 people have gone to jail because of my work and the work of my team. So, we've been in the trenches. We don't need on-the-job training, and I think that that record of results is going to make a difference for Ohioans.\" OHIO COLLEGE 'ILLEGALLY FORCING STUDENTS' TO SHARE BATHROOMS WITH OPPOSITE SEX: WATCHDOG Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost speaks at the Conservative Political Action Coalition annual meeting(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Recent polling shows that Ramaswamy, who has been endorsed by President Trump, Elon Musk, Rep. Jim Jordan and others, holds a commanding lead in the race, but Yost remains optimistic. \"Obviously, there's a long way to go, but I love Ohio,\" Yost said. \"I've been getting back out and talking with folks. The reception has been amazing. People are eager for a new America First kind of leadership in Ohio. And I am really excited about where we're heading.\" One specific issue that Yost believes he has been clearer on where he stands is the death penalty. \"I don't know where my opponent is on that,\" Yost said. \"He hasn't spoken about it. I imagine that that's why we have campaigns, and we'll find out. But look, I support the death penalty.\" Yost explained that \"safeguards\" must be used, and he emphasized that there are \"no do-overs\" but said that \"we need\" thedeath penalty. \"What do you do with a guy who's serving life without parole and then he kills a prison guard or a cook inside?\" Yost said. \"A family loses a loved one because of this murder. Was that a freebie? What, are we gonna give them another life sentence? So, at least in that circumstance, we need to have the death penalty, and then we're just arguing about when we use it.\" \"But the death penalty is not working in Ohio right now. We haven't abolished it. We still have the promise of it out there as the ultimate justice. We haven't executed anyone since 2018. The average time that somebody on death row has been waiting for their date with justice is 22 years. That's not due process, it's overdue process, and we need to either man up and say, okay, we're not gonna do this anymore, or we need to go about following the law and bringing the 116 people on death row to their date with justice.\" A person close to the Ramaswamy campaign told Fox News Digital that the team is\"looking forward to helping Dave Yost be successful in his next venture, whatever he chooses to do.\" Another local issue in Ohio that Yost told Fox News Digital he is concerned about is the recent push by professional sports teams to secure taxpayer funds for stadiums. Yost expressed concerns about taxpayers being on the hook for sums of several hundred million dollars. \"I'm not so sure that the taxpayers ought to be throwing tax money at these big public stadium projects,\" Yost said. \"I mean, those bonds, those taxes are going to be paid for by people that in a lot of ways can't afford to go to a pro game. That strikes me as unfair. But beyond that, we have no limiting principle here.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Vivek Ramaswamy speaks before Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump takes the stage at the campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on October 27, 2024, in New York City.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"We've got all these different sports teams. We already have three of them now, since the Browns said we want $600 million. The Bengals come forward, and they want $350 million, and FC Cincinnati is saying, ‘Well, what about us?’ And pretty soon, we're spending billions of dollars on sports stadiums that are used in one town a few days a year, when we could be spending that money on any number of other things, whether we're talking about roads, bridges, economic development, whether we're talking schools, or we're talking about tax cuts. None of this makes sense to me. We at least need a plan and a limit. Right now, it looks like the candy store is just open.\" Fox News Digital asked Yost what he hears most often when he travels the state talking to voters, and he said that the economy and \"kitchen table\" issues are most prevalent, but pointed out that Trump’s tariff policies, which have been much maligned by the Democrats, are more popular than the media lets on. \"Right now, everybody's watching as the world economy is being reordered, and unlike what I'm hearing from the disaster predicted by the elite press on the coasts, it's a much different situation on the ground in Ohio,\" Yost said. \"I talk to a lot of businesses that think that this is going to be good for them, that the fair and reciprocal kinds of trade are going to bring a new resurgence to Ohio and to their industries, even though they see some pain and that's what everybody's talking about right now.\" Ultimately, Yost told Fox News Digital that he believes that his \"record of results\" shows that he is the candidate with the \"experience and the vision and the know-how\" to \"bring Ohio to the bright future that's out there for us.\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

    "article_text": "‘The Saints’ releases new episodes, exclusively streaming on Fox Nation, starting April 4. FIRST ON FOX:One of the world's leading liberal ecumenicalChristian organizationspublished a post during Holy Week promoting climate change activism, sparking criticism from some experts who spoke to Fox News Digital. \"Training shows climate justice a moral imperative for churches,\" a post on theWorld Council of Churches websitesaid on Monday as the billions of Christians worldwide began observing Holy Week and commemorating the seven days leading up to Easter. The post stated: \"Exploring how churches can do more for climate justice, the World Council of Churches (WCC), in cooperation with the National Council of Churches in Bangladesh, organized a climate litigation training in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 11 April.\" In a Thursdaypost on X, WCC again spoke about climate change saying, \"Climate crisis isn’t siloed—neither should our solutions be.

Prof. Dr. Jerry Pillay said in Bangladesh. \"Our moral voice is necessary for the urgently needed system changes.\" Last week,WCC announcedthat it has \"debuted its new resource on legal tools for climate justice, the focus was on hope for children—a hope strongly backed by knowledge on how churches can hold financial actors accountable for their role in perpetuating the climate crisis.\" Fox News Digital reached out to WCC for comment. Dan Turner, founder and executive director of Power The Future, likened the climate change push to Christianity’s \"long history of a battle against paganism.\" \"It is unsurprising that neo-pagans hide behind climate change to pollute religion and push their agenda,\" Turner said. \"The most Christian countries have the cleanest air and water, and the greatest respect for the Earth.\" EASTER AND PASSOVER FOODS THAT AMERICANS MOST LIKE AND DISLIKE, ACCORDING TO NEW DATA Children painting Easter eggs.(iStock) Gabriella Hoffman, Independent Women’s Forum Center for Energy & Conservation Director, told Fox News Digital that it is not \"uncommon\" for religious institutions to preach the \"biblical\" teaching of \"stewardship of the land\" but that climate justice \"strays from this teaching by encouraging its adherents to reject positive human interactions with nature.\" \"They believe nature supersedes the needs of people. Both interests can be balanced and not at odds with each other,\" Hoffman said. Steve Cortes, founder of the League of American Workers and a Senior Advisor for Catholic Vote, told Fox News Digital, \"During Holy Week, the church should be focused on reflecting on Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, instead of advancing climate hysteria. The church should be spreading the Gospel, not advance divisive legal battles that amplify fear over faith.\" The WCC, which claims 352 member church bodies from more than 120 countries, representing over 580 million Christians worldwide, has a long history of political activism on behalf of liberal causes. The organization has \"established several highly biased and politicized subgroups,\"according to NGO Monitor, some of which have been linked to anti-Israel efforts and BDS activities.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Madeleine Rivera provides details on Sen. Chris Van Hollen's, D-Md., meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts react. Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s, D-Md., sudden trip to El Salvador to try to free deportee Kilmar Abrego Garcia is getting the attention of critics who believe the Maryland Democrat may have violated a 1799 law prohibiting unauthorized diplomacy. The Logan Act – named for former Pennsylvania Sen.George Logan– stipulates a fine and/or imprisonment for Americans corresponding with foreign officials \"with intent to influence the[ir] measures … in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.\" Logan met with French diplomat Charles de Talleyrand after Paris rebuffed President John Adams, and he attempted to entreat him – in part via a letter from Vice President Thomas Jefferson – to end the Franco-American hostilities of the so-called \"Quasi War.\" In that way, several prominent conservatives questioned whether Van Hollen’s actions similarly violated the law.

It’s illegal to conduct your own foreign policy,\" longtime Republican consultant Roger Stone tweeted. WMAL host Vince Coglianese read the Logan Act statute aloud and asked his audience whether Van Hollen had done what the code outlined. \"Is Chris Van Hollen violating the Logan Act?\" Coglianese said. \"Because this is what they accused General [Michael] Flynn of doing … the incoming national security advisor … who was merely having conversations with foreign diplomats [after] people had chosen President Donald Trump.\" Democrats previously seized on the Logan Act when Flynn contacted Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak prior to Trump being sworn in the first time, which ultimately led to an FBI probe and tanked his public-service career. Notes from formerFBI agent Peter Strzokread, \"VP: Logan Act\" and suggested then-Vice President Joe Biden floated using it against Flynn, while then-FBI director Jim Comey said the Kislyak correspondence appeared \"legit.\" NOT A MARYLAND MAN: GOP BLASTS DEMOCRAT SENATOR FIGHTING FOR RETURN OF SALVADORAN NATIONAL Kilmar Garcia, a deported Salvadoran national.(Fox) Fox News contributor Byron Yorkresponded to an Xquestion on the matter by saying that he repeatedly argued during the Flynn matter that the act is a \"dead letter.\" \"But politically, it's useful to know thatSen. Van Hollentraveled to a foreign country to bash the President of the United States.\" The American Accountability Foundation (AAF) sent a letter to Senate Ethics Committee Chairman James Lankford, R-Okla, asking to probe for violations, according tothe New York Post. AAF’s Thomas Jones said Garcia \"is essentially an enemy combatant in the ongoing invasion … by transnational gangs.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Lankford for comment. The act was last invoked by Trump critics after a book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward claimed the mogul held several calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin between his terms in the White House. Trump was lambasted by the \"Never-Trump\" Lincoln Project and Kamala Harris over Woodward’s book’s claims. Agents also considered getting Flynn to admit to breaking the Logan Act: \"What is our goal?\" one of thenotesfrom ex-FBI counterintelligence chief Bill Priestap read: \"Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\" After that situation, Rep.

Stone Jr., right, one of the conservatives calling for the Logan Act to be invoked.(Reuters) In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan suggested it be used against Rev.

Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., of violating the Logan Act via their contact with Iran in 2019 and 2020. \"It’s literally my job to meet with foreign leaders,\" Murphy shot back, citing his position on a Senate Mideast subcommittee. Ultimately, no one has been successfully prosecuted under the Logan Act, as the namesake Philadelphian himself was essentially grandfathered out.

    "article_text": "Carlo Fidanza, member of the European Parliament, joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to break down President Donald Trump’s meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and what it signals for the future of U.S.-Europe relations. PresidentDonald Trumpmet with foreign leaders from El Salvador and Italy this week, advancing negotiations on both trade and immigration issues at the White House. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Washington during a pause in steep tariffs against the European Union and other countries that could go into effect in June. But both Trump and Meloni voiced optimism that the two countries would secure a deal before then. \"There will be a trade deal, 100%,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Thursday. \"Of course there will be a trade deal, they want to make one very much, and we’re going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it, but it’ll be a fair deal.\" ITALY'S MELONI GOES TO WASHINGTON FOR TARIFF HUDDLE WITH TRUMP When asked whether she still considered the U.S. a reliable trading partner due to changes related to tariff policy, Meloni said that she wouldn’t have made the trek to the White House unless it were so. Meloni said her objective for the trip was to invite Trump to meetings on behalf of Italy and Europe to foster a trade negotiation between the two states. \"I think the best way is that we simply speak frankly about the needs that every one of us has and find ourselves in the middle for that's useful for all,\" Meloni told reporters Thursday. Meanwhile, Vice PresidentJD Vancemet with Meloni Friday in Rome to continue discussing economic policies between the two countries. Here’s what also happened this week: Trump kicked off the week meeting withEl Salvador President Nayib BukeleMonday, launching a debate about whether El Salvador should return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego-Garcia after he was deported there. On Monday, Trump administration officials and Bukele agreed that they didn't have the authority to return Abrego-Garcia to the U.S., even though the Trump administration admitted in court filings that he was deported in an \"administrative error.\" Even so, the Trump administration has accused Abrego-Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, a designated terrorist group. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court upheld in April a lower court's order that \"requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" President Donald Trump shakes hands with Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, April 14, 2025(Al Drago for The Washington Post via Getty Images) While Attorney GeneralPam Bonditold reporters Monday that El Salvador would call the final shots on whether it would return Abrego-Garcia, Bukele said it was \"preposterous\" for El Salvador to do so. \"How can I smuggle a terrorist into the U.S.? I don't have the power to return him to the United States,\" Bukele said. Additionally, the Justice Department unveiled documents Wednesday detailing domestic violence allegations that Abrego-Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez, included in a court filing in 2021. Vasquez alleged in the filing that Garcia beat her and that she had documentation of the bruises he left on her. The Trump administration also continued to go after federal funding at higher education institutions. After Harvard refused to comply with a series of requests from the Trump administration to reform various practices on campus, the administration revealed Monday that it would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding for the institution. Harvard University President Alan M. Garber said in a Monday statement that the Trump administration included additional requests unrelated to tackling antisemitism on campus. As a result, Garber said the institution would not bend to those requests, claiming they were unconstitutional. WHITE HOUSE SLAMS IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTIONS FOR ‘EGREGIOUS ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR’ AMID TRUMP FEUD WITH HARVARD Trump has publicly criticized Harvard University multiple times in recent weeks.(Getty Images | iStock) Garber said the new requests \"direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard,\" including auditing viewpoints of student, faculty and staff members on campus, and eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices and initiatives at Harvard. \"It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner,\" Garber said. \"We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement.\" Trump also signed an executive order Tuesday seeking to combat soaring prescription drug prices. The directive instructsRobert F. Kennedy Jr.'sDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to standardize Medicare payments for prescription drugs, including those used for cancer patients, no matter where a patient receives treatment. This could lower prices for patients by as much as 60%, according to a White House fact sheet. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A new White House directive instructs Robert F.

That amounts to up to 35% lower than what the government pays to acquire those medications, the White House said. Drug prices have significantly risen in recent years. Between January 2022 and January 2023, prescription drug prices rose more than 15% and reached an average of $590 per drug product, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the 4,200 prescription drugs included on that list, 46% of the price increases exceeded the rate of inflation. Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering theWhite House.",

Two previous judges found he was likely affiliated with MS-13. Trump administration officials acknowledged in court that his deportation had been an administrative error, although now some top Trump officials say he was correctly removed and contend he's a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. One immigration judge in 2019 found that Garcia had not sufficiently refuted evidence of MS-13 affiliation and was thus removable to anywhere other than El Salvador because of a threat from a rival gang. This is called a withholding order. The Supreme Court acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a 2019 withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador and that the removal to El Salvador was \"therefore illegal.\" The Court stressed that the government must facilitate his release from custody in El Salvador and treat his case as if he were never deported. White HouseDeputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Monday said that when Trump declared the violent gang a terrorist organization, Abrego Garcia was no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the United States.

On Friday, Trump released an image of Abrego Garcia’s hand showing purported MS-13 gang tattoos. A 2022 Homeland Security Investigations report identified Garcia as amember of MS-13and a suspected human trafficker. A 2021 domestic violence filing, written by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, claimed, \"I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he [has] left me.\" Democrats like Dexter say he is a hard-working Maryland resident who has had his due process rights stripped away after being sent to the notorious prison.

    "title": "What is REAL ID? Deadline approaches for new identification cards required to fly domestically",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use REAL ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. Due to a security law passed 20 years ago, many Americans are now required to update their driver’s license or identification cards to become REAL ID-compliant — or they won’t be able toboard U.S. flights. With the deadline fast approaching on May 7, some conservatives have called on President Donald Trump to do away with the inconvenient requirement that they say violates civil liberties. On May 7, federal agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), will no longer accept driver’s licenses or ID cards that do not have a star in one of the upper corners to represent their REAL ID verification. To become REAL ID-verified, applicants have to provide additional verifying information like Social Security numbers. Flyers who don’t have REAL ID verification on their license should plan to use a passport, a passport card, a permanent resident card, military ID or an enhanced driver’s license offered by some states. 'MASS SURVEILLANCE': CONSERVATIVES SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP ADMIN'S REAL ID ROLLOUT Sample driver's license with REAL ID. The star in the top right corner signifies REAL ID.(DC DMV ) The TSA says it will begin \"phased enforcement\" on May 7, but it’s unclear whether that means turning away travelers without proper documentation or subjecting them to additional security screening. TheDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS) said in an FAQ on its website that travelers without \"a REAL ID-compliant license or acceptable alternative beginning May 7, 2025, will not be permitted through the security checkpoint.\" In a federal rule established this year, the TSA says its \"phased approach\" could last two years, with the potential to issue warnings to people without REAL ID verification. Access to other federal facilities and nuclear power plants will also require a REAL ID, according to DHS. Drivers who have recently renewed their driver’s license may already have a REAL ID. Check for the star in the upper right or left corner. Otherwise, check with your local Department of Motor Vehicles office on how to get a REAL ID or make an appointment to get a new license. You’ll need documentation to show your full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number and lawful status, as well as two proofs of address. If you don’t have your Social Security card, you can provide a W-2 or pay stub with your name and Social Security number on it. NO 'REAL ID' APPOINTMENTS OPEN IN NEW JERSEY AS RESIDENTS SOUND OFF: ‘GET WITH THE TIMES, NJ' Americans face lines at the DMV in a rush to get a REAL ID before May 7.(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the REAL ID Act in 2005 after the 9/11 Commission warned that it was too easy for bad actors to obtain a driver’s license. Implementation of the law has been marred by delays in getting all 50 states and U.S. territories to implement the new requirements and start issuing advanced identification, which the federal government estimated would cost $11 billion in 2007. The 2020 deadline was pushed back multiple times due to theCOVID-19 pandemic. TSA senior official Adam Stahl said recently in an announcement that REAL ID \"bolsters safety by making fraudulent IDs harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.\" Some on the right have cried foul, and questioned why, if previous administrations have delayed the implementation, it is necessary now. When Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemposted a video reminding Americans of the May 7 deadline, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin responded: \"Or what?? Evidently, existing ID requirements for American citizens just aren’t adequate now, so Big Brother is forcing us through more hoops for the ‘right’ to travel within our own country.\" Airline passengers are required to show REAL ID beginning May 7 — but DHS has said it will be a \"phased implementation.\"(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Palin continued: \"Other administrations delayed this newfangled, burdensome REAL ID requirement. Are you curious why its implementation is imperative now?? And who came up with this?\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., argued in an X post, \"As long as the pilot’s door is locked and no one has weapons, why do you care that someone who flies has government permission? REAL ID provides no benefit, yet presents a serious risk to freedom. If a person can’t be trusted to fly without weapons, why are they roaming free?\" Massie took shots at Trump in a follow-up post: \"REAL ID is a 2005 George Bush-era Patriot Act overreach that went completely unenforced until Trump got into office. Let me guess: he’s playing 4D chess and I should just go along with it?\" Trump ally Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., rebuked REAL ID critics in his own public statement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The REAL ID Act was passed way back in 2005, 20 years ago!!!! It’s about time everyone stop dragging their feet. Quit scrolling through social media, quit complaining, get your info together, and get down to the DMV to get your REAL ID,\" Alford said Wednesday. The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on the criticisms of REAL ID. Fox News' Liz Elkind contributed to this report.",

(Credit: The White House) FIRST ON FOX:The White House is launching a new \"Road to Independence\" video lecture series leading up to America's 250th birthday, and the Trump administration has planned a year of festivities to commemorate it. The series, launched the same day as the first engagement of the Revolutionary War in 1775, will commemorate important moments in American history ahead of the Trump administration's commencement of a full year of festivities that will launch on Memorial Day in honor of America's 250th anniversary. The videos are being produced in a partnership between the Department of Education and Hillsdale College, whose president appeared in an introductory video launching the series. \"President Trump wishes to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year with an open heart,\"Hillsdale President Larry P. Arnnsaid in his introductory video. \"One of the things we must do to commemorate anything — commemorate just means to remember together — first we have to know the thing.

Additional episodes, which will be shared on theWhite House website,will be released regularly to commemorate significant events related to America's founding. TRUMP TO CREATE TASK FORCE TO PLAN ‘EXTRAORDINARY CELEBRATION’ FOR 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICA'S INDEPENDENCE The Battle of Lexington and Concord, fought on April 19, 1775, was the first military engagement leading to America's independence from Great Britain and the eventual signing ofthe Declaration of Independence.The 10-minute video shares the story of this pivotal moment in history from the perspective of Hillsdale College history professor Wilfred M. McClay In addition to the two videos in the series, the White House is also commemorating the start of America's fight for independence this weekend with a reading of the poem \"Paul Revere's Ride\" byWhite Housepress secretary Karoline Leavitt, which will be posted across social media. The poem commemorates the midnight ride of Paul Revere on April 18, 1775, when he rode his horse through the night to warn Massachusetts colonists of advancing British troops. \"President Trump signed an executive order to create the America 250 task force because he feels strongly about honoring our nation’s heritage ahead of this monumental anniversary,\" Leavitt told Fox News Digital. \"The ‘Road to Independence’ video series will bring the incredible story of our country to the public as we prepare to celebrate America together in July 2026.\" PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HOSTS EASTER DINNER WITH ‘WORSHIP AND PRAYERS’ President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watch a flyover as they attend the Salute to America event on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., July 4, 2020.(Chris Kleponis/Polaris/Bloomberg via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During President Trump's first term, he held a unique \"Salute To America\" event on theFourth of Julyin 2019, which was different from typical Independence Day celebrations put on by past presidents.

Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has been crisscrossing the country the past couple of months, taking a lead in amplifying the Democratic Party's message in resisting PresidentDonald Trump'saggressive and controversial actions in overturning long-standing government policy and slashing the federal workforce. ButKhanna,the California Democrat who's in his fifth term in the House and who likely harbors national ambitions in 2028, is not only turning up the volume in his broadsides against Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Trump's heir apparent, but also against his own party. \"We have to have a whole rebrand of the Democratic Party with a coherent platform and a future-oriented platform, and many leaders need to do that. New leaders, not the old guard. And I hope to be part of that,\" Khanna said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

And you know, if you're not willing to speak up about someone being snatched away from their home and deported withoutdue process, you probably shouldn't be in elective office as a Democrat right now,\" he said. \"We need Democrats speaking out, not just on the economy.

Democrats have become increasingly angry and very energized in response to Trump's moves. That anger is directed not only at Trump and Republicans, but also at fellow Democrats. Many in the party's base feel their leaders in Congress haven't been effective or vocal enough in pushing back against the president. BERNIE SANDERS, AOC AND OTHER ANTI-TRUMP PROGRESSIVES HAUL IN BIG BUCKS FOR 2026 MIDTERMS And the energy has been evident at town halls this winter and early spring held by both Democratic and Republican members of Congress. National polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University, and last month by CNN and by NBC News, indicated the favorable ratings for theDemocratic Partysinking to all-time lows.

    "article_text": "A pro-life father who’s home was raided by the FBI by Biden is calling on the Trump administration to reform the DOJ FIRST ON FOX—Pro-life activist Mark Houck, who sued theJustice Departmentover his arrest and prosecution under the Biden administration, said his family has been blocked from settling their lawsuit by an \"activist\" federal judge. Houck filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department last year, seeking restitution for what he called \"a faulty investigation\" and \"excessive force\" after a SWAT team of around 25 people arrested him in front of his children. Now, Houck is appealing the judge's decision to the Third District Court and calling on theTrump administrationto follow through on ending the weaponization of the DOJ against pro-lifers such as him once and for all. He discusses the case with his wife and 40 Days for Life founder Shawn Carney in a new video shared with Fox News Digital. \"You live in fear of it happening again, not only to yourselves but to others, and you want to know that this administration, which rode this message to the White House, is willing to step in,\" Houck said in the video, adding, \"and they're doing it for other organizations, they're doing it in the DOGE, they're doing it with all the things, they're cleaning house.\" PRO-LIFE JOURNALIST ASSAULTED ON STREET ASSIGNS BLAME TO DEMOCRATIC RHETORIC Mark Houck (right) and his wife, Ryan, sit down for an interview with 40 Days for Life founder Shawn Carney.(40 Days for Life) In an interview with Fox News Digital, 40 Days for Life President Shawn Carney said: \"I just think, Democratic or Republican, we're tired of activist judges on both sides of the political aisle.\" \"Nobody likes it – and just, this guy's a victim,\" Carney said, adding that the Justice Department \"needs to fix this.\" News of the appeal, which is slated to be filed by 40 Days for Lifeon behalf of Houck, was shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. The group has already filed a Notice to Appeal to the courts. At issue are the settlement negotiations that 40 Days for Life entered into with the Justice Department in early 2025, following Trump's inauguration. U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond, a Bush appointee, abruptly issued a motion to dismiss the case last month, effectively ending the negotiations that had been playing out between Houck and the Trump-led Justice Department. FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING (Shawn Carney of 40 Days for Life spoke to Fox News Digital about Mark Houck's appeal.) It appears that the motion to dismiss the case had originally been filed by theBiden-led Justice Department, which charged Houck in 2021 for allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances, or FACE Act. In the video, Carney and Houck discussed the judge's decision as well as changes in the law enforcement community more broadly, and what they hope to be new priorities of the second Trump administration. Houck said his family is disappointed by the judge's actions and added that \"it reflects poorly against the Trump administration.\" Speaking with Fox News Digital, Carney lamented the dismissal of their lawsuit by Diamond, whom he called an \"activist\" judge and accused of political bias. Nevertheless, he expressed confidence that the Trump administration would make it right. PENNSYLVANIA JURY ACQUITS PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST MARK HOUCK ON CHARGES OF OBSTRUCTING ABORTION CLINIC ACCESS Family photo of Mark Houck, a pro-life activist arrested by the FBI, with his children.(Thomas More Society) \"We are appealing the decision of the judge to continue the lawsuit against the DOJ,\" Carney said. \"And of course, if we could get back on track with that, the idea is that then we would be able to settle with DOJ, since they want to settle.\" \"We have a very strong appeal,\" he said of their yet-to-be-filed brief. \"We're very confident about the appeal.\" The FBI and Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment. Houck, a longtime volunteer with 40 Days for Life, was arrested in 2021 for his actions outside aPlanned Parenthood clinic, which prosecutors said violated the so-called Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act. He was acquitted bya Philadelphia jury, but could have faced up to eleven years in prison if convicted. Both his high-profile arrest at home, and the lengthy prison sentence he could have faced if convicted, prompted outrage from pro-life groups, including 40 Days for Life, where Houck has volunteered since 2007. SUPREME COURT FREEZES ORDER TO RETURN MAN FROM EL SALVADOR PRISON Pro-life crowd cheers over Supreme Court decision.(Joshua Comins/Fox News) In 2023, after Houck's acquittal, 40 Days for Life joined Houck in suing the Justice Department over the ordeal, accusing law enforcement personnel of conducting a \"faulty investigation\" against him, and accusing law enforcement of using \"excessive force\" in the FBI raid of his family home. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carney has weighed in on the topic before, saying in apost on Xthis year that 40 Days for Life was \"targeted constantly by the Biden DOJ.\" \"With 1,000,000 peaceful volunteers we will always fight for free speech for pro-life and pro-abortion Americans alike.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the significant increase taxpayers will face if Republicans fail to renew President Donald Trump's tax cuts on 'America's Newsroom.' Tax season is done. And this year, Congressional Republicans converted tax season to \"sales\" season. Republicans andPresident Donald Trumpare pushing to approve a bill to reauthorize his 2017 tax cut package. Otherwise, those taxes expire later this year. \"We absolutely have to make the tax cuts permanent,\" said Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., on FOX Business. \"We've got to get the renewal of the President's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That's absolutely essential,\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., on FOX Business. Rates for nearly every American spike if Congress doesn’t act within the next few months. CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRATS HITS ALL TIME LOW IN NEW POLL Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talks with the media after the House passed the budget resolution on Thursday, April 10, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) \"We are trying to avoid tax increases on the most vulnerable populations in our country,\" said Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee which determines tax policy. \"I am trying to avoid a recession.\" If Congress stumbles, the non-partisan Tax Foundation estimates that a married couple with two children – earning $165,000 a year – is slapped with an extra $2,400 in taxes. A single parent with no kids making $75,000 annually could see a $1,700 upcharge on their tax bill. A single parent with two children bringing home $52,000 a year gets slapped with an additional $1,400 in taxes a year. \"Pretty significant. That's an extramortgage paymentor extra rent payment,\" said Daniel Bunn of the non-partisan Tax Foundation. \"People have been kind of used to living with the policies that are currently in law for almost eight years now. And the shift back to the policy that was prior to the 2017 tax cuts would be a dramatic tax increase for many.\" But technically, Republicans aren’t cutting taxes. \"As simple as I can make this bill. It is about keeping tax rates the same,\" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, on Fox. Congress had to write the 2017 tax reduction bill in a way so that the reductions would expire this year. That was for accounting purposes. Congress didn’t have to count the tax cuts against the deficit thanks to some tricky number-crunching mechanisms – so long as they expired within a multi-year window. But the consequence was that taxes could climb if lawmakers failed to renew the old reductions. \"It sunsets and so you just automatically go back to the tax levels prior to 2017,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. A recent Fox News poll found that 45% of those surveyed – and 44% of independents believe the rich don’t pay enough taxes. Democrats hope to turn outrage about the perceived tax disparity against Trump. \"He wants his billionaire buddies to get an even bigger tax break. Is that disgraceful?\" asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at a rally in New York. \"Disgrace!\" shouted someone in the crowd. \"Disgraceful! Disgraceful!\" followed up Schumer.

Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., (L) to reporters during a news conference on the impacts of the Republican budget proposal at the U.S. Capitol on April 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Some Republicans are now exploring raising rates on the wealthy or corporations. There’s been chatter onCapitol Hilland in the administration about exploring an additional set of tax brackets. \"I don't believe the president has made a determination on whether he supports it or not,\" saidWhite Housespokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. \"We’re going to see where the President is\" on this, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent while traveling in Argentina. \"Everything is on the table.\" A Treasury spokesperson then clarified Bessent’s remarks. \"What’s off the table is a $4.4 trillion tax increase on the American people,\" said the spokesperson. \"Additionally, corporate tax cuts will set off a manufacturing boom and rapidly grow the U.S. economy again.\" Top Congressional GOP leaders dismissed the idea. \"I’m not a big fan of doing that,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox. \"I mean we're the Republican party and we're for tax reduction for everyone.\" FEDERAL JUDGE TEMPORARILY RESTRICTS DOGE ACCESS TO PERSONALIZED SOCIAL SECURITY DATA \"I don’t support that initiative,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., on FOX Business, before adding \"everything’s on the table.\" But if you’re President Donald Trump and the GOP, consider the politics of creating a new corporate tax rate or hiking taxes on the well-to-do. Sunrise light hits the U.S. Capitol dome on Thursday, January 2, 2025, as the 119th Congress is set to begin Friday.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The president has expanded the GOP base. Republicans are no longer the party of the \"wealthy.\" Manual laborers, shop and storekeepers and small business persons now comprise Trump’s GOP. So maintaining these tax cuts helps with that working-class core. Raising taxes on the wealthy would help Republicans pay for the tax cuts and reduce the hit on the deficit. And it would shield Republicans from the Democrats’ argument that the tax cuts are for the rich. Congress is now in the middle of a two-week recess for Passover and Easter. GOP lawmakers and staff are working behind the scenes to actually write the bill. No one knows exactly what will be in the bill. Trump promised no taxes on tips for food service workers. There is also talk of no taxes on overtime. WHITE HOUSE PHOTO BLUNTLY SHOWS WHERE PARTIES STAND ON IMMIGRATION AMID ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION Republicans from high-tax states like New York and Pennsylvania want to see a reduction of \"SALT.\" That’s where taxpayers can write off \"state and local taxes.\" This provision is crucial to secure the support of Republicans like Reps. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. But including the SALT reduction also increases the deficit. So what will the bill look like? \"Minor adjustments within that are naturally on the table,\" said Rounds. \"The key though, [is] 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate.\" In other words, it’s about the math. Republicans need to develop the right legislative brew which commands just the right amount of votes in both chambers to pass. That could mean including certain provisions – or dumping others. It’s challenging. Especially with the slim House majority. People attend a press conference and rally in support of fair taxation near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on April 10, 2025.(Bryan Dozier / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) \"There were trade-offs and offsets within that bill that many people are dissatisfied with,\" said Bunn of the 2017 bill. \"And it's not clear how the package is going to come together with those various trade-offs.\" Johnson wants the bill complete by Memorial Day. Republicans know this enterprise can’t drag on too late into the year. Taxpayers would see a tax increase – even if it’s temporary – if working out the bill stretches into the fall when the IRS begins to prepare for the next tax season. It’s also thought that finishing this sooner rather than later would provide some stability to the volatile stock markets. Establishing tax policy for next year would calm anxieties about the nation’s economic outlook. \"The big, beautiful bill,\" Trump calls it, adding he wants the legislation done \"soon.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And that’s why tax season is now sales season. Both to the lawmakers. And to the public. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the debate over the Trump administration's deportation efforts on 'Special Report.' TheU.S. Supreme Courtissued a ruling early Saturday morning blocking, at least for now, the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th century wartime law. The justices instructed theTrump administrationnot to remove Venezuelans held in Texas' Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order of this court.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority opinion. Later on Saturday, Trump administration lawyers later filed an opposition to the request to block the deportations, noting the government provided advance notice to detainees prior to removals, and they had adequate time to file habeas claims. \"The government has agreed not to remove, pursuant the AEA, those AEA detainees who do file habeas claims (including the putative class representatives),\" according to the filing. \"This Court should dissolve its current administrative stay and allow the lower courts to address the relevant legal and factual questions in the first instance — including the development of a proper factual record.\" At a minimum, attorneys argued the court should limit the administrative stay to removals.

SCOTUS has previously said that the Trump administration could conduct deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, as long as the suspected illegal immigrants are given due process to challenge their removal from the U.S. In its request for an injunction, the ACLU reportedly argued that the government's notice \"does not remotely comply with the Supreme Court's order,\"according to NPR. The organization also reportedly said that \"at a minimum\" the notice needed to be translated so those being notified could understand. The Supreme Court urged the government to file a response to the ACLU's application \"as soon as possible.\" Two federal judges earlier declined to step in and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has not made any decision.

And experienced it so up close this year, I have no choice than to agree with him.\" ROMAN REIGNS' HOLLYWOOD ASPIRATIONS 'NOTHING NEW,' PAUL HEYMAN SAYS, AS WWE STAR REVEALS CAREER PLANS The Rock & Roman Reigns vs. Cody Rhodes & Seth Rollins during Wrestlemania XL at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia April 6, 2024.(Joe Camporeale/USA Today Sports) Heyman dismissed fans on social media who have failed to give Rollins his flowers, saying he’s seen pro wrestlers fail in the ring and seen praise on social media for them while others spout nonsense while ignoring historical facts. \"When you can find detractors of (Abraham) Lincoln or you can find proponents of people who blatantly suck, at some point you have to say these are not the opinions of those that matter,\" he said. On the final \"Monday Night Raw\" before WrestleMania 41, Rollins stood tall in the ring as he delivered stomps to Punk and Reigns. Punk even took a spear from Reigns. Heyman was already put through a table last year by the Bloodline faction. Could he see himself taking another finishing move this year? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Am I prepared for it? I understand the possibility of it and perhaps the probability of it, and I’m hoping to escape the inevitable as I have managed to do for most of my career,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"But if the storyline calls for a stomp or a spear or a GTS or a referee knocking me out, then that’s what the public is gonna get to see.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on Xand subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "article_text": "Maine cross-country high school athlete Cassie Carlisle breaks down her experience with biological males in women’s sports after the Justice Department sued Maine for Title IX violations on ‘America Reports.’ A federal judge ruled against Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby Friday inher lawsuitto have her censure in the state legislature overturned. Libby was censured Feb. 15 for a social media post that identified a transgender athlete who won a girls state pole vault title. The judge who made the ruling is Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose, who was appointed byformer President Joe Bidenjust before he left office in January. DuBose denied Libby's motion for a preliminary injunction Friday, ruling the process House Speaker Ryan Fecteau used to impose the sanction reflected the will of the majority of Maine House members. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM DuBose presided over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Judges John C. Nivison, John A. Woodcock, Lance E. Walker, Karen F. Wolf, Stacey D. Neumann and Nancy Torresen signed recusal orders shortly after the case was initially filed. No reason was given. So, the case went to DuBose in Rhode Island. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Libby is \"disappointed\" by the ruling but plans to appeal it and will take the case to the court of appeals and, potentially, the U.S. Supreme Court. \"I certainly won't leave any stone unturned in getting my constituents their voice and vote back,\" Libby told Fox News Digital. Libby represents 9,000 constituents in Maine's 90th district and has not been able to speak or vote on their behalf in the state legislature for 62 days. That cost her a chance to vote on the state's biannual budget and propose a bill to expand access to mental health resources for residents. With her censure remaining in place, it will prevent Libby from voting on or speaking on the House floor about a bill that would add trans inclusion in girls sports to the state constitution. Her colleagues will be voting on the Democratic majority's bill after it passed with a slim simple majority in the House Thursday but will need a two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters. If passed, it would codify in the state's constitution theMaine Human Rights Act(MHRA), which protects the rights of transgender athletes to compete for sports teams of the opposite sex. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I will not be able to vote on that,\" Libby said. Libby's social media post that prompted the censure thrust the entire state into an active legal battle with President Donald Trump's administration over the issue of trans athletes in girls sports. The U.S. Department of Justice fileda lawsuitagainst the state for its ongoing defiance of Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Maine has faced federal pressure in the last two months over its refusal to comply, including two federal investigations, a funding freeze by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and now a lawsuit. The Democratic leadership in the state, led by Gov. Janet Mills, has fought back, filing their own lawsuit against Trump over the funding freeze. Another federal judge has already ruled the USDA must unfreeze the funding. \"I’m happy to go to court and litigate the issues that are being raised in this court complaint,\" Mills told reporters Thursday. Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls sports tobiological females.

    "article_text": "Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese explains the significance of Mary Magdalene and her story for ‘The Saints,’ streaming exclusively on Fox Nation. Archaeologists recently unveiled a series of strange, centuries-old inscriptions at the site believed to be the location of theLast Supper– just in time for Easter. The Room of the Last Supper, also known as the Cenacle, is located onMount Zion in Jerusalem. The hall was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century, though pilgrims have venerated the site as early as the 4th century. The recent discovery was announced by the Austrian Academy of Science (OeAW) on April 16, with the help of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). Archaeologists identified some 40 elements of graffiti, including five coats of arms. RARE 4,000-YEAR-OLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENT 'BURIED IN THE GROUND' PUZZLES ARCHAEOLOGISTS Most of the inscriptions date back to the late Middle Ages. Researchers found that the site attracted numerous international tourists – and several pilgrims left messages in their native language. Researchers recently unveiled never-before-seen graffiti found at the site of the Last Supper.(Heritage Conservation Jerusalem Pikiwiki Israel; Shai Halevi / © Israel Antiquities Authority) Pictures from the site show various coats of arms and writings in ancient languages. A drawing of a scorpion was also found — presumably when Suleiman the Magnificent took over the Cenacle in 1523 and turned it into a mosque. One interesting depiction of the Last Supper was found above a German coat of arms. The inscriptions were written by pilgrims from Serbia, the modern-day Czech Republic and Germany, as well as Armenia and Syria. ANCIENT TREASURE FOUND BY METAL DETECTORISTS IN 'IMPORTANT' AND LEGENDARY REGION Most of the graffiti, though, was left by Arabic-speaking Christians. One interesting depiction of the Last Supper was found above a German coat of arms, which depicted a goblet, a platter, and a round piece of bread with a hole in it, similar to a Jerusalem bagel. This image shows a Styrian coat of arms, as well as an Armenian \"Christmas 1300\" inscription and a Serbian inscription reading \"Akakius.\"(Shai Halevi / © Israel Antiquities Authority) Researchers also found an Armenian inscription reading \"Christmas 1300,\" as well as an Arabic inscription reading \"ya al-Ḥalabīya.\" For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"Based on the double use of the feminine suffix ‘ya’, the researchers concluded that this is a graffito of a female Christian pilgrim from the Syrian city of Aleppo, making it a rare material trace of pre-modern female pilgrimage,\" the statement noted. Researchers found the inscription of a Syrian woman from Aleppo, seen here.(Shai Halevi / © Israel Antiquities Authority) Researchers first documented the inscriptions using multispectral photography and Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), before analyzing the images in a lab. Analysts then\"digitally merged\"the two photographic techniques to make the inscriptions readable.

    "title": "Archaeologists uncover remnants of Florida's short-lived British past in St. Augustine: 'Always fascinating'",
    "article_text": "Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about the recent excavation of 18th-century British redoubts in the Sunshine State. Archaeologists in theoldest city in the United Statesrecently excavated part of an historic district — unearthing remnants of its short-lived British past. Fox News Digital spoke with Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, about the excavation. The project took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood and wrapped up in February.(See the video at the top of this article.) Archaeologists were digging at the site as they made way for construction and discovered the dried-up moat of a British redoubt, or small outpost. TRAVELERS HEAD TO ‘MOST WELCOMING CITIES' IN AMERICA: SEE IF YOURS MADE THE LIST \"We knew there were a series of British redoubts,\" White said. \"In St. Augustine, everyone thinks about the Spanish period, but we actually had a 20-year period where the British were in control of both East and West Florida.\" The British inhabitants of St. Augustine built the redoubt in 1781, due to fears of attacks by the Spanish.(City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) St. Augustine was primarily a Spanish military town in the first 200 years of its history, beginning in 1565. Florida came under British control when Spain traded it for Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British. In 1763, through the Treaty of Paris, the British gained control of Florida and theSeven Years' War (1756-1763)ended. But the British inhabitants of St. Augustine still worried about attacks by the Spanish — hence the fortifications, according to numerous historical accounts. ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER LONG-LOST TOMB OF UNKNOWN PHARAOH IN EGYPT At the end of the American Revolution, the Spanish crown was given back control of Florida in exchange for some of their assistance to the British. The Sunshine State didn't become U.S. territory until 1821. \"The Spanish actually attacked both [the port of] Mobile and Pensacola,\" White said. \"So there was a great fear that there could be an attack on St. Augustine.\" The redoubt contained a dry moat with organic material, including seeds, that will undergo additional testing.(City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) \"A series of these small redoubts were constructed sort of surrounding the historic town with plans to actually connect them by a series of walls and defensive moats,\" White added. \"But that kind of never came to fruition because the American Revolution ended, and so did the threat to the British at the time.\" ANCIENT SETTLEMENT REVEALS REMAINS OF 1,800-YEAR-OLD DOG, BAFFLING EXPERTS: ‘PRESERVED QUITE WELL’ One of the most surprising parts of the excavation, first reported by The Associated Press, was not what the archaeologists found, but what theydidn'tfind. \"We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.\" White told Fox News Digital the artifacts they uncovered were few and far between. \"In [an] urban context, we're used to finding tons of artifacts because people have lived here for over 4,000 years, but in this case, it was really the lack of artifacts that surprised us,\" the historian said. ANCIENT TOMB TIED TO ROMAN GLADIATOR DISCOVERED BY ARCHAEOLOGISTS \"So we might've found a few pieces of pottery, a couple of pieces of [shotgun pellets], little pieces of lead that would've been used to fire out of a gun,\" she said. But while many people may think archaeology is just about digging up artifacts, White encouraged a broader perspective about the field. The excavation took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood. St. Augustine was established by the Spanish in 1565.(City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) \"Everyone associates archaeology with finding things, and it's really the information that we're after as archaeologists,\" White said. She added, \"[It's] not what you find, but what you'dfind out.\" One of the most interesting takeaways was the amount of seeds in the moat, which had survived thanks to the environmental conditions. \"They were really well-preserved because it's kind of in the water table at this point in time. The water table has risen over the last few centuries,\" she noted. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"So we've just started working with an ethnobotanist … and she's been starting to help us study theseplant remains, these seeds. We're hoping to learn a lot more.\" White also said the redoubts were some of the only British-constructed fortifications in the city. When they took control of the territory, the British inhabitants usually reused Spanish infrastructure instead of building their own. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Everything else was either already here and the Spanish built it, and the British might've modified it a little — but this was something that was uniquely British,\" she said. \"We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.\" White added that she hopes the group finds \"evidence … now that we sort of know what to look for, especially since there's not a lot of artifacts associated with them.\" St. Augustine's city archeology program conducts over 60 projects a year, with archaeologists constantly learning more about the city's past. St. Augustine archaeologists hope to conduct more excavations in the future, as the city's archeology program conducts dozens of projects per year.(City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) At a time when many fascinating excavations are taking place across the world,from Europeto the Middle East, White emphasized the amount the U.S. has to offer in terms of archaeology. \"I think sometimes we're surprised: 'Wait, there's archaeology in America, in our own backyard?'\" she said. \"Yes, there is archaeology everywhere.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It may not be as old as some people want to think, but there's stuff everywhere.

(Credit: @whitehouse via Instagram) It’s been 250 years since Paul Revere's midnight ride, and now,the Trump administrationis marking the patriotic silversmith's brave act with a special video. The tribute titled \"The Ride That Roused a Nation,\" offers a cinematic retelling of the 1775 event, which the White House called a \"bold act of defiance [that] set in motion a war of independence that changed the course of history.\" Meanwhile, inBostonwhere it all began, the anniversary was marked Friday with a reenactment of Revere's historic ride. TRUMP PUSHES TO ‘RESTORE TRUTH IN AMERICAN HISTORY,' END DEI AT SMITHSONIAN Actor Michael Lepage portrayed Revere, walking from the Paul Revere House to the Old North Church, where two lanterns were lit to signal the British advance.

Massachusetts 250th is conducting various American Revolution events throughout Boston and Massachusetts.(David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Revere’s mission began late on the night of April 18, 1775, when two lanterns lit in Boston’s Old North Church signaled that British troops were crossing the Charles River by sea. Revere mounted a borrowed horse and rode into the countryside to alert colonial militias and warn patriot leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock in Lexington. Although he was stopped by British patrols before reaching Concord, his message had already been passed along by fellow riders William Dawes and Dr. Samuel Prescott. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER 250-YEAR-OLD MUSKET BALLS TIED TO AMERICAN REVOLUTION IN MASSACHUSETTS Thanks to their warning, militia forces were ready when the first shots of the American Revolution rang out the next morning on Lexington Green. The presidential statement highlighted these facts while paying tribute to Revere as \"a master craftsman, a husband, a father, and a proud son of liberty.\" It also quoted from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s famous 1860 poem, \"Paul Revere’s Ride,\" which turned the midnight journey into a national legend. While the actual ride was part of a larger effort involving multiple messengers, Longfellow’s verse — \"a cry of defiance, and not of fear\" — helped enshrine Revere’s name inAmerican memory, where it remains to this day. \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\" is a depiction of the legendary journey of American patriot Paul Revere from Boston to Lexington in 1775, to bring news that regular troops were about to march into the countryside northwest of Boston. From \"The Studio\", Volume 125.(The Print Collector/Getty Images) The video released by Trump’s team underscored that legacy with dramatic narration, archival imagery, and references to key sites like Old North Church andNorth Bridge in Concord. \"In the dead of night, a silversmith became a signal. A signal became a movement. And that movement became America,\" the voiceover declares, in the first of many patriotic events planned as part of the administration’s \"Salute to America 250\" initiative. That effort, launched ahead of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, includes coordinated federal, state, and local commemorations aimed at spotlighting major moments in early American history.

    "title": "Looming REAL ID deadline causes chaos at DMVs as critics take to social media",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use REAL ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. The countdown is on: In less than 20 days, the REAL ID requirement will take effect, requiring Americans to obtain a new form of identification in order to fly domestically. Other identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID includea valid U.S. passportor passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. As of Friday morning in New Jersey, the Department ofMotor Vehicles(NJDMV) website showed \"0 appointments available\" for REAL ID services on its site. REAL ID APPOINTMENTS ADDED AS NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO GET NEW IDENTIFICATION There were, however, 13,380 appointments available for non-driver IDs and 31,107 appointments open for transferring drivers' licenses from out of state. DMVs across the country are reportedly working to meet the demand, with some implementing Saturday REAL ID events and extending appointment hours during the week. The New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles website showed \"0 appointments available\" for REAL ID services on its site as of Friday morning.(Fox News Digital) If a driver's license falls within the renewal period, the person can book a renewal appointment to upgrade to a REAL ID — and there are 51,906 appointments available for that. Fox News Digital reached out to NJDMV for comment. NO 'REAL ID' APPOINTMENTS OPEN IN NEW JERSEY AS RESIDENTS SOUND OFF: ‘GET WITH THE TIMES, NJ' Daniel Velez, a spokesperson for TSA New England, told Fox News Digital on Friday that the agency will be \"ready to enforce\" the policy on the deadline of May 7 and that the requirement will \"not be pushed back.\" The launch date happens to fall on a Wednesday — which is one of least busy travel days of the week, Velez said. Some motor vehicle bureaus across the nation are offering extended hours and events for people to obtain REAL IDs as the deadline approaches.(Getty Images) Airports are finalizingplans on how to handle those travelers who do not have proper identification to fly. He added that travel delays will be \"few and far between.\" The approaching REAL ID deadline has drawn comments from both supporters and critics, sparking debates on social media. \"REAL ID is literally just a regular ID with a little star on it to demonstrate you showed the DMV clerk a document with your name and address on it. It's gonna be OK, people,\" one user posted on X. \"As always, no appointments available when you need it.\" Another user wrote, \"I see REAL ID is trending. What's BS about this is you have to make an appointment, and you can't just walk [into] in the DMV and get it taken care of. As always, no appointments available when you need it.\" REAL ID DEADLINE FOR TRAVELERS, SOME FEDERAL BUILDING ACCESS QUICKLY APPROACHING \"You can pitch a tent on their lawn. Camp out until they can see you,\" someone else joked about DMV appointments. Another person said, \"REAL IDs are an insult to everyAmerican citizen. What next?\" An example of a REAL ID shows the gold star in the upper right-hand corner, as shared by TSA.(U.S. Transportation Security Administration) \"States have had 25 years to implement REAL ID. Blame your state for the delay,\" said one user. \"Now we have REAL ID being forced down our throats,\" posted one man.

What am I missing.\" Said another person on X, \"We’ve been showing ID to fly as far back as I can remember. Stop fear-mongering. REAL ID simply helps guarantee that the ID being used is genuine.\" Some Americans are ordering passports amid the REAL ID deadline in order to fly domestically.(iStock) One woman shared, \"Yea, that REAL ID is definitely not happening before this flight. Thank God for a passport.\" Former presidential candidate and ex-House Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, wrote on X, \"REAL ID is one of the greatest threats to Americans' civil liberties in decades.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Another user posted, \"The fact there are roughly 90 million people in this country who will be unable to fly starting May 7 unless they pay to get a REAL ID seems like it should be a bigger story.\" Said yet another person, \"I don’t know if it’s the same in every state, but in Nevada we have to physically go to the DMV to get one … I’d rathertake my passport everywhereI go than have to ever go to the DMV.\" REAL IDs will be required starting May 7 in order for U.S. air travelers to fly domestically. DMVs have been struggling to meet demand.(Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) One man shared, \"Even as a right-leaning independent that has some libertarian views, I don’t get the hoopla over REAL ID.

    "article_text": "Palantir’s head of defense, Mike Gallagher, joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to react to a Wall Street Journal report alleging China was behind a major U.S. cyberattack during President Biden’s time in office. Taking care of your loved ones comes in many forms: cooking a warm meal after a long day, lending a listening ear when life gets tough, sending a check-in text just because or making sure they receive the right support at a nursing home. But as recent events have shown, care shouldn’t stop there. Physical and mental well-being are essential, butprotecting finances and personal informationis just as important. I’ll walk you through some steps you can take and some services worth considering to stay one stepahead of cybercriminals. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS — SIGN UP FOR KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW A man being helped with technology(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Scammers and fraudsters often have no moral compass, and they increasingly target the most vulnerable, especially nursing homes and the personal data of their residents. Take the case of Hillcrest Nursing Home, the victim of a cyberattack that led to a data breach affecting more than 100,000 people. Names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, patient records, treatment information, insurance details and provider data — all leaked in a single incident. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The good news? There are things you can do to help safeguard your loved ones’financial and personal datain the event of a similar breach. A group of elderly nursing home residents(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW CRIMINALS ARE EXPLOITING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO TARGET VULNERABLE SENIORS IN ELDER FRAUD In the first few months of 2025 alone, more than half a dozen nursing homes havereportedsome form of cyberattack. Experts say elderly patients are being targeted because they’re simply easier marks, from limited digital literacy to a lower likelihood of regularly monitoring their financial or medical accounts. Add to that the often outdated and vulnerable IT infrastructure of nursing homes, and you’ve got a prime target. As a security advisor from Optiv, a cybersecurity solutions company, explains,these centers typically operate on tight budgets, which means cybersecurity isn’t always a top priority — or even feasible at the level it should be. A woman in a wheelchair in a nursing home(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) BEST TECH TO HELP A LOVED ONE WITH MEMORY ISSUES Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but, with the right precautions, you can protect your loved ones from falling victim to these threats. Here’s a guide to six essential actions you can take to safeguard their personal and financial information. Data breaches usually happen for one reason — financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it’s crucial to take action if your or a loved one’s personal data has been exposed. One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place. If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.  They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus. When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully. Equifax: You can place afraud alert onlineor by calling their customer support at (888) 298-0045. Experian: Place afraud alert onlineor contact their customer service at (888) 397-3742. TransUnion: You can place afraud alert onlineor call them at (800) 916-8800. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Now that your credit accounts are secured, there’s one more step worth taking, a broader layer of protection. I’m talking about personal data removal services. These companies specialize in removing your personal information from the internet. With how easy it is for someone to find details like your name, address, contact info, relatives  and more, you and your loved ones are at greater risk for scams and identity theft. This is especially true for older adults, who are often seen as easier targets by scammers. Even just for peace of mind, it’s worth taking this extra step. There are plenty of services out there that tackle this issue.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Install strong antivirus software to further safeguard your loved ones' devices and personal information. Strong antivirus programs help block malware, spyware and phishing attempts that can lead to identity theft. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Encourage your loved ones to regularly review their bank and credit card statements for any suspicious transactions or do it for them. Early detection can help prevent significant financial loss. Many elderly people fall victim to scams due to limited digital literacy. Providing basic cybersecurity education, such as recognizing phishing emails, avoiding suspicious links and using strong passwords, can significantly reduce their risk of being targeted. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. HOW VR TECHNOLOGY IS CURING LONELINESS IN SENIORS Remember that protecting your loved ones from cyber threats and identity theft is an ongoing process. It’s not just about taking a few steps and forgetting about it. It's about continually updating your strategies as new threats emerge. By combining these measures, like freezing credit accounts, using fraud alerts, removing personal data from the internet, installing strong antivirus software, regularly reviewing financial statements and educating them on internet safety, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: 5 years after a dark COVID Easter, faith is flourishing",
    "article_text": "White House Faith Office members Paula White and Jennifer Korn detailed to Fox News Digital the events taking place during Holy Week and shared the Trump administration's faith goals. Five years ago, our country’s Christians experienced an Easter like none before it, and hopefully like none we will ever see again. It was a time ofisolation, loneliness and anxiety, and yet today, we are learning that out of this darkness, the flame of our faith has only grown brighter. Prior to the COVID pandemic, few Americans could have even imagined any day, let alone an Easter Sunday, upon which we could not go to church. This is, after all, a nation created by people who were seeking the freedom to worship however they pleased. All throughout Lent in 2020, which eerily tracked with the emergence of the Chinese virus, I recall hearing the Brooklyn church bells peeling, piercing the strange silence of the empty urban landscape. INSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, IN HIS OWN WORDS: ‘I WAS SAVED’ But thechurch doors were locked tighton epidemiologists' orders. The sound of the bells mingled consolation with mockery, a harsh reminder of the spiritual prohibition, but also ringing with the promise and the truth that this too would pass. At the time, separated from my family, I wrote in acolumn for the New York Postthat \"we have given up each other for Lent. But as we awake on Sunday to the surreal reality of current circumstance, there is hope we will see each other again.\" As we celebrate the Lord’s resurrection this year, not only have the COVID lockdowns passed, not only are our churches open, but they are packed to the brim with flocks of the faithful, new and old, in what some have called another American religious revival. At church, things can be beautiful and true and celebrated, unlike the snark-filled world of our screens that thrives on cruel jokes. This week, that same New York Post ran an article with the glorious headline, \"Young people are converting to Catholicism en masse — driven by pandemic, internet, ‘lax’ alternatives.\" The National Catholic Register reports that Catholic parishes across the nation are experiencing 30-70% growth in attendance, and it's not just Catholics. Ask any practicing Christian in our country, and I meet a lot on the road, and most will tell you they see and feel the growth in the faith. People attend Sunday mass at Saint Patricks Catholic Cathedral, in New York city, on October 16, 2022.((Photo by Daniel SLIM / AFP) (Photo by DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images)) Perhaps we should not be surprised that the bitter cup of COVID led to greater religious observance by Christians. After all the Holy Spirit, speaking through the prophets, has told for thousands of years of periods of loss and suffering that end in the fullness of God’s light. From the banishment from Eden, to the Flood, to the Exodus, and finally Christ’s 40 days of starvation and temptation in the desert, again and again, it is suffering that brings God’s people closest to Him. During COVID, our desert was isolation, and especially for young people, it only exacerbated what was already a trend of smartphones replacing playgrounds, of virtual life online slowly supplanting reality. At church, everything is very real, much as it has been for more than a thousand years. At church, we are never alone. At church, things can be beautiful and true and celebrated, unlike the snark-filled world of our screens that thrives on cruel jokes. Human beings need a purpose and meaning beyond being a cog in the brave new world of tech. We need connection to our God and to each other. And so we should think back to our cold, dark COVID Easter this year, as spring brightens the clouds and warms the grass across this nation, and remember that once again, like always, God has delivered us from suffering. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This year, there will be family and friends, handshakes and hugs. There will be no masks, and life will be well-lived, like in the good old days, like in the old normal. Maybe more than anything else, we all learned the hard way not to take the practice of our faith for granted. We never thought it could be taken from us, and yet it was, though thankfully only briefly. The other night, I had to pick up my son from his CCD class at church. It was after 9 p.m. and the class was running late. I was tired and annoyed, but then I saw him and his buddies walking out, laughing, having just spent an hour talking about God. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A feeling of gratitude washed over me. I didn’t have to be there, I got to be there. This wasn’t a burden, it was a blessing. Is America poised for a new religious revival out of the ashes of COVID? It may be too soon to say, but in the end, it is up to us, and so far, the signs are looking pretty good.

    "article_text": "New episodes of 'The Saints' will be featured on FOX Nation starting on April 4 as it spotlights the lives of Francis of Assisi, Moses the Black and Mary Magdalene. Years ago, my wife Gracie sang for PresidentGeorge W. Bushat a special event in Nashville. That performance opened another door. A year later, she was invited to sing at the 2004 Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York. After her performance in New York, we were ushered into the president’s box – seated just behindGeorge H. W. and Barbara Bush. The following day, the White House called again while we were packing to head home. They wanted us on the platform with the president as he accepted his nomination. We stood behind a president once on a stage the whole world saw. But on Easter, we celebrate the One who holds the whole world.(iStock) That Thursday night, the arena roared. Flags hung sharp and bright overhead. The crowd’s cheers rattled the seats. The place pulsed like a living thing. If you watch the footage, you’ll see Gracie and me just over the president’s left shoulder, clapping until our hands gave out. WHY EASTER MATTERS As surreal as it all felt, one moment stood out – and it didn’t happen on the stage or near the president. It came a week after the Nashville event. I was back at the same hotel and walked past the ballroom – the sameroom that had held the president, Secret Service, media, and the temporary seat of American power. Now? Empty. No podium. No flags. Not even a chair left behind. Just another room, waiting for the next event. That’s the thing about power in this world. It shows up big – but it doesn’t stay. President George W. Bush waves after addressing delegates at the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Sept. 2, 2004. (Jeff Haynes/AFP via Getty Images) The stage comes down. The room resets. The moment passes. THE EASTER REVOLUTION CAUSES THE TYRANTS OF THE WORLD TO TREMBLE Even Madison Square Garden – iconic as it is – followed the same pattern. One night, it was a national spotlight. The next, just an arena again. In January, I watched PresidentDonald Trump’s second inauguration. As former President Bush and his wife Laura entered the Capitol Rotunda, their arrival was announced and warmly met with polite applause. But it didn’t compare to the thunderous welcome he’d once received on that stage in New York – or even in that hotel ballroom. The weight and the glory of the office had moved on. That’s how it works. Earthly glory is loud, impressive – and short-lived. But not with Christ. Former President George W. Bush winks as he arrives for President Donald Trump's inauguration in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 20, 2025.(Saul Loeb/Pool via Reuters) He didn’t take a stage. He was lifted onto a Roman cross – like Moses lifting the serpent in the wilderness. He was raised – not to inspire but to save. IN JUST 3 DAYS YOUR LIFE CAN CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. EASTER SHOWS HOW The hill wasn’t grand. Golgotha was a dump. No spotlight. No entourage. No applause.Just a Savior– and a cross. Presidents hold borrowed power. Christ doesn’t borrow anything. And here’s the difference: when a president leaves the room, the power goes with him. When Christ enters a life, He stays. He doesn’t come for ceremony. He comes to reign – and the trappings of His office never leave. HOLY WEEK AND EASTER SUNDAY OFFER A MESSAGE LIKE NO OTHER. AND IT CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE That night in Madison Square Garden, whenPresident Bushstepped forward, the air snapped with energy – it was electric. Golgotha was a dump.No spotlight. No entourage. No applause. Just a Savior – and a cross.(iStock) But it was just a spark compared to what Christ brings. \"And the government shall be upon His shoulder…\" (Isaiah 9:6) That’s not a political slogan. It’s a throne. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Presidents take an oath of office for a term. Jesus sealed an eternal promise with His own blood. Eventually, presidents leave the platform.

    "article_text": "‘The Saints’ releases new episodes, exclusively streaming on Fox Nation, starting April 4. Easter celebrates the Resurrection of Jesus from the dead. It is thecornerstone of Christianity. The faith stands or falls on this foundation. Theologians say there are three questions about Easter that Christians should be prepared to answer: Was Jesus God? Was He crucified? Did He Rise from the dead? Every other detail about Jesus's life, ministry, arrest, trial and death sentence, are secondary in comparison to those three questions. Theologian and author Dr. Lee Strobel said he once talked to Hugh Hefner, the owner of Playboy magazine and an agnostic, about Jesus. He asked him, \"What if the resurrection were true, that Jesus actually rose from the dead? Hefner said, \"Well, yeah, that would change everything?\" Then Strobel asked, \"Have you ever investigated the Resurrection?\" Hefner answered, \"No.\" GEN Z MEN POUR INTO CHURCH PEWS MORE OFTEN THAN WOMEN, FLIPPING THE TREND ON FAITH: ‘WHAT’S THE LORD DOING?' That parallels the culture at large's beliefs about organized religion. Researcher George Barna said the greatest spiritual threat today is \"syncretism.\" In other words, designer religion, where people create a fusion of different religions, without bowing down to anyone of them. While a study atCornell Universityfound that young people today are creating their own personal faith; a 'spiritual not religious' form of self-worship. It's the kind of spiritual individualism that doesn't ask questions about the core tenets of any faith. Was Jesus God? Was He crucified? Did He Rise from the dead?(iStock) But are those three questions about Easter answerable? Yes, says Strobel. \"As an atheist trained in law and journalism... I spent two years of my life investigating this stuff,\" says Strobel... \"and coming to the conclusion that in light of the avalanche of historical data for the Resurrection of Jesus, it would have taken more faith for me to maintain my atheism than to become a Christian.\" Strobel has written a series of books based on investigating the claims of Christianity. The best-seller, \"The Case For Christ,\" was the first of many. His latest book, \"Seeing the Supernatural,\" explores the plethora of the mysteries of the unseen spiritual realm, like angels and demons, mystical dreams, near-death experiences... and of course, the Resurrection. GEN Z LEADS RISE IN CHURCH ATTENDANCE IN UK: POLL On an episode of my \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast, Strobel says the Resurrection as a supernatural and divine event, hinges on Jesus being the Son of God, equal to God, the Word of God made flesh, and God incarnate. Why? Because Jesus said. \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" So... In the New Testament Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, it's pretty clear Jesus claimed to be God. Theologian and author Rick Renner, in his book, \"Easter: The Rest of the Story,\" highlights some key events of Holy Week that help answer that question. On Thursday after the Last Supper, Jesus and the Apostles go to the Garden of Gethsemane. There, hundreds of Roman soldiers descend on the Garden to arrest Jesus. The Gospel of John recounts that Jesus said to them, \"Whom do you seek? ‘They answered , \"Jesus of Nazareth. \"In most English translations, Jesus responds, \"I am he.\" Easter cross(iStockphoto) But Renner says, \"The (actual) Greek says, ‘ego eimi,’ which is, I AM. It's the same words that God identified himself with to Moses in Exodus chapter three.\" On a recent episode of my \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast, Renner talked about some of the unknown facts about that scene in the Garden, like how many Roman soldiers did it take to arrest one man? And who was that mysterious youth wrapped in only a towel that ran away naked after being chased? MARTIN SCORSESE TELLS THE STORY OF ST. MOSES THE BLACK, A ONCE-BLOODTHIRSTY BANDIT WHO BECAME AN ICON OF MERCY Renner says there are other places in the Bible where it's clear that Jesus acts and says things with the kind of authority that only someone believing he was God would say and do. Jesus tells His followers, \"Very truly I tell you... before Abraham was born, I am!  \"Again, the words God uses to identify Himself in the Old Testament and his claims to have been in existence long before the patriarch Abraham was born. And this famous verse, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\" Jesus's declaration of divinity is what sealed His fate. It angered the prevailing religious leaders, who then pressured the civil authorities to do away with him. They had him arrested. He was beaten and then crucified on a cross. Strobel says despite Dan Brown's widely popular fiction \"The Da Vinci Code,\" and other conspiracy theorists who postulate that Jesus didn't die on the cross and somehow he survived... the evidence proves otherwise. Says Strobel, \"We have not only accounts in the New Testament, we've also got five ancient sources outside the Bible that talk about His execution. In fact, no less of a source than theJournal of the American Medical Association, which is a secular, scientific, peer-reviewed medical journal, carried an investigation into the death of Jesus and said, quote, 'clearly the weight of the historical and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead even before the wound to his side was inflicted'. So, Jesus clearly was dead.\" Strobel says one of the key issues about the Resurrection is that the accounts are quite early in the historical timeline. Skeptics say that the resurrection was a legend concocted by Jesus' followers. But legends take about100 to 200 years to develop. Author Lee Strobel says one of the key issues about the Resurrection is that the accounts are quite early in the historical timeline.(iStock) Says Strobel, \"We have a report of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, including named eyewitnesses and groups of eyewitnesses including 500 at once who saw him alive, that has been dated back by scholars to within months of the death of Jesus. That is a news flash in ancient history.\" In comparison, the first two biographies of Alexander the Great were written 400 years after his life... and they are generally considered reliable, says Strobel. \"So here we've got something that goes right back virtually to the scene.\" And that pesky empty tomb is a head scratcher. Did his disciples steal the body and perpetuate a lie about his raising from the dead? The fact, says Strobel, that everyone admits the tomb was empty, corroborates eyewitness accounts. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Says Strobel, \"We have no fewer than nine ancient sources inside and outside the New Testament confirming and corroborating the conviction of the disciples that they encountered the risen Jesus. That is an avalanche of historical data.\" So what? What difference does it make if the Resurrection is true? Former cold case murder detective J. Warner Wallace says it makes all the difference in the world. Wallace, a former atheist, used his forensic skills to try todebunk Christianityand came away a staunch believer. He saw in the four Gospel accounts of the Resurrection not a series of discrepancies, but four different eyewitness accounts of the same event. If the four writers had said the exact same thing, just like in anymurder investigation, Wallace says he would have known there was a cover-up. Says Warner, \"The evidence broke through my philosophical naturalism, and the Gospels passed all the tests we use to evaluate eyewitness accounts.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But there is one more mountain to climb.To believe Jesus is God, that he died on a cross and was supernaturally resurrected... can all be intellectual facts. But to bow down and worship Jesus as your Lord and Savior because on that cross he defeated death and bridged the eternal chasm between God and humanity... that takes a lot more.... that takes leap of faith.

    "title": "President Trump’s ultimate magic trick",
    "article_text": "‘Fox News @ Night’ panelists Jessica Millan Patterson and Kaylee McGhee White break down the Trump administration’s latest tariff negotiations and reports of nearing deals with more than 10 countries. You can say a lot of things about PresidentDonald Trump, but one thing no one can deny: The man understandsshowmanship. And if there’s one place on Earth where showmanship reigns supreme, it’s Las Vegas. But Donald Trump didn’t build a hotel in Vegas to learn how to count cards or win at slots. He’s built many hotels. What he picked up in Las Vegas was the magician’s most powerful tool: misdirection. The ability to distract the crowd with one hand while pulling off the real magic with the other. And right now? He’s using that same strategy toget things done for America– whether you love him or loathe him. And those who loathe him have a hard time separating the man from his policies. In just a short matter of time we will uncover whether President Trump is a mad genius or if he’s just mad. Former President Donald Trump smiles during a Hispanic roundtable at Beauty Society on Oct. 12, 2024, in North Las Vegas.(Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Let me break it down. Misdirection is the art of drawing your opponent’s attention one way, while the real play is happening elsewhere. It’s how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. It's how Trump has always played politics – and he's back on center stage. 10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER Here are three ways Trump is using magician misdirection right now: 1. Tariff Hype, But The Real Tariffs Were Aimed At China Everyone’s shouting about Trump’s 10% tariff on all countries – calling it reckless, inflationary and a new trade war in disguise. But while the mainstream media fixates on the headlines, Trump’s real play is something else entirely: Sending awarning message to Chinaand reviving good old American manufacturing. Consider Trump's tactics. Announce a policy. Change a policy. Announce a policy. Change a policy. Part of being a master negotiator is to never let your opponent get balanced footing. In the end of this massive flurry of tariff talks the last two weeks, the real tariff hit China the hardest at 145%, sending the ultimate message that we won’t tolerate manipulative tactics from China. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT While behind closed doors, the Trump team is simultaneously working with economic advisors to roll out a broader industrial plan – one focused on bringing critical supply chains home, incentivizing American-made goods and loosening our dangerous reliance on China. The tariff talk? That’s just the spark. The fire iseconomic independence. 2. Tariff Revenue, Tax Talks Amid all the tariff scuttlebutt, most Americans are forgetting that right around the corner looms one of thelargest tax discussionsin American history. President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, and those very tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025. One of the big initial questions is, how we are going to pay for the tax cuts to continue and for what was promised on the campaign, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits. According to a study, President Trump’s tariff plan (as of April 8, 2025) is projected to raise significant revenue – over $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a \"strict conventional\" basis and $4.2 trillion on a \"partially dynamic\" basis commonly used with tariffs. This revenue could be used to reduce federal debt, thereby encouraging private investment. HOW THE SENATE AND HOUSE FIND $2 TRILLION Instead, while most of the public-facing discussion in the media has been abouttrade imbalancesor resurrecting fairness of trade around the world so the United States doesn’t get taken advantage of anymore, this is a master magician move by President Trump as I predict he will use these tariffs revenues as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan that will move corporate tax rates to 15%, fulfill part of the \"no tax\" promises made on the campaign trail, and create tax cuts for millions of middle-class families in America. It’s just that nobody is talking about it right now. 3. It’s Not A Nobel Prize, It’s The Noble Cause From Ukraine toGaza, and with growing tensions between Taiwan and China, global instability is on the rise. Some suggest that Trump’s goal in stopping these wars is selfishly to win a Nobel Peace Prize. But while President Joe Biden tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to please both progressives and defense hawks, Trump is pushing a simple message: peace through energy, economic strength, and keeping our enemies off balance. If you don’t comply, \"there will be hell to pay.\" We don’t always know what President Trump’s real goal is in this magic trick. Take over Greenland? Canada as the 51st state? Gulf of America? Mineral deals withUkraine? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION If you don’t watch the sleight of hand, what he’s calling for is a return to full-scale American energy dominance – through oil, gas, nuclear and even clean coal – to take power back from rogue nations like Iran and Russia. While critics scream \"isolationism,\" Trump may just be pulling off the ultimate trick by crafting a platform of controlled strength that aims to keep America out of wars by making sure no one wants to pick a fight in the first place. How would that be for a grand finale? Atlantic City and Las Vegas may have taught Donald Trump that if you want to win the game, you don’t just play your hand – you control where everyone’s looking. And while the media, the left and even some conservatives keep falling for the noise, he’s laying track for a political comeback that’s part Houdini, part heavyweight prizefighter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Love him or hate him, Trump knows how to put on a show. But don’t mistake the sizzle for the steak. Look past the lights – and you’ll see the real trick: getting stuff done for America while everyone else is watching the shiny objects. Because in politics,just like in Vegas, the brilliant magicians don’t succeed with luck. They do it with misdirection.

    "title": "Uncancel the minutemen: Celebrate Lexington and Concord heroes, Black and White, on battle's 250th anniversary",
    "article_text": "Capt. John Parker led 77 members of the Lexington, Massachusetts, militia into battle against 700 British regulars on April 19, 1775. The deadly firefight that ensued, including \"the shot heard ‘round the world,\" ignited the American Revolution. Now is the perfect time to uncancel the minutemen, theRevolutionary War marksmenwho were ready to defend their towns at a moment’s notice. This week marks the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, whereMassachusettsminutemen fought on April 18-19, 1775, to defend these towns against British soldiers who tried to seize their guns and gunpowder. In recent years, however, some have tried to cancel the heroic minutemen. The Battle of Lexington and Concord, which marked the beginning of the American War of Independence, April 19, 1775. (DeAgostini/Getty Images) In August 2023,Fox Newsreported that California’s Concord High School had canceled its mascot, the minutemen, because the school’s leadership believed that minority students could not relate to these Revolutionary War heroes based on race. WHY THE MAGA MOVEMENT IS THE 1776 REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME Applying identity politics to the minutemen is debased. Why? Black men served as minutemen. One of them was Peter Salem, who ran from his home town, Framingham, to fight at the Battle of Concord alongside Lawson Buckminster, the man who’d freed him from slavery. Salem’s story is featured in the new movie, \"The American Miracle,\" which will be in theaters June 9-11, 2025. The author of this article is an on-camera scholar in the film. Unfortunately, Americans have become increasingly debased about their nation’s history, especially about America’s founding era. The last Hollywood feature film about the American Revolution was released more than 20 years ago, Mel Gibson’s \"The Patriot.\" Hundreds of colonial militia reenactors march in formation during the Battle Road reenactment at Minute Man National Historical Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts, on April 15, 2023. The reenactment recounts the battle that immediately followed the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) Nationwide protests in 2020 attacked sculptures of American heroes, including George Washington and other founders from the era. Most telling of all, however, is a terrible statistic. Only 13% of eighth graders are proficient in American history, according to a 2023 U.S. Department of Education report. GEORGE WASHINGTON’S SACRED TRADITION, A GIFT TO EVERY PRESIDENT AND ALL AMERICANS In 1772,John Adams, who later became America’s second president, warned his fellow Bostonians about debasing and corrupting the population through distorted perspectives. He believed that tyranny would flourish if lies, instead of truth, permeated the people’s understanding of important topics. \"The preservation of liberty depends upon the intellectual and moral character of the people. As long as knowledge and virtue are diffused generally among the body of a nation, it is impossible they should be enslaved. This can be brought to pass only by debasing their understandings or by corrupting their hearts,\" Adams wrote. Adams was correct. Therise of cancel culturein the United States has led to distorted perspectives of America’s history. Americans have become debased. Truth has been distorted. Grievance has replaced gratitude. Fortunately, the nation’s 250th anniversary provides an opportunity for Americans to renew their understanding of the sacrifices made for liberty during the American Revolution. A keffiyeh is wrapped around the head of a statue of George Washington during anti-Israel protests at George Washington University on May 3, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) At 10 o’clock at night on April 18, 1775, messengers, such as silversmith Paul Revere, rode on horseback throughout the Massachusetts countryside to warn residents that British soldiers were marching toward them. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO LED 77 MINUTEMEN AGAINST 700 REDCOATS AT BATTLE OF LEXINGTON: CAPTAIN JOHN PARKER Revere was tasked with going \"to Lexington and inform Mr. Samuel Adams and the Honorable John Hancock that there was a number of soldiers composed of the light troops and grenadiers marching... to Lexington or... to Concord.\" Adams and Hancock were the leaders of the Sons of Liberty. Revere ordered two lanterns to hang in the steeple of Old North Church to signal patriots across the water in Charlestown that British soldiers were crossing the river instead of traveling solely on land. In a deposition, Paul Revere described the moment that he wascaptured by a British officerduring his midnight ride. The Briton \"clapped his pistol to my head and said he was going to ask me some questions and if I did not tell the truth, he would blow my brains out. I replied that... I would tell the truth, for I was not afraid.\" Colonial militia reenactors fire a salvo at British regular militia reenactors during the Battle Road reenactment at Minute Man National Historical Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts on April 15, 2023. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) FOUNDERS' JULY 4TH LESSON: DIVIDED BY POLITICS BUT UNITED IN CORE VALUES OF A FREE PEOPLE Forced to ride with British officers, Revere heard gunfire when they were about a half a mile from Lexington. Eventually, the British let him go, but not before cutting the saddle off his horse. Thanks to Revere and other messengers, dozens of minutemen rushed to Lexington and Concord to prevent the British from capturing their gunpowder stores. The truth of Black men serving as minutemen has been available for decades. Ardent abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote \"The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution\" in 1855. Believing that \"courage and bravery\" are of no \"particular race or complexion,\" Stowe was known for writing \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin,\" which played a role in the start of the Civil War. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION \"In Colored Patriots,\" Stowe reported on the numerous Black men who contributed to the American Revolution. In addition to Peter Salem, she pointed out that Henry Hill and Toney Proctor were also Black men who fought at the Battle of Lexington and several other battles. Thanks to Revere and other messengers, dozens of minutemen rushed to Lexington and Concord to prevent the British from capturing their gunpowder stores. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) Lemuel Haynes, a Black man from Connecticut, joined the army after the Battle of Lexington. As many as 5,000 black men fought throughout the American Revolution in various capacities. Stowe also wrote about Peter Salem’s heroism on June 17, 1775, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, which also turns 250 this year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Major Pitcairn caused the first effusion of blood at Lexington,\" she explained about the British major who ordered his men to shoot at the patriots at the Battle of Lexington. At the Battle of Bunker Hill two months later, \"a black soldier named Salem shot him (Pitcairn) through, and he fell.…. and he (Salem) was presented to(General) Washingtonas having performed this feat.\" To celebrate America’s 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Two Lights for Tomorrow,  is calling on all Americans to hang two lights in their windows across the nation on April 18. It’s time to un-cancel the minutemen and commemorate the heroes of Lexington and Concord, such as Paul Revere and Peter Salem.

Representatives Brett Guthrie, Gus Bilirakis, and Gary Palmer (all Republicans)sent a letterThursday to the genetic testing company’s interim CEO Joe Selsavage asking a number of questions about how 23andMe will handle customer data if the company is sold. The letter also says that some customers have reported problems deleting their data from the 23andMe website, and it notes that direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe are generally not covered by the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). “Given the lack of HIPAA protections, the patchwork of state laws covering genetic privacy, and the uncertainty surrounding what happens to customer information should a sale of a company or customer data and information transpire, we are concerned that this trove of sensitive information is at risk of being comprised,” the representatives write. 23andMe, whichsettled a data breach lawsuitfor $30 million last year,filed for chapter 11 bankruptcyin March, with co-founder and CEO Anne Wojciki saying she was resigning to become a private bidder for the company.

Beijing’s E-Town tech hub hosted what it described as the first world’s first humanoid half-marathon on Saturday, with 21 humanoid robots competing alongside thousands of humans. Bloomberg reportsthat the winning robot, Tiangong Ultra, was built by the government-backed research institute X-Humanoid and finished the race in two hours and 40 minutes. This would not be an impressive time for a human — the race’s winning male runner finished in one hour and two minutes, and it’s normal for casual runners to complete a half-marathon in (brag alert)under two hours. Tiangong Ultra needed human assistance to win — specifically a human who ran ahead with a signaling device on his back, enabling the robot to imitate his movements. (Most other robots were remote controlled, with human operators running beside them.) Tiangong robot won the Beijing half marathon with a time of 2 hours 40 minutes – more than twice the time of the men's race winner.The robot is built by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center.https://t.co/0QGcEOeTpppic.twitter.com/dVnYx2uZ5A Every other robot needed at least three hours to complete the race, and only four robots in total managed to finish ahead of the four-hour cutoff time,according to Bloomberg. Some robots barely made it past the starting line — for example, Shennongtripped a human support runner, then slammed into a fence and shattered. At one point, Little Giant (the shortest competitor, at 30 inches in height), paused as smoke emerged from its head. The Beijing E-Town Humanoid Robot Half Marathon featured robots built by Chinese companies, as well as student groups. (Unitree’s G1 robot fell at the starting line, but the company said a client had used the robot without its algorithms.) In order to compete, robots needed to have a humanoid appearance and run on two legs. They ran in a separate, fenced-off lane from the humans, with staggered start times to reduce the risk that they’d run into each other. Battery changes were allowed (Tiangong Ultra’s battery was changed three times), and substitute robots could even be swapped in with a time penalty. X-Humanoid’s Chief Technology Officer Tang Jiangtold Reuters, “”I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

We’ve got tons of stuff for you this week: antitrust lawsuits against Google and Meta; Grok can now remember; Bolt CEO Ryan Breslow wants to make his mark; and much, much more. Have a great weekend! It’s over:Googleviolated antitrust lawsin the ad tech market, a judge ruled, ending a two-year battle after eight states filed complaints against the Big Tech giant. Remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling Google Ad Manager. “We won half of this case, and we will appeal the other half,” said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs. Gone surfing:OpenAI isreportedly in talks to buy Windsurf, formerly Codeium, which makes a popular coding assistant. Before the news broke,OpenAI approached Anysphere, which makes Cursor, another coding assistant. These talks signal how important capturing a slice of the code-generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. A tweet started it all:Theseus, a defense tech company, tweeted that it had built a cheap drone at a hackathon with tech that had clear potential to combat rampant GPS jamming of drones. The tweet went viral, and the company soon found itself in Y Combinator’s 2024 cohort with$4.3 million in seed funding. The U.S. Special Forces has also entered into an agreement for early testing and development. Meta on the stand:The government’s antitrust suit against Meta started with a bang this week. Among the testimony, a few things stood out: Mark Zuckerbergonce proposed the strategyof “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” to try and make Facebook culturally relevant again. And around the time that Meta noticedTikTok affecting its growth, it stopped reporting Facebook’s user numbers in its quarterly reports. New trend in town:People are using ChatGPT to figure out the location shown in pictures. These image-analyzing capabilities, paired with the models’ ability to search the web, make for apotent location-finding tool. Great, just what we wanted. Grok catches up:Groknow has a “memory” featurethat lets the bot remember details from past conversations with a user, and it’s available in beta on Grok.com and in the Grok iOS and Android apps in the U.S. It should be noted that ChatGPT and Gemini both already have this feature. Climate for the win:Big Tech companies are in a race to see who can eliminate carbon pollution first. This week Apple announced thatit’s halfway there: Since 2015, the company says it has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by around 60%. Back at it:After retaking the helm at Bolt, CEO Ryan Breslow announced this week a“one-click crypto and everyday payments” solutionall in one “super app” that he hopes will formally mark his return as the company’s leader. Oh?Nvidia said this week that it was informed by the U.S. government that it will need a license toexport its H20 AI chips to China. Earlier in the week it flagged that it will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to startproducing some of those chips in the U.S., but it was light on details. Call me “Dev Mode” now:Figmasent a cease-and-desistto popular no-code AI agent Lovable so it would stop using the term “Dev Mode” for a new product feature. Figma also has a product called Dev Mode, which it trademarked last year. Isn’t there enough Dev Mode to go around? Where in the world?Rippling filed a lawsuit against rival Deel alleging that Deel paid one of its employees to spy on Rippling. Rippling was trying to serve Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz with papers butcouldn’t find him. Now it’s even more complicated:Bouaziz and his lawyers are in Dubai, which has a reputation for being a safe haven for those wanting to avoid extradition. More AI with your AI:Notion this week released Notion Mail, an AI-powered email client that hooks up with your Gmail to help organize emails, draft responses, schedule meetings, and search across messages. Lucid Gravity first drive:“The Lucid Gravity may just be over-engineering at its best,” writes Abigail Bassett, whotook a spin in the electric SUV. It’s poised to take market share from the likes of other luxury EV and internal combustion SUVs like the Rivian R1S, Cadillac Escalade IQ, BMW X7, and Audi Q8.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder – and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch – is being skewered on X after he announced it. Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”) Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.” Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible. Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote. Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics. The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize for companies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for most humans.” But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others. This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT-maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up-front about the relationship. When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.” Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment. Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing Partner at crypto hedge fund AltX, andself-described“effective altruist.” He told TechCrunch he invested because, “The team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.” Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic. “Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch. This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?). On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: if humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing. Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.” But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources—such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.” So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare – if the AI agents are paying taxes. Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents which helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: a year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well. He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.” However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is, too. And agent startups abound: from tasks specialists (outbound sales, financial analysis); to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics. In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

The U.S. government is accusing Meta of violating competition laws by acquiring companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that threatened the Facebook monopoly. If lawyers for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are successful, the government could force Meta to break up its business by selling off Instagram and WhatsApp. As part of the trial, the FTC shared compelling evidence to demonstrate that Facebook was very much aware of the risk Instagram created for its business as the photo-sharing app grew in popularity. In documents containing Facebook’s internal emails, Facebook execs fret over Instagram’s growth and discuss how much to pay for the app, if Facebook were to acquire it. The company execs also discuss other strategies for limiting Instagram’s growth, including copying its functionality and releasing an app of their own, or buying the app and then no longer adding new features to it while working on its own products. Facebook’s strategy to either buy or bury its competition is on display in these conversations, according to the government’s arguments. In addition to showing how the company was thinking about its competition at the time, the messages are indicative of the cutthroat strategies that have allowed Meta to become the social networking behemoth it is today.

    "title": "Zelensky says Russian attacks ongoing despite Putin announcing 'Easter truce'",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says he has ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine, as he declared an \"Easter truce\" until the end of Sunday. He said the 30-hour truce would last until 22:00 BST on Sunday (00:00 Moscow time), adding that Russian forces should be prepared to respond to \"any possible violations\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce, but accused Moscow of breaking it. \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions,\" he said. \"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table — the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X. He said fighting continued in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions and Russian drones were still in use, but added that some areas had become quieter. Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. Responding to Putin's initial announcement, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha wrote on X: \"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a cease-fire. 30 hours instead of 30 days.\" \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions. We know his words cannot be trusted and we will look at actions, not words,\" he added. Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. \"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov. \"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\" The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine. It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. Reacting to Putin's truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\" Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. The US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. Last month, Moscow rejected a proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine. US President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would \"take a pass\" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress. He was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\". \"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added. \"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\" The US and Ukraine have taken the first step to finalising a deal that would set up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction. Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government in days, but it failed. Steve Witkoff appeared to suggest that a peace deal hinged on the status of five Ukrainian regions. Anna Alexandrova denied posting anti-war messages, insisting the case was motivated by a land squabble. The US president apportioned blame to Ukraine's leader hours after the deadliest strike on civilians this year.",

    "article_text": "Tributes have been paid to British couple Elaine and Graeme Winn who were among four people killed in a cable car crash near Naples. The school Mrs Winn worked at in Market Harborough described the 58-year-old as \"much-loved and highly respected\", and tributes were also left for the couple on social media. The mountain cable car cabin plunged to the ground after one of the cables supporting it snapped on Thursday, local officials said. The cable car operator said it had passed a safety inspection just two weeks ago and that a criminal investigation has been opened. The two other victims include the driver of the cable car, named by authorities as 59-year-old Carmine Parlato, and an Israeli woman identified as Janan Suliman. A fifth person in the cabin, Ms Suliman's brother, was \"extremely seriously injured\" in the crash and airlifted to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition, officials said. Authorities in Torre Annunziata have opened an investigation into the cause of the crash. A spokesperson for Welland Park Academy said Mrs Winn worked at the Leicestershire secondary school as a business manager and that it was \"deeply saddened\" by her death. \"Elaine was a much-loved and highly respected member of our school community,\" they said. \"Her professionalism, warmth, and unwavering dedication to school life touched the lives of students, staff, and families alike.\" They added: \"The care and kindness she showed to everyone in our community means her loss will be felt deeply by us all.\" The mayor of Castellammare di Stabia - where the cable car is located - said it was believed a traction cable had snapped. \"The emergency brake downstream worked but clearly not the one on the cabin that was about to reach the top of the hill,\" Luigi Vicinanza told Italian media on Thursday. He added that there had been regular safety checks on the cable car line which runs the two miles (3km) between the town to the top of Mount Faito. Vicinanza's spokesman told PA news agency that 10 people were rescued from a second cabin which was also on the line near the bottom of the valley at the time of the incident. They were winched to safety. The investigation into the incident will examine the possibility that strong winds could have been among the causes of the incident. The cable car service had been suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday due to adverse weather conditions and had only resumed full operations on Thursday morning. British tourist Megan Paceywas near the site of the incident on Thursdaywith her husband and their two young children when they saw the suspended cable car. Ms Pacey said: \"We were within a minute or two of [the incident] happening.\" \"We watched the first couple of people come down in a harness, and as we left, there was a sense of urgency that had kicked in.\" She said flowers and candles had been left as tribute on the railway station steps on Friday. A day of mourning will be held in the town, which is between Pompeii and Sorrento, and all local events for the Easter holiday have been cancelled. The president of the region, Vincenzo De Luca, said it was a \"truly tragic and painful\" day. Shortly after the crash, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who was on a trip to Washington, expressed her \"sincere condolences\" to the families of the victims. The Mount Faito cable car has been operating since 1952. A similar accident on the line in 1960 left four people dead. A Goring-by-Sea church's ceiling bears a scale replica of the famous Sistine Chapel ceiling A family of four from London have spoken about being at the scene of a cable car accident in Monte Faito. The car had been traversing the 1,100m-high mountain when a cord to one of the cabins snapped say local media. The US vice-president will meet Italy's prime minister but an audience at the Vatican could also happen, the BBC learns. A Swiss ski resort is cut off and people have been told to stay indoors in the French resort of Tignes.",

Paria Veisi, from Cathays, in Cardiff, was last seen at 15:00 BST on 12 April when she left her place of work driving a black Mercedes GLC 200. A man from Penylan, Cardiff, and a woman from White City Estate, London, have been charged. Both appeared in Cardiff Magistrates' Court on Saturday and have been remanded in custody. Ms Veisi's body was discovered at an address in Penylan, police said. The 41-year-old man from Penylan has been charged with murder, preventing lawful and decent burial of a dead body and assaulting a person occasioning them actual bodily harm. The 48-year-old woman from Australia Road, White City Estate, London, has been charged with preventing a lawful and decent burial of a dead body and conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

    "title": "Police algorithm said Lina was at 'medium' risk. Then she was killed",
    "article_text": "In January, Lina went to the police. Her ex-partner had been threatening her at home in the Spanish seaside town of Benalmádena. That day, he'd allegedly raised his hand as if to hit her. \"There had been violent episodes - she was scared,\" Lina's cousin Daniel recalls. When she got to the police station, she was interviewed and her case registered with VioGén, a digital tool which assesses the likelihood of a woman being attacked again by the same man. VioGén - an algorithm-based system - asks 35 questions about the abuse and its intensity, the aggressor's access to weapons, his mental health and whether the woman has left, or is considering leaving, the relationship. It then records the threat to her as \"negligible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"extreme\". The category is used to make decisions about the allocation of police resources to protect the woman. Lina was deemed to be at \"medium\" risk. She asked for a restraining order at a specialist gender violence court in Malaga, so that her ex-partner couldn't be in contact with her or share her living space.  The request was denied. \"Lina wanted to change the locks at her home, so she could live peacefully with her children,\" says her cousin. Three weeks later, she was dead. Her partner had allegedly used his key to enter her flat and soon the house was on fire. While her children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, Lina didn't. Her 11-year-old son was widely reported as telling police it was his father who killed his mother. Lina's lifeless body was retrieved from the charred interior of her home. Her ex-partner, the father of her three youngest children, was arrested. Now, her death is raising questions about VioGén and its ability to keep women safe in Spain. VioGén didn't accurately predict the threat to Lina. As a woman designated at \"medium\" risk, the protocol is that she would be followed up again by a nominated police officer within 30 days. But Lina was dead before that. If she had been \"high\" risk, the police follow-up would have happened within a week.  Could that have made a difference to Lina? Tools to evaluate the threat of repeat domestic violence are used in North America and across Europe. In the UK, some police forces use DARA (Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment) - essentially a checklist. And DASH (Domestic Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-based Violence Assessment) may be employed by police or others, like social workers, to assess the risk of another attack. But only in Spain is an algorithm woven so tightly into police practice. VioGén was developed by Spanish police and academics.  It's used everywhere apart from the Basque Country and Catalonia (those regions have separate systems, although police co-operation is nationwide). The head of the National Police's family and women's unit in Malaga, Ch Insp Isabel Espejo, describes VioGén as \"super-important\". \"It helps us follow each victim's case very precisely,\" she says. Her officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day. And every month, VioGén classifies nine or 10 women as being at \"extreme\" risk of repeat victimisation. The resource implications in those cases are huge: 24-hour police protection for a woman until the circumstances change and the risk decreases. Women assessed as \"high\" risk may also get an officer escort. A 2014 study found that officers accepted VioGén's evaluation of the likelihood of repeated abuse 95% of the time. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm. Ch Insp Espejo says that the algorithm's calculation of risk is usually adequate. But she recognises  - even though Lina's case wasn't under her command - that something went wrong with Lina's assessment. \"I'm not going to say VioGén doesn't fail – it does. But this wasn't the trigger that led to this woman's murder. The only guilty party is the person who killed Lina. Total security just doesn't exist,\" she says. But at \"medium\" risk, Lina was never a police priority. And did Lina's VioGén assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner? Court authorities didn't give us permission to meet the judge who denied Lina an injunction against her ex-partner - a woman attacked on social media after Lina's death. Instead, another of Malaga's gender violence judges, Maria del Carmen Gutiérrez tells us in general terms that such an order needs two things: evidence of a crime and the threat of serious danger to the victim. \"VioGén is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one,\" she says. Sometimes, the judge says, she makes restraining orders in cases where VioGén has assessed a woman as at \"negligible\" or \"low\" risk.  On other occasions she may conclude there's no danger to a woman deemed at \"medium\" or \"high\" risk of repeat victimisation. Dr Juan Jose Medina, a criminologist at the University of Seville, says Spain has a \"postcode lottery\" for women applying for restraining orders – some jurisdictions are much more likely to grant them than others.  But we don't know systematically how VioGén influences the courts, or the police, because studies haven't been done. \"How are police officers and other stakeholders using this tool, and how is it informing their decision-making? We don't have good answers,\" he says. Spain's interior ministry hasn't often allowed academics access to VioGén's data. And there hasn't been an independent audit of the algorithm. Gemma Galdon, the founder of Eticas – an organisation working on the social and ethical impact of technology – says if you don't audit these systems, you won't know if they're actually delivering police protection to the right women. Examples of algorithmic bias elsewhere are well-documented.  In the US, analysis from 2016 of a recidivism tool found black defendants were more likely than their white peers to be incorrectly judged to be at higher risk of repeat offending. At the same time, white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be wrongly flagged as low risk. In 2018, Spain's interior ministry didn't give a green light to an Eticas proposal to conduct a confidential, pro-bono, internal audit. So instead, Gemma Galdon and her colleagues decided to reverse-engineer VioGén and do an external audit. They used interviews with women survivors of domestic abuse and publicly available information - including data from the judiciary about women who, like Lina, had been killed. They found that between 2003 and 2021, 71 women murdered by their partners or ex-partners had previously reported domestic abuse to the police.  Those recorded on the VioGén system were given risk levels of \"negligible\" or \"medium\". \"What we'd like to know is, were those error rates that cannot be mitigated in any way? Or could we have done something to improve how these systems assign risk and protect those women better?\" asks Gemma Galdon. The head of gender violence research at Spain's interior ministry, Juan José López-Ossorio, is dismissive of the Eticas investigation: it wasn't done with VioGén data. \"If you don't have access to the data, how can you interpret it?\" he says. And he is wary of an external audit, fearing it could compromise both the security of women whose cases are recorded and VioGén's procedures. \"What we know is that once a woman reports a man and she's under police protection, the probability of further violence is substantially lowered - we've no doubts about that,\" says López-Ossorio. VioGén has evolved since it was introduced in Spain.  The questionnaire has been refined, and the \"negligible\" category of risk will soon be abolished. And even critics agree it makes sense to have a standardised system responding to gender violence. In Benalmádena, Lina's home has become a shrine. Flowers, candles and pictures of saints were left on the step. A small poster stuck on the wall declared: Benalmádena says no to gender violence. The community fundraised for Lina's children. Her cousin, Daniel, says everyone's still reeling from news of her death. \"The family it's destroyed – especially Lina's mother,\" he says. \"She's 82 years old. I don't think there's anything sadder than to have your daughter killed by an aggressor in a way that could have been avoided. The children are still in shock – they'll need a lot of psychological help.\" Jonny Fox is displaying his paintings at an exhibition called Back Story in Seaford, East Sussex.

    "title": "Inside the rural Texas town where Elon Musk is basing his business empire",
    "article_text": "After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas – but his new neighbours have mixed views. Half an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind. Somewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become. Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform. A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufacturesStarlink satellite internet equipment. Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views. Here the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development. Of course, there are also specific political angles to the move. In July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes. Musk has anestranged transgender daughterand has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\"-which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas. And so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US. In addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May. Locals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development. \"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area. \"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says. Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area. \"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says. \"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says. The Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop. On a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside. The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation. The area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center. During World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town. \"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes. Views of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area. Judah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic. \"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it. \"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\" Alfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on. Instead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay. Mr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours. \"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\" His concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (£8,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations. The Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant. The water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off. In November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies. It's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country. Local officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (£34,800) in revenue this year. The company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (£13.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop. Few local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through. \"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\" The BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington. But to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the \"historic nature\" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts. Bastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place. \"His national stuff doesn't really register,\" she says. \"His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.\" Demonstrations, taking place on the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War, addressed a range of grievances. The accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law. \"Olo\" is said to be a saturated blue-green - but some say the existence of a new colour is \"open to argument\". Iranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal.

    "title": "Three chords and the truth: Where country's big moment might go next",
    "article_text": "They say the recipe for a good country track is simple - just combine three chords and the truth. Over the past year though, a growing number of artists have been adding their own sprinkles with pop stars including Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter leaning into the genre. Chappell's The Giver went straight to number two in the UK charts when it was released in March, with the self-proclaimed Midwest Princess saying she wanted to give country music a new take with \"a little gay yodel\". Figures from streaming platforms suggest that cooking up a country song has also been a recipe for success, with listening time up by 25% over the past year in the UK. British artists are hopeful that'll act as a giddy up to the UK scene and help them replicate some of the success of their US country cousins. \"It only benefits me and other country music artists in the UK because more people listening to country music just means they're going to take an interest - hopefully - in what we're doing,\" 20-year-old singer Neeve Zahra tells BBC Newsbeat. Her love for country music comes from two sources: her grandad and Hannah Montana. The Disney Channel school-girl-by-day-pop-star-by-night character played by Miley Cyrus \"probably started me off\", she says. \"I can now officially say I was country before country was cool.\" Neeve, from Manchester, is already noticing a spike in people coming to gigs and hopes the hype could build to a point where British country acts can be recognised with a category at the Brit Awards. \"That's definitely the dream.\" Izzie Walsh is currently recording her debut album and tells Newsbeat it's important fans support country artists \"at a grassroots level\" to ensure it can continue to grow in the UK. \"Everyone's been sleeping on it and now it's become this big thing. \"There's a lot of support for the big US artists and it can be hard to compete with that budget, the press. \"There's a big gap between people like me and these massive artists.\" In as far as a trend can ever be attributed to one person, this resurgence in the mainstream is \"100%\" down to Beyoncé, according to country music podcaster Matt Clewes. Her 2024 album Cowboy Carter \"very much splits opinions with country fans\", Matt tells Newsbeat, but \"it has introduced new country artists to a country audience and gives a different perspective\". Artists and critics predicted last yearCowboy Carter could \"open the floodgates\"for country music fans and Spotify credits \"viral tracks\" from 2024 with the sudden uptick in streams. But there's actually been a gradual increase in listenership going back much further it says, with streams of the genre in the UK growing by 154% since 2019, the year Lil Nas X released Old Town Road with country singer-songwriter Billy Ray Cyrus. Apple Music says it's noticed similar trends and both streamers report its rising popularity is particularly striking in the UK, where according to Apple it's growing five times as quickly as in the US. That's reflected in some of the biggest songs of the past year. Sabrina Carpenter's country-pop hit Please, Please, Please, which she re-released with Dolly Parton, spent five weeks at number one in the UK and Shaboozey's A Bar Song was a fixture of the top 10 for months. British country music is even set to be represented on one of the world's biggest stages next month thanks to the UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday. \"Storytelling is so important to us and that is really rooted in country music,\" singer Lauren Byrne tells Newsbeat about why the trio felt drawn to the genre. \"We never wanted to feel like we were trying to replicate or copy, we wanted to always make it feel our own. \"It doesn't all have to be 'yeehaw'.\" Matt says the next step will be to see British country artists headlining bigger festivals as the fan base continues to grow. And as it does, he says it'll have to embrace the different points of view feeding into it. Country is often associated with being dominated by male artists, but the musicians driving it into the mainstream are mainly women. Last week Lana Del Rey joined Beyoncé, Chappell and Sabrina with her country song Henry, come on, but before them it was Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Shania Twain making country more popular. \"We're in the year of women in general for music,\" says Neeve. \"I think now it's time for the country women.\" As British country music grows, there are a few differences too with the traditional US scene that will also need embracing. \"We're often seen as, 'Why are they making country music? They don't live the country lifestyle',\" Matt says. \"We don't all live on farms, we don't all drive tractors. \"But country is all about storytelling and everyone wants to write their own story. \"It's evolving all the time so we have to be open to different styles and different perspectives.\" Neeve agrees that authenticity is the key to British country. \"It's about telling our own story,\" she says. \"I can dream about Nashville and maybe write some songs about it but I'm not gonna say I'm gonna pick you up in my truck because I don't have a truck. \"You've got to stay real to yourself. We try to keep it country but in our own way.\" Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham apologises to a mum told her baby was too young for a ticket. Memories are being sought of the heady early days of rave. The singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End. The new Disney project, titled Star Wars: Starfighter, is set to be released in May 2027.

    "title": "'Route to ignominy': Hereditary Lords on prospect of leaving parliament",
    "article_text": "Imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1538 waiting to be executed, Henry Courtenay, the Earl of Devon, wrote on his cell walls words which would become his family's motto - \"Where have I fallen, what have I done?\" Nearly 500 years later, another Earl of Devon, is once again contemplating getting the chop. Charlie Courtenay, the 19th or 38th Earl of Devon, depending on how you count it, is one of the 87 remaining hereditary peers who will be kicked out of the House of Lords this year, if the government's House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill passes. He is fairly relaxed about his impending departure. Henry Courtenay's beheading was one of four the family has suffered, so for the current Earl of Devon \"executions\" - as he puts it - are nothing new. \"For us hereditaries, that's what happens.\" For hundreds of years,hereditary peers had the right to make and debate laws in Parliament, a right they inherited from their fathers and passed on to their sons. In 1999, then Prime Minister Tony Blair described their presence in the House of Lords as an \"anachronism\" and got rid of more than 600 of them but, following what was supposed to be a temporary compromise, 92 were saved. Twenty-five years on, a new Labour government has come to power and ishoping to get rid of the ones who remain. The BBC has spoken to four of those peers preparing to pack up their parliamentary desks. Charlie Courtenay is happy to talk about his family's long history but growing up he felt uncomfortable about his privileged background. \"It's obviously awkward and embarrassing on a personal front. Particularly it doesn't help if you live in a castle - you feel a bit like the odd one out.\" \"I moved away from England for ten years and lived in America, where it suddenly became a lot easier. \"By moving to America, where the response was 'gee, that's really interesting, tell me more', I learnt to talk about it with a bit more confidence.\" His distant ancestor, Baldwin de Redvers was given the title in 1142 a reward for backing Empress Matilda's right to the throne. He inherited it following his father's death in 2015, and began to think more deeply about what it meant to be an earl. His father had been kicked out of the House of Lords in the 1999 cull but his son was able to return via a by-election process, by which hereditaries who have died can be replaced by others from the same political grouping. He says he remembers thinking \"here's a nice opportunity to provide a Devon voice in Westminster which is exactly the job Baldwin was given 900 years ago.\" The Earl of Devon is what he calls an \"unashamed\" proponent of hereditary peers. \"I am the one person who defends the indefensible,\" he jokes. He argues that, at a time of concern about the \"rabid consumption of our natural world\" hereditaries offer a \"long-term, multi-generational view\" and are less likely to be focused on short term political gains. With his remaining months, he is hoping to, if not change the law, then get some support for his amendment to remove what he calls \"the patriarchal, misogynistic\" rules that bar women from inheriting most titles. \"I find it faintly, totally ridiculous, embarrassing and wrong that my sisters and my aunt or my daughter can't inherit the title.\" Whether or not his amendments are accepted, it is all but certain that his children will not get the chance to sit in the Lords based on the title alone - a fact the earl is more than resigned to. \"The big time for the Courtenay family was around 1100. Ever since then it's been a kind of slight gentle winding down of glories. \"This is just another step on the route to ignominy.\" \"I will not miss commuting 672 miles there and back every week,\" says Lord Thurso, a Liberal Democrat peer. He lives in Thurso, a town which is on the north coast of Scotland and about as far from the Lords as you can be without getting on a boat. He has no problem with hereditary peers getting the boot (\"the idea we have some unique quality is laughable,\" he says) but doubts it will make much difference. \"This is another sticking plaster over something that really needs to be dealt with.\" He says the Lords have good debates and scrutinise the government's plans \"extremely well\" but \"does it actually get us anywhere? It doesn't.\" To have influence with the government, the Lords needs legitimacy, he says. \"A house full of largely retired MPs put out to grass for 30 or 40 years or people like me who inherited it because their grandfather was cabinet secretary? That's no way to put together a second chamber.\" In 2012, he worked on a doomed plan that would have seen the Lords made up of a combination of elected and appointed peers. He says there is not \"cat in hell's chance\" of the government making any further changes once the current bill is passed. He wants to see ministers use the legislation to make other changes including a 20 year term limit for new peers and a restriction on the size of the house. \"If you've got those two, well, then we can wait another 100 years or so for democracy,\" he sighs. Lord Howe inherited his title from a son-less second cousin in 1984, along with Penn House, a stately Buckinghamshire home. \"My wife and I lived in a small terrace house in London. She was a teacher. I was working in bank. \"All of a sudden I had a call to say I'd inherited the title. \"It was a shock to the system - particularly when you arrive on a dark January evening, the front door creaks open and there is a butler saying 'Welcome home your Lordship'. And it didn't feel like home at all.\" The heating bill cost more than his annual salary, he remembers. Just a few years after becoming a peer, he was made a minister by  then Conservative prime minister John Major (\"Must have been scraping the barrel,\" he says). He's been on the front bench of his party ever since in various roles. Nearly 40 years on, his enthusiasm for the Lords has not diminished. \"I love the place. I've found it very fulfilling. And just occasionally you feel that you've done a little bit of good.\" Lord Hacking is a rare thing - a Labour hereditary peer. There are only four of his kind, a fact that partly explains the government's enthusiasm to get rid of hereditaries. He got the title in 1971, but never expected to stay so long. He assumed hereditary peers would soon be removed and decided that once kicked out he could run to be an MP. \"It didn't quite work out like,\" he says. \"A bad political misjudgement.\" \"I remained in the House of Lords until 1999 when I was 62 and that was a bit late then to think about getting into the House of Commons. He backs his party's position on hereditary peers but not without regret. \"I wouldn't say I'm happy to get rid of them. I'm sad but I think what will happen... is that the very best of the hereditary peers will be invited to have a life peerage. \"I'm sure there will be a compromise. We always compromise out of situations in England.\" You can listen to the interviews on BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Houron BBC Sounds",

    "title": "Why I hesitate to tell people I'm a Gypsy",
    "article_text": "\"Are they going to think I'm going to steal stuff from here?\" That's the question Chantelle remembers asking herself after starting a new job and wondering whether or not to share her Romany heritage. Chantelle, 23 from Bedfordshire,says she's proud of her background but has sometimes been \"nervous\" to share it because of negative portrayals of her community in the media. \"When you watch films, it's always like, 'Oh, these are the Gypsies, they're the bad guys,'\" she explains. Chantelle features in Stacey Dooley's BBC documentary Growing Up Gypsy, which follows three young Romany women as they navigate everyday life. The show comes as the charity Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) - an organisation working to end discrimination against the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) community - says it regularly hears from Romany Gypsy women who feel pressure to hide their identity in professional or public spaces to avoid discrimination and hate. Ebony, 23 from Nottinghamshire, works as a beautician and recalls a client at a previous job, who didn't know about her heritage, telling her she didn't want to park in a certain area because there were Gypsies living near there. \"And I was sat there, painting her nails, like: 'Little do you know',\" she recalls thinking. Romany Gypsies are one of the three ethnic groups within the GRT community.Some in the community prefer to refer to themselves as travellers, while others prefer to use the term Gypsy. Presenter Dooley says she felt privileged to be invited into the community but that being with the women and their families has shown her \"how unwelcome they can sometimes be made to feel\". It's something that as a Romany Gypsy myself, I've had conflicting feelings about. Now 26, I'm incredibly proud of my heritage - it's often one of the first things I'll share about myself and I have incredible memories of summers spent in the cherry orchard where my family worked. However, I didn't always feel that way. At school, I was reluctant to tell people about my identity for fear of being called a derogatory name and when I applied for university, my parents told me not to tick the GRT ethnicity box on the entrance form in case it hurt my chances of getting in. I filled it in anyway, and have grown more confident in talking about my heritage but the hesitation is still there and is shared by many in the community today. \"There is a lot of hate and discrimination against travellers, and people don't get jobs because they're travellers,\" says Ebony, on why she's hidden her heritage in the past. A spokesperson for the FFT says prejudice against the GRT community \"remains widespread\" and \"too often goes unchallenged\". And in 2021, aYouGov pollorganised by the FFT suggested that 22% of people surveyed would be uncomfortable employing a Gypsy or traveller. However, Ebony also says she's had positive interactions with her employers when she did share her heritage and loves where she currently works. Chantelle now enjoys working as a content creator, with more than 400,000 followers on TikTok, and is more open in speaking about her culture, explaining people online were really \"interested\" to learn more about her heritage. Her content includes answering followers' questions about her community and making traditional dishes, like bacon pudding, which she learned to make from her grandmother. However, she still sees negative comments, with some even claiming those who live in a house are not Gypsies, which Chantelle says shows a misunderstanding of how her culture works. \"It goes back in your generations and it's in your blood,\" she says. Despite the comments,Chantelle continues to make videos and appreciates her heritage, explaining: \"I know we get talked bad about and things like that, but I'm proud of it.\" Ebony, meanwhile, hopes that people watching the documentary learn more about the GRT community and aren't so prejudiced towards them. \"I don't look at every non-traveller like you're a bad person,\" she says, adding that the community does experience that type of prejudice. \"That's what I would like people to sort of open their eyes to,\" she adds.",

    "title": "The mother and children trapped between two conflicts",
    "article_text": "When the devastating war in Sudan reached Sarah Williams' neighbourhood in the capital Khartoum, she and her children were caught in the crossfire. Bullets tore through their home, fires engulfed buildings, and electricity lines sparked explosions. \"We were crawling on the ground,\" she recalls, holding her one-year-old son close. \"It was chaos.\" Ms Williams, a 33-year-old mother of five, is from South Sudan. She was forced to flee when civil war erupted in 2013, two years after it gained independence from Sudan, to become the world's newest nation. But the post-independence euphoria soon dissipated, when a power struggle between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar triggered a civil war that claimed the lives of an estimated 400,000 people and forced 2.5 million people to flee their homes. Ms Williams was among them. After arriving in what was then a peaceful Khartoum, she rebuilt her life, working as a housekeeper for a middle-class family. But she was uprooted again after fighting erupted in the city in 2023 between forces loyal to military ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his then-deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti. \"The conflict started among themselves,\" Ms Williams says. \"But later, they began killing South Sudanese also, even though we weren't part of their fight.\" In the past two years, the conflict in Sudan has claimed more than 150,000 lives, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes, and turning large parts of Khartoum into rubble. When her home came under attack, she packed her few belongings and headed back to South Sudan. However, conflict has now resumed there too, with the United Nations (UN) warning that the 2018 peace agreement between Kiir and Machar is at risk of collapsing. Ms Williams' journey has ended, for now, in Renk. A once quiet dusty border town, it has  turned into a transit hub, heaving with refugees from both Sudan and its neighbour to the south. Stranded in Renk for about five months, Ms Williams wants to return to her hometown, Nasir, in Upper Nile State. However, it is unsafe to travel to Nasir - a strategically important port town along the Sobat River - as it has turned into a war zone. \"There's conflict ahead of us,\" she tells the BBC, holding her four-year-old daughter while gently rocking her one-year-old son. Her voice is steady, but her eyes are heavy - carrying the weight of war, loss, and uncertainty. Government troops and the White Army - a militia allied with Machar during the civil war - have repeatedly clashed in Nasir, with reports of heavy shelling, ambushes, and displacement of residents. Ms Williams has not heard from her family in the town. \"I don't know where they ran to when the clashes started… or even if they're alive,\" she says quietly. The fighting in South Sudan has left thousands of people like Ms Williams stranded at the Renk Transit Centre. The camp is overcrowded, accommodating more than 9,000 people - three times the number it was designed for. Refugees are given a small amount of cash by aid agencies to buy food, but it lasts for only two weeks and they are then expected to fend for themselves. Sarah says she and other refugees were then forced to chop down trees to sell as firewood, so that they could raise money for food \"I used to collect firewood and sell it to buy flour, but there's nothing left in the forest now. No wood for women to collect and sell,\" Ms Williams says  - a reminder of the environmental degradation that war causes. Corrugated shelters at the camp squeeze in up to 15 people per room. Others build fragile homes from sticks, cloth, and torn sacks. Overcrowding is fuelling disease, hunger and despair. Aid agencies are scrambling to move families to safer parts of South Sudan, where people have \"stronger community or family ties, livelihood opportunities, and better access to services\", says Vijaya Souri of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Hundreds wait under a scorching sun to board metal boats bound for Malakal. The journey takes two and a half days down the River Nile. Passengers sit on their luggage or the floor of the boat. Among them is Mary Deng, who escaped from Wad Madani, afierce battleground in the Sudanese conflict. \"This child was just one day old when we crossed the border,\" she says. \"We are 16 in total. We had no money - but we had God.\" She clutches a bundle of documents - her family's ticket out of Renk. Medical services are stretched to their limits. The Joda border clinic - built from iron sheets - is the only functioning health centre in the area. \"Over 600 babies have been born here since the war began,\" says a health worker. \"But we can only operate during the day now, there's no funding for night shifts.\" A cholera epidemic was declared in Renk last October. It spread across most of South Sudan, including the capital Juba,causing more than 450 deaths. Tatek Wondimu Mamecha, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) emergency officer in South Sudan, warns of the growing risks. \"Even though the cholera outbreak is controlled, we're not out of the woods. Right now, malaria is spiking and with the rainy season coming, it will shoot up,\" he tells the BBC. Mr Tatek adds that the ripple effects ofglobal aid cuts by US President Donald Trump's administrationare devastating. \"Five of our partners either stopped service or reduced operations by 50%.\" Hospitals like Renk Referral have lost half their staff, including surgeons, obstetricians, paediatricians, putting an enormous strain on the remaining medics. \"The facility manages around 350 to 400 patients a day,\" Mr Tatek says. The refugee crisis in Renk brings into sharp focus the fact that tens of thousands people are trapped between two conflicts, with parts of South Sudan no longer a safe haven for people fleeing the two-year conflict in Sudan. Tensions have escalated in South Sudan since March when Machar was put under house arrest after being accused by Kiir's allies of supporting armed groups - a claim his party denies. George Owino, the chair of a monitoring body set up under the 2018 peace deal to assist in its implementation, has warned that the latest clashes \"threaten the foundation of the agreement.\" He tells the BBC the core problem is that political leaders continue to command  rival troops, failing to integrate them into a unified national army. \"The link between politics and military power is still intact,\" Mr Owino says. \"When leaders disagree, it quickly turns into armed confrontation - exactly what the agreement was supposed to prevent.\" The 2013 civil war broke out after Kiir sacked Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup, while Machar made the counter-accusation that Kiir was a \"dictator\". The devastating civil war ended following the 2018 peace deal that saw Machar being reappointed as vice-president. \"There used to be more dialogue within the presidency. That has diminished,\" Mr Owino says. The African Union (AU) has so far failed in its efforts to get the peace process back on track, while Uganda has deployed troops to South Sudan to bolster Kiir's position. Machar's party says the deployment undermines South Sudan's sovereignty, and the 2018 peace deal. Both Uganda and Kiir's government defend the deployment, saying it is in accordance with a long-standing security agreement between the two nations. Nevertheless, the deployment shows how fragile Kiir's grip on power is, while fears grow that a full-scale civil war could resume. And across the border in Sudan, the civil war continues to rage, with Gen Dagalo announcing the formation of a rival government. His move comes despite the fact that his forces have lost control of Khartoum after heavy fighting. The city is now a burnt-out shell, with bombed and blackened buildings. Ms Williams says she has no intention of going back to Khartoum, and has decided that it is best to try and rebuild her life in her home country, \"even if the situation is bad\".

    "title": "India's sword-wielding grandmother still going strong at 82",
    "article_text": "An 82-year-old woman who teaches the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu says she has no plans to retire. \"I'll probably practise Kalari until the day I die,\" says Meenakshi Raghavan, widely thought to be the oldest woman in the world to practise the art form. Kalaripayattu - kalari means battleground and payattu means fight - is believed to have originated at least3,000 years backin the southern state of Kerala and is regarded as India's oldest martial art. It is not solely practised for combat or fighting; it also serves to instil discipline, build strength and develop self-defence skills. Ms Raghavan is fondly known as Meenakshi Amma -  Amma means mother in the Malayalam language - in Kerala's Vadakara, where she lives. The town is also home to other renowned exponents of the art like Unniyarcha, Aromal Chekavar and Thacholi Othenan. Meenakshi Amma occasionally performs in other cities but mainly runs her own Kalari school, founded by her husband in 1950. Her days are busy, with classes from five in the morning to noon. \"I teach about 50 students daily. My four children were also trained [in the art form] by me and my husband. They started learning from the age of six,\" she says. Kalaripayattu has four stages and it requires patience to learn the art form. Training begins with meypattu - an oil massage followed by exercises to condition the body. After about two years, students progress to kolthari (stick fighting), then to angathari (weapon combat), and finally to verumkai - the highest level, involving unarmed combat. It typically takes up to five years to master Kalaripayattu. Kung fu is believed to have adapted principles like breathing techniques and marmashastra (stimulating vital points to optimise energy flow) from Kalaripayattu, according to Vinod Kadangal, another Kalari teacher. Legend has it that around the 6th Century, Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma introduced these techniques to the Shaolin monks, influencing the more famous Chinese martial art. Meenakshi Amma still recalls the first time she stepped into a Kalari - the red-earth arena where the art is practised - 75 years ago. \"I was seven and quite good at dancing. So my guru - VP Raghavan - approached my father and suggested that I learn Kalaripayattu. Just like dance, the art form requires you to be flexible,\" she says. Hailing from Kerala's Thiyya community, Meenakshi Amma's guru was 15 when he and his brothers opened their own Kalaripayattu school after being denied admission elsewhere because of their low social caste. \"There was no bias when it came to girls enrolling to study Kalari - in fact, physical education was compulsory in all Kerala schools at that time. But we were expected to stop after attaining puberty,\" she says. Unlike others, Meenakshi Amma's father encouraged her training into her late teens. At 17, she fell in love with Raghavan, and they soon married. Together, they went on to train hundreds of students, often for free. \"At the time, a lot of children came from poor families. The only money he [Raghavan] accepted was in the form ofdakshinaor a tribute paid to the teacher,\" she says. Donations sustained the school, while Raghavan later took a teaching job for extra income. After his death in 2007, Meenakshi Amma formally took charge. While she has no plans to retire at the moment, she hopes to hand over the school  one day to her eldest son Sanjeev. The 62-year-old, who is also an instructor at the school, says he is lucky to have learnt from the best - his mother. But being her son earns no favours; he says she's still his toughest opponent. Meenakshi Amma is a local celebrity. During our interview, three politicians drop by to invite her to an awards ceremony. \"Amma, you must grace us with your presence,\" one of them says with folded hands. \"Thank you for considering me, I'll attend,\" she replies. Her students speak of \"fierce admiration\" for her. Many have opened their own Kalari schools across the state, a source of great pride for Meenakshi Amma. \"She's an inspiration to women everywhere - a rare person who shows love and affection to her students, yet remains a strict disciplinarian when it comes to Kalari,\" says KF Thomas, a former student.

    "title": "Thousands of trans rights protesters gather in Scotland and London",
    "article_text": "Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has said the Supreme Court ruling over the legal meaning of a woman will leave members of the trans community feeling \"uncertain and anxious\". He was speaking as protests were held in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh against the ruling that  biological sex defines a woman for the purposes of the Equality Act. Swinney declined to directly answer whether he believed a trans woman is a woman, but said he accepted the court's judgement. He said the Scottish government would set out on Tuesday the steps it will take to comply with the law. TheSupreme Court ruling on Wednesdayhas major implications for single-sex spaces and services such as public toilets and changing rooms. This means transgender women with a gender recognition certificate can be excluded from single-sex spaces if \"proportionate\". The case had been brought by the group For Women Scotland who claimed that sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The judges unanimously ruled that the terms woman and sex in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\" rather than \"certificated sex\". Large demonstrations took place in Glasgow's George Square and at the foot of the Mound in Edinburgh on Saturday to protest against the judgement. Thousands more marched through central London for what was billed as an \"emergency demonstration\" which started in Parliament Square before heading towards St James's Park. Activists demanded \"trans liberation\" and \"trans rights now\", with some waving flags and holding banners which read \"No feminism without trans women\" and \"Biology is not binary\". The Metropolitan Police said it was investigating damage to seven statues in Parliament Square which had graffiti sprayed on them during the protest. Ch Supt Stuart Bell said the damage was \"very disappointing\" to see and \"criminality like this is completely unacceptable\". John Swinney told BBC Scotland News his government would \"accept and adjust to the circumstances\". He  said: \"The first thing that is important is that we all have to accept the rule of law so I accept the Supreme Court decision because it is the voice of the most significant court in the land. \"We will focus entirely on making sure the rights of absolutely everybody are protected at a time when, I acknowledge that there will be many in the trans community that feel very uncertain and anxious about the implications of the Supreme Court ruling.\" Swinney said courts in Scotland had twice supported the Scottish government position and his government had always acted in \"good faith\" but added that the  Supreme Court had provided legal certainty. One of those who attended the demonstration in Glasgow was Alexander Cart, a trans man who described being \"completely devastated\" by the ruling. Alex told BBC Scotland News: \"I already struggle to go into to single sex spaces because I look too feminine for one and too masculine for the other but now I feel like I'm really being forced into a corner of you have to go into the ladies restroom. \"I'm terrified for the future, I don't know whether my care is going to get worse tomorrow or if it's going to get better. \"We are being told we can't be who we want to be and most of us are adults, surely it should be our choice to choose what we want and who we are.\" Trans people will continue to have protections under the Equality Act because gender reassignment is listed as a protected characteristic. The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers. The watchdog's head, Baroness Falkner, has suggested trans people should use their \"power of advocacy\" to ask for facilities including a \"third space\" for toilets. Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, the group which brought the case to the Supreme Court, has called for the Scottish government to apologise to women. She told BBC Scotland News: \"I think we'd be asking for an apology, not a personal apology from Mr Swinney, but from the Scottish government for the way they've approached this, the way they have handled this, the way they have treated women campaigners. \"There needs to be an acceptance on the part of the Scottish government that much of what they did, much of what they allowed ministers or members of committees to do and say and act was completely wrong.\" She added that the ruling would have \"huge implications\" across the public sector in Scotland, including in schools, prisons and hospitals. She said For Women Scotland should be a part of discussions moving forward. Mumsnet's founder says a number of advertisers have pulled out over the site's gender discussions. Campaigners say transgender people have been sent a message that their identities are less valid. Attendees voice their concerns about the Supreme Court's decision on the definition of women.

    "title": "Scientists claim to have discovered 'new colour' no one has seen before",
    "article_text": "A team of scientists claim to have discovered a new colour that no human has ever seen before. The research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. By stimulating specific cells in the retina, the participants claim to have witnessed a blue-green colour that scientists have called \"olo\", but some experts have said the existence of a new colour is \"open to argument\". The findings,published in the journal Science Advanceson Friday, have been described by the study's co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as \"remarkable\". He and his colleagues believe that the results could potentially further research into colour blindness. Prof Ng, who was one of five people to take part in the experiment, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday that olo was \"more saturated than any colour that you can see in the real world\". \"Let's say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, a pastel pink,\" he said. \"And then one day you go to the office and someone's wearing a shirt, and it's the most intense baby pink you've ever seen, and they say it's a new colour and we call it red.\" During the team's experiment, researchers shone a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant. There were five participants in the study - four male and one female - who all had normal colour vision. Three of the participants - including Prof Ng - were co-authors of the research paper. According to the research paper, the participants looked into a device called Oz which consists of mirrors, lasers and optical devices. The equipment was designed previously by some of the involved researchers - a team of scientists from UC Berkeley and the University of Washington, and updated for use in this study. The retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye responsible for receiving and processing visual information. It converts light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, enabling us to see. The retina includes cone cells, which are cells responsible for perceiving colour. There are three types of cone cells in the eye - S, L and M - and each one is sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red and green respectively. According to the research paper, in normal vision, \"any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighbouring L and/or S cones\", because its function overlaps with them. However, in the study, the laser only stimulated M cones, \"which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision\", the paper said. This means the colour olo could not been seen by a person's naked eye in the real world without the help of specific stimulation. To verify the colour observed during the experiment, each participant adjusted a controllable colour dial until it matched olo. Some experts, however, say the new perceived colour is a \"matter of interpretation\". Prof John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George's, University of London, who was not involved in the study, said that while the research is a \"technological feat\" in stimulating selective cone cells, the discovery of a new colour is \"open to argument\". He explained that if, for example, the red cone cells (L) were stimulated in large numbers, people would \"perceive a deep red\", but the perceived brightness may change depending on changes to red cone sensitivity, which is not unlike what happened in this study. But the study's co-author Prof Ng admitted that although olo is \"certainly very technically difficult\" to see, the team is studying the findings to see what it could potentially mean for colour blind people, who find it difficult to distinguish between certain colours.",

    "article_text": "Ocado has apologised \"unreservedly\" to Mumsnet for citing \"hateful political views\" when it pulled out of a commercial partnership over the parenting forum's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Founder Justine Roberts said Ocado \"abruptly pulled out\" of the partnership after Mumsnet called at the last election for the act to be reformed \"to ensure women can access single-sex places\". Ms Roberts said she had \"feared the site might not survive\" because of the number of advertisers which withdrew support over the discussion of gender issues on its forums. Her post came after the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesdaythat a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act. Mumsnet's call for reform would have allowed for spaces to be reserved for biological women. Ms Roberts said the forum had also made \"repeated attempts to explain our position - as a platform committed to amplifying women's voices\" but Ocado had \"refused to speak to us\". In a post on X, Ocado said the comments were \"not representative of us as a company\" and that they were made by a \"temporary contractor\" who has since left. \"We apologise unreservedly to Mumsnet,\" the online grocery site added. Ms Roberts wrote her post in a discussion on the forum about the Supreme Court ruling. In the post, she congratulated those on the website \"who played a part in securing what I think most would agree is much-needed clarity in the Equality Act\". The ruling was on a case campaign group For Women Scotland brought against the Scottish government, arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. Mumsnet's policy of allowing discussion of gender issues over a number of years had led to intense criticism, Ms Roberts said, adding that the site \"risked being permanently labelled as bigoted, vicious, and 'on the wrong side of history'\". She claimed that a number of organisations had pulled their advertising over pressure from trans activists, both \"internal and external\", threatening the survival of the site. Ms Roberts added the site \"never considered banning discussion of this issue altogether\". Her post only listed one other example, saying Mumsnet had been \"blacklisted on instruction from the top brass at Barclays\". Barclays said it would not comment when approached by the BBC. Scotland's first minister comments on the Supreme Court ruling as protests are held in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh. The judgement provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean, but it remains to be seen what will change. It is the second major case Google has lost in a year, after it was found to have a monopoly on online search. The ruling on the meaning of the term \"woman\" in law is a \"victory for common sense\", the EHRC's chair says.",

    "article_text": "Kyren Wilson defeated Jak Jones in last year's world final Halo World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:19 April to 5 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live Debutant Lei Peifan stunned defending champion Kyren Wilson by fighting back from 6-2 down to triumph 10-9 as the 'Crucible curse' struck again in the first round of the World Snooker Championship. Wilson becomes the 20th player to succumb to the so-called curse, with no first-time winner able to retain the world crown since the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977. \"It is really hard to take. I gave it my all and Lei came out extremely positive this evening and potted some incredible balls,\" Wilson told BBC Sport. \"It really hurts to be honest. As a debutant he held himself together incredibly well and I'd like to wish him all the best for the rest of the tournament. \"He seems like quite a cool character. He showed no emotion at all.\" Joe Johnson (1987) and Ken Doherty (1998) came the closest to breaking the 'curse' but fell at the final hurdle. \"It's obviously been built up into something it's not, because other players have gone on to win it. \"I'm sure it'll be broken at some point but unfortunately I won't be that person,\" added Wilson. The chances of an upset had looked slim heading into Saturday evening, despite Lei winning the final frame of their morning session to trail 6-3. However, the 21-year-old from China, who had to win two qualifying matches just to reach the televised stages of the tournament, reeled off another six consecutive frames once play resumed. Lei, who won the Scottish Open in December, knocked in pot after pot as he crafted six half century breaks and scored 544 points during that burst to move on to the cusp of victory. In contrast Wilson, who has claimed four ranking tournaments this term, looked completely out of sorts and managed a meagre 44 points until he stopped the rot in the 16th frame with his second century break of the match. The 33-year-old Englishman cleared up to pinch the 17th frame after Lei broke down on 60 and then made a half century of his own to draw level at 9-9. But the world number 39 held his nerve and sealed a famous victory with a break of 66 in the decider. \"He is a legend, I am so proud I could beat him,\" Lei said. \"I didn't think too much because it was my first time at the Crucible so I just wanted to enjoy it. I was nervous in the decider but I just told myself, 'try and calm down'.\" Watch Saturday's matches at the Crucible Wilson, O'Sullivan, Trump, Selby - who will win World Snooker Championship? World Championship: Match schedule & BBC coverage Lei, one of a record 10 Chinese players in this year's first round, will now face either Jak Jones - the player Wilson beat in the 2024 final - or former UK Championship winner Zhao Xintong. World number 14 Xiao Guodong is in control of the other match that got under way on Saturday morning. Xiao and Matthew Selt made two century breaks apiece in the opening nine frames, but the Chinese player will take a 7-2 advantage into Sunday's concluding session. Three-time champion Mark Williams is 5-4 ahead of China's Wu Yize. The Welshman won the opening three frames but was then forced to watch on as Wu constructed superb breaks of 120 and 136, as well as two half-centuries to edge 4-3 ahead. Williams took the final two frames of the session, with that match scheduled to be played to a conclusion on Sunday afternoon. Barry Hawkins also established a slender 5-4 lead over Iran's Hossein Vafaei. England's Hawkins crafted three half centuries, while Vafaei's break of 123 was arguably the highlight of a match that concludes on Sunday evening (19:00 BST). Meanwhile, 2010 world champion Neil Robertson is in danger of an early exit. The Australian, who failed to qualify for last year's tournament but is now back into the world's top 10, trails England's Chris Wakelin 7-2. Wakelin opened the match with a 108 break and the world number 20 later reeled off four frames in a row to lead 6-1. Robertson knocked in a break of exactly 100 to halt that run, but Wakelin took the ninth frame - which lasted close to 55 minutes - to establish a healthy lead before Sunday's deciding session. 10:00 Jak Jones (16) v Zhao Xintong Xiao Guodong (14) 7-2 Matthew Selt 14:30 Mark Allen (8) v Fan Zhengyi Mark Williams (6) 5-4 Wu Yize 19:00 Neil Robertson (9) 2-7 Chris Wakelin Barry Hawkins (11) 5-4 Hossein Vafaei Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

Two years ago she was living her dream, running two successful businesses helped by her explosion in popularity during the Covid lockdowns. But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fiancée - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner. She woke to find \"thousands\" of notifications from social media and messaging apps as seemingly the whole world wanted to know whether there was truth behind the rumours. Lilly was watching the life she knew fall apart in real time. The creators of the podcast, which the BBC has chosen not to name, say they are not responsible for actions taken as a result of their content. Lilly - who has not discussed what happened in public until now - sat down with me to talk about the moment which changed her future. Soon after the podcast launched, her social media feeds began to fill with what she called \"investigator-style\" videos speculating about her life and how she would react. Her first step was to delete her Instagram app. \"I just had to get away from social media,\" she said. \"People wanted answers, people wanted to see even more into my life, even when I asked for privacy. \"All I could do was control my own reaction and that meant withdrawing and protecting myself and my family.\" Lilly's relationship ended, but there was much to untangle - her ex was also her business partner, leaving her faced with raising the funds to buy him out. He has been contacted by the BBC for comment. She left Dubai, where she had been living with her partner, to move back in with her family in the UK - and had to lay off most of the companies' staff. \"It was very humbling and very difficult,\" Lilly said, explaining she had to go back to doing the work she used to have staff for - such as editing, filming her videos, and running the business' social media feeds. It meant even though she was trying her best to avoid it, Lilly was constantly engaging with social media platforms to keep her businesses going - and she had to try to avoid looking at myriad personal comments. \"I was trying to manage the heartbreak and the shock combined with keeping the business afloat,\" she said. Her most recent Instagram post until now, on her personal account, was uploaded in November 2023 - with many of the comments asking why she has not posted for so long. Up until the gossip podcast launched, Lilly had been open about her life online. And she accepted there may have \"potentially\" been less interest in her relationship had she shared less on social media. \"I truly don't know the answer to that,\" she said. \"I think when I compare to some other people, I didn't show a lot of my lifestyle. \"But it was clearly enough for people to put two and two together.\" Lilly acknowledged she had shared snapshots about herself to help build her brand - to draw in those who wanted to know more about her - and for a long time it was a successful strategy. While she maintained some boundaries such as not revealing information about her family, she said there was always an unspoken pressure to share more. \"I've learned people will constantly want more the more you give,\" she said. \"If it's just showing your dog, or sharing your relationship, it's like 'okay, what else, now show the house'. \"It can lead to a lot of exposure because you're chasing likes or you feel that's what your customers want.\" Nearly eighteen months after her most recent post, Lilly is in a different headspace. Her business - the workout videos and a nutrition app - are thriving and she feels ready to return to her personal Instagram account - but with a very different set of rules this time around. \"I'm not going to be showing my personal relationships, I've been too scarred, and I can't do it again,\" she said.

    "title": "US Supreme Court halts deportation of detained Venezuelans",
    "article_text": "The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of a group ofalleged Venezuelan gang members. A civil liberties group had sued to stop the removal of the men, currently in detention in Texas, saying they had not been able to contest their cases in court. Donald Trump has sent accused Venezuelan gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which gives the president power to detain and deport natives or citizens of \"enemy\" nations without usual processes. The act was previously used only three times, all during war. The White House called challenges to using the law for mass deportations \"meritless litigation\". \"We are confident in the lawfulness of the administration's actions and in ultimately prevailing against an onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. The Alien Enemies Act was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent were imprisoned without trial and thousands sent to internment camps. Since taking office in January, Trump's hard-line immigration policies have encountered a number of legal hurdles. Trump had accused Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" on US territory. Out of 261 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador as of 8 April, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, a senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner. A lower court temporarily blocked these deportations on 15 March. The Supreme Court initially ruled on 8 April that Trump could use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, but deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. The lawsuit that resulted in Saturday's order said the Venezuelans detained in north Texas had been given notices about their imminent deportation in English, despite one detainee only speaking Spanish. The challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also said the men had not been told they had a right to contest the decision in court. \"Without this Court's intervention, dozens or hundreds of proposed class members may be removed to a possible life sentence in El Salvador with no real opportunity to contest their designation or removal,\" the lawsuit read. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented on Saturday. In his second inaugural address in January, Trump pledged to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\". In the highest-profile case, the government admitted it mistakenly deported El Salvador national Kilmar Ábrego García, but contends he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer and family denies. Mr Ábrego García has never been convicted of a crime. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled thatthe government should facilitate bringing back Mr Ábrego García, but the Trump administration has said he will \"never\" live in the US again. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland,visited Mr Ábrego García in El Salvadorand said he had been moved from the mega-jail Cecot (Terrorism Confinement Centre) to a new prison. Demonstrations, taking place on the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War, addressed a range of grievances. The tycoon and Donald Trump advisor has moved his businesses from California to a mostly rural central Texas county. What do the neighbours think? \"Olo\" is said to be a saturated blue-green - but some say the existence of a new colour is \"open to argument\". Iranian and US officials agree to continue with a third round of high-stakes talks on a new nuclear deal. The wartime Alien Enemies Act has been controversially used to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.",

    "title": "The forgotten Indian explorer who uncovered an ancient civilisation",
    "article_text": "An Indian archaeologist, whose career was marked by brilliance and controversy, made one of the world's greatest historical discoveries. Yet he remains largely forgotten today. In the early 1900s, Rakhaldas Banerjee (also spelled Banerji) unearthed Mohenjo-daro - meaning \"mound of the dead men\" in the Sindhi language - in present-day Pakistan. It was the largest city of the thriving Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation, which stretched from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age. Banerjee, an intrepid explorer and talented epigraphist, worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the country was under British colonial rule. He spent months travelling to distant corners of the subcontinent, looking for ancient artefacts, ruins and scripts. But while his discovery of Mohenjo-daro was ground-breaking, Banerjee's legacy is clouded by disputes. His independent streak and defiance of colonial protocols often landed him in trouble - tainting his reputation and perhaps even erasing parts of his contribution from global memory. Interestingly, Banerjee's reports on Mohenjo-daro were never published by the ASI. Archaeologist PK Mishra later accused then ASI chief John Marshall of suppressing Banerjee's findings and claiming credit for the discovery himself. \"The world knows Marshall discovered the civilisation's ruins and it is taught in institutions. Banerjee is an insignificant footnote,\" Prof Mishratoldthe Times of India newspaper. In her book,Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization Was Discovered,  historian Nayanjot Lahiri writes that Banerjee \"lacked diplomacy and tact and displayed a high-handedness that ruffled feathers\". Her book also sheds light on the controversies he was embroiled in during his time at the ASI. She notes how once, he attempted to procure inscriptions and images from a museum in north-east India without the approval or knowledge of his boss. Another time, Banerjee attempted to relocate some stone sculptures from a museum in Bengal to the one he was stationed at without the necessary permissions. In another instance, he purchased an antique painting for a sum without consulting his superiors who thought he'd paid more than was necessary. \"Banerjee's many talents seemed to include being always able to rub people the wrong way,\" Lahiri writes. But Banerjee remains a prominent figure among world historians and scholars in Bengal because of his connection with Mohenjo-daro. He was born in 1885 to a wealthy family in Bengal. The medieval monuments that dotted Baharampur, the city he grew up in, kindled his interest in history and he pursued the subject in college. But he always had an adventurous streak. Once, when he was tasked with writing an essay about the Scythian period of Indian history, he travelled to a museum in a neighbouring state to study first-hand sculptures and scripts from that era. In her book,The Life and Works of Rakhaldas Banerji, author Yama Pande notes how Banerjee joined the ASI as an excavation assistant in 1910 and rose quickly within the ranks to become a superintending archaeologist in western India in 1917. It was in this post that he first set eyes on Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in 1919. In the following years, he conducted a series of excavations at the site that revealed some of the most fascinating finds: ancient Buddhist stupas, coins, seals, pots and microliths. Between 1922 and 1923, he discovered several layers of ruins that held clues about various urban settlements that had emerged in the region, but most importantly, the oldest one that had existed some 5,300 years ago - the Indus Valley Civilisation. At that time, historians had not yet discovered the full scale of the Indus Civilisation which, we now know, covered an expanse of approximately 386,000 sq miles (999,735 sq km) along the Indus river valley. Three seals from Banerjee's excavation bore images and scripts similar to those from Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan. This helped establish a link between the two sites, shedding light on the vast reach of the Indus Valley civilisation. But by 1924, Banerjee's funds for the project had dried up and he was also transferred to eastern India. He had no further contact with the site, nor did he participate in any excavations there, Pande writes in her book. But Nayanjot Lahiri notes that Banerjee was transferred at his own request, after becoming entangled in questions over his spending. He had failed to account for several job-related expenses. It was also revealed that Banerjee had used excavation grants to buy office furniture and his travel expenses were deemed excessive. His explanations failed to convince his superiors and disciplinary action was recommended. After some negotiation, Banerjee was granted his request and transferred to another region. Banerjee continued to work with the ASI in eastern India. He spent most of his time in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and oversaw the restoration work of many important monuments. He resigned from the ASI in 1927, but his departure was marred by controversy. In the years prior to his departure, he became the prime suspect in a case of idol theft. It all started in October 1925, when Banerjee had visited a revered Hindu shrine in Madhya Pradesh state that housed a stone idol of a Buddhist goddess. Banerjee was accompanied by two low-ranking assistants and two labourers, Lahiri notes in her book. However, following their visit, the idol went missing, and Banerjee was implicated in its theft. He denied any involvement in the disappearance and an investigation was launched. The idol was later recovered in Calcutta. Though the case against Banerjee was dismissed and the charges were found to be unsubstantiated, Marshall insisted on his resignation. After leaving the ASI, Banerjee worked as a professor, but faced financial difficulties because of his lavish lifestyle. Historian Tapati Guha-Thakurtatoldthe Telegraph newspaper that Banerjee splurged on good food, horse carriages and friends. In 1928, he joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor. He died just two years later at the age of 45. Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook.

    "title": "'Fuming' Watkins channelled 'anger' into 'dynamite' display",
    "article_text": "Watkins' goal means he is the first Villa player to score 15 or more times in three consecutive Premier League seasons Ollie Watkins has a message for his Aston Villa manager Unai Emery - he wants to be starting the biggest games. The striker said he'd been \"fuming\" to only be a substitute for both of Villa's Champions League quarter-final ties against Paris St-Germain. But against Newcastle on Saturday he channelled his anger perfectly as he scored inside the opening minute and set up another to propel his side to a brilliant 4-1 win. His goal meant he became Villa's joint-top Premier League goalscorer - alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor - on 74. But, despite his record-equalling feats, Watkins has started just two of the club's past six games, a fact he is not best pleased with. Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford started Tuesday's Champions League second-leg tie, with Watkins coming on in the second half as Villa were knocked out. \"I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games. I am not going to lie, I was fuming that I wasn't playing - I let him [Unai Emery] know that,\" Watkins told Sky Sports. \"He's the manager, you have to respect his decision, [but] I am not one of these players happy to sit on the bench. \"It is something I have not experienced before, to miss out on the biggest stage. I wanted to be out on the pitch for much longer. I have played a big part to get to where we are today and I want to play in those games.\" When asked about Watkins' comments Emery replied: \"It's fantastic to be angry and fantastic for him to play like he did [against Newcastle].\" Villa hit four past Newcastle in stunning win Man Utd eye Rashford-Watkins swap - Sunday's gossip This video can not be played How Villa 'passed the Geordies on the left hand side' Watkins believes Emery will now have \"a headache\" over his next starting XI. \"I'm banging on the door asking why I'm not playing,\" he added, while also pointing out Villa's strength in depth. \"Since I have been at Villa, a lot of fans would say it is the best squad we have had. \"The signings we made in January, players like Rashford and [Marco] Asensio coming in, the quality means players like myself have to drop to the bench and there's going to be lots of rotation.\" With Emery preferring Rashford in the starting XI in four of Villa's past six games, speculation that Watkins may move away from Villa has risen this week. Villa rejected a Â£40m bid for Watkins from Arsenal in January. Earlier this season Watkins himself was keeping Jhon Duran out of the team, and the Colombian left Villa in the winter transfer window for Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr in a deal that could be worth up to Â£71m. Villa are yet to make any indication as to whether they will try to sign Rashford on a permanent deal in the summer. The 27-year-old's loan deal runs until the end of the season and includes an option to buy for Â£40m. Villa's next match is away to Manchester City on Tuesday, before Emery's side take on Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. The 29-year-old needed just 33 seconds to open the scoring against Newcastle, receiving the ball in the box and finding the net with a fierce shot which deflected off defender Fabian Schar. Watkins was the best player on the pitch and twice hit the woodwork in the first period. At 1-0 he clattered an effort against the underside of the crossbar, and at 1-1 had a thumping header hit the post. The England international set up Villa's second with a driving dart forward before slipping in Ian Maatsen with a perfectly weighted pass. And he otherwise impressed with tireless runs, fine hold-up play and continual pressing. Watkins was substituted in the 82nd minute, by which point Villa were already 4-1 up and Villa Park was chanting his name. Ex-Aston Villa defender Dion Dublin, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I am delighted, why wouldn't be fuming? You can imagine his frustration. Be honest and tell people what you think.\" Former Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp said Watkins' performance was \"dynamite\" and believes the striker \"has turned a massive negative into a positive\". \"He has played with anger. I have been here, you are fuming and want to knock the manager's door down. He channelled that in the right way,\" Redknapp added. Watkins' goal means he is the first Villa player to score 15 or more times in three consecutive Premier League seasons. Since the start of last season he has both scored and assisted in eight Premier League games, with only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah doing so on more occasions.

    "article_text": "Lando Norris is hoping to go one better this season, having finished second to Max Verstappen in 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Venue:JeddahDate:20 AprilRace start:18:00 BST Coverage:Live radio commentary online and BBC 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app Lando Norris says he has a \"big job\" on his hands to try to recover in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix from his crash in qualifying. The Briton, who leads McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri by three points in the drivers' championship heading into the race, starts 10th after his accident. Red Bull's Max Verstappen is on pole position, ahead of Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell. Norris said: \"I don't think it's going to be an easy one because I don't think it's very easy to overtake around here. \"We have a strong car but clearly not as good as we would like because Max is on pole and George is only 0.1secs behind, so it's not like things are plain sailing at the minute. \"[I've got] a big job to try and do.\" Verstappen claims Saudi GP pole after Norris crash How to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBC Norris being forced to drive in 'uncomfortable ways' McLaren showed extremely strong race pace during the practice sessions in Jeddah but Norris said he was \"going to need a bit of luck\" in the grand prix. He said that to \"get close\" to Verstappen, Piastri and Russell was \"not very realistic\". \"It's almost impossible to overtake around here, so I'm not expecting anything magical,\" Norris said. \"But we have a good car, so if we can work our way up to the top five, six, I will say I'll be happy.\" Norris lost control on the exit of Turn Four, his car sliding on to the kerb at Turn Five and flicking into the wall on the exit. He swore and called himself an \"idiot\" over the radio to his team in the immediate aftermath of the accident. \"Makes sense,\" he later said of his frustration in the car. \"I agree with it. I should be fighting for pole and, especially on a Q1 lap, not taking any silly risks like I seem to have done. \"We will review it but it's not a guarantee we would have been on pole, because Red Bull were quick the whole qualifying. \"It would have been nice to be in that fight. I was doing well until then and feeling comfortable. I shunted, so I am not going to be proud, I'm not going to be happy, I've let myself and the team down and the guys have a big job to do to fix it.\" McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the crash was a reflection of Norris' struggles with the behaviour of this year's car. \"In Q3, when Lando tries to squeeze a few more milliseconds out of the car, the car doesn't respond as he expects,\" Stella said. \"This is a behaviour that kind of surprises him. Today it surprised him. The car understeered a bit in corner four, ended up on the outside kerb, and this outside kerb can be quite unforgiving. \"It's an episode that I think starts from some of the work that we have done on the car. It made the car faster overall, but I think it took something away from Lando in terms of predictability of the car once he pushes the car at the limit. \"So it's the responsibility of the team to try to improve the car and to try and correct this behaviour. Because we want Lando to be confident, comfortable, that he can push the car.\" Verstappen, eight points behind Norris in the championship, said he was surprised to have been in the fight for pole after a difficult time through the practice sessions, adding that until taking pole he had been \"not very confident\" for the race. \"My long runs weren't particularly great compared to Oscar or Lando,\" he said. \"Naturally, with how the car was reacting today, it will be a bit better. But I don't think it'll be enough to be super competitive. \"But the car definitely took a bit of a step forward compared to what we were testing yesterday. So I hope that will help our tyre life out as well, but difficult to say that gives an opportunity to fight.\" This video can not be played Five things to know before the Saudi Arabia Grand Prix Verstappen's pole was his second of the season. After his first, in Japan two weeks ago, he held off Norris and Piastri for the entire grand prix to win. Piastri, though, said the three zones in which the drivers can use the Drag Reduction System overtaking aid might make it easier for him to have a try at passing Verstappen than in Japan. The Australian said: \"I'm feeling confident in what we've got. There are a lot of DRS zones around here, which is a nice difference to Suzuka. So, yes, let's see if we can make some progress. Russell said he and Verstappen had agreed that McLaren were still the team to beat. \"Max and I were just talking now,\" Russell said. \"We both recognise McLaren are the standout favourites and definitely have the pace on everybody else. \"If Oscar gets into the lead, you'll probably see arepeat of Bahrain.If we stay in the order we qualified, I think it could be a tight race until the pit stops.\" Russell added that the decision to bring a softer range of tyres for Saudi Arabia this year could also impact the race. \"The medium tyre this year was last year's soft, which only one driver used in the whole race. \"We saw the tyres were too hard in Japan. We've all pushed to have softer tyres. Hopefully, it won't make it a slam-dunk one-stop, and there could be a couple of different strategies on the table.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

The victory extends the Red Roses' winning run to 24 games before a home Rugby World Cup that starts in August. Prop Kelsey Clifford grabbed the first of six first-half tries, with John Mitchell's side in complete control right from the opening whistle. Flanker Marlie Packer was next to cross, followed by captain Zoe Aldcroft, wing Claudia MacDonald and lock Abbie Ward. Lark Atkin-Davies's try ensured a 42-0 lead at half-time, a vastly improved margin from last Saturday's win in Ireland, when England led 7-5 at the break. Player of the match MacDonald raced clear down the wing for her second try early in the second half, before Lisa Thomson finally got Scotland on the board with a try from a rolling maul. Wing Abby Dow capped off the scoring, in front of a crowd of 15,530, with a brilliant solo try, before a simple finish in the corner. The Red Roses are chasing a fourth successive Grand Slam and a seventh Six Nations title in a row. Scotland, who finished fourth in last year's championship, will host Ireland next Saturday, with hopes of adding to their sole victory over Wales this campaign.

Without a win over the Red Roses since 1999 an upset seemed unlikely, especially with Bryan Easson's side coming into the fixture off the back of a disappointing25-17 home defeat by Italy. Clifford, who grabbed her first international try last week, was on hand to power over from close range in a dominant opening period for the hosts. Mitchell made nine changes from the side that won in Cork, one of which was former England captain Packer, who had not featured since the opening-roundwin over Italy in York. She was given a chance to respond to impressive performances from Sadia Kabeya in the seven jersey and did just that, scoring the second try of the match - her 50th for the Red Roses - following a powerful carry from number eight Maddie Feaunati. Aldcroft replaced Packer as England skipper in January and is the only player to start every game this campaign. The blind-side flanker showed no sign of fatigue as she intercepted Helen Nelson's pass and galloped clear for her side's third try. MacDonald was another player who had not featured since the opening round and after a bright start, the elusive wing cut through the Scotland defence for a deserved try. Heading into the fixture, England's average winning margin over Scotland was 46 points in the Six Nations, which looked likely to increase when tries by Ward and Atkin-Davies ended an utterly dominant half of rugby. This video can not be played Dow extends England's lead against Scotland MacDonald, who featured in the World Cup final in 2022, missed last year's Women's Six Nations after suffering a second neck injury in February 2024. Saracens' Jess Breach nailed down the left wing spot in her absence, but MacDonald went up another gear from her return in York, with her high work-rate and footwork causing Scotland problems throughout the game, and was rewarded with a second try. Dow then paid a reminder to the class on the opposite wing, as she showed terrific strength and balance to run half the pitch and finish off the try of the game. Scotland's second-half performance will please Easson after his side managed a first try against England since 2023 and held the hosts to only three scores - two of which came in the closing stages. Flanker Evie Gallagher, who came into the game with the most turnovers (five) in the competition, was at the heart of slowing down England's breakdown, producing the kind of display that made the 24-year-old a contender for player of the match. Three debutants also appeared off the bench as Easson continued to look at new talent before the World Cup. France'svictory in Italy earlier on Saturday,despite being behind at half-time, meant the slim chance of England winning the title in Leicester evaporated prior to kick-off. However, even with the game likely to be their toughest assignment this championship, the Red Roses have not lost to Les Bleus since 2018 and will go in as heavy favourites.

    "title": "Guardiola 'grateful' to O'Reilly after 'massively important' win",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played How Man City's academy player Nico O' Reilly took control - Keown For Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City side, the celebrations at full-time at Goodison Park on Saturday pointed to a monumental result in the context of their substandard campaign. City have set the benchmark in English football, as the first side to win four top-flight titles in a row, but they will relinquish their hold on the trophy this season. They also fell in the Champions League play-offs - and for 84 minutes on Merseyside, it seemed like they were facing a real battle to compete in Europe's elite club competition next term. But two late goals from the emerging star Nico O'Reilly and experienced midfielder Mateo Kovacic gave City a hard-foughtvictory at Everton. Asked how big the result was, Guardiola told BBC Sport: \"I would say big. We have five, six games left and with the moment they had after [winning against] Nottingham Forest away, [and given that] Liverpool and Arsenal could not win here, it is massively important. \"I've tried to convince the players that qualifying for the Champions League is a huge achievement in this country and in this league. \"Being in the Champions League is enough, thinking that is not enough for us would be arrogant.\" Man City strike twice late on to beat Everton City were facing the prospect of being out of the Premier League top five come the end of the weekend, but picked up a pivotal result to strengthen their hopes of Champions League football in 2025-26. The performance of English teams in Europe means the Premier League has received an extra fifth spot in the continent's premier club competition for next season, which leaves City in a healthy position. But they needed a late show on Merseyside for all three points and the reaction at the end highlighted how important a victory it was. City players and staff made their way over to the corner of the stadium where their joyous supporters were housed, taking their acclaim and being serenaded with chants for Guardiola and the departing Kevin de Bruyne. Victory in their next game against Aston Villa, who are also chasing a top-five place, will go a long way to sealing a coveted Champions League spot. \"If you win you have character, if you don't win you don't have character - this is the motto,\" said Guardiola. \"What these players have done for one decade, I am so grateful for, whatever has happened - this season more than ever, in the toughest period for many reasons especially injuries. \"We were more or less stable, kept going and going for the next time. We are miles away from Liverpool and Arsenal but tonight we sleep fourth. \"It is in our hands but we have a final on Tuesday, three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"That is a massive win for Manchester City. Champions League football for a club of their stature is an absolute minimum.\" Injuries have had a substantial impact on City this season - and the absences of Nathan Ake, Manual Akanji and John Stones have provided a chance to Manchester-born O'Reilly. He has been deployed as an inverted left-back, often drifting into midfield, and his runs forward have contributed to City's attacking threat. At 20 years and 29 days, O'Reilly became the fourth-youngest player to score in back-to-back Premier League appearances for City after Kelechi Iheanacho, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden. \"My defending and positioning while defending is definitely improving,\" O'Reilly told Sky Sports. \"Every day I am just learning and I am grateful for that.\" The left-footer has had an instant impact since being drafted into the team, having had a hand in six goals across his past six appearances for City in all competitions. \"He's not really a left-back,\" Guardiola told BBC Match of the Day. \"I would say all of our left-backs score, Josko Gvardiol before and now Nico. He is an attacking midfielder. \"We have passes, passes and passes and then we can arrive brilliantly into that position. He has arrived from the academy and is helping us a lot. I am more than grateful. He is taking his opportunity.\" Team-mate Ilkay Gundogan described O'Reilly as being \"very humble and shy\" and someone who \"doesn't talk much\". The German midfielder added: \"In terms of talent and quality, not just his size but playing in a position that isn't natural for him at left-back, he's been doing amazing in recent weeks. \"He has the technical ability and timing to arrive in the box and score crucial goals. I am very glad for him.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Home-made Hawk-Eye? Sabalenka takes pic of ball mark to dispute call",
    "article_text": "Aryna Sabalenka has never won the Stuttgart Open title, finishing runner-up three times Aryna Sabalenka took a photograph on court of a disputed ball mark during her quarter-final victory over Elise Mertens at the Stuttgart Open. World number one Sabalenka disagreed with an \"out\" call on her shot when she was break point down against Mertens. At the changeover, with Sabalenka trailing 4-3, the Belarusian asked umpire Miriam Bley to check the mark, before walking over to see it herself. She thentook a photograph,externalof the mark with a member of her team's phone before receiving a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct from Bley. Sabalenka did not let the incident distract her, regrouping to break back immediately and going on to win 6-4 6-1. She shook hands with Bley at the end of the match but said in her on-court interview: \"When I gave her a handshake, there was a very interesting look and a very strong handshake. Never had it before.\" Asked if she squeezed the hand back, Sabalenka said: \"No, it's OK. Why would I play this game with someone like her? It's OK.\" Sabalenka will face Jasmine Paolini for a place in Monday's final after the Italian beat Coco Gauff 6-4 6-3. Earlier, Jelena Ostapenko continued her dominance over Iga Swiatek, beating the world number two 6-3 3-6 6-2 to extend her unbeaten winning streak against the Pole to six matches. Alcaraz sets up Barcelona Open final against Rune Zverev heckled again over domestic abuse allegations Tsurenko to take legal action over WTA 'abuse' Ostapenko is the first player to beat five-time major champion Swiatek on every surface - once on grass, four times on hard courts and now once on clay. Swiatek often struggles against Ostapenko's powerful groundstrokes which rush her forehand and draw out the errors in her game. The Pole came into the match with an 11-1 record in Stuttgart, having won the title in 2022 and 2023, but she could not fend off Ostapenko. Ostapenko hit 29 winners to Swiatek's 17, with eight double faults not helping Swiatek as Ostapenko attacked her second serve. Ostapenko broke Swiatek's serve three times to take the first set but was scrappier in the second, allowing Swiatek to level the match. But Ostapenko won 12 of the first 15 point of the deciding set to take control, eventually taking the match on a long Swiatek forehand. \"She's a great clay-court player but I won the French [Open] as well, so I can say the same thing about myself, \" the 27-year-old said. \"I have so much respect to her and her team but every time I step on the court with her, it's a battle and I'm ready for it.\" Ostapenko will face a semi-final against Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova, who beat third seed Jessica Pegula 6-0 6-4. Jelena Ostapenko won the French Open in 2017 aged 20",

    "title": "Iraola guides Bournemouth to another record - can they keep him?",
    "article_text": "Andoni Iraola cut a frustrated figure after Bournemouth's draw against 10-man Crystal Palace Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola gave a coy response when asked about his future after Saturday's frustrating goalless draw at Crystal Palace, but Cherries supporters will be desperate for the Spaniard to extend his stay at Vitality Stadium. The draw at Selhurst Park lifted Iraola's team to 49 points - a club record in the Premier League - with five games remaining, surpassing their tally of 48 in Iraola's first season. Bournemouth were disappointed not to claim all three points in south London after failing to capitalise on Palace defender Chris Richards' first-half dismissal, but Iraola - whose existing deal is set to expire next summer - could yet guide the Cherries into Europe for the first time in their history. Owner Bill Foley is due to attend next weekend's game at home to Manchester United before talks with the 42-year-old former Rayo Vallecano manager. Tottenham are reported to be interested in securing Iraola's services after a disappointing campaign under Ange Postecoglou, while reports have also linked him to Real Madridas a potential replacement,externalfor Carlo Ancelotti. However, sources at Bournemouth suggest Iraola isopen to extending his timeon the south coast. \"We'll talk, but nothing special,\" Iraola, who was appointed in June 2023, told BBC Match of the Day after Saturday's stalemate. The Spaniard was also quick to deny reports that talks have already started about a contract extension. He went on to describe the result as a \"missed opportunity\" for his side, but former Brighton striker Glenn Murray says the Cherries are heading firmly in the right direction. \"Of course they want Europe, but this is the best season Bournemouth have had,\" Murray told Final Score. \"Things are progressing in the right way for them.\" Richards sent off as Crystal Palace hold Bournemouth In December 2023 - a year after taking control of the club - Foley said he was confident Bournemouth would qualify for Europe within the next five years. After following an impressive 2023-24 campaign with another outstanding season including wins over Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle, Iraola could be about to lead the Cherries into continental competition far quicker than Foley or anyone else had anticipated. They could end the weekend eight points outside the top seven, buteighth place may still be enoughto secure European football in 2024-25. For a club who were playing in League One as recently as 2013, it is a tantalising prospect. Indeed, Iraola's downcast demeanour following Saturday's draw only serves to highlight how far Bournemouth have come. \"We cannot be happy with this point,\" he said. \"Before the game, [we thought a draw] is not a bad result, coming to a stadium this difficult. \"But considering how the game has gone, we cannot be happy. I feel we have not used the extra player in the proper way.\" Bournemouth were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men themselves after referee Sam Barratt opted against showing midfielder Alex Scott a second yellow card 10 minutes before Richards' dismissal. It may be nothing more than a silver lining for Iraola and his players, but the point does at least extend Bournemouth's unbeaten league run to three games - their longest streak since going 11 games without defeat between November 2024 and January 2025. \"Iraola has been able to grow and develop his squad,\" former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson told Final Score. \"They have been able to establish themselves in the Premier League. \"He is very tactically astute and uses his bench well, which is a credit to his in-game management and squad depth.\" Next up for Bournemouth is a home match against Manchester United, a team theybeat 3-0 at Old Traffordthis season. By the end of next weekend, Bournemouth may not only be closing in on European qualification, they may have moved a step closer to ensuring Iraola remains at the helm.

    "title": "‘I love my country but nobody is safe’: the plight of Cameroon’s exiles, trapped in Nigeria",
    "article_text": "Amid the sound of children excitedly practising a drama for a forthcoming performance, a yam seller calls to passers by with discounts for their wares. Outside a closed graphic design shop overlooking them from a small hill, Solange Ndonga Tibesa tells the story of being uprooted from her homeland in north-westCameroon. In June 2019 she and other travellers were abducted with her three-month-old baby by secessionists, who accused them of supporting the military. Their captors repeatedly hit them with butts of their guns, keeping them in a forest without food or water. “We stayed in a forest there for two days. My baby cried [so much]... and we just became used to the mosquitoes,” said the 30-year-old. “One of the boys was asking me to take off my clothes but I begged: ‘It’s better if you just kill me than rape me,’ before the other boys intervened.” In October, Cameroon goes to the polls, with 92-year-old Paul Biya, its president since 1982, running for an eighth term. An estimated 6.9 million people are registered to vote, but Tibesa, who fled into Cross River state in neighbouringNigeriaafter her release, is one of thousands who cannot vote even if they wanted to. The vast majority of Nigeria’s eastern flank is with Cameroon. The entire corridor is swallowed by two overlapping axes of migration due to conflict: in the upper half are mostly Nigerians fleeing jihadists such asBoko Haramand theIslamic West Africa Province; in the bottom half are Cameroonians fleeing a civil war in the English-speaking minority areas since 2017. About 107,000 refugees have come into Nigeria from Cameroon alone, according to figures from the UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency. Approximately half of that number live in and around Adagom, Cross River state, where 63 hectares (156 acres) of land donated by the Nigerian government hosts open settlements. The UNHCR pays households in these communities a monthly stipend and teaches skills acquisitions. Many refugees have integrated with their Nigerian neighbours, some marrying each other, and passionately arguing about winning or losing bets on football matches. That similar dialects of pidgin English and Ejagham are spoken on both sides of the border has also helped. That has enabled many such as Tibesa to put trauma behind them to plough on. She is now working on being an all-rounder: she coaches a netball team, volunteers as a social worker and has taken classes in biofuel production and plastics recycling. Next to her, Tessy Ekpang, 29, who says soldiers killed two of her uncles, cannot wait to head to Kenya this month to begin studying pharmacy, courtesy of a fully funded scholarship. A five-minute drive away, an agricultural engineer named Edmund is fabricating solar power systems next to his fish pond with 3,000 fingerlings on a land sold to him by the Adagom community. The land that is now Cameroon was carved apart and patched together by European powers in the 19th and 20th century with little regard for its citizens or sense of national identity. A century ago, the entire country was the German colony of Kamerun. After the first world war, it was split between the British, which also administered neighbouring Nigeria, and the French. In a 1961 UN plebiscite, southern Cameroons voted to rejoin Cameroon, while northern Cameroons joined Nigeria. Now a predominantly Francophone nation, it has two anglophone regions in the west. For decades, anglophones complained of being treated as “second-class citizens”. When the military tried to quellpeaceful protestsabout appointments of French-speaking judges and teachers in the English-speaking minority areas in 2016, armed groups known as “Amba Boys” clashed with them and declared the breakaway republic ofAmbazonia. The impact on the civilian population has been massive: among other things, schools were closed as bridges were cut in two, disconnecting villages. More than 4,000 civilians have been killed and at least 712,000 displaced within and outside the country. “No single person is in my village again,” said Ekpang. Aid workers say half of the combined 4 million people in both regions are in need of humanitarian support, which could now be hampered bythe reshaping of foreign aid. In 2024, the US funded approximately half of UNHCR’s budget in Nigeria. “We are deeply concerned by the growing gap between needs and resources, and the massive impact [funding cuts] will have on millions of people displaced by war and persecution,” said Alpha Seydi Ba, a Dakar-based UNHCR representative. Many say the conflict lingers because the government is unwilling to decentralise power or engage with the separatists, which it has described as terrorists. Many young men suspected of being separatists have been detained in prisons, according to Human Rights Watch. A national dialogue organised in 2019 by Biya’s government failed as key separatist movements were not included. Canada and Switzerland have also separately tried to mediate in the crisis but with little success. October’s election could, therefore, be crucial for any peace efforts. If Biya wins, as is widely expected, many expect business as usual. If his health keeps him from the ballot, it is rumoured that he and the party will appoint his 53-year-old son, Franck Biya, to run in his stead. Analysts say there must be a push for dialogue again regardless of the election’s outcome. “Cameroon’s international partners should press for inclusive dialogue to resume… [and] highlight the need to strengthen governance and expedite decentralisation so the anglophone regions benefit from the autonomy their ‘special status’ should have granted them,” said Hubert Kinkoh, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies in Addis Ababa. For the refugees in Adagom, the clock is ticking and the losses rising. Tibesa would love to be able to return to Cameroon. “But when I see pictures of people that have been killed, I just burst out into tears because I really love my country,” she said. “But nobody is safe. If you run to the army, the Amba Boys will pursue you. If you run to the Amba Boys, the army will pursue you.”",

    "title": "China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon for first time",
    "article_text": "Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21km course. The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 1.2m, others as tall as 1.8m. One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile. Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to motor racing, given the need for engineering and navigation teams. “The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence. The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race. A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one wearing boxing gloves and another had a red headband with the words “Bound to Win” in Chinese. The winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, with a time of 2hr 40min. The men’s winner of the race had a time of 1hr 2min. The centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest. Tang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon. “I don’t want to boast but no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements,” Tang said, adding that the robot’s batteries were switched three times during the race. Some robots struggled from the beginning. One fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. Another crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over. Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons inChinaover the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans. China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.",

    "title": "‘Bordering on incredible’: Coalition under fire for planning to scrap Labor climate policies and offering none of its own",
    "article_text": "TheCoalitionis refusing to say if it will introduce any policies to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade as it pledges to unwind most climate measures introduced under Labor. Peter Dutton’s position on the climate crisis came under scrutiny last week after he gave contradictory answers on whether he accepted mainstream climate science. Asked during a leaders’ debate on the ABC whether extreme weather events were worsening, the opposition leader said:“I don’t know because I’m not a scientist”. Dutton later said he“believes in climate change”and the Coalition was committed to Australia having net zero emissions by 2050. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter But climate experts said its policies would boost local fossil fuel use, send the country backwards on emissions, put the net zero goal beyond reach and damage its reputation internationally. Bill Hare, a scientist and the Australia-based chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the Coalition’s positions were “almost totally regressive in the sense that they would unwind action in Australia”. He said if people accepted Dutton’s claim the Coalitionwanted to abolish a national legislated 2030 emissions target– a 43% cut below 2005 levels – but still supported getting to net zero emissions without introducing new policies “you are being taken for a mug”. “It is too late to be listening to empty promises like that,” Hare said. The Grattan Institute’s energy and climate change program director, Tony Wood, said “every single one” of the Coalition’s policies in the area was “a reduction in ambition or slowing down emissions reductions”. “None of it is adding to emissions reductions,” he said. “It would be bordering on incredible to think that we could maintain a commitment to net zero by 2050 with no plans to head us in the direction for the next 10 to 15 years.” Guardian Australia asked the Coalition if it had any policies that would reduce emissions over the next decade. The shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O’Brien, replied it had a “track record of reducing emissions” and would continue to “advocate for solutions that deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all Australians”. He did not specify a Coalition policy that would cut emissions in the next 10 years. The Coalition’s policies include: Dropping a Labor goal of 82% of electricity coming from renewable generation by 2030 and slowing the rollout of solar and windfarms, in part by scrapping a “rewiring the nation” fund to build new transmission connections. Instead, it says the country would rely on more fossil fuels – coal and gas-fired power – until it could lift a ban on nuclear energy andbuild taxpayer-owned nuclear generators, mostly after 2040. Abolishing fines for car companies that do not meet targets to cut the average emissions from the new cars they sell. Not supporting Labor’s 2030 emissions reduction target. Former diplomats say lowering the target would put Australiain breach of commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Opposinga joint Australia-Pacific bidto host a major UN climate summitin Adelaide next year. The Coalition has also said it would reviewthe safeguard mechanism– a policy introduced under Tony Abbott, and revamped under Labor to require major industrial polluters to either make direct cuts or buy carbon offsets – topossibly make it less onerous on business. Industry groups have largely supported Labor’s changes. Lesley Hughes, a professor emerita at Macquarie University and member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Climate Council, said the last Coalition government “went backwards” on addressing the climate crisis and “there’s nothing to suggest we won’t go backwards under the next Coalition government”. Hare has assessed the likely difference between Labor and the Coalition based on their current policies. He said government projections indicated Labor was headed for a 42.6% cut by 2030 – nearly on track to meet the 43% target – but the Coalition’s released policies would limit the cut to 36%. He pointed to modelling by Frontier Economics released in support of the Coalition’s nuclear plan that assumed Australia wouldget only 54% of its electricity from renewable energy, rather than 82%. “That would slow down emissions reduction dramatically … and would require more gas for the next 15 to 20 years,” Hare said. The Climate Change Authority has estimated it couldincrease national emissions by 2bn tonnes, adding the equivalent of more than four years of total Australian climate pollution. Hare and Wood both said the Coalition’s plan to scrap fines for car companies that did not meet the vehicle efficiency standard would make the policy pointless. “It’s like having a speed limit without a penalty,” Wood said. All experts who spoke with Guardian Australia bemoaned a lack of focus on climate change policy from the major parties given the challenge of reaching net zero and the rising impact of increased temperatures and extreme weather. Labor’s sole new climate policy released in the election has been a30% subsidy for households and small businesses that install batteries. Neither party has announced 2035 emissions targets or released a plan to reach net zero emissions, though Laborbegan work on a planin the last term and has promised a 2035 goal by September if re-elected. Wood said: “It is monumentally disappointing that these issues are not really being discussed by either party.” Hughes said the Great Barrier Reef hadjust suffered its sixth mass bleaching event in nine years, but the major parties seemed to be “quite strenuously avoiding talking about climate impacts.” Hare said the “lack of engagement on climate across the board has been quite depressing”. An initial assessment by the Climate Change Authority founda 2035 emissions reduction target of between 65% and 75%“would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken”. Organisations representingengineers, scientistsand thesocial service sectorhave called for a target of net zero emissions by 2035, in line with a goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C.",

    "title": "As Dutton faces a last-minute policy inquisition, Albanese seems to be on top – and he knows it",
    "article_text": "Two weeks until the 3 May election day andAnthony Albaneseis cracking jokes about Star Wars. Every profile and sketch of the prime minister during this campaign – which is now past its halfway – speaks of the confidence and even swagger Albanese projects as he travels the country. It is one of the starkest differences to his 2022 campaign, which was dominated by missteps:forgetting key economic figures, then his untimely Covid diagnosis and images of beingchased out of a press conference by journalists. This time, he’s on top and he knows it. This week’s Guardian Essential poll puts himin an election-winning position. Peter Dutton is running out of time to stage a comeback. Still, there is a quiet carefulness to Albanese’s campaigning – he knows first-hand how quickly a campaign can come off the tracks, and how a written-off underdog can win from behind. I’m fresh back from a week on Albanese’s campaign bus. Earlier, I tailed the Liberal leader on his first week in the campaign pressure cooker. From up close and afar, the two campaigns are different beasts. Albanese bounds into the public eye, often accompanied by a number of his higher-profile ministers; Dutton is on constant high alert, still adjusting to the barrage of questioning he faces each day. While the prime minister cracks jokes or waxes lyrical over his footy team, his rival seems to end most press conferences with a negative story, a backtrack or leaving more questions than answers. One of Albanese’s few missteps – literally and figuratively – was to claim he didn’t fall off a stage in week one. It was a weird moment, given the media pack was there to see (and film) it, even if the instinctual reaction was to downplay misfortune. The Coalition campaign machine pounced on it, desperate for any crack in the Labor facade; the “Albo lied about falling off the stage” attack hasn’t really taken hold anywhere beyondLiberal partymemes, but that hasn’t stopped them. This week’s debate saw another, more consequential flub, when Albanese claimed Labor had never commissioned modelling on negative gearing changes. It was the opening for Dutton’s best punch of the night, Albanese looking uncomfortable as Dutton claimed his opponent “has a problem with the truth”. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had earlier said it was“not unusual” for governments to get such advice, even as he stressed it wasn’t on their radar – and was rolled out to help clean up the situation the next day, splitting hairs that the government had received “advice” not “modelling”. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter TheCoalitionthis week launched an “Albanese Live Lie Tracker”. Both sides are doing this; Labor’s campaign machine sends out a tally of Dutton’s “daily lies” to journalists. Some Liberals quietly grumble that the respective press packs are grilling Dutton harder than they are Albanese. Having been on both campaign buses now, with a revolving cast of press gallery colleagues and competitors, I can say it’s not for the reason Dutton sympathisers might like to think. Albanese has fronted up often to tough TV and radio interviews or all-in press conferences over his three years; Dutton has not. Whereas Labor has consistently released policy over their time in government, the Coalition has left much of their heavy lifting and reform ideas to the last minute. This means many Labor policies have already been thoroughly raked over in the lead-up to the poll, as has Albanese on his mistakes. Dutton, on the other hand, is facing his inquisition now, in the more intense period right before voters make up their minds. To be sure, Albanese is still – rightly – getting fresh questions over Labor’s promise last election to cut $275 from power bills, their energy systems plan and new promises on housing, tax and cost of living. He has gotten cranky at times, snipping a little too vehemently at a question he didn’t like and downplaying the journalist as a “state correspondent”; he rubbishes questions about minority government and potential cooperation with the Greens, not bothering to disguise expressions of annoyance or dismissiveness. But there’s only so many times you can write the same story – which leaves Albanese breathing room for lighthearted podcasts, or a ferry ride with journalists. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dutton, as well as having to defend his policy announcements in the heat of the campaign, also has to respond to breaking events. Hisserious error(slip of the tongue or pure mistake) in claiming the Indonesian president had announced that Russian planes would be stationed on Biak island, gave Labor fresh ammo for their “reckless and risky” attack. And confusion and a deliberate lack of clarity over public service cuts leaves Dutton looking evasive and tricky whenever he’s asked. The opposition leader couldn’t even catch a break when he finally let down the shutters to kick a footy around with a few local kids in Darwin. During his only really easygoing press appearance this campaign, a wayward kick sent the ball crashing into a TV camera, leaving the operator with a bleeding gash on his head. Dutton’s campaign is workmanlike. Numerous visits to factories in his first week have given way to endless petrol station photo ops; a campaign event here, a building site there. Albanese looks meanwhile to be genuinely enjoying his time hopping around the nation – if a little tired at points. JoiningGuardian Australia’s Full Story podcast on Thursday, he downed a piccolo at 3pm, a caffeine boost ahead of a few engagements he said lay ahead into the afternoon and evening. On two separate occasions this week he brought up, unprompted, his plan to watch Star Wars on 4 May (“May the Fourth”) after election day. Journalists and even his own staff barely manage to suppress quiet groans when he goes off on a tangent at each media appearance about a local infrastructure project he’s backed nearby, or about his dog. Others have commented at how few genuine public interactions both men have had on this campaign. Security threats detailed recently partly explain the reticence, even as Albanesespoke this week of how he enjoys getting out to meet punters.

    "title": "Trumpet of Patriots faithful told Australia needs ‘many’ Trump-like policies as Clive Palmer launches campaign",
    "article_text": "BillionaireClive Palmerhas made his pitch to party faithfuls after launching the Trumpet of Patriots campaign at his own resort. Palmer hopes his Trumpet of Patriots can bring “common sense” back toAustralian politicsafter launching the party’s campaign in front of a strong crowd at his resort. Palmer, the Victorian senator Ralph Babet and the federal party leader Suellen Wrightson led the party pitches to a crowd of 400 at the Palmer Coolum Resort on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, pointing the finger at Australia’s major political parties. “The uni-party of Labor and the coalition have provided the blueprint for a disaster since the turn of the century,” Palmer told the crowd. “It’s dumb and dumber. It’s tweedledum and tweedledee. It’s B1 and B2.” Attendees at the event were provided yellow hats saying “Make Australia Great Again”. American journalist Tucker Carlson was fed in to proceedings via video to begin the launch. “Australia needs many of the policies of the Trump administration, which will be effective in bringing Australia back on track,” Ms Wrightson said in her speech. “We also believe it’s time to throw out the professional politicians in the Labor and Liberal Party and it is indeed time to provide Australians with a real, genuine alternative at this election.” Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Palmer has spent millions of dollars on federal election campaigns, with the 3 May poll no different as he seeks to gain more than one seat. He does not expect to spend as much in this shorter federal campaign, but estimates his expenses about $70m. Since he vowed at a recent National Press Club address to bombard Australians with advertising, billboards and videos have been appearing thick and fast across the physical and digital landscape. The party has committed to driving down cost of living through high-speed rail, allowing Australians to access superannuation for a housing deposit and capping interest rates at three per cent.

Part of the party’s immigration policy includes limiting foreign buyers from purchasing Australian homes and prime agricultural land. Palmer is also calling for the abolition of net zero and Paris Agreement targets. “The government has given $38 billion to foreign developers and manufacturers in the form of subsidy for renewable energy, they’ll spend another $642 billion of taxpayers money to try to get to net zero,” he told the party faithful. “They’ll spend that $642 billion to keep you poor, to keep you in your cage and to tie you up so you can do nothing, and you’ll feel helpless and defenceless.” Palmer also accused both parties of staging the most boring election campaign he could recall, “and I don’t think that’s a good thing”. He said his party would preference them last in the seats they held.",

    "article_text": "Australia will use “whatever avenues” it can to help Melbourne man Oscar Jenkins, who faces a 15-year jail term inRussiafor fighting with Ukrainian troops. The prime minister said on Saturday that the government would “continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of Vladimir Putin” to release Jenkins, 33, a former teacher who fought with Ukraine’s armed forces against Russia’s invasion. After initial reports in January that Jenkins had died in captivity, Russia then confirmed he wasalive and in custody. In February video of him appeared on YouTube in which he appeared weak and said he thought he had a broken arm. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter According to several news reports on Saturday, the Russian prosecutor’s office in Luhansk – eastern Ukrainian territory currently occupied by Russia – has approved a criminal indictment against Jenkins. The Guardian has confirmed that a charge was laid. Russia has indicted other foreign prisoners of war. “We continue to hold serious concerns for Mr Jenkins and are working with Ukraine and other partners to advocate for his welfare and release.” a spokesperson for Australia’s department of foreign affairs and trade said. The ABC reported that the indictment claimed “a citizen of Australia, on his own initiative, in order to receive material remuneration, arrived on the territory of Ukraine to participate as a mercenary in an armed conflict with the Russian Federation on the side of enemy troops”. The ABC also cited local media claiming he was paid up to $15,000 a month to fight on Ukraine’s side against Russia. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has said Jenkins was being held as a prisoner of war, which would mean he should be afforded the protection of international humanitarian law. But Moscow referred to him as a mercenary, which would mean he is not covered by the conventions. Anthony Albanese said on Saturday the Australian government would “stand up and use whatever avenues we have at our disposal to continue to make those representations [on behalf of Jenkins] … both to Russia, but also, of course, through our friends in Ukraine, who have also made representations as well”.

It’s against national sovereignty. “The people of Ukraine are fighting for a democratic nation, for their own sovereignty, but they’re also fighting for the international rule of law, which is why we do want to see peace, but we do want to see it on the terms that are acceptable to Ukraine.” The government is considering sending apeacekeeping forceto Ukraine, a plan opposed by the Coalition.",

    "article_text": "A man has been taken into custody after allegedly ramming a police vehicle with a stolen Audi in Sydney’s eastern suburbs after an early-morning pursuit during which police fired at the car. Police officers patrolling in Bondi began following a “suspicious” dark-coloured Audi A1 about 4am and a pursuit began, but ended the chase a short time later due to the speed, detective superintendent Jodi Radmore said. Shortly afterwards the vehicle was spotted on Sir Thomas Mitchell Road in Bondi. As an officer approached on foot, the car allegedly “accelerated towards the officer” and the officer discharged a firearm at the car. “The vehicle then collided with a police car and drove away,” Radmore said. Neither of the two police officers at the scene were injured. The vehicle was spotted by a member of the public in North Bondi at 6.30am and shortly afterwards a 37-year-old man who is known to police was taken into custody. “It was necessary to take him to hospital for an assessment, and we will continue our inquiries when he’s released,” Radmore said. She said she was not aware of any physical injuries. Police checks revealed the vehicle was stolen from Double Bay on Friday night, Radmore said. On the officer’s decision to discharge a firearm, Radmore said police “review all matters involving police use of force in a number of ways, and that will come out through the investigation”.",

    "title": "Putin cannot be trusted, says Ukraine after Russia announces ‘Easter truce’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you can read more on this story here: RussianpresidentVladimir Putinon Saturday announced anEaster trucein the conflict inUkrainestarting this evening and lasting till midnight on Sunday. “Today from 1800 (1500 GMT) to midnight Sunday (2100 GMT Sunday), the Russian side announces an Easter truce,” Putin said in televised comments, while speaking to Russian chief of staffValery Gerasimov, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). It is approaching 8pm inKyivandMoscow. This blog will be closing shortly. You can keep up to date on the Guardian’sRussia-Ukrainecoveragehere. Here is a summary of the updates from today’s live blog: Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral 30-hour Easter ceasefire in Ukraine on Saturday, after Washington said it could abandon peace talks within days unless Moscow and Kyiv show they are ready to stop the war. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6pm Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the ceasefire “another attempt by Putin to play with human lives”.He wrote on X that “air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine” and “Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin’s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life”. Andrii Sybiha, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said that Kyiv had in March “agreed unconditionally to theUS proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days”, which Russia had rejected.“Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,” Sybiha continued, writing on X. “Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.” Ukraine and Russia conducted a swap of more than 500 prisoners of war on Saturday, the latest in a series of exchanges since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago.Zelenskyy, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, said 277 Ukrainian service personnel had returned home from Russian captivity. Russia’s defence ministry said 246 servicemen had been handed over by Kyiv. It said a further 31 injured prisoners of war had been handed over to Ukraine and 15 of its own wounded servicemen had also been returned by Kyiv. Moscow’s troops have driven out Ukrainian forces from nearly all of Russia’s western Kursk region, Russia’s military chief, Valery Gerasimov, said. “The bulk of the area where the invasion took place has now been cleared,” Gerasimov told Putin in a televised meeting. “It’s 1,260 square km, 99.5%.” Posting on X on Saturday, the Ukrainian presidentsaid “our forces continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions”.He added: “In the Belgorod region, our warriors have advanced and expanded our zone of control.” Russian troops are “solidifying their presence” in the village of Kalynove in the Donetsk region, theKyiv Independentreported, citing the DeepState military blog, which is considered close to Ukraine’s army.The publication reports, sourcing DeepState, that Russian forces are deploying infantry, and establishing logistical routes and communication lines in Kalynove. The US is prepared to recognise Russian control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv,Bloomberg News has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.According to Bloomberg, the people said a final decision on the matter had not yet been taken, and the White House and state department did not respond to a request for comment. The USrepresentative Brian Fitzpatrick, a pro-Ukraine Republican representing Pennsylvania, signed an artillery shell with a message intended for Vladimir Putin during a visit with Ukrainian troops yesterday after a meeting withZelenskyy.Fitzpatrick was filmed signing the shell with a message that read: “To: Putin, From: PA-1. #PeaceThroughStrength.” Australia will use “whatever avenues” it can to help Melbourne man Oscar Jenkins, who faces a 15-year jail term inRussiafor fighting with Ukrainian troops.The prime minister said on Saturday that the government would “continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of Vladimir Putin” to release Jenkins, 33, a former teacher who fought with Ukraine’s armed forces against Russia’s invasion. Last weekend, Alla Shyrshonkova got on the 62 bus on a journey to her cottagenear the Ukrainian city of Sumy. It was a warm spring day. “I thought I’d sit with friends, have some tea. Birds were singing. The weather was beautiful. It was so nice,” she recalled. “The bus was packed. There wasn’t a single free seat. People were standing. Some were going to church for Palm Sunday. There were families with children.” As she reached the city centre she heard a loud bang. Two minutes later – as the bus made its way down Petropavlivska street – there was a second massive explosion. “The blast was in front of me, so I didn’t see it. I only heard it. I was sitting behind the driver, with my back to him. When I heard the noise, I covered my head with my hands and ducked.” After that, she said, “rocks, glass and everything went flying”. Shyrshonkova lifted her head. Blood was gushing “like a fountain” from her arm. “I saw cars on fire and smoke. People were lying at my feet. I said to them: ‘Get up, get up.’ They were silent.” A conductor called the name of the driver – “Kolya” – but there was no reply. Passengers tried to climb out of a window. Eventually, a teenage boy opened a door and she staggered out. The double strike on Sumy was thebloodiest single moment this year in Russia’s murderous war against Ukraine. The Iskander ballistic missiles carried deadly cluster of munitions which released a wave of shrapnel. Thirty-five people were killed. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s foreign minister,Andrii Sybiha, saidKyivremains committed to the 30-day ceasefire agreement. In a post on X, he urged countries to remain “vigilant” and ensure thatRussianforces also uphold the truce. Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a cease-fire. 30 hours instead of 30 days. Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions. We know his words cannot be trusted and we will look at actions, not words. Russia can agree at any time to the proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which has been on the table since March. We want to see Russian forces actually cease fire in all directions. We also urge all of our partners and the international community to be vigilant. Only actions, not words, reveal the truth: this war began and continues only because of Russia. The Guardian’s Luke Harding reports on Putin’s announcement of a temporary Easter ceasefire in Ukraine: Vladimir Putinhas announced an “Easter Truce”, saying that Russian forces will stop combat operations from 6pmMoscowtime on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. In a surprise move, Russia’s president said he was ordering a temporary halt to the fighting out of “humanitarian considerations”. He said he expectedUkraineto follow suit and said this would be a test of whether the “regime” in Kyiv was interested in peace. Putin’s made his remarks in a meeting with Russia’s commander-in-chiefValery Gerasimov,which was broadcast on state television. Ukrainians reacted sceptically, pointing out the announcement was made at the same time as an air raid alert sounded across the Kyiv region. Russia has broken numerous ceasefire since its 2014 covert invasion of eastern Ukraine. Unlike Ukraine, it has refused to implement a 30-day pause in fighting proposed more than a month ago by the Trump administration. Speaking on Saturday, Putin saidKyivwas guilty of violating a deal “100 times” to refrain from attacking Russian energy infrastructure. He commanded Gerasimov to prepare an “immediate response” if this were to happen again. Read the full story here: Ukraine and Russia conducted a swap of more than 500 prisoners of war, the latest in a series of exchanges since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, said 277 Ukrainian service personnel had returned home from Russian captivity. He thanked the UAE for helping with the mediation of the swap and wrote on X: In total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 4,552 people—both warriors and civilians—have been successfully brought back home from Russian imprisonment. We remember all those who remain in captivity. We are searching for everyone who could be there. We must bring them all home. Russia’s Defence Ministry said 246 servicemen had been handed over by Kyiv. It said a further 31 injured prisoners of war had been handed over to Ukraine and 15 of its own wounded servicemen had also been returned by Kyiv. It is approaching 6pm inKyivandMoscow. Here is a summary of the updates so far from today’s live blog: Russian presidentVladimir Putinon Saturday announced an Easter truce in the conflict in Ukraine starting this evening and lasting till midnight on Sunday.“Today from 1800 (1500 GMT) to midnight Sunday (2100 GMT Sunday), the Russian side announces an Easter truce,” Putin said in televised comments, while speaking to Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov. Putin said he assumed Ukraine would follow Russia’s example, but told Gerasimov, to ready Russian troops to repel any violations of the truce by Kyiv. President Donald Trump has said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are “coming to a head” and insisted that neither side is “playing” him in his push to end the grinding war.Trump spoke on Friday shortly after secretary of state Marco Rubio warned that the US may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting. US vice-president JD Vance met on Saturday with the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, archbishop Paul Gallagher.As the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv’s right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be “imposed” onUkrainebut “is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect”. At least six people have been injured by Russian attacks across Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Saturday,according to theKyiv Independent. Citing the Ukrainian air force, the publication reported thatRussiadeployed eight missiles of different types, and 87 long-range drones. Of those, 33 were shot down and 36 turned out to be decoy, the air force said. The overnight attack caused damage in five regions across the country, the Ukrainian air force said. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukraine on Saturday of attacking Russian energy facilities 10 times over the past 24 hours.A 30-day moratorium was brokered by the US in March between Ukraine andRussiaagainst strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure. However, both nations have repeatedly accused the other of violating it. On Saturday, a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the Kursk region killed a woman and injured a man and a child, regional governor Alexander Khinstein said on Telegram. Russia on Saturday said it had retaken the penultimate village still under Ukrainian control in its Kursk frontier region, where Kyiv’s forces launched a surprise offensive in August. “During offensive operations, units of the Northern Group of Troops liberated the village of Oleshnya,” the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram. “In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory … is now liberated. That’s 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,” Gerasimov told Putin in a televised meeting. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the reports. Posting on X on Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said “our forces continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions”.He added: “In the Belgorod region, our warriors have advanced and expanded our zone of control.” Russian troops are “solidifying their presence” in the village of Kalynove in the Donetsk region, theKyiv Independentreported, citing the DeepState military blog, which is considered close to Ukraine’s army.The publication reports, sourcing DeepState, that Russian forces are deploying infantry, and establishing logistical routes and communication lines in Kalynove.

Russia and Ukraine will conduct a new prisoner swap on Saturday mediated by the United Arab Emirates, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters.Nearly 500 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners and 46 injured soldiers will be exchanged in the latest swap to be mediated by Abu Dhabi. The exchange will involve 246 prisoners from each side, the source said. AlthoughVolodymyr Zelenskyyis yet to respond toRussianpresidentVladimir Putin’s announcement of atemporary Easter ceasefire, theUkrainianpresident has just posted an update on X about theKursk region. Zelenskyy said Ukrainian troops were “holding their positions”. He wrote: I have just received a report from commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi. Today, our forces continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions. In the Belgorod region, our warriors have advanced and expanded our zone of control. As for yet another attempt by Putin to play with human lives-at this moment, air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine. At 17:15, Russian attack drones were detected in our skies. Ukrainian air defense and aviation have already begun working to protect us. Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin’s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life. Here is whatVladimir Putinsaid about thetemporary Easter ceasefireon Saturday, as reported by the Associated Press (AP): Guided by humanitarian considerations, today from 18:00 00:00 from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side declares an Easter truce. I order that all military actions be stopped for this period. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions. Russia’s military chief of staffValery Gerasimovon Saturday said troops had retaken more than 99% of territory seized byUkrainein theKursk regionin an incursion launched in August. “In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory … is now liberated.

    "title": "JD Vance had ‘exchange of opinions’ with senior cardinal, Vatican says",
    "article_text": "The US vice-president,JD Vance, had “an exchange of opinions” with the Vatican’s secretary of state over current international conflicts and immigration when they met on Saturday, the Vatican has said. The Vatican issued a statement after Vance, a Catholic convert, met Cardinal Pietro Parolin and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher. There was no indication he metPope Francis, who has resumed some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia. The Holy See has responded cautiously to theTrump administration, in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality. It has expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and cuts in international aid, and has called for peaceful resolutions to the wars inUkraineand Gaza. Those concerns were reflected in theVaticanstatement, which said the talks were cordial and that the Vatican expressed satisfaction with the administration’s commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience. “There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the statement said. “Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the state and the Catholic church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.” The reference to “serene collaboration” appeared to refer to Vance’s accusation that the US conference of Catholic bishops was resettling “illegal immigrants” in order to obtain federal funding. Top US cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim. Parolin told La Repubblica on the eve of Vance’s visit: “It is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the west, from what we have relied on for many years,.” As the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv’s right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be “imposed” on Ukraine but “built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect”. Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St Peter’s Basilica after meeting Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. On Saturday, after the Vance family’s introduction to Parolin, they had a private tour of the Sistine Chapel. It was not immediately clear where they would celebrate Easter. Pope Francis, for his part, according to official liturgical plans released on Saturday, indicated he hoped to attend Easter mass on Sunday, which usually draws thousands to St Peter’s Square. The pope and Vance have tangled over immigration and the Trump administration’s plans to deport people en masse. Francis has made caring for those who migrate a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative US Catholic church. The pope also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment was inadmissible in all cases. After a public appeal from Francis just weeks before Trump took office, Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row. Trump is an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Vance, who converted toCatholicismin 2019, identifies with a small Catholic intellectual movement that is viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings and often described as “post-liberal”. Post-liberals share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. They envision a counter-revolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions such as universities from within, replacing entrenched “elites” with their own and acting upon their vision of the “common good”. Just days before the pope was admitted to hospital in February, Francis criticised the Trump administration’s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive people of their inherent dignity. In a letter to US bishops, he also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies. Vance had defended the administration’s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin asordo amoris. He said the concept delineated a hierarchy of care – to family first, followed by neighbour, community, fellow citizens and, last, those elsewhere. In his 10 February letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance’s understanding of the concept. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,” he wrote. “The trueordo amoristhat must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the good Samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” Vance has acknowledged Francis’ criticism but has said he will continue to defend his views. During an appearance on 28 February at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance did not address the issue specifically but called himself a “baby Catholic” and acknowledged there are “things about the faith that I don’t know”.",

Eventually, a teenage boy opened a door and she staggered out. The double strike on Sumy was thebloodiest single moment this year in Russia’s murderous war against Ukraine. The Iskander ballistic missiles carried deadly cluster of munitions which released a wave of shrapnel. Thirty-five people were killed. Two of the victims buried last week were children, aged eleven and seven. Sumy residents left toys at the spot where they perished: a bear, a hippo, a toy car and a football. Shyrshonkova was one of 129 people wounded. Among them are 15 children. Some are critically injured, hovering “between life and death”, as Tetyana, a nurse at Sumy’s general hospital, told theObserver. The first missile crashed into a university congress centre, plunging through a glass atrium and a basement theatre. The second turned the city into a vision of hell, with bodies on the ground and a little girl crying and covered in blood. The war seems further away than ever from a peaceful resolution. On Friday, Donald Trumpsignalled he is ready to “take a pass”on brokering an agreement unless the two sides reach a deal “very shortly”. More than a month ago, Ukraine accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Russia didn’t. Since then, it has demonstratively escalated its bombing campaign on civilians and infrastructure,hitting Sumy, Kharkiv and Dnipro. As many predicted, Trump’s negotiating strategy has been to favourRussia. He has effectively ended military assistance to Kyiv, while falsely blaming Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Joe Biden for “starting” the war. No similar pressure has been applied to Moscow. Trump downplayed last weekend’s Sumy strike, calling it a “mistake”. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff – whomet European leaders on Thursday– parrots Kremlin disinformation. Speaking from hospital, survivors expressed anger at the US president, accusing him of laziness and a bewildering partisanship. “What happened in Sumy is terror, obviously – nothing else,” Shyrshonkova said. “Trump is basically supporting Russia now. “I wish he would come toUkraineand see what his belovedpuylo[a slang term for Putin, meaning prick] is doing. I want Trump to help us at the same level as Joe Biden.” Another wounded survivor, 72-year-old Hennadii Smoliarov, said the Russians were carrying out genocide. “They are trying to destroy all Ukrainians. They hate us. Putin says we are not a people. “They promote the concept ofRusskiy Miror ‘Russian World’. That means conquering everywhere.” Smoliarov said that, when he was studying in Moscow in the 1980s, he was called aKhokhol, a derogatory term for Ukrainians.“Prejudice is widespread,” he noted. He had been sitting on the 62 bus, having gone into town to fetch eyedrops for his wife, Anna. After the first strike the bus stopped outside Sumy state university’s institute of applied physics. Shrapnel from the second missile hit his lung and head. “There was a strong shockwave. You couldn’t see inside. The smoke was like a fog, it was so thick.” A woman lay motionless at his feet. “I lost strength and collapsed right inside the bus,” he recalled. A volunteer grabbed Smoliarov by the collar of his brown leather jacket and dragged him on to the pavement. The explosion blew the wooden doors and glass from the 19th-century institute, sending shards into its garden and flowerbeds. A quartz wall clock on the ground floor stopped at the moment of impact: 10.20am and 40 seconds. Across the road, a giant hole was gouged in the white-painted economics and business faculty building. Another wounded survivor, Viktor Voitenko, said Sumy was in its fourth year of war. “We’ve had so many attacks, withShahed drones and missiles,” he said. “The air raids don’t stop.” The city, a key military hub, is located less than 20 miles from Russia. From here, Ukraine’s armed forces launcheda surprise mini-invasionlast August into Russia’s neighbouring Kursk region. Theywithdrew in March. Fighting continues in villages along the border, where Ukrainian troops hold a sliver of Russian territory. Voitenko works at the physics institute as a security guard. He was in the foyer when the second Iskander dropped. A metal fragment hit him in the spine. “I couldn’t feel my legs. I called my wife and she reached me in five minutes. After that, the police took me to a safe place,” he said. Lying in a hospital bed, Voitenko said it was unclear if he would walk again: “It’s in God’s hands. My operation went well. The doctors say they can’t guarantee anything.” Aged 56, Voitenko previously worked as a builder and as a “liquidator” – a member of the clean-up crew sent to the Chornobyl nuclear power station after the 1986 disaster. The Kremlin, he said, was addicted to reckless imperialism. “Before the war, we lived well. We had everything. I have a beautiful wife, an 11-year-old daughter and two cars.” The bus driver, Mykola Leon – killed on Palm Sunday, together with most of his passengers – was a distant relative, he said. Shyrshonkova spoke to theObserverfrom the neighbouring hospital room. She put her survival down to a class she attended in the 1950s as a schoolgirl in the Soviet Union. “We had civil defence lessons. The teachers told us capitalism was bad. They also explained what to do in the event of a nuclear attack. We were taught to keep our mouth closed and to cover our head and eyes. “When I heard the explosion on Sunday it came back to me. Some instinct took over,” she said. Once she left hospital, Shyrshonkova said she hoped to visit her dacha. “I’ve planted tomatoes and peppers on the balcony. I want to see them growing.” Luke Harding’sInvasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for theOrwellprize, is published by Guardian Faber",

    "title": "Harborough FC ‘surprised’ as 100 Spanish fans turn up to watch game",
    "article_text": "Football tourism is usually seen at Premier League stadiums such as Old Trafford, Anfield and the Emirates, so fans of Harborough Town, who compete in the seventh tier of the football pyramid, were stunned when 100 Spaniards arrived at Bowden Park to watch them take on St Ives Town. The Spanish fans, who turned up last Saturday, were subscribers to a Spanish YouTube channel,La Media Inglesa(LMI), focused on English football, which has now started arranging overseas trips for its followers. “Some of the local fans were quite surprised, probably wondering what 100 Spaniards were doing there,” said Álvaro Sanz, a Harborough Town fan from Madrid. According to the marketing agency Two Circles, 80.2 million fans attended professional sports in the UK in 2023, with football making up 33% of the total. Premier League matches accounted for 20% (15.8 million) of all sports attendances. Ilie Oleart, from Barcelona, founded LMI, which has covered football matches in England for Spanish-speaking fans around the world since 2011. The channel has attracted nearly half a million subscribers, and in 2018 began offering trips to the UK so fans could experience the English game. Oleart, who supports the Catalan club Espanyol, who play in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football, said he aspired to not only arrange trips but to be involved in a club in a more meaningful way. “Our aim was to transform a small local English club into a small local club with a global fanbase,” he said. Harborough Town FC,nicknamed the Bees, emerged as the fans’ choice after Oleart consulted his subscriber base. LMI has brought its subscribers along to watch matches at the grounds of Brighton and Hove Albion, Sheffield United and Wycombe Wanderers. “I met people at the club in September to get to know their history, the town and the facilities,” said Oleart. “We thought they were the perfect club with the right values to share with our audience.” Football matches at Harborough Town, which take place in the Southern League Premier Division Central , will now feature live on the LMIYouTubechannel, allowing Spanish speakers an opportunity to become “virtual supporters” of the club. The Bees chair, Peter Dougan, said the partnership with LMI was an “opportunity to grow our fanbase and our income” through a global audience and could open the door to sponsorship deals. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion “It was being in the right place at the right time,” he said. “LMI liked what they saw and we decided they were right for our club too.” Harborough were defeated 2-1 by St Ives Town but the result didn’t dampen the spirits of Oleart’s group, who were “very happy” with their experience. “It wasn’t just any club any more, it felt like our club,” said Oleart.",

    "title": "Orbán’s stance on Ukraine pushes Hungary to brink in EU relations",
    "article_text": "The posters are going up all overHungary. “Let’s not allow them to decide for us,” runs the slogan alongside three classic villains of Hungarian government propaganda. They are: Ukraine’s wartime leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy; the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen; andManfred Weber, the German politician who leads the centre-right European People’s party in the European parliament, which counts Hungary’s most potent opposition politician among its ranks. That decision is Ukraine’s membership of the EU, a distant prospect not in the gift of any of the politicians now plastered across billboards in Hungary. Ballot papers, being sent out this week, ask a simple question: “Do you supportUkrainebecoming a member of the EU?” Despite the neutral question, Hungary’s government is not standing on the sidelines. After the launch of the campaign, the prime minister,Viktor Orbán, last week urged people to vote, claiming that Ukrainian membership would mean “we would have to spend all Hungary’s money on Ukraine”. The government has also claimed – without offering evidence – that “cheap labour” from Ukraine would take jobs from Hungarians, while epidemics would spread because not enough Ukrainians get vaccinations. The governing Fidesz party realised that “there is a sentiment against Hungary’s involvement in the war”, said László Andor, Hungary’s EU commissioner from 2010 to 2014. “But ever since, this has been used and abused to deny proper support to Ukraine.” Hungary has repeatedly sought toblock EU sanctions against Russia, eventually backing down. It has vetoed the release of €6bn funds to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and flatly refused to sign two EU declarations in support of its invaded neighbour. But now its attempts to stymie EU support for Ukraine could force a reckoning in its relations with the bloc at a moment when Orbán contends with his most serious political challenger in years. EU member states are considering more seriously than ever how to use their ultimate sanction against Hungary: the removal of voting rights under theEU treaty’s article 7. The idea remains at an early stage, but informed insiders think it will never happen because rescinding voting rights requires the unanimity of the remaining 26 members. Under a previous government, Poland wielded the saviour veto; now Slovakia’s populist prime minister,Robert Fico, is seen as holding that card. The European parliamentlaunched the article 7 procedure in 2018, but it has languished amid hesitancy among member states. Now there are flickers of change. Andor said things had moved on since the Orbán government’s first “very consequential violations” against the independence of the judiciary emerged in 2010-11. “There are many more emotions [now]. Why? Because Orbán is obstructive on issues which the majority of theEuropean Unioncountries consider of vital importance,” he said, referring to Ukraine. Some think a reckoning will come if Hungary seeks to veto the extension of sanctions againstRussia, a vast array of measures aimed at curtailing the war economy, including the freezing of €210bn of Russian central bank assets held in the bloc. The profits are being used tofund Ukraine’s war effort, while the capital is seenas vital for its eventual reconstruction. But the measures need to be renewed unanimously by 31 July. “I am pretty sure that if they felt they had the backing of the US, they would block,” said one senior EU official.“It would be huge: basically, it would put them not literally but virtually outside the union.” Diplomats have taken comfort from the fact that Hungary has always backed down on threats to veto, possibly discouraged when Donald Trump alsothreatened Vladimir Putin with sanctions. “If the past is predictive for the future, we should be OK. But it would be foolish to assume that,” said one senior diplomat, who added that “work is going on” to find ways around a potential veto. Dutch Green MEP Tineke Strik, who leads the European parliament’s work on Hungary and the rule of law, said: “Member states really are getting fed up with Orbán.” She counts 19 governments “that seem to be ready to take a step in the article 7 procedure”, which includes action that falls short of suspending voting rights. But they lack “a strategy on how to get the rest of the member states on board”, she added. Last week, the Dutch MEP led a cross-party team of parliamentarians to investigate democratic standards in Hungary, concluding that developments were“going rapidly in the wrong direction”. Pressure onindependent voices is intensifying. In a speech last month, widely seen as marking a new low, Orbán described political opponents, journalists, judges and political activists as “bugs”, redolent of the dehumanising language used in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. A report by the MEPs is expected to elaborate on Hungary’s deep-rooted problems: government-dominated media and politicised courts, as well as increasing restrictions on the LGBTQ+ community after the approval of a constitutional change to codify theban on Pride marches and other public gatherings. “Everyone is fearing this stands for something bigger – the free right to assembly,” Strik said. For analysts, the Pride ban has a different purpose: to wrongfootopposition leader Péter Magyar, the insider turned critic whose Tisza party has extended its lead on Fidesz since the start of the year. “In strategic terms, [the Pride ban] is a trap set for Péter Magyar,” said Daniel Hegedüs, regional director for central Europe at the German Marshall fund. If Magyar condemns the Pride ban, Fidesz will criticise him as part of the “European gay lobby”, which could alienate him from conservative voters, said Hegedüs, using the government’s own language. “But if he stays silent, he risks alienating the more educated, more urban voters for whom it’s a question of values commitment.” In a similar way, the government is also seeking to use the Ukraine referendum to discredit Magyar among voters who are wary of Hungary being drawn into the conflict. His Tisza party is described by government propaganda as “pro-Ukrainian”, working with Brussels to “undermine the living standards of Hungarians”. Tisza, Hegedüs said, is such “an existential threat” to Fidesz that Orbán could resort to electoral fraud to secure victory in parliamentary elections next year. While the last three Hungarian parliamentary elections have been rated unfair – due to media and state resources tilted to favour the government – they have always been free. “We cannot excludethe first neither free, nor fair election in an EU member state[and] a situation where the US administration will immediately recognise the outcome,” Hegedüs said. This raises a challenge for EU diplomats, who have long argued the best way to solve the “Orbán problem” – likethe “Poland problem”before it – is to wait for change at the ballot box. Strik thinks it is the wrong approach. The Dutch MEP wants the commission to speak out more, seek a European court suspension order on the ban of LGBTQ+ events, and redistribute Hungary’s forfeited EU funds to civil society and local government: the Hungarian government lost €1bn in EU funds in 2024 over rule-of-law noncompliance, while a further €19bn is blocked. “He [Orbán] should be under huge pressure from the EU to change his course,” said Strik.",

    "title": "Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’",
    "article_text": "Gaza has been pushed to new depths of despair, civilians, medics and humanitarian workers say, by the unprecedented seven-week-long Israeli military blockade that has cut off all aid to the strip. The siege has left the Palestinian territory facing conditions unmatched in severity since the beginning of the war as residents grapple with sweeping new evacuation orders, the renewed bombing of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, and the exhaustion of food, fuel for generators and medical supplies. Israel unilaterallyabandoned a two-month ceasefirewith Palestinian militant group Hamas on2 March, cutting off vital supplies. Just over two weeks later, itresumed large-scale bombingand redeployed ground troops withdrawn during the truce. Since then, political figures and security officials have repeatedly vowed that aid deliveries will not resume until Hamas releases the remaining hostages seized during the7 October 2023 attacksthat ignited the conflict. Israel’s government has framed the new siege as a security measure and has repeatedly denied using starvation as a weapon, which would constitutea war crime. The blockade is now entering its eighth week, making it the longest continuous total siege the strip has faced to date in the 18-month war. Firmly supported by the US, its most important ally under Donald Trump, Israel appears confident that it can maintain the siege with little international pushback. It is also moving ahead with large-scale seizures of Palestinian land for security buffer zones, and plans to shift control of aid delivery to the army and private contractors, exacerbating fears inGazathat Israel intends to maintain boots on the ground in the territory long-term and permanently displace its residents. Many people theObserverspoke tosaid they are now more afraid of famine than airstrikes. “Many times, I have had to give up my share of food for my son because of the severe shortages. It is the hunger that will kill me – a slow death,” said Hikmat al-Masri, a 44-year-old university lecturer from Beit Lahia in north Gaza. Food stockpiled during the two-month-ceasefire has run out, and desperate people across the territory are jostling at charity kitchens with empty pots and bowls. Goods at markets are now selling for 1,400% above ceasefire prices, according to the latest assessment from the World Health Organization. An estimated 420,000 people are on the move again because of new Israeli evacuation orders, making it difficult to compile hard data on hunger and malnutrition, but Oxfam estimates that most children are now surviving on less than one meal a day. About 95% of aid organisations have suspended or cut back services because of airstrikes and the blockade, and since February, Israel hastightened restrictionsfor international staff to enter Gaza. Basic medical supplies – even painkillers – are running out. “Gaza City is packed with displaced people who have fled Israeli troops moving into the north, and they are living on the street or putting their tents inside damaged buildings that are going to collapse,” said Amande Bazerolle, the Gaza emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières, speaking from Deir al-Balah. Bazerolle added: “There are not enough points of care for so many people. At our burns clinic in Gaza City, we are refusing patients by 10am and we have to tell them to come back the next day, as we are triaging to make our drug supplies last as long as possible.” The siege has been accompanied by a fierce push by Israeli forces on northern Gaza as well as the entirety of Rafah, the strip’s southernmost city, cutting the territory off from Egypt. According to the UN, approximately 70% of Gaza is now under Israeli evacuation orders or has been subsumed intoexpanding military buffer zones; the new Rafah security zone totals one-fifth of the entire territory. The land seizures are pushing the 2.3 million population – and aid and medical efforts – into ever-smaller Israeli-designated “humanitarian zones”, although anIsraeli airstrike last week on al-Mawasi, the biggest such zone on the coast of southern Gaza, killed 16 people. As the space they can operate in shrinks, aid workers said they are worried that that the rules of engagement followed by the Israeli military have changed since the ceasefire collapsed, pointing to the recentbombings of Nasser hospitalin Khan Younis andal-Ahli hospitalin Gaza City. Two people were killed in the Nasser attack, which hit a building where members of an international medical team were present. No casualties were reported in the al-Ahli strike, but the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital were destroyed, medics said. In both cases, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted Hamas militants. “People in Gaza like having international staff around because they assume it affords them more protection and the IDF is less likely to attack the building or the area,” said a senior aid official, who asked not to be named so as to speak freely. “In the beginning of the war, if there was an airstrike two kilometres away from our location, we would evacuate… eventually, that became 300 metres, and now it’s 30 metres, if [the IDF] hits the building next door. “There are either no warnings, or sometimes 20 minutes, which is not enough time to evacuate sick people. Our exposure to risk is getting higher... We know the Israelis are trying to force us to work under their terms.” In a statement in response to the aid worker’s allegations, the IDF said: “Hamas has a documented practice of operating within densely populated areas. Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including taking feasible precautions.” It referred questions about aid to the political echelon. Israel has long alleged that Hamas siphons off large amounts of the aid that has reached Gaza, allowing the group to maintain its control by either keeping the aid for itself or selling it at marked-up prices to desperate civilians. Last week, Israeli media reported that efforts to sidestep international agencies and create an Israeli-controlled mechanism to distribute aidusing private contractorsare under way but still in the “early stages”, with no timeframe for implementation. In the interim, the humanitarian crisis will only worsen, aid agencies say. International mediators are attempting to revive ceasefire talks, but there is little sign either side has moved closer on fundamental issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Masri, the lecturer from Beit Lahia, said: “When the blockade was imposed again and the war resumed, I felt terrified. I constantly think about my little son, and how I can provide him with basic necessities. “No one can imagine the level of suffering… Death surrounds us from every direction.”",

    "title": "Iranian minister says nuclear deal possible if US does not make ‘unrealistic demands’",
    "article_text": "Iran’s top negotiator believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the US is possible as long asWashingtonis realistic, as the two sides prepare to resume talks in Rome on Saturday. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will begin indirect negotiations through mediators from Oman,after their first round in Muscat, which both sides described as constructive. “If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow on Friday after talks with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Tehran has, however, sought to tamp down expectations of a quick deal. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was “neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic”. The talks take place under the shadow of Donald Trump’s threat to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the US over its nuclear programme. The US president told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stoppingIran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.” Trump, who ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers during his first term in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran, has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran since returning to the White House in January. Washington wants Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb. Tehran, which has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful, says it is willing to negotiate some curbs in return for the lifting of sanctions, but wants watertight guarantees that Washington will not renege again as Trump did in 2018. Araghchi said Iran’s right to enrich uranium was “non-negotiable”, afterWitkoff called for its complete halt. Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the west says is necessary for a civilian energy programme. In an interview published on Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said Iran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb. Grossi, who held talks with Iranian officials during a visit to Tehran this week, said the US and Iran were “at a very crucial stage” in the talks and “don’t have much time” to secure a deal.",

    "title": "Miliband in blistering attack on Farage’s UK net zero ‘nonsense and lies’",
    "article_text": "Ed Miliband has torn into Nigel Farage and the Tories for peddling dangerous “nonsense and lies” by suggesting the UK’s net zero target is responsible for destroying Britain’s businesses,including its steel industry. Cabinet ministers are determined to fight back against the way Reform UK and theConservativeshave unceremoniously lambasted the climate crisis agenda for what they believe are nakedly political reasons before important local elections next month. Both Farage and the Tories have blamed the perilous situation atBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe planton high energy costs, saying renewable energy prices have put the company on the brink. Reform has also used the crisis to call for the UK to become self-sufficient in oil and gas by drilling more in the North Sea, despite the fact that stocks there are dwindling fast and most of what is produced is exported. The total abandonment of the broad political consensus for net zero by parties on the right of UK politics – and by US president Donald Trump’s Republican administration in Washington – is causing serious alarm inside the UK government. Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to “double down” on hisLabourgovernment’s commitment to a green energy future, and making the UK a clean energy superpower, at an International Energy Agency conference this week in London that will also be attended by pro-fossil-fuel officials from the Trump administration. In an article for theObserver, Miliband, the energy secretary, says the argument for the UK delivering clean power by 2030 is the same as it was when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022: the need to free ourselves from dependency on foreign supplies, including from Russia, which can lead to uncontrolled price spikes for customers in Britain. Referring to the soaring prices that shocked UK consumers in 2022 and that have continued to reverberate, he says: “Our exposure to fossil fuels meant that, as those markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed, family, business and public finances were devastated. The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today.” As a result, Miliband says breaking free of dependence on overseas supplies is also a matter of “national security”. With an eye on thelocal and mayoral elections in England on 1 Mayin which Reform hopes to turn its recent national poll leads into council seats, Miliband says Farage’s party and the Tories “make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda”. Polling experts believe the attacks on net zero could backfire on Reform and the Tories because the policy is overwhelmingly supported by the public. While Miliband has also been disparaged by the rightwing media over net zero, he is determined to fight back, not least because internal polling shows he and his policies remain popular within the Labour party. Luke Tryl, UK director of polling organisation More in Common, said: “There’s no doubt Reform have channelled public discontent with the status quo and a desire for change into electoral momentum since last July. “But their approach to climate change, along with stances on Ukraine and Farage’s relationship with Trump, risk becoming an achilles heel. Our research finds that in every UK constituency voters say they are more worried about climate change than not, and most see renewable energy as the path to energy security, jobs and cheaper energy. “Even Reform voters themselves, despite being less enamoured by the idea of net zero, just aren’t that motivated by it, and certainly not compared to an issue like immigration.” A Labour source said: “We will go after [Kemi] Badenoch and Farage on energy. They want to leave the UK exposed to markets controlled by [Vladimir] Putin – we are going to make the hard-nosed national security case for climate action.” This week Farage will tour 10 counties in England promoting his anti-net zero policy and also touting his newfound support for the outright nationalisation of the British steel industry – normally an approach advocated by politicians on the left. Miliband adds in hisObservercolumn that if the anti-net zero agenda were followed, it would not only risk “climate breakdown” but also “forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future” in this country, and with them a great opportunity for economic renewal. At a rally in Durham last week Farage said Reform would “reindustrialise Britain”, adding that this would require the country to start producing “enough of our own gas and oil and coal”. He said: “We should be self-sufficient in oil... We should be absolutely self-sufficient in gas.” Climate groups have, however, criticised this rhetoric as “pure fantasy”, pointing to official projections that show a steep decline in North Sea production, regardless of government policy and intervention, owing to the ageing nature of the sea’s basin. Far from being self-sufficient in gas, official forecasts show that the UK will be 94% reliant on gas imports by 2050 even if new fields were to be developed, only a fraction lower than if no new fields are developed (97% dependency). Labour has been making its own case for energy independence, focusing on Great BritishEnergy(GBE), which sources note is one of its most popular policies. The party will campaign heavily in the coming months on GBE’s policy of putting solar panels on the roofs of 200 schools and 200 hospitals. Tessa Khan, executive director of climate action group Uplift, said: “Nigel Farage is peddling a dangerous fantasy by suggesting that the UK can secure its energy from North Sea oil and gas. “As usual, he’s imitating Trump and his obsession with more drilling while ignoring that the UK’s remaining oil and gas reserves are dwindling fast after 60 years of extraction. That’s down to geology, not policies.” Khan added: “By trying to slow the shift to renewable energy, which the UK has in abundance but which Reform is opposed to, Farage is endangering the creation of new jobs that provide a more secure, long-term future. “The question for Reform is: what is its plan for the UK’s oil and gas workers, other than this dangerous fantasy?” Most of what is left in the North Sea is oil, about 80% of which is exported. The sea is also a high-cost basin to drill and more production is only possible if oil and gas prices are so high that energy bills become unaffordable for most ordinary people, or with more generous tax breaks for developers.",

    "title": "‘One hell of a turnout’: trans activists rally in London against gender ruling",
    "article_text": "After last week’s supreme court decision, activists had been worried that trans people might become fearful of going out in public in case they were abused. They weren’t afraid inLondonon Saturday. Thousands of trans and non-binary people thronged Parliament Square, alongside families and supporters waving baby blue, white and pink flags to demonstrate their anger at the judges’ ruling. The numbers seemed to take the organisers and police by surprise. Protesters from a hastily assembled coalition of 24 groups gathered in a ring against the barriers surrounding the grass and began speeches. But after the roads became clogged with people, a woman wearing a “Nobody knows I’m a lesbian” top ran across with her dog and soon the square was full. “It’s one hell of a turnout and there is a really strong sense of unity and solidarity,” said Jamie Strudwick, one of the organisers. “I think it’s impossible to compare it – it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.” Last Wednesday,the supreme court ruledthat when the Equality Act 2010 referred to women, it referred only to biological sex and did not include transgender women who hold a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The judgment was celebrated by groups including For Women Scotland, a gender-critical campaign groupbacked by JK Rowling, which says that women’s safety is threatened by allowing transgender women into single-sex spaces. In his judgment, Lord Hodge said that trans people were still protected from discrimination and harassment under the Equality Act. But some trans people say they have felt confusion, fear and anger, with many believing they will find it harder to challenge unfair treatment and receive support from authorities that should be helping them. After the ruling, the Equality and Human Rights Commission chair,Kishwer Falkner, said that it would create a new statutory code of practice by the summer, giving guidance to public bodies on how they should change their treatment of women and trans people. She said the NHS would need to change itsrules on single-sex wardsand her organisation would pursue the matter if it did not. Other organisations have already acted. British Transport Police said same-sex searches in custody would be conducted “in accordance with the biological birth sex of the detainee”. “In the last week, I’ve had to respond to four suicide attempts or threats from young people,” said Oscar Hoyle, who founded the Blossom LGBT community interest group in 2018. “The most significant one, I was on the phone for three hours to a transgender girl, 18 years old. It took three hours for police to come.” Blossom works with about 400 16 to 30-year-olds from across the LGBTQ community to support them into adulthood, and about two-thirds identify as trans or non-binary. “Regardless of where you sit in this conversation, nobody should be in a position where they feel like life isn’t worth living just because they fall within a marginalised group,” Hoyle said. Among the crowds outside parliament were Awsten Atkinson, a 23-year-old trans man and their partner, Daisy Watt, a 19-year-old trans woman. “My first reaction to the ruling was absolute horror,” Watt said. “I remember looking at the news and thinking, how on earth have we fallen this far? Not even 10 years ago we were making incredible progress but we just seemed to backslide so severely.” Atkinson was “devastated and in disbelief”: “Why do people care so much about what we do with our lives when it doesn’t actually affect them? This is being framed as a feminist movement but the criteria they’re using to decide who is a woman brings the focus back to women as objects, as the sum of their body parts.” The couple were appalled by the BTP decision. “There are a lot of British transport police under investigation for sexual harassment as it is and this opens up the opportunity for them to say ‘you’re getting searched by a male because I believe you’re trans’ and they’re protected by law to do that,” Atkinson said. With protesters on the green, mostly under 30, waving flags and banners, Watt was “reassured that we have a community around us that is willing to stand up and speak truth to power”. Atkinson added: “As we were coming along, I started smiling and I said to them [Watt and her friends] ‘wow look at everybody’. What you can count on in this community is that people will rally round.” Near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue, two trans women in their 20s said they were worried that the UK was becoming more like the US. “When they instituted the bathroom bans there, you saw that it wasn’t just trans people, it was also cis people getting accused and being forced out,” one said. The other said: “What I see is trans misogyny that women legally can’t be women, whereas men will always be men. I find it very scary. “In public spaces I have a different vibe. It’s like we’re going back in time. It feels like we’re not protected by the law any more.” Ann-Marie Still was there with her sister and niece. When she heard the news she was angry and disappointed in the system, she said. “I immediately reached out to trans friends, family, with a simple message: ‘you are loved, you are valid’.” “Most people disregard the young,” said Dani, who was there representing her trans sister. “Parents, children, elderly people – they can’t live their lives as they actually want to.” Police later launched an investigation after seven statues were daubed with graffiti, among them that of the suffragette Millicent Fawcett. Scotland Yard said its officers were in Parliament Square at the time, but did not witness the “criminal damage” take place. No arrests had been made, but officers were investigating, said Ch Supt Stuart Bell, leading the protest policing operation. Polack said it would not change how she behaved. “I can go for an exercise and I go into the changing rooms and there’s nothing to hide because I look like every other woman that’s there. “There are one or two people I come across there who know my past and they’re quite happy with it and the rest of them don’t know and can’t tell. Why should it change? There’s no reason for it to change.”One of the things that bothers Polack is whether the ruling makes her gender recognition certificate valid or not. “There will probably be an attempt to restrict access to changing rooms and what they call single-sex spaces and enforce some sort of ban, but how do you police that?”",

    "title": "TikTok trend for ‘Dubai chocolate’ causes international shortage of pistachios",
    "article_text": "Product promotion onTikTokis now powerful enough to influence the vast agricultural economies of the US and Iran – at least when it comes to the consumption of high-end confectionery. A chocolate bar stuffed with a creamy green pistachio filling has become incredibly popular after a series of video clips shared on the social media site. The first bit of footage praising the taste of the expensive so-called “Dubai chocolate” was posted at the end of 2023 and has now been viewed more than 120m times, to say nothing of the many follow-up videos. The result has been an international shortage of the vital ingredient, pistachio ­kernels, which are largely grown in either the US or Iran. In a year, prices have surged from $7.65 to $10.30 a pound, Giles Hacking, from nut trader CG Hacking,told theFinancial Times. The nut was already becoming scarce due to last year’s poor harvest in the US, the world’s leading exporter. Although that crop was smaller than usual, it was of higher quality and so was largely sold as whole nuts, still in their shells. This has created a further shortage of the basic kernels used in the chocolate bars. Iranian producers, meanwhile, had exported 40% more nuts to the UAE in the six months to March than they had in the 12 months prior to that. Dubai chocolate mania can be sourced to the creation of a bar that combined milk chocolate, the shredded pastry known askataifi, and a pistachio cream filling. Made by the swish Emirati chocolatier Fix, which only sells in the UAE, it was prophetically given the punning name Can’t Get Knafeh of It, in reference to a traditional Arab dessert. Other leading chocolate makers, such as Läderach and Lindt, quickly created their own pistachio ­chocolate products, but are now struggling to meet international demand. Charles Jandreau, the general manager for Prestat Group, which owns several luxury British chocolate brands, told theFTthat the demand for the bars has surprised the industry. “It feels like it came out of nowhere,” he said. “Suddenly you see it in every corner shop.” Some stores are reportedly rationing the number of bars sold at one time. Testament, then, either to the power of TikTok influencers, or the rather more established appeal of tasty chocolate.",

    "title": "Second teachers’ union vows to strike if pay award fails to fund schools in England",
    "article_text": "A second teaching union inEnglandhas vowed to strike if the government fails to compensate schools in full for next year’s teachers’ pay award. The NASUWT union’s annual conference voted to reject any pay offer from the government that did not top up school budgets in June’s spending review, and to “move immediately to ballot members for industrial action”. The vote means the NASUWT and the National Education Union (NEU), which together represent the bulk of England’s teaching workforce, are poised to strike if Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, cannot secure additional funding to match the 2025-26 pay award. Last week, at its annual conference, the NEU agreed to launch a formal ballot on strike action if the government’s pay offer for teachers remained “unacceptable” and was not fully funded in the spending review. Any decisions on pay will hinge on the recommendations of the independent School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB), which have yet to be published. TheDepartment for Education(DfE) has told the STRB it favours a 2.8% wage increase, but the NEU and the NASUWT want an above-inflation pay rise and full compensation for school budgets, so that pay increases do not force cuts to be made elsewhere. Dan Lister, the NASUWT’s junior vice-president, told delegates in Liverpool: “The government’s recommendation to the STRB for a 2.8% partially funded pay award is not acceptable. “The government’s recommendation makes it clear that efficiencies will need to be made. We know what this means. It means restructures, it means redundancies, memberslosing their jobsand children losing their teachers.” Patrick Roach, the NASUWT’s general secretary, said: “We know that the government has been handed the pay review body’s latest report and we hope that the pay review body has been ambitious in putting forward recommendations that will address the ongoingrecruitment and retention crisis.” If the spending review fails to top up school budgets, the two unions are likely to hold formal strike ballots among their members in the summer, setting the scene for potential school closures in the autumn. In a video address to the NASUWT conference on Saturday, Phillipson told delegates: “The toughest financial inheritance in a generation has meant that we’ve already had to take some incredibly difficult decisions, and I’m afraid that more are still coming.” The NASUWT scrapped a planned announcement about Roach’s replacement as general secretary, after he announced in October that he would be stepping down. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The union was expected to reveal if the national executive’s preferred candidate – Matt Wrack, the former Fire Bridgades Union general secretary – had been appointed unopposed, or if his grassroots challengers had received enough branch nominations to trigger an open election. Wrack’s candidacy hascaused concern among memberswho fear his leftwing politics are a bad fit for the more moderate teaching union, while others have criticised his lack of a teaching or education background. Wrack, a former firefighter, led the FBU for 20 years until he lost re-election in January. Union sources said an emergency meeting was held last week to consider legal advice over the appointment process and whether it should be extended. The NASUWT is thought to have last held a contested election for general secretary in the 1990s. An NASUWT spokesperson said on Saturday: “Following the close of nominations, the union will undertake the required checks on the validity of all nominations received and an announcement will be made at the conclusion of this process next week.”",

    "title": "‘Nobody has done this before’: Britain’s beloved steam trains trial pioneering technology",
    "article_text": "About 500 steam trains run across the UK each year, from Penzance in the south to Inverness in the north,­transporting tens of thousands of passengers to a bygone age, ­bringing joy to the faces of enthusiasts and bemusing commuters. But the future of main line steam operations could be under threat unless the traditional fire-breathing machines can be fitted with pioneering modern technology. The UK’s railways are undergoing a major change to their signalling ­systems in the coming years.Network Railis planning to remove traditional lineside colour light signals in favour of in-cab signalling systems along key routes. No steam locomotive in the world had ever been run with in-cab digital signalling – until now. On a Monday night earlier this month, the new technology was ­trialled for the first time as part of a “pathfinder” project aimed at ­securing the future of steam locomotives in the UK. The “A1” No.60163 Tornado –Britain’s first steam locomotive to be built in 50 yearsand which has appeared in thePaddington 2movie and onTop Gear– has been ­fitted with European Train Control System (ETCS) technology as part of a Network Rail-led initiative which was launched in 2021. Fitting the new technology cost about £9m. ETCS is to be rolled out across the country in the coming years and some trains will run in digital-only mode from the end of this year. It is already widely used in Europe and is seen as the industry standard ­signalling system for high-speed lines. Since 2011, the Cambrian Coast Line has been operated exclusively using the system as part of a different pilot programme. The Tornado ran west of Shrewsbury to Newtown and Welshpool overnight to trial the technology for the first time. “It is existential to the sector if steam cannot run with ETCS … the team have done a brilliant job of ­getting us to this point,” a Network Rail spokesperson involved in the project told theObserver. “The pathfinder [project] is all about saying ‘this is going to be really hard, is it ­technically viable?’ Nobody has ever done it with a heritage vehicle.” Since the privatisation of the railways, steam trains have been free to roam the national network subject to there being “white space” in the ­timetables around service trains. “We had quite a few challenges fitting the systems,” Rob Morland, electrical engineer at The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, Tornado’s ­owning group, told theObserver. “This is a very harsh environment: we’ve got heat, coal, coal dust, shocks and vibrations and they all stress the systems.” A second steam-powered turbo generator, an axle-driven alternator and a dedicated battery bank had to be installed in order to power the equipment: “The cab was stripped back to bare metal because of the sheer number of new conduits, boxes and equipment and that was the only practical way to do it,” Morland added. Amy Clouston, principal human factors specialist at engineering consultancy AtkinsRéalis, which designed the fitment of the systems, said: “We had to test whether or not you can even use a touchscreen while you’re hurtling along at up to 75mph. We’ve had to think about vibrations, lighting, noise, coal dust, water and steam and grubby fingers.” Clouston said her team also had to factor in the placement of the screens to avoid being hit by a fireman ­swinging a shovel around, while still being in a position where the driver can still see the safety-critical ­information displayed. “Drivers have varied positions: some drivers hang out of the cab, ­others stand. It isn’t a ‘I’m sat at a desk’ design of a modern diesel or electric locomotive,” she said. Keeping the computers powering the systems cool also proved to be a headache: “The design team had the challenge of sealing them [against] coal dust and heat. Electronics in a sealed environment that’s already hot does not bode well [for the longevity],” she added. “Tornado’s retrofit with our ETCS is a world-first project that has tested our technology in one of the most complex and harsh ­operating environments, proving heritage and digital systems can coexist ­without compromise,” Tank Porteous, ­main line signalling programme director at Hitachi Rail UK, a partner in the project, said. Tornado is so far the only steam locomotive to have been fitted with the system. Last year Network Rail issued a £40m tender document for companies to bid to fit 24 main line steam and heritage diesel locomotives. “The price of future fitments will be significantly cheaper, there’s no doubt about that, but we don’t know yet exactly what that might be,” the NR spokesperson said. “We need to work out how ­commercially viable it is going to be. This is going to form part of where we go in the future.” The spokesperson told theObserverthe team have “learned more in the extremes with Tornado than we will do anywhere elsewhere” and the results will influence the design of equipment that will be fitted. AtkinsRéalis’s Clouston said the project was vital to the future of the main line steam sector: “Steam is part of the nation’s engineering ­heritage so it would be such a shame if it were to only be contained to ­private, ­heritage railways. Having steam ­locomotives out there on the main line is a ­wonderful thing to see.”",

    "title": "Indonesian student detained by Ice after US secretly revokes his visa",
    "article_text": "An Indonesian father of an infant with special needs, who was detained by federal agents at his hospital workplace in Minnesota after his student visa was secretly revoked, will remain in custody after an immigration judge ruled Thursday that his case can proceed. Judge Sarah Mazzie denied a motion to dismiss the case against Aditya Wahyu Harsono on humanitarian grounds, according to his attorney. Harsono, 33, was arrested four days after his visa was revoked without notice. He is scheduled for another hearing on 1 May. “His wife has been in a state of shock and exhaustion,” Sarah Gad, Harsono’s lawyer, said. “The Department of Homeland Security has weaponized the immigration system to serve just an entirely different purpose, which is to instill fear.” Harsono, a supply-chain manager at a hospital in Marshall,Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, was surprised by authorities in his workplace basement on 27 March. Gad said that Harsono was detained without clear explanation and interrogated for hours. Harsono’s wife, Peyton, called Gad in a panic after she received a call from human resources at the hospital. Two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, dressed in plain clothes, had shown up and instructed the staff to stage a fake meeting in the basement so they could apprehend him, according to Gad. Hospital staff were distraught but felt forced to comply. “He unsuspectedly walks in, smiling, and then they just pull out their handcuffs and forcibly detain him, pushing against the wall, start frisking him, and stripping all of his belongings,” Gad said. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. Harsono was brought to the Kandiyohi County Jail, where he is still detained, according to theIce detainee locator. He told the Ice agents that his F-1 student visa was valid through June 2026, and that he had a pending green-card application based on his marriage to a citizen, but that he had been issued a notice to appear in court stating that he had overstayed his visa. His attorney said that as of 28 March, the day after his arrest, his F-1 visa was still active. Gad said the government revoked it without any notice to him, and then claimed he had overstayed. The revocation was backdated to 23 March and allegedly based on his 2022 misdemeanor conviction for graffitiing a semi-truck trailer. Gad said that this is not a deportable offense under the Immigration and Nationality Act. He had traveled internationally and returned multiple times to Indonesia since the conviction without incident. The day before Harsono’s bond hearing, DHS disclosed their evidence against him. Besides stating that his visa had been revoked for the misdemeanor graffiti conviction, for which he paid $100 in restitution, they also mentioned an arrest from 2021 during a protest over the murder of George Floyd. That charge was dismissed. Harsono is Muslim and frequently posts on social media in support of humanitarian relief for Gaza. He also runs a small non-profit, which sells art and merchandise, with proceeds going to organizations aiding Gaza. His wife and eight-month-old daughter, who has special needs, are distraught by his arrest, Gad said. After the judge granted Harsono a $5,000 bond on 10 April, the Minnesota Freedom Fund had been en route to pay it. But DHS immediately filed a notice to appeal the bond decision, which triggered an automatic stay, meaning Harsono had to remain in custody. Gad said this type of move is rare, usually only seen when a judge grants bond to someone charged with violent or serious crimes. “You never involve stays of an immigration judge’s bond order for a minor conviction when somebody’s on their way to becoming a green-card holder,” she said. Gad is preparing to file a federal petition and a temporary restraining order against DHS. Inan appeal for helpon GoFundMe, Harsono’s wife explained that her husband had been fired from his job while in detention and now the family is “in danger of losing our apartment” and they “no longer have health insurance”. The Minnesota Nurses Associationcondemnedthe hospital worker’s arrest and restated its position that “nurses should not and will not serve any role in immigration enforcement” and its hope that “all hospital employees will also reject a role in assisting Ice”. Harsono’s case comes amid a wave of reports ofstudent visas being revoked under the Trump administration’s new executive policy. The actions by the federal government to terminate students’ legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation. At least 901 students at 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal statuses terminated since mid-March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. In some high-profile cases, including the detention of the former Columbia University graduate studentMahmoud Khalil, the Trump administration has argued it should be allowed to deport noncitizens over involvement in pro-Palestinian activism it casts as antisemitic. But in the vast majority of visa revocations, colleges say there is no indication that affected students had a role in protests.",

    "article_text": "Barbara Lee, a trailblazing former member of Congress, has been elected as the next mayor ofOakland, California, after fending off an insurgent challenge from the center at a critical moment for the Bay Area city. Lee defeated the former city council member Loren Taylor after nine rounds of ranked-choice voting gave her more than 52% of the vote to Taylor’s 47%, according to the Alameda county registrar of voters. “This morning, Loren Taylor called me to concede the race,” Lee said in a statement on Saturday. “While I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and ballots will continue to be counted through Tuesday, the results are clear that the people ofOaklandhave elected me as your next Mayor. Thank you, Oakland!” “I accept your choice with a deep sense of responsibility, humility, and love,” Lee added. “Oakland is a deeply divided City; I answered the call to run to unite our community, so that I can represent every voter, and we can all work together as One Oakland to solve our most pressing problems.” Lee must confront a series of acute challenges, including a gaping budget shortfall, widespread public safety concerns and an affordability crisis. She will serve out the remainder of the term of Sheng Thao, who was recalled by voters in November amid frustration over crime and homelessness. Earlier this year, Thao was indicted on federal bribery charges; she has denied wrongdoing. Both Lee and Taylor – the leading contenders in a wide field of candidates – prioritized addressing public safety and the city’s financial crisis, but offered different visions. “Right now, we’re in a period of instability and voters are looking for somebody to stabilize the city government,” said Chris Higgenbotham, an Oakland-based political consultant who was not involved with the mayoral race. He added that residents had wanted the city’s next mayor to “move us not in just the right direction for the next two years but to put us on a road map back to where we were at before the pandemic – one of the best cities, highlighted in magazines, and not just in the news for the negative”. The 78-year-old former representative, a hometown hero, promised to move Oakland past the rancor that has clouded city hall over the last few years. Taylor had cast himself as a tough-on-crime moderate who would shake up city hall and “fix” a “broken” city. Though Lee entered as the heavy favorite, Taylor’s campaign gained momentum as outside groups working to push the Bay Area’s progressive politics to the center took an interest in his campaign. Lee was backed by most of the city council, the interim mayor, the local Democratic party, labor unions, faith leaders and business leaders. She earned the endorsement of the editorial board of the East Bay Times. Taylor drew support from the business and tech communities and was endorsed by the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board.",

    "title": "Protesters fill the streets in cities across the US to denounce Trump agenda",
    "article_text": "Protesters poured into the streets of cities and towns across the United States again on Saturday, in the second wave of protests this month, as organizers seek to turn discontent withDonald Trump’s presidency into a mass movement that will eventually translate into action at the ballot box. By early afternoon, large protests were under way inWashington,New YorkandChicago, with images of crowds cascading across social networks showing additional demonstrations inRhode Island,Maryland,Wisconsin,Tennessee,South Carolina,Ohio,Kentucky,CaliforniaandPennsylvania, among others. Americans abroad also signaled their opposition to the Trump agenda inDublin, Ireland, and other cities. More than 400 rallies were planned, most loosely organized by the group50501, which stands for 50 protests in 50 states, one movement. Opponents of Donald Trump’s administration mobilized from the east coast to the west, including at rallies inPortland, Maine, andPortland, Oregon, decrying what they see as threats to the nation’s democratic ideals. The demonstrations includeda massive marchthrough midtown Manhattan, a rally in front of the White House, and protestersholding up placardsreading “It’s Our Turn to Fight Tyranny” and “The Fascists Are Coming, The Fascists Are Coming” at a Concord, Massachusetts, commemoration of the start of the American revolutionary war 250 years ago. In Massachusetts, 80-year-old retired mason Thomas Bassfordtold CBS Newsthat he believed US citizens were under attack from their own government, saying: “This is a very perilous time in America for liberty. Sometimes we have to fight for freedom.” Protesters identified a variety of concerns, each unified under a common theme: opposition to the second Trump presidency. “We are losing our country,” demonstrator Sara Harvey toldthe New York Timesin Jacksonville, Florida. “I’m worried for my grandchildren,” she said. “I do it for them.” It is the fourth protest event to be staged by the group since Trump was inaugurated on 20 January. Previous events included a “No Kings Day” on President’s Day, 17 February, a theme adopted beforeTrump referred to himself as a king in a social media postdays later. Organizers have called for 11 million people to participate in the latest rallies, representing 3.5% of the US population. Such a figure would likely surpass the numbers who took part in the “Hands Off” rallies staged on 5 April, when 1,200 demonstrations were staged across the US to register opposition to Trump’s assault on government agencies and institutions, spearheaded by the president’s chief lieutenant, the tech billionaireElon Musk, and his unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) unit. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Indivisible, the progressive movement behind the “Hands Off” events, said it was seeking to send a message to opposition politicians and ordinary voters that vocal resistance to Trump’s policies was essential. It also said it was seeking to build momentum that would lead to further and larger protests. Heather Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, said the goal of Saturday’s protests was “to protect our democracy against the rise of authoritarianism under the Trump administration”. She called the group a “pro-democracy, pro-constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement” that was nonpartisan. “We have registered Democrats, registered independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits,” she toldthe Washington Post. Academics who have tracked the slide of democracy into authoritarianism say protests can be part of a wider of strategy to reverse the trend. “Oppositions to authoritarian governments have to use multiple channels always,” said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University and co-author, with Daniel Ziblatt, ofHow Democracies Die. “They have to use the courts where those are available. They have to use the ballot box when that’s available, and they have to use the streets when necessary – that can shape media framing and media discourse, which is very, very important.” In Washington DC on Saturday, a protest planned by the 50501 movement was scheduled to take place in Franklin Park, while other protesters, including a local chapter of Indivisible, rallied outside JD Vance’s home, on the grounds of the Washington Naval Observatory. Protesters also gathered near the Washington monument for a march in support ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador from Maryland.",

    "article_text": "Bill Clinton called on Americans to put aside “whose resentments matter most” and issued a defense of government employees as he returned toOklahoma Cityon Saturday for a remembrance service for the 30th anniversary of the deadliest homegrown terrorist attack in US history. “If our lives are going to be dominated by efforts to dominate people we disagree with, we’re going to put the 250-year-old march toward a more perfect union at risk,” he said. “None of us would ever get much done. Believe me, we’ve all got something to be mad about.” In stirring remarks, the 78-year-old former president, who was widely praised for how he helped the city grapple with its grief in the aftermath of the 19 April 1995 bombing in which 168 people died, including 19 children, offered a message of unity. Clinton was just over two years into his first term as president when a truck bomb destroyed a nine-story US government building in the city’s downtown. He described how he was out jogging with the winners of the Boston marathon on the morning of the attack when he learned of the damage that had been done at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. “Thirty years ago, I thought I was going to have a different day,” he said. “Most of the people who lost their lives were public servants, as we all know,” Clinton said. “What they did every day was a matter of choice, showing up for work, to do business for the American people.” In his address, Clinton hinted at themes that were extremist in 1995 but have now become more established, noting that “in recent years the country has grown more polarized” and bringing the political forewarnings of theOklahomabombing into the present. “The terrorist who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government,” he said, “and would eventually destroy our government and democracy. “A lot of times a fanatic will tell you: ‘Sorry, this, that or the other thing had to happen but, you know, there had to be collateral damage sometimes to make a statement,’” he said. “But I’ve never heard anybody say that who had to live with the damage.” Clinton said Oklahoma City had offered the country an example of how to manage the response to tragedy. He referred to the “Oklahoma standard”, the resilient attitude described by news media and first responders to the tragedy, which was later embraced by the state and defined as “a statewide initiative preserving and promoting a culture of caring citizens by encouraging acts of service, honor and kindness”. The “bombing profoundly shook the country, and did more to all of you. But in the end it brought out the best in America,” Clinton told remembrance service attendees, and urged them to spread the same message to other Americans in the current turbulent political moment. “We can still find a way to move forward together with the Oklahoma standard,” he said. “We were there for you when you needed us. America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard. We all live by it.” He also joked that he felt more able to be candid now. “I’m old and can’t run for anything any more,” Clinton said. “I’m almost as old as President Trump.”",

    "article_text": "Can a 33-year-old cricket-playing socialist, who wants to freeze rent, make city transport free and once aspired to be a rapper win an already turbulent election to become the next mayor ofNew York? Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assembly ­member in Queens, has been the surprise package in the Democratic primary and is now poised to take on the frontrunner in the race, ex-state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is mounting a political comeback after beingforced from office in the face of a series of sexual harassment claims. A recent pollof Democratic ­voters placed Cuomo at 64%, supported mainly by older New Yorkers, and Mamdani at 36%. But with scandal-plagued incumbent Eric Adams sitting out the primary– he may run as an independent – the Ugandan-born Mamdani is in with a chance undera new ranked-choice voting system. “Zohran is breaking away as a clear second place and the alternative to the disgraced ex-governor Andrew Cuomo whose campaign is a house of cards,” Mamdani spokesperson Andrew Epsteintold theGothamistnews sitelast week. He added that the campaign has been successful so far by “being everywhere all of the time,” with more than 10,000 volunteers knocking on more than 100,000 doors, and by pushing out a platform of affordability, of rent freezes, free metro transport and city-run grocery stores – as well as the creation of a department of community safety to invest in citywide mental health programs and crisis response. Mamdani’s emergence as a viable candidate comes as another New York Democrat Socialist, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, currently on a packed-out “Fighting Oligarchy” tour of the US, is being touted as the new face of the national party. Mamdani “represents the city of the future – a more Asian city, a more Muslim city, and what could be a more leftwing city,” says Democrat campaign veteran Hank Sheinkopf. With New York City ­containing about 800,000 Muslims, with 350,000 believed to be registered to vote, this could be the year that they show their power. “Every group shows its power in New York at some point because urban power in the US is all about competition for resources,” Sheinkopf adds. Mamdani is the son of Mira Nair, the Academy Award nominated film director ofSalaam Bombay!; his father,Mahmood Mamdani,is a professor at Columbia who studies ­colonialism. Around the family ­dinner table they would discuss Darfur and other political topics. Before ­running for office, Mamdani worked as a counsellor, a rapper under the name “Mr. Cardamom” and as a cricketer. As a lawmaker, he’s introduced a bill to eliminate tax exemptions for the city’s biggest universities, Columbia and NYU, arguing that the tax funds should go to underfunded public universities; and has said there is a “ceiling” on the power of representation in identity politics because “people cannot feed themselves and their family on someone looking like them”. When theObservercaught up with him at an anti-Tesla protest, he said “it was important that when we turn the page on Elon Musk, we also turn the page on all those who empowered and emboldened the accumulation of this kind of wealth through public policy and public subsidy”. Mamdani said New Yorkers “have a role to play in fighting back against the wealthiest man in the world, who has purchased the president of the United States. It’s critically important that we do so, and we show ourselves standing alongside New Yorkers from all walks of life who are saying that this cannot happen on our watch and our dime.” Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion But key to Mamdani’s ­candidacy may be that he’s a good ­communicator, appearing in comedy clubs, ­grocery stores,diving into the freezing Atlantic on New Year’s Dayto illustrate his rent freeze proposal andtalking to New Yorkers about why they voted for Trump; and going virtually anywhere to meet young voters that, asGothamistnoted, “need a jolt to stop doomscrolling”. In short, he’s on a mission, alongside Ocasio-Cortez, to revive theDemocratsas the Trump presidency marks 100 days in office next week. But New York is also home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, and Mamdani has faced criticism for accusing Israel of committing American-funded genocide in Gaza. Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, has gone to great lengths to portray antisemitism as a central campaign issue, calling it “the most serious and the most important issue” in New York , and portraying himself as a “hyper aggressive supporter of Israel and proud of it”. Mamdani has the capacity to win, says Sheinkopf, but his anti-Israel stance could be a problem: “Is Mamdani’s run a worthwhile demonstration of how healthy a democracy is? Yes. But he’s got to convince people his ­behaviour is within the bounds of what [they] consider appropriate.”",

    "title": "Further delay as Menendez brothers seek freedom after decades in prison",
    "article_text": "The Menendez brothers have spent years waiting for another day in court and a chance to prove that they should be freed after serving more than three decades in prison for the 1989 slayings of their parents. This week it appeared their time was perhaps finally coming – a judge was set to review their request for a resentencing and determine whether they have been rehabilitated. Their attorney, Mark Geragos, planned to ask theLos Angelescounty judge Michael Jesic to reduce Erik and Lyle Menendez’s charges to manslaughter, which would allow them to be released from prison immediately. But as has often been the case in the brothers’ decades-long fight for release, it was not so straightforward. After a tense day in court, the Los Angeles county judge Michael Jesic delayed the proceedings until next month in response to the disputes between the defense and prosecution. “Today was a little bit disappointing for us as a family,” Anamaria Baralt, the brothers’ cousin, toldNBC Los Angelesoutside the courthouse on Thursday. “There have been some delays in this process that were unforeseeable, like the wildfires, that, of course, we have great patience for. This is another delay that is not so much, but we will continue to show up as a family.” In the last year, the brothers have hadnew hopefor the possibility of their release after a wave of public support, as well as the former Los Angeles district attorney’s announcement that he would recommend they be resentenced, and a decision from the governor to order the parole board to determine whether they would pose a risk to the public if they were released. In 1996,Erik, now 54, and Lyle, now 57, were convicted of first-degree murder in the shotgun killings of José Menendez, an entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez. A judge sentenced them to life in prison without parole. The brothers had said they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of sexual, psychological and physical abuse they had suffered at the hands of their father. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as wealthy young men who killed to obtain their multimillion-dollar inheritance, and have argued they were not abused. They have recently sought freedom through multiple legal avenues, including by asking for a new trial in light of new evidence of their father’s abuse, a petition for clemency from the governor, and a request for resentencing. And last year, for the first time since their convictions, it began to appear they could have a meaningful shot at freedom. Adocumentaryand a popular – albeitcontroversial–Netflix serieshighlighted their stories and accounts of abuse and they received support from criminal justice reform advocates, includingKim Kardashian. George Gascón, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for release underCalifornialaw. He said he believed the brothers were “subjected to a tremendous amount” of dysfunction and molestation, and argued they had paid their debt to society. He pointed to their behavior in prison, where they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers. But Gascón lost his seat to Nathan Hochman in November, and the new district attorney said he would not support resentencing and asked the court to rescind his predecessor’s motion. He argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes and his office has said it does not believe they were abused. The brothers’ family, the majority of whom support their release, have been highly critical of the new DA, and asked that he be removed from the case. They said he is “incapable of handling this process with the fairness, care, or neutrality required by law”. This week’s hearing unfolded with the family in attendance as well as the brothers, who watched the proceedings via video from a state prison near San Diego. Hochman’s office had sought to delay this week’s proceedings, which were postponed in January because of the Los Angeles wildfires, to allow the court to obtain part of the comprehensive risk assessments completed by the state parole board. “If there is a report out there assessing the risk of violence, how do we not use it?” Habib Balian, the deputy district attorney, said in court on Thursday. The judge ultimately decided to postpone the proceedings to allow the prosecution and defense time to review the document, which the governor’s office has said is not a stand-alone risk assessment. The hearing in May will also look at a pending request from the brothers’ attorney, Geragos, on whether the district attorney’s office should be recused from the case. Geragos had denounced the district attorney for discussing the risk assessment report in a morning news conference. He said Hochman’s treatment of the case was “appalling”, and he and attorney Bryan Freedman, who represents Menendez relatives, were particularly critical of prosecutors’ decision in a hearing last week to show, without warning, a graphic crime scene photo of José Menendez while relatives were present. “That’s not dignity,” Freedman said. “That’s disrespect. That’s harassment.” Balian apologized for not warning the family about the image, but said: “Erik and Lyle Menendez caused that carnage, not me.” The family has said the act “retraumatized” them and led to the hospitalization, in critical condition, of Terry Baralt, José’s sister, who is 85 and has cancer. “This wasn’t just cruel. It was a clear violation of our rights,” the family said in astatement. “Our forgiveness for Erik and Lyle does not erase our grief. It does not mean we don’t mourn José and Kitty. It means we believe that people can grow. That trauma begets trauma,” the statement continued. “And yet this District Attorney’s Office seems determined to punish us for that humanity.” The next hearing for the brothers is scheduled for 9 May.

    "title": "Canada’s PM Carney plans for stronger defence, broader trade amid US rift",
    "article_text": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled plans to cut taxes and beef up defence spending, arguing Canada must project economic strength and defend its “sovereignty” from the United States amid roiled relations with its neighbour. Carney, whobecame prime ministerafter Justin Trudeau resigned on March 14, presented his Liberal Party’s campaign plan on Saturday beforeparliamentary elections on April 28. The vote will determine whether Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, secures a mandate to continue as premier or whether the rival Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, take power. Carney has said he is the best person to stand up to US President Donald Trump, who has opened up a rift in relations with the traditional US ally,imposing heavy tariffsand even threatening toannex Canadaas the 51st US state. “President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us, and that will never happen,” Carney said on Saturday. “Canada is not America, and it never will be, but we need to do more to just recognise that. We need a plan to deal with this new reality.” Carney’s plan includes investing more in infrastructure and defence while cutting income taxes. He also envisions a trade diversification fund to help exporters expand outside the tariff-heavy US market. “We’re in an enormous crisis, so we have to be able to do two things: one, hold down on that wasteful spending, which we will do, but much more than that, we need to be bold and drive investment in the economy and take the amazing opportunities we have,” Carney said. The plan would boost defence spending to exceed a NATO target of 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2030. It includes buying more submarines, drones and icebreakers. Canada will also invest in transatlantic security with “like-minded” European partners, Carney said. Poilievre, too, has called for increased defence spending although he has proposed offsetting it with deep cuts to “wasteful” foreign aid. Carney aims to balance the budget within three years by cutting expenditures in the federal public service, all while safeguarding healthcare and pensions. “The government has been spending too much, and Canada has been investing too little,” he said.",

    "title": "US attacks Yemen again after at least 80 people killed in Hodeidah",
    "article_text": "The United States has carried out 13 air strikes on Hodeidah’s port and airport, the Houthi-affiliated TV channel Al Masirah says, two days after aUS air striketargeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150. Al Masirah also reported Saturday that three people were killed and four injured due to a US attack on al-Thawra, Bani Matar, and al-Safiah districts in the capital Sanaa. The Houthis have promised to carry out “more operations” despite the ongoing US attacks. US President Donald Trump’s administration announced a major military offensive against the Houthis a few weeks ago. It said the air strikes are aimed at forcing the Houthis to stop threatening ships sailing on the Red Sea on a route crucial to international trade. Since November 2023, the group has reportedly launched more than 100 attacks on vessels it says are linked to Israel in response toIsrael’s war on Gazaand in solidarity with Palestinians. On Friday, Houthi official Mohammed Nasser al-Atifi told Al Masirah that the “American enemy’s crimes” will not deter the Yemeni people from supporting Gaza, but “rather will strengthen their steadfastness and resilience”. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah or “supporters of God”, are an armed group that controls most parts of Yemen, including Sanaa. The group emerged in the 1990s but rose to prominence in 2014 when it seized Sanaa and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee the country. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is gravely concerned about the airstrikes conducted by the United States over the course of 17 and 18 April in and around Yemen’s port of Ra’s Isa, which reportedly resulted in scores of civilian casualties, including five humanitarian workers injured,” Guterres spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Saturday. Guterres expressed fears of damage to the port and “possible oil leaks into the Red Sea”, Dujarric added. The strikes on Ras Isa aimed to cut off supplies and funds for the Houthis, the US military said. It was the deadliest attack of Washington’s 15-month campaign against the Iran-aligned group. About 70 percent of Yemen’s imports and 80 percent of its humanitarian assistance pass through the ports of Ras Isa, Hodeidah and as-Salif. Ras Isa also is the terminus of Yemen’s main oil pipeline, which, along with its port, are “critical and irreplaceable infrastructure” in Yemen, according to the UN Development Programme.",

    "title": "Real Madrid vs Athletic Club: LaLiga – Start, team news, squads, Ancelotti",
    "article_text": "Who:Real Madrid vs Athletic ClubWhat:Spanish LaLigaWhere:Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, SpainWhen:Sunday at 9pm local time (19:00 GMT) FollowAl Jazeera Sport‘s live text and photo commentary stream. Defending champions Real Madrid are in desperate need of all three points as they entertain Athletic Bilbao in LaLiga. The Spanish giants’ defence of their Champions League title ended with a defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday. And with Barcelona moving seven points clear at the top of LaLiga withtheir 4-3 comeback win against Celta Vigoon Saturday, Los Blancos can ill afford to drop points against a team that are proving tough to topple. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti has refused to speak about his future with the club after recent reports again linked him with a move to Brazil’s national team. The veteran Italian manager was asked several times by reporters on Saturday at a pre-game news conference if he would leave the Spanish giant this summer, and each time he responded that he didn’t want to speak about it. “At the end of the season, we will speak about this with the club,” he said more than once. The 65-year-old is under contract with Madrid through June 2026. Speculation regarding Ancelotti’s career plans once again spiked after Madrid’s exit from the Champions League. Besides the Copa del Rey, Madrid is still in the fight to defend its LaLiga title and will also play in the Club World Cup this summer. FT:#BarçaCelta4-3 Raphinha leads the REMONTADA for@FCBarcelona! 🔥#LALIGAEASPORTS|#DesenlaceLALIGApic.twitter.com/85zk1Fshis — LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN)April 19, 2025 Brazil have reportedly been after Ancelotti since last year as they seek an elite coach for the 2026 World Cup. The South Americans fired Dorival Junior as coach last month. Ancelotti is the only coach to have won the Champions League five times — three times with Madrid (2014, 2022, 2024) and twice with AC Milan (2003, 2007). He is also the only coach to have steered teams to domestic league titles in Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and former Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso are both considered top candidates to replace Ancelotti should he leave Madrid. Klopp, however, is “very happy” in his current post at Red Bull despite rumours linking him to a return to management with Real Madrid, his agent said on Friday. The German became Red Bull’s global head of football in January, taking care of a stable of clubs, including RB Leipzig, the New York Red Bulls and Bragantino in Brazil. Alonso, Bayer Leverkusen’s coach, on Friday refused to shut down speculation he could be set for a move to Real Madrid in the summer. “It’s not a good time to discuss the future. We’re at a very important moment in the season,” Alonso said. Leverkusen are six points behind league leaders Bayern Munich with five games remaining. Athletic hold fourth spot in the Spanish top flight with 15 wins from 31 games.

    "title": "Anti-Trump administration protesters turn out for rallies in the US",
    "article_text": "Opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration have taken to the streets in droves across the United States to decry what they say are threats to the nation’s democratic ideals, includingdeportations of immigrantsand mass firings of government workers. The protests on Saturday ranged from rallies in midtown Manhattan and in front of the White House in Washington, DC, to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration marking the start of the American Revolutionary War 250 years ago. The protests come just two weeks aftersimilarnationwide protests against the Trump administration drew thousands of participants. Organisers said they’re protesting against what they view as Trump’s violations of civil rights and the US Constitution, including efforts to deport hundreds of immigrants and scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and in effect shutter entire agencies. In Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants from the steps of the New York Public Library. “No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thomas Bassford drove from Maine to Massachusetts to witness the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord and “the shot heard ’round the world” on April 19, 1775, that heralded the start of the US war of independence from Britain. The 80-year-old retiree said he believed Americans today are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it. “This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” he told The Associated Press news agency, adding: “I wanted the boys [his grandsons] to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.” Elsewhere, protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government while still others organised community-service events, such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters. Some of the events drew on the spirit of the American Revolutionary War, calling for “no kings” and resistance to tyranny. Boston resident George Bryant was among those who turned out in Concord. He told The Associated Press he was concerned Trump was creating a “police state” in America as he held up a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!” The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shut down Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programmes and scale back protections for transgender people. In Washington, DC, Bob Fasick said he came out to the rally outside the White House out of concern about threats to constitutionally protected due process rights as well as Social Security and other federal safety-net programmes. “I cannot sit still knowing that if I don’t do anything and everybody doesn’t do something to change this that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbours is simply not one that I would want to live in,” said a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia.",

    "title": "Barcelona mount Raphinha-led comeback to beat Celta Vigo 4-3 in LaLiga",
    "article_text": "LaLiga leaders Barcelona have fought back from 3-1 down to beat Celta Vigo 4-3 in a roller-coaster encounter as a stoppage-time penalty by Raphinha extends their lead over Real Madrid at the top of the table to seven points. With the score tied at 3-3 after Celta’s Borja Iglesias netted a hat-trick, Saturday’s game in Barcelona seemed to be heading for a draw when Dani Olmo won a penalty deep into added time and Raphinha stepped up to score and seal the three points. The result puts the pressure back on Real Madrid, who play fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Celta Vigo are seventh with 43 points. “This is football. We wanted to win this game, but we weren’t always at our best,” Barca substitute and goal scorer Dani Olmo told DAZN. “But the team came through in the end, and the crowd pushed us on right to the finish. “It’s three points towards our objective, but we have to keep going.” Barcelona took the lead when Ferran Torres picked up the ball in midfield and found space to dribble towards goal, pulling the trigger from the edge of the box to beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita for his 10th league goal of the season. But Celta responded immediately when Pablo Duran put in a superb cross from the wing, and as Wojciech Szczesny sprinted off his line to collect the ball, the Polish keeper missed it to give Iglesias a tap-in into an empty net. Barca fell behind seven minutes into the second half when Frenkie de Jong made an error and completely missed a long ball, allowing Iglesias to run through and beat Szczesny to grab his second goal. As Barca pushed forward to find an equaliser, a Celta clearance found Iglesias again, and he capitalised on the home side’s high line to sprint through on goal and beat Szczesny for a third time to claim his hat-trick. A stunned Barcelona tried to recover quickly, and they got one back in the 64th minute when Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha combined to find Olmo, who scored five minutes after coming on as a substitute. “He [coach Hansi Flick] told me we needed to play a little more calmer. We just needed to connect with each other better,” Olmo said about what Flick told him before he went onto the pitch. Four minutes later, Barcelona levelled it at 3-3 when Lamine Yamal crossed the ball into the 5.5-metre (6-yard) box, where Raphinha rose above the defence to head home. A shell-shocked Celta looked to leave with a point, but Olmo earned a penalty when he was fouled in the box and the referee had no doubts when he pointed to the spot after a VAR check. Raphinha then stepped up and blasted the ball into the top corner in the 98th minute for his 30th goal in all competitions this season. “It’s a bittersweet feeling because we did a lot of things right,” Celta’s Pablo Duran said. “They’ve got such a high level, especially in the final third. They’re capable of these things. “We should be very proud of ourselves, coming here and showing a lot of character, playing our football. For a lot of the game, we were better than them, but we go away with a bad feeling because of the result.”",

    "title": "Iran, US report progress in nuclear talks, confirm third round next week",
    "article_text": "Iran and the United States both report progress after a second round of indirect nuclear negotiations, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi describes as “constructive”, and say they will hold further meetings in the coming week. Technical experts will be meeting in the coming days, suggesting movement in negotiations, before the third round of talks in Oman on April 26, Araghchi said. A senior US official quoted by The Associated Press news agency said Saturday’s meeting in Rome had achieved “very good progress” and confirmed follow-up talks for next week. There has been no official US readout yet of the meeting. Delegations led by Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate executive whom US President Donald Trump has dispatched onnumerous foreign policy missions,heldfour hours of indirect talksat Oman’s embassy in the Italian capital, according to Iran’s top diplomat. The delegations stayed in separate rooms in the embassy as Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi shuttled messages between them, Iranian officials said. “We succeeded in reaching a better understanding on certain principles and goals,” Araghchi was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying. “The negotiations were conducted in a constructive atmosphere and are progressing.” There were useful indirect talks today between Iran and the United States conducted by Oman Foreign Minister in a constructive atmosphere. The two sides agreed to continue the indirect talks in few days at technical level to be followed by another round at their own level on… — Esmaeil Baqaei (@IRIMFA_SPOX)April 19, 2025 “I hope that after next week’s technical sessions, we’ll be in a better position,” Araghchi said, according to Tasnim. “There’s no reason for excessive optimism or pessimism.” Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting near the Omani diplomatic compound in Rome, said the Iranian response was “very positive” for a delegation that “had seemed pretty negative going into the talks”. Next week’s planned talks mean “the pace of negotiations is going to be picked up”, Bays said. The latest meeting comes a week after Iran and the UScame together in Muscatfor their first high-level discussions since Trump in 2018 unilaterally abandoned a landmark nuclear accord signed and brokered by world powers in 2015. The Iranians “are looking for a kind of consistency when it comes to the current talks”, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi reported from Tehran. Western governments, including the US, have long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons – an allegation Tehran has denied, insisting its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful civilian use. On Wednesday, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said Iran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear weapon. Grossi was also in Rome on Saturday meeting Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Grossi’s nuclear watchdog would likely be central in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord. The US and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. After returning to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against Tehran, but in March, he sent a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei calling for renewed negotiations – while warning of military consequences if diplomacy fails. “I’m not in a rush” to use force, Trump said on Thursday. “I think Iran wants to talk.” On Friday, Araghchi said the US showed “a degree of seriousness” during the first round of talks butquestioned Washington’s “intentions and motivations”. Bays said the heart of the dispute remains whether Iran may maintain a civilian nuclear programme – or whether, as hardliners in Washington insist, it must dismantle its nuclear programme entirely. “All they’ve been talking about last week in Muscat and here in Rome is a framework for the discussions and what they want to achieve,” Bays said. “They have not been discussing the nuclear detail, … and the devil is in the detail on these things.”",

    "article_text": "US Vice President JD Vance has met with the Vatican’s top diplomats, discussing the politically fraught issue of migration months after Pope Francis rebuked the new US administration’s hardline immigration stance. Vance, a Catholic convert, held what the Vatican described as “cordial talks” with Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin – the Holy See’s second highest official after the pope – and Paul Richard Gallagher, the secretary for relations with states. “There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the Vatican said in a statement. The two sides also stressed “the common commitment to protect the right to freedom of religion and conscience”, the Vatican said. In February, Pope Francis angered the White House after writing a letter to US bishops in which he condemned Trump’s plan to deport migrants en masse, describing it as a “major crisis”. Trump’s border tsar told Francis to “stick to” religion. Vance had been hoping to meet with the 88-year-old Francis, who isrecuperating after battling life-threatening pneumoniaand spending nearly 40 days in hospital. The Vatican made no mention of any such meeting with the pontiff, who has resumed some official duties, and Vance’s entourage has not commented on the remainder of his programme in Rome. Last year, Francis also made arare foray into the US election seasonto call harsh anti-migrant attitudes “madness” and criticise right-wing US Catholic figures for overly conservative stances. But following Saturday’s meeting, the Vatican did acknowledge the US Catholic Church’s “valuable service to the most vulnerable people”.",

    "title": "Over 170 arrested for attacks on Pakistan KFC outlets in Gaza war protests",
    "article_text": "Police have arrested close to 200 people in Pakistan in recent weeks after more than 10 group attacks on outlets of the United States-based fast-food chain KFC, sparked by anti-US sentiment, unconditional US backing for Washington’s close ally Israel and opposition toIsrael’s war in Gaza, officials say. The fast-food chain has become a target of protest and boycott calls by Islamist parties since the start of the war in Gaza as they link the brand toUS support for Israel. At least 178 people have been arrested, the officials said this week. Police in major cities in Pakistan – including the southern port city of Karachi, the eastern city of Lahore and the capital, Islamabad – confirmed at least 11 incidents in which KFC chicken restaurants were attacked by protesters armed with sticks and vandalised. A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one KFC employee was shot and killed this week in a store on the outskirts of Lahore by unknown gunmen. The official added there was no protest at the time and police were investigating whether the killing was politically motivated or for some other reason. In Lahore, police said they were ramping up security at 27 KFC outlets after two attacks took place and five were prevented. “We are investigating the role of different individuals and groups in these attacks,” Faisal Kamran, a senior Lahore police officer told the Reuters news agency, adding that 11 people, including a member of the Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), have been arrested in the city. He added the protests were not officially organised by the TLP. TLP spokesman Rehan Mohsin Khan said the group “has urged Muslims to boycott Israeli products, but it has not given any call for protest outside KFC”. “If any other person claiming to be a TLP leader or activist has indulged in such activity, it should be taken as his personal act which has nothing to do with the party’s policy,” Khan said. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protests in Pakistan, other Muslim-majority countries and several Western nations over Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip. In February last year, McDonald’s cited boycott campaigns in the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia for sales growing just 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with 16.5 percent growth in the same quarter the previous year. Unilever – which produces Dove soap, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Knorr stock cubes – also said sales in Indonesia in the same quarter had experienced a double-digit decline as a result of “geopolitically focused, consumer-facing campaigns”. A KFC restaurant in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir was also set on fire in March last year as protesters chanted “Free Palestine.” More than 51,900 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s war, which began 18 months ago. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks of October 7, 2023, and more than 200 were taken captive. KFC and its parent company Yum Brands have not yet responded to news of the arrests in Pakistan.",

    "title": "Russia declares unilateral Easter truce; Ukraine says attacks are ongoing",
    "article_text": "President Vladimir Putin has announced an unexpected and brief unilateral Easter truce in Russia’s war on Ukraine while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insists that Russian “assault operations” and “artillery fire are ongoing”. Zelenskyy initially called the announcement on Saturday “another attempt by Putin to play with human lives. … Air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine,” and “Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin’s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life.” The Ukrainian leader said later on X that his country would abide by a truce “if Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence” and suggested extending a ceasefire. In his surprise move, Putin said in televised comments while speaking to the Russian military’s chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov: “Today from 18:00 [15:00 GMT] to midnight Sunday [21:00 GMT on Sunday], the Russian side announces an Easter truce.” He added that the truce is based on “humanitarian considerations”. Putin said he assumed Ukraine would follow Russia’s example and said Kyiv’s actions during the ceasefire would show its readiness for a peaceful settlement. But the Russian president also told Gerasimov to ready troops to repel any violations of the truce by Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence posted on Telegram: “The ceasefire regime is being introduced for humanitarian purposes and will be observed by the Russian Joint Group of Troops, provided that it is mutually observed by the Kyiv regime”. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha countered that Putin’s word “cannot be trusted and we will look at actions, not words”. Sybiha added that Ukraine had “agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days” in March, which Russia rejected. “Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,” Sybiha continued on X. Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said this would be the first time Russia has suspended fire since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. “No doubt this decision would be positively received here and around the world. This move certainly gives hope to a lot of people, and the timing is also right as the Christian world is celebrating Easter these days,” she said. Putin’s announcement came a day after United States President Donald TrumpsaidWashington will “take a pass” on trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war if either Moscow or Kyiv makes it too difficult to end it. Last month, Putinagreedto halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets in Ukraine for 30 days after a phone call with Trump but stopped short of accepting a broader US-backed 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine has said it is ready to implement. According to Russian media reports, Putin on Saturday accused Ukraine of violating the truce on attacks on energy infrastructure more than 100 times but said the situation on the front lines has been favourable to Russia so far. Ukraine has also cited numerous violations by Russia in recent weeks. Putin said Moscow “has always been ready for negotiations” and welcomed the US, Chinese and other countries’ efforts to ensure a fair settlement on Ukraine. Hanna Shelest, security programmes director at the think tank Ukrainian Prism, told Al Jazeera that Putin’s latest truce announcement has to do with Trump’s comments on Friday. “For the Kremlin, the current US administration … is much more open to the demands of Moscow and more open than European partners,” she said. “So they [Kremlin officials] feel they can manipulate the White House much more than Berlin or London or Paris,” she added. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said people in Ukraine are looking at Putin’s announcement cynically. “Ukrainians will tell you that they agreed to a ceasefire more than 30 days ago and that Russia did not. Based on the responses we’ve seen from … MPs, civil and military officials and bloggers, everyone here feels this is simply a way for Vladimir Putin to carry out a publicity stunt and buy some time with the White House,” he said. “Ukrainians feel this is another example of Russia saying one thing and doing another,” he added. Russialaunchedeight missiles and 87 drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said on Saturday. Air defence units shot down 33 Russian drones, and another 36 drones were redirected by electronic warfare, the Ukrainian air force added. It gave no details on the missiles. Damage was recorded in five regions in the south, northeast and east, it said. Shelest noted that usually a ceasefire would be accepted very positively in Ukraine, but it is important to see the reality play out on the front lines. “Ukraine is ready and will try to have it [a ceasefire], but Ukraine has to be on high alert because previous experiences have demonstrated we cannot relax,” she said. In the meantime, the Russian Defence Ministry said Russia and Ukraine on Saturday conducted a swap of 246 prisoners each that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates. Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian service personnel had returned home from Russian captivity in the latest swap. The Russian former prisoners of war are in Belarus, where they were being provided with medical and psychological care, the ministry said. Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for mediating the exchange. He said a total of 4,552 Ukrainians – service personnel and civilians – had been returned since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022.",

    "title": "Israeli bombardment of Gaza kills 92 in two days: Health Ministry",
    "article_text": "Israeli attacks have killed 92 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over the past two days, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health. The attacks, which took place on April 17-19, have also left at least 219 people wounded and hospitalised, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday, with dozens more still trapped under the rubble or in areas that rescuers are unable to reach. The surge in bloodshed comes as Israel presses a six-week aid blockade and demands that Hamas disarm before any truce can be agreed. The armed group has flatly refused the demand and insists a permanent ceasefire must be part of any deal. At least 15 children, hit during an overnight air raid on tents in Khan Younis, were among the casualties, according to the statement. A raid on Rafah killed a mother and her daughter alongside two others, according to the European Hospital where their bodies were taken. “For the vast majority of civilians, nighttime is the time of horror and unrelenting pain,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from central Gaza. “Nobody is safe in their homes, in the makeshift tents, in displacement camps.” After restarting its military campaign on March 18 following a brief ceasefire, Israel has pledged to intensify its 18-month war on Gaza and occupy large “security zones” inside the Strip. Since March 2, it has also blocked the entry of food, fuel and aid into the enclave,defying an orderby the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that it must allow humanitarian access. Aid groups warn food is running out. “Kids are eating less than a meal a day and struggling to find their next meal,” said Bushra Khalidi, policy head of Oxfam. “Malnutrition and pockets of famine are definitely occurring in Gaza.” Earlier this week, Hamasrejected an Israeli proposalto pause fighting for 45 days if the Palestinian group releases 10 live captives and agrees to disarm. “The request to disarm Hamas is not acceptable to even hear,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said. “This is not just a red line. It is a million red lines.” Hamas has offered to free all remaining captives – believed to be about 58 although several are dead – in return for a permanent end to the war and the Israeli army’s full withdrawal. The death toll in Gaza has now reached 51,065, with 116,505 wounded, according to the Health Ministry. “We can see the very psychological toll in the city on the faces of everyone here, people are walking very exhausted, traumatised,” said Abu Azzoum. “They are thinking about the dark future that awaits them.”",

    "title": "Gaza had educational justice. Now the genocide has wiped that out, too",
    "article_text": "Palestinians have always been passionate about learning. During the Ottoman era, Palestinian students travelled to Istanbul, Cairo, and Beirut to pursue higher education. During the British Mandate, in the face of colonial policies aimed at keeping the local population ignorant, Palestinian farmers pooled their resources and established schools of their own in rural areas. Then came the Nakba, and the occupation and displacement brought new pain that elevated the Palestinian pursuit of education to an entirely different level. Education became a space where Palestinians could feel their presence, a space that enabled them to claim some of their rights and dream of a better future. Education became hope. In Gaza, instruction was one of the first social services established in refugee camps. Students would sit on the sand in front of a blackboard to learn. Communities did everything they could to ensure that all children had access to education, regardless of their level of destitution. The first institution of higher education in Gaza – the Islamic University – held its first lectures in tents; its founders did not wait for a building to be erected. I remember how, as a child, I would see the alleys of our neighbourhood every morning crowded with children heading to school. All families sent their children to school. When I reached university age, I saw the same scene: Crowds of students commuting together to their universities and colleges, dreaming of a bright future. This relentless pursuit of education, for decades, suddenly came to a halt in October 2023. The Israeli army did not just bomb schools and universities and burn books. It destroyed one of the most vital pillars of Palestinian education: Educational justice. Before the genocide, the education sector in Gaza was thriving. Despite the occupation and blockade, we had one of the highest literacy rates in the world, reaching 97 percent. The enrolment rate in secondary education was 90 percent, and the enrolment in higher education was 45 percent. One of the main reasons for this success was that education in Gaza was completely free in the primary and secondary stages. Government- and UNRWA-run schools were open to all Palestinian children, ensuring equal opportunities for everyone. Textbooks were distributed for free, and families received support to buy bags, notebooks, pens, and school uniforms. There were also many programmes sponsored by the Ministry of Education, UNRWA, and other institutions to support talented students in various fields, regardless of their economic status. Reading competitions, sports events, and technology programmes were organised regularly. At the university level, significant efforts were made to make higher education accessible. There was one government university which charged symbolic fees, seven private universities with moderate to high fees (depending on the college and major), and five university colleges with moderate fees. There was also a vocational college affiliated with UNRWA in Gaza that offered fully free education. The universities provided generous scholarships to outstanding and disadvantaged students. The Ministry of Education also offered internal and external scholarships in cooperation with several countries and international universities. There was a higher education loan fund to help cover tuition fees. Simply put, before the genocide in Gaza, education was accessible to all. Since October 2023, the Zionist war machine has systematically targeted schools, universities, and educational infrastructure. According to UN statistics, 496 out of 564 schools – nearly 88 percent – have been damaged or destroyed. In addition, all universities and colleges in Gaza have been destroyed. More than 645,000 students have been deprived of classrooms, and 90,000 university students have had their education disrupted. As the genocide continued, the Ministry of Education and universities tried to resume the educational process, with in-person classes for schoolchildren and online courses for university students. In displacement camps, tent schools were established, where young volunteers taught children for free. University professors used online teaching tools like Google Classroom, Zoom, WhatsApp groups, and Telegram channels. Despite these efforts, the absence of regular education created a significant gap in the educational process. The incessant bombardment and forced displacement orders issued by the Israeli occupation made attendance challenging. The lack of resources also meant that tent schools could not provide proper instruction. As a result, paid educational centres emerged, offering private lessons and individual attention to students. On average, a centre charges between $25 to $30 per subject per month, and with eight subjects, the monthly cost reaches $240 – an amount most families in Gaza cannot afford. In the higher education sector, cost also became prohibitive. After the first online semester, which was free, universities started requiring students to pay portions of their tuition fees to continue distance learning. Online education also requires a tablet or a computer, stable internet access, and electricity. Most students who lost their devices due to bombing or displacement cannot buy new ones because of the high prices. Access to stable internet and electricity at private “workspaces” can cost as much as $5 an hour. All of this has led many students to drop out due to their inability to pay. I, myself, could not complete the last semester of my degree. A year and a half of genocide was enough to destroy what took decades to build in Gaza: Educational justice. Previously, social class was not a barrier for students to continue their education, but today, the poor have been left behind. Very few families can continue educating all their children. Some families are forced to make difficult decisions: Sending older children to work to help fund the education of the younger ones, or giving the opportunity only to the most outstanding child to continue studying, and depriving the others. Then there are the extremely poor, who cannot send any of their children to school. For them, survival is the priority. During the genocide, this group has come to represent a large portion of society. The catastrophic economic situation has forced countless school-aged children to work instead of going to school, especially in families that lost their breadwinners. I see this painful reality every time I step out of my tent and walk around. The streets are full of children selling various goods; many are exploited by war profiteers to sell things like cigarettes for a meagre wage. Little children are forced to beg, chasing passersby and asking them for anything they can give. I feel unbearable pain when I see children, who just a year and a half ago were running to their schools, laughing and playing, now stand under the sun or in the cold selling or begging just to earn a few shekels to help their families get an inadequate meal. For Gaza’s students, education was never just about getting an academic certificate or an official paper. It was about optimism and courage, it was a form of resistance against the Israeli occupation, and a chance to lift their families out of poverty and improve their circumstances. Education was life and hope. Today, that hope has been killed and buried under the rubble by Israeli bombs. We now find ourselves in a dangerous situation, where the gap between the well-to-do and the poor is widening, where an entire generation’s ability to learn and think is being diminished, and where Palestinian society is at risk of losing its identity and its capacity to continue its struggle. What is happening in Gaza is not just a temporary educational crisis, but a deliberate campaign to destroy opportunities for equality and create an unbalanced society deprived of justice. We have reached a point where the architects of the ongoing genocide are confident in the success of their strategy of “voluntary transfer” – pushing Palestinians to such depths of despair that they choose to leave their land voluntarily. But the Palestinian people still refuse to let go of their land. They are persevering. Even the children, the most vulnerable, are not giving up. I often think of the words I overheard from a conversation between two child vendors during the last Eid. One said: “There is no joy in Eid.” The other one responded: “This is the best Eid. It’s enough that we’re in Gaza and we didn’t leave it as Netanyahu wanted.” Indeed, we are still in Gaza, we did not leave as Israel wants us to, and we will rebuild just as our ancestors and elders have.

    "title": "Palestinian government denounces settler threat to Al-Aqsa Mosque",
    "article_text": "The Palestinian government has expressed “extreme concern” over threats circulating among Israeli settler organisations to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates warned on Saturday of calls by Israelisettlerorganisations circulating on Hebrew-language social media platforms to attack and demolish the mosque and construct a temple in its place. The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem is Islam’s third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian identity. It is administered by Jordan, but access to the site itself is controlled by Israeli soldiers. It is also considered an important site by Jews, who believe it to be the site of the First and Second Temples, the latter destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. Earlier this week, an Al-generated video depicting the destruction of the mosque and construction of the “Third Temple” under the title “Next Year in Jerusalem” was published on the platforms. In a statement published on X, the ministry said it considers the posts on social media a “systematic incitement to escalate the targeting of Christian and Islamic holy sites in occupied Jerusalem”. “The Ministry calls on the international community and its relevant UN institutions to deal with this incitement with utmost seriousness, and to take the measures required by international law,” it said. Al-Aqsa has become a regular target of visits by right-wing Israeli politicians and Israeli settlers, who have stormed the compound on an almost weekly basis and performed religious rituals under the protection of Israeli forces. Under thedecades-old status quomaintained by Israeli authorities, Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the compound in occupied East Jerusalem during specified hours, but they are not permitted to pray there or display religious symbols. Last August, right-wing Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir caused outrage by saying he would build a Jewish synagogue at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to the Jews as the Temple Mount. Once considered a fringe movement, the campaign to build a“Third Temple”on Al-Aqsa is growing in Israel, and many Palestinians see parallels with what has happened in Hebron, where the Ibrahimi Mosque, also known as the Cave of the Patriarchs, was partitioned. Since taking office in December 2022, Ben-Gvir, as national security minister,has visited the holy siteat least six times, drawing severe condemnation.",

    "article_text": "At least 56 people are reported to have been killed as suspected nomadic cattle herders carried out twin attacks in centralNigeria‘s Benue State this week. The governor’s office sharply revised a previous toll of 17 Saturday. The number of dead could rise even further as search-and-rescue operations continue, a government spokesman said. Police spokesperson Anene Sewuese Catherine said in a statement on Friday that “a large number of suspected militia had invaded” a region ofBenue Stateovernight. The attack came amid a resurgence of deadly clashes between herders and farmers, a conflict that has killed hundreds over recent years. Security forces were deployed and as the assailants “were being repelled in the early hours of today, they shot sporadically at unsuspecting farmers” killing five farmers in Benue’s Ukum area. Police said a second attack took place in Logo, about 70km from the area of the first incident. “Unfortunately an unsuspected simultaneous attack was carried out” in a neighbouring locality, where 12 people were killed before police arrived, the police spokesperson said. The attacks came just two days after 11 people were killed in the Otukpo area of Benue, and barely a week after gunmen attacked villages and killed more than 50 people in neighbouring Plateau State. Since 2019, clashes between nomadic cattle herders and farming communities have killed more than 500 people in the region and forced 2.2 million to leave their homes, according to research firm SBM Intelligence. The clashes, mostly between Muslim Fulani herders and Christian farmers from the Berom and Irigwe ethnic groups, are often painted as ethnoreligious. However, analysts have said climate change and scarcity of pastoral land are pitting the farmers and herders against each other, irrespective of faith. The conflict has disrupted food supplies from north-central Nigeria, a significant agricultural area.",

    "title": "Ecuador accuses ‘bad losers’ of assassination plot against President Noboa",
    "article_text": "Ecuador has declared a state of “maximum alert” over an assassination plot against President Daniel Noboa. In a statement entitled “The revenge of the bad losers” issued early on Saturday, the Ministry of Government said “all security protocols have been activated” due to the threat emanating from “criminal organizations, in collusion with political groups defeated at the polls”. Noboa was re-elected earlier this month, promising to continue a crackdown on rampant cartel violence that plagues Ecuador. His opponent, Luisa Gonzalez, has continued to insist that the vote wasfraudulent. The statement follows the leak earlier this week of a military intelligence report that said assassins entering Ecuador from Mexico and other countries planned to carry out “terrorist attacks” against Noboa. The government statement alleges that “bad losers” from the recent April 13 election hired sicarios (hitmen) from Mexico and other countries in a bid to destabilise the government. “The state is on high alert. All security protocols have been activated, and the Armed Forces, the National Police, and intelligence agencies are working together,” it reads. Quoting intelligence sources, it reports “the plotting of an assassination, terrorist attacks, and street riots through violent demonstrations”. The plot targets “the life of the President of the Republic, state authorities, and public officials”, it said. Although not offering names, the statement appears to accuse the Citizen Revolution Movement (RC5) of which Gonzalez is leader and that is linked to former President Rafael Correa, of planning the attack. Media reports in Ecuador also suggested that support may have been forthcoming from foreign leaders including President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. Amid a diplomatic fallout that launched last year, Sheinbaum announced on Wednesday that Mexico would not restore diplomatic relations with Ecuador as long as Noboa remains in office. The Mexican leader had publicly supported Gonzalez in the election. The reported assassination plot comes amid a pattern of escalating violence in Ecuador, including the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio in 2023. Rampant violence by criminal gangs involved in trafficking from the world’s biggest cocaine producers, neighbouring Peru and Colombia, has also blighted the country. In the latest instance, at least 12 people were killed on Friday in an attack in the coastal province of Manabi as gunmen dressed in fake military uniforms opened fire on spectators at a cockfight. Noboa declared an “internal armed conflict” to combat drug gangs in January last year, reflecting the country’s ongoing struggle with organised crime. Alongside a promise to boost the country’s flagging economy, that was seen as key to helping him win re-election earlier this month. However, Gonzalez, who had entered the run-off vote following a tight first round in February and claimed “grotesque” fraud, said late on Wednesday that she plans to contest the results with the elections authority.",

    "title": "Is the US dollar at risk of a ‘confidence crisis’?",
    "article_text": "Amid the financial market fallout which followed Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2, the value of the US dollar has plunged. But while United States stock markets havelargely recoveredsince then, the greenback – which typically gains in value during periods of financial turbulence – has continued its downward trajectory. This is because theseverenature of Trump’s international trade policies has raised the possibility of a US recession later this year, denting demand for America’s currency. Trump’s tariff blitz is also forcing investors to confront the possibility that the dominance of the dollar might be fading, or even coming to an end. “The world is facing a dollar confidence crisis as the repercussions of ‘Liberation Day’ continue to reverberate,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. For close to a century, the US has been the world’s investment “safe haven”. Dozens of countries still maintain a peg to the greenback, meaning their currency prices are correlated. But investors are now starting to worry about the long-term safety of the dollar, and the consequences could be dramatic. On April 2, the Trump administration unveiled punishing tariffs on imports from dozens of countries around the world, denting confidence in the world’s largest economy and causing a selloff of US financial assets. More than $5 trillion was erased from the value of the benchmark S&P 500 index of shares in the three days after “Liberation Day”. US Treasuries – long considered the archetypical safe investment – also sawselloffs, lowering their price and sending debt costs for the US government sharply higher. Faced with a revolt in the financial markets, Trump announced a90-day pauseon tariffs, except for exports fromChina, on April 9. But investors remain wary about holding dollar-linked assets. So far in April, the dollar has fallen by 3 percent relative to a basket of other currencies to reach its lowest level in three years, compounding an almost 10 percent slide since the start of 2025. “Investors have been selling US assets, and the value of the dollar has fallen,” Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin told Al Jazeera. “But the dollar hasn’t gone up as much [as US equity prices since April 9] because there’s been a loss of trust in US economic policymaking,” he added. For the past 80 years, the US dollar has held the status of primary reserve currency – foreign currencies held in significant quantities by the world’s monetary authorities. In large part, the dollar emerged as the commanding global currency due to the first and second world wars. As Europe and Japan descended into chaos, the US was making money. Then, in 1971, when Richard Nixon de-linked gold from the value of the US dollar, the greenback’s role in supporting the global financial system grew. So did its demand. Following the “Nixon shock”, most countries abandoned gold convertibility but didn’t adopt market-determined exchange rates. Instead, they pegged their currencies to the dollar. Owing to its dominance in trade and finance, the dollar became the standard currency anchor. In the 1980s, for instance, many Gulf countries began pegging their currencies to the greenback. Its influence didn’t stop there. While the US only accounts for one-quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP), 54 percent of world exports were denominated in dollars in 2023, according to theAtlantic Council. Its dominance in finance is even greater. About 60 per cent of all bank deposits are denominated in dollars, while nearly 70 percent of international bonds are quoted in the US currency. Meanwhile, 57 percent of the world’s foreign currency reserves – assets held by central banks around the world  – are held in dollars, according to theIMF. But the dollar’s reserve status is largely supported by confidence in the US economy, its financial markets and its legal system. Trump is changing that. “He doesn’t care about international norms,” said Junius, and “investors are beginning to realise they’re over-exposed to US assets.” Indeed, foreigners own $19 trillion of US equities, $7 trillion of US Treasuries and $5 trillion of US corporate bonds, according to Apollo Asset Management. That’s roughly 30 percent of global GDP. If even some of these investors start to trim their positions, the dollar’s value could come under sustained pressure. Many in the Trump team argue that the costs of the US dollar’s reserve status outweigh the benefits by making it overvalued – raising the cost of US exports. Stephen Miran, chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, recentlysaidthat high dollar valuations place “undue burdens on our firms and workers, making their products and labour uncompetitive on the global stage”. “The dollar’s overvaluation has been one factor contributing to the US’s loss of competitiveness over the years, and… tariffs are a reaction to this unpleasant reality,” he added. At first blush, a lower dollar would make US goods cheaper to overseas buyers, supporting domestic manufacturing and helping to reduce the country’s trade deficits. “It will also make imports more expensive, hurting consumers,” Colombia’s former finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo told Al Jazeera. “The general view is that US inflation will increase. “Elsewhere, the price of gold has also gone up,” Ocampo said. “It seems there’s a growing preference among central banks to hold gold instead of US Treasuries.” Ocampo said that he also thinks that confidence in the dollar has taken a hit as a result of Trump’s tariff announcements and that its selloff has been offset by gains for other safe-haven currencies. On April 11, the euro hit a three-year high above $1.14 and has gained more than 5 percent on the dollar since the start of the month. “For now, I think the dollar will remain the dominant global currency,” said Ocampo. But he also said that by weakening the US’s economic foundations, Trump is undermining global dollar dominance. For his part, Ocampo mentioned two currencies that stand to benefit. “We’ve seen inflows into the Swiss franc recently. But the euro is the real alternative to the dollar,” he said. The euro currently makes up 20 percent of international foreign exchange reserves – one-third of the dollar amount. “If the EU can agree on closer fiscal union and, crucially, more integration across its financial markets, it will be the currency that could take on the mantle,” Ocampo said.",

    "title": "Memphis beats Dallas to face top-seeded Oklahoma City in the NBA playoffs",
    "article_text": "Ja Morant shrugged off a sprained right ankle to score 22 points and add nine assists and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Dallas Mavericks 120-106 on Friday night to advance to the NBA playoffs. Memphis secured the Western Conference’s eighth seed and will open against top-seeded Oklahoma City in a best-of-seven series beginning Sunday on the Thunder’s home court. Morant was injured Tuesday night at Golden State in the Grizzlies’ play-in opener and was questionable to play Friday. “The doctors gave me all the help I needed in the simplest terms,” said Morant, whose availability wasn’t certain until about 30 minutes before tip-off. “I wanted to be on the floor. I wanted to play this game and get the win.” Jaren Jackson Jr led Memphis with 24 points, and Desmond Bane had 22. Anthony Davis led Dallas with 40 points and nine rebounds. Klay Thompson had 18 points. Davis limped off in the fourth quarter with what appeared to be a right calf injury. He returned briefly but didn’t finish the game. He sat in the locker room after the game with a wrap and an ice bag on the leg. Davis said he tried to fight through the injury, knowing it was a win or go-home situation. “We had our chances. Obviously, a tough loss,” Davis said. Memphis saw a 25-point first-half lead melting away in the third quarter as the Mavericks crafted a 27-12 run spanning halftime. That brought the Mavericks’ deficit to single digits midway through the third. The Grizzlies stretched the lead back to 96-80 heading into the final quarter and Dallas never threatened the rest of the way. Dallas, which beat Sacramento 120-106 on Wednesday night to earn a spot against the Grizzlies, didn’t seem to have the same spark to start the game, never leading against Memphis. Zach Edey had 15 points and 11 rebounds for Memphis, and Scotty Pippen Jr scored 13 points. Memphis lost all four games against Oklahoma City during the regular season, all by double digits. Jackson said the Grizzlies are looking at a different situation in the first round. “A series is a series,” Jackson said. “You’ve got to stay level-headed. Whether you win a game or lose a game, it really doesn’t matter until it’s over.” Like Memphis, the Mavericks limped into the end of the season, going 7-15 since March 1. Amid it all, they also lost Kyrie Irving to left knee surgery after dealing with a trade that brought Davis to Dallas and sent Luka Doncic to the Lakers. “An incredible season, but the change (trading Doncic for AD) and injuries, some would say we shouldn’t even be there,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “So give those guys in that locker room a lot of credit.” Through the first half of Miami’s NBA Play-In Tournament elimination game at Atlanta, Heat backup guard Davion Mitchell did not look a contender to finish as a star of the game. Mitchell missed each of his four shots in the first half and had only one point. At the end of regulation, he still had only seven points. Then something clicked for Mitchell. After the Heat entered overtime tied with Atlanta at 106, Mitchell made three of four shots – all 3-pointers – in the extra period to help lead Miami to a win on Friday night. Mitchell finished with 16 points and helped Miami advance to the playoffs, where it will face Cleveland, the No 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Heat became the first No 10 seed in either conference to make the playoffs since the current play-in format was launched in the 2020-21 season. Miami also became the first play-in team to advance with two road wins. Tyler Herro added two 3s in overtime to lead Miami with 30 points. Herro’s scoring lead was expected. Mitchell’s starring role was a surprise. He warmed up for the extra period by making a 3-pointer in the fourth quarter. “For him to struggle like that in the first half and have that kind of fourth quarter and overtime really speaks to his character,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said of Mitchell. Mitchell said the support of Spoelstra and his teammates helped give him the confidence to keep shooting, especially in overtime. “I feel I was forcing it in the first half, trying to do too much,” Mitchell said. “I just kind of re-set in my mind … and let the game come to me. … I just believe in the work I’ve put in. Even if I’m missing shots, it’s OK.” Mitchell averaged 7.9 points, but scored 15, making each of his two 3-pointers, in Miami’s at Chicago on Wednesday night in its first Play-In Tournament win. Mitchell’s big game against the Hawks came in his return to his home state. Mitchell was born in Hinesville, Georgia, and began his college career at Auburn before transferring to Baylor. He helped Baylor win its first NCAA championship. Mitchell began his NBA career in Sacramento and was acquired by Miami from Toronto in a five-team trade on February 6 that sent Jimmy Butler to Golden State.",

    "title": "Tunisian court hands opposition figures lengthy jail terms",
    "article_text": "Dozens of opposition figures in Tunisia have been handed lengthy prison terms on national security charges, according to state media. A number of the North African country’s most senior opposition politicians were among 40 people sentenced on Saturday, including a former justice minister and diplomats. Critics insist the chargesare trumped upand say they are symbolic of President Kais Saied’s authoritarian rule. The TAP state news agency, quoting an unnamed judicial official, reported that the sentences ranged from 13 to 66 years. An official from the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office was quoted by Jawhara FM as saying the defendants were found guilty of “conspiracy against state security”, and “belonging to a terrorist group”, including liaising with “foreign powers” to undermineSaied’s rule. The precise details of the trial remain cloudy, with the exact number of those on trial and the specific charges they face unclear. It was not immediately clear either on Saturday whether all of the estimated 40 defendants in the case, which has become known as the “conspiracy case” and been running for two years or so, were found guilty and given prison terms. About 20, many of whom have fled Tunisia, were sentenced in absentia, including the French intellectual, Bernard-Henri Levy, who is accused of being a conduit between defendants and foreign parties. “President Saied has weaponised Tunisia’s judicial system to go after political opponents and dissidents, throwing people in arbitrary detention on flimsy evidence and pursuing them with abusive prosecutions,” Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch,told Al Jazeera earlier this month. On Friday evening, defence lawyers denounced the trial after the judge finished reading the accusations and began deliberation without hearing from either the prosecution or the defence. “In my entire life, I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said lawyer Ahmed Souab. Authorities have accused the defendants, who also include the former head of intelligence, Kamel Guizani, as well as media figures, of attempting to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied. A number of the defendants – including Issam Chebbi, Ghazi Chaouachi,Said Ferjaniand Jawhar Ben Mubarak – have been in custody since being detained in 2023. Chebbi is a member of the opposition National Salvation Front coalition. “The authorities want to criminalise the opposition,” Chebbi said on Friday. Saied rejects accusations that he is a dictator. He said in 2023 that the accused politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that any judge who would acquit them would be an accomplice. Saied consolidated his power in 2021 by dissolving the parliament and sacking the then-prime minister. The opposition leaders involved in the case accused him of staging a “coup”. They say the charges against them were fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule. Some of Tunisia’s most prominent opposition leaders are already in prison. Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahdha, was arrested in April 2023 and sentenced to one year in prison on charges of incitement. Earlier this year, he was handed a further 22-yearsentenceon charges that included plotting against state security. He was also sentenced to three years for accusations that his party received foreign contributions.",

    "title": "Could an earthquake shift the balance in Myanmar’s civil war?",
    "article_text": "Bangkok, Thailand– As Myanmar slowly recovers from the magnitude 7.7 earthquake that killed thousands in March, an even greater catastrophe continues to shape the nation’s future – this one man-made. Myanmar remains gripped by a civil war and after four years of fighting the military regime finds itselfincreasingly encircled. But the impact of the earthquake could prove decisive for the conflict in the coming year. Striking in Myanmar’s central Sagaing Region on March 28, thequake killed at least 3,649 people, with more than 5,000 injured and 145 still missing, according to figures from the military government. The seismic shock flattened houses, factories, Buddhist pagodas, apartment blocks and brought down bridges and ripped up roads in Sagaing city and nearby Mandalay. It also disrupted electricity supplies to factories producing munitions for the military, said Tin Lin Aung, a former major in Myanmar’s army who defected to the resistance movement in 2022. In a clear sign that military supplies are stretched, bullet and artillery casings recently captured from government forces bear this year’s manufacturing date, Tin Lin Aung said. “When I was in the military, we used to joke that some of the bullets were older than us,” he said. “Now they are being used straight away,” he said. The reported interruption to the military’s ammunition production comes as areas the army still controls in Myanmar are surrounded on almost all sides by longstanding ethnic armed groups and newer armed opposition forces. Despite this, the military maintains an iron grip on the country’s major cities and core critical infrastructure. Hemmed into urban strongholds, the military has tried to reverse its losses through indiscriminate air strikes and burning villages in rural areas – a campaign the United Nations suspects involves war crimes. Sagaing city was devastated by the quake and it remains under military control, while much of the surrounding countryside is governed by a patchwork of resistance militias – such as the People’s Defence Force (PDF) – which are loosely coordinated by the opposition National Unity Government (NUG). The NUG declared a truce in earthquake-affected areas until April 20, except for “defensive operations”, yet the military’soperations have continued. According to the NUG, the Myanmar military’s aerial and artillery attacks killed at least 72 civilians between the quake striking on March 28 until April 8. Two more civilians, including a 13-year-old girl, died from bombing by military aircraft on April 10, the Myanmar Now news outlet reports. A Sagaing-based PDF fighter who requested anonymity said some rebel units had pivoted to relief efforts in central Myanmar even though their military adversaries were taking advantage of the lull in battle. “Since the quake, the military has used the Sagaing-Monywa road more confidently because of the truce,” she said. But PDF forces in Sagaing expect fighting to intensify after the April truce is over. “The PDF has more momentum than the military here,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that the NUG is now “coordinating better with ethnic armed organisations”. “There will be more fighting in coming months,” said Ko Ko Gyi of the Sagaing PDF’s Battalion 3. Regional security analyst Anthony Davis said he doubted the earthquake would distract the military from its strategic objectives, adding that most soldiers had stayed in their garrisons rather than help with relief efforts. “The military isn’t taking time off to save people. They’ll keep up the air strikes and, where possible, launch ground offensives to weaken the PDF,” Davis said. But it is western Rakhine State – largely spared from the earthquake – that is still the most consequential battleground currently, he said. There, the rebel Arakan Army (AA) has clashed with the military’s forces around the state capital Sittwe and Kyaukphyu, the site of a key pipeline that transports gas from across Myanmar to China. The AA has simultaneously pushed out of its home territory in the west of the country and into Myanmar’s central heartlands in Magwe, Bago and Ayeyarwady regions, Davis said. “They are the swing player who can significantly move this conflict one way or another,” he added. Commanding an estimated 40,000 soldiers, the AA has a proven record of defeating the military regime’s forces. In eastern Myanmar’s Kayah State, a senior resistance commander said the earthquake had underscored the suffering of displaced communities who “bear the brunt of the ongoing wars”. “The side who’s willing to care for the people can sway public opinion and will succeed in the coming battles,” he said. In the north and northwest, the military is on the back foot. The Kachin Independence Army captured Indaw town in the northern Sagaing Region on April 7 after an eight-month siege, despite declaring its own post-quake truce. Chin resistance forces recently gained control ofFalam township in western Myanmar– though they had not announced any ceasefire. Political analyst Kyaw Hsan Hlaing said the military is still grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake and that may create openings for the AA and others to seize more towns. “However, any such gains would likely be incremental, as the military’s longstanding control and ability to adapt, especially in regions like Bago and Magwe, even under crisis conditions remain significant,” he said. “In the long term, the earthquake is unlikely to fundamentally shift the balance of power in Myanmar,” he said. While the earthquake has not dealt a decisive blow to military rule, the quake has delivered a psychicshock to the regime’s generals. In a country where astrology and superstition guide the highest political decisions, many interpret the natural disaster as a cosmic rebuke against Myanmar’s military leadership. “They see this earthquake as divine intervention – punishment for the mistakes of the king. From what I hear, they are not blaming him [regime leader Min Aung Hlaing] directly. But there are questions about his leadership and capacity,” said former major Tin Lin Aung, who still maintains contacts within the secretive military establishment. According to Tin Lin Aung, the regime has ordered civil servants nationwide to recite a protective Buddhist chant nine times daily for nine consecutive days. The number nine has auspicious symbolism in Buddhist tradition. He also described growing confusion within the ranks over the regime’s response to the earthquake – appealing for international aid and assistance, declaring a truce, while also continuing its attacks. “They know the people hate them more and more, and their leader seems lost,” he said. Richard Horsey, senior Myanmar adviser at the International Crisis Group, said even if Myanmar military’s commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing dismisses these supernatural interpretations, the fact that his inner circle takes them seriously creates real vulnerability. Instead of causing an internal coup, he suggested the quake as a bad omen would more likely signal the erosion of Min Aung Hlaing’s authority and the rise of open criticism. “You go from there to people feeling they can just ignore his orders and do their own thing because everyone else agrees with them, not him,” he said. Political analyst Kyaw Hsan Hlaing said some sources suggest that beliefs in the quake as a portent of collapse for military rule may be used to push the narrative that the regime needs to “act decisively to regain control”. Superstition is just one of many factors shaping the military’s decisions in the conflict, he added. The earthquake has also “done enormous damage to the basic fabric of Myanmar,” Horsey said, noting that Mandalay’s residents are potentially facing relocation due to extensive housing damage. Given the scale of the quake, it would likely affect the civil war – “but in ways that are hard to predict”, he said. Criticised for its ineffectual and disinterested response to earthquake victims, along with continued attacks at a time of national emergency, the military’s poor reputation has plummeted even further in the eyes of the people and its adversaries. The powerful ethnic armed groups involved in the conflict will probably be even more unwilling to negotiate for peace with the military following the quake, Horsey said. “Even if you could get a spirit of compromise, which seems not to exist”, few would believe the military’s sincerity in adhering to any peace deal or ceasefire document. “Who would believe that piece of paper,” Horsey said, when it is signed by a military that is considered “so illegitimate and so incompetent.”",

    "title": "US Supreme Court orders temporary halt to deportations under antique law",
    "article_text": "The United States Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt on the deportation of two Venezuelan men using the antique wartime law invoked previously by the administration ofPresident Donald Trumpto send hundreds of people to El Salvador. The country’s top court issued the order to pause the deportation of the men in immigration custody early on Saturday, after their lawyers filed an urgent petition citing an imminent risk of removal without due process. The ruling sets up the possibility of another challenge by the Trump administration to the power of the courts, and evena full-blown constitutional crisis. “The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the justices wrote in an unsigned order. Two of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented from the decision. The court issued the ruling following an emergency appeal filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Trump’s use of the wartime legislation, last used during World War II, to deport alleged members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang by claiming they are “conducting irregular warfare” in the US has prompted a vigorous debate over the constitution’s ability to rein in executive power. The Supreme Court had said in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals. “We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email to The Associated Press. The White House has not yet commented on the ruling. Two federal judges had refused to intervene to stop the latest deportation proceedings, and the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to act, prompting the ACLU to file a petition directly with the Supreme Court. According to the ACLU, some of the men had already been loaded onto buses and were told they were to be deported. During a hearing on Friday, a government lawyer had said he was unaware of plans by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deport the men that day, but there could be deportations on Saturday. “I’ve spoken with DHS. They are not aware of any current plans for flights tomorrow, but I have also been told to say they reserve the right to remove people tomorrow,” Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign told a district court in a separate but related case. In March, the Trump administrationdeported 238 alleged Venezuelan gang membersand 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The deportations took place despite a US federal judge granting a temporary suspension of the expulsions. Among those deported was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of the US State of Maryland, who had secured a protection order preventing the process from going ahead. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it had wrongly deported Garcia, but has refused to abide by a separate Supreme Court order to return him to the US. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who met with Garcia in El Salvador on Thursday, said as he returned to the US that it’s “very clear that the president” is “blatantly, flagrantly … defying the order from the Supreme Court”. “This case is not only about one man, as important as that is. It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America,” Van Hollen said.",

    "article_text": "Humans took the lead over robots and kept it easily as they raced to victory at Beijing’s Yizhuang half-marathon. Thousands of runners joined 21 humanoid robot rivals in a world-first 21km (13 miles, 352 yards) challenge in the Chinese capital on Saturday. But not every bot was up to the task. One collapsed moments after the starting gun and lay motionless for minutes before regaining its feet. Another slammed into a barrier after only a few strides, taking its handler down with it. Some machines made it to the finish line but still trailed the humans badly. Tiangong Ultra, developed by the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, clocked a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men’s winner finished more than an hour earlier. “Generally, these are interesting demonstrations,” said Alan Fern, a robotics professor at Oregon State University, “but they don’t demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence.” “The robots are running very well, very stable… I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said He Sishu, a local AI engineer watching from the sidelines. Though technically in the race, the robots weren’t exactly autonomous athletes. Each one came with a team of engineers, and some needed physical support to stay upright. Chinese firms like DroidVP and Noetix Robotics fielded bots of all shapes and sizes, with a few even donning boxing gloves and headbands. Officials likened the event more to motorsport than a traditional race. Tang Jian, CTO at Tiangong’s lab, said they plan to shift focus to real-world tasks: “A focus going forward will be industrial applications … so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.”",

    "title": "‘I always come here’: The Indian tea shop that runs on trust",
    "article_text": "Serampore, India –It is a warm morning in March, and 65-year-old Ashish Bandopadhyay has cycled the 10 minutes from his home to a tea shop in the Chatra neighbourhood of Serampore, about 30km (19 miles) from Kolkata. Dressed in a pastel pink polo shirt, Ashish takes charge of the shop, declaring it’s his “turn” to run it today. “I don’t work here,” he explains with a smile while tearing open a packet of milk as he prepares to brew a fresh pot of cha (the Bengali word for tea). “I’m just an old-timer and a customer who loves volunteering.” Located in the old part of the town, this hole-in-the-wall shop is locally known as Naresh Shomer cha er dokaan (Naresh Shome’s tea shop). In India, the process of preparing and sharing tea forms an important part of social bonds. And that is what this tea shop is all about. For a century, it has been a space for relaxation, conversation and shared moments. But it takes the social bond one step further: customers not only drink tea but also brew and serve it. Ashish, who has now retired from his office job with a construction company, has been visiting this tea shop since he was 10 years old. It is where he meets friends to catch up over a cup of tea. Each weekday morning, 60-year-old owner Ashok Chakroborty opens the shop and then leaves for his office job. “One of us takes control of running the shop till the time he returns in the evening. Today was my turn,” Ashish says. In all, there are 10 volunteers who take turns in the shop seven days a week. None are paid – most are volunteer-customers who, like Ashish, have retired and receive a pension from their former employers. Today, Ashish arrived at the shop at 9am and closed for lunch at noon. He reopened at 3pm. “If not every day, I prefer to stay here for the majority of the week. After my departure, another person steps into my role,” he says. There’s no fixed rota – “whoever is free does it,” Ashish explains. “We keep the cash in a wooden box on the shelf after using it to buy milk or sugar. And there hasn’t been a single day without a caretaker.” Little has changed in the 100 years the five-by-seven-foot tea shop has been going – “except for a few whitewashes and a ceiling repair”, Ashish notes. Despite the layers of paint, the walls are stained dark with soot and smoke from the coal-fired traditional clay stove. Tea is still served in clay cups as well as paper ones, with a refill costing just five rupees (approximately $0.06). The shop offers a modest tea menu with simple, straightforward options. Customers can choose from milk tea – with or without sugar – and black tea served plain or with lemon, or Kobiraji cha (black tea with spices). Jars of biscuits complete the shop’s offerings. Situated across from Chatra Kali Babu’s Crematorium, family members often come for tea after bidding farewell to loved ones. The shop was founded by Naresh Chandra Shome, who worked for Brooke Bond, a tea company that traces its roots to the colonial era in India. All Ashok, the current owner, knows about Shome from that period is that he left his job to become a freedom fighter. Following India’s independence from British rule in 1947, Shome joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and remained an active member until his death in 1995 at the age of 77. Throughout his life, his tea shop served as a gathering place where comrades would meet, sit and exchange ideas over cups of tea. Today, the tea shop sits next door to the local CPI(M) office. “Shome was a helpful man and was active in community service. His shop was well known then and now. There is a photo of him in the party office,” says Prashanto Mondal, 54, a regular customer at the tea shop. He recalls how he was first brought to the shop by a colleague during a lunch break 25 years ago. “There are many tea stalls in Serampore, but I always come here, almost daily, because of the shop’s unique atmosphere and sense of camaraderie,” the LPG gas delivery agent explains. After finishing his tea, Prashanto gets up to help Ashish refill the coal in the oven. Like Prashanto, most customers help with duties such as fetching milk from the nearby shop or filling water from the tap. “We have heard stories of Naresh Shome during his activist days,” says Ashish. “He would sometimes leave the shop abruptly for urgent community service or be taken by the police, always asking his customers to look after the shop. I believe this legacy has endured – customers naturally take responsibility for the tea shop in the owner’s absence – the test of time.” In about 1925, Shome opened the tea shop on the ground floor of the building owned by his aunt. But before it was a gathering spot for tea drinkers and conversationalists, the 350-year-old building on the banks of the Hooghly River housed various types of shops, including one that sold utensils. Exposed wooden beams on the ceiling seem to bear the weight of history. The thick limestone walls stand as silent witnesses to the many Bengali, Danish and English people who’ve passed through over the years. The shop looks out towards Chatra ghat (steps leading down to the river), where Hindus have cremated their dead for generations. Now, a modern electric crematorium has taken the place of traditional wood pyres. The town of Serampore, home to about 200,000 people, predates the West Bengal capital of Kolkata by a few centuries and has been ruled at times by both the Danes and the British. The town was a Danish trading settlement named Frederiksnagore from 1755 to 1845, until the British took over, staying until independence in 1947. Once, horse-driven carriages transported European officers and their families along the streets. Today, the bylanes bustle with motorbikes, electric rickshaws and cars. European-style buildings stand alongside the tall apartment complexes built in more recent decades. Local restoration activist Mohit Ranadip explains that the tea shop holds an important position in the cultural history of Serampore. Ranadip is a member of the Serampore Heritage Restoration Initiative, a local citizen-led body dedicated to preserving and promoting the town’s heritage. “Adda and para culture are still very relevant in the [Chatra] locality and maybe that is the reason why the tea shop is still so popular,” he says. In West Bengal, para culture loosely refers to a neighbourhood or locality, defined by a strong sense of community. Each para inevitably has its adda spot – the corner of a street, park or, indeed, a tea shop. Adda is a beloved pastime that is unique to West Bengal. Markedly different from mere small talk or chatting, it is best described as an informal group conversation that’s long, fluid and relaxed in nature. A cup of cha invariably binds these gatherings together. In the Chatra neighbourhood, Naresh Shome’s tea shop is a focal point for this adda tradition, attracting people from all walks of life to converge and share their daily experiences over steaming cups of tea. Prashanto and his colleagues, Karthick and Amal, discussed the remaining gas cylinders they had to deliver by the end of the day. Some came on their own for a quick tea. The customers who dropped by in the evening were more relaxed, like Anima Kar, who came with her daughter to catch up with her brother. The state of West Bengal’s connection with tea also runs deep. About 600km north of Serampore, the tea industry took root in the hills of Darjeeling in the mid-19th century during the British Raj. The first commercial tea gardens were established in Darjeeling and the surrounding areas. The emerald green tea estates of Darjeeling still produce some of the world’s most expensive tea. At about 6pm, as evening sets in, Ashok returns from his clerical job. Wearing an olive green T-shirt, he takes over from Ashish, seamlessly continuing the shop’s daily rhythm. Ashok is the son-in-law of Lakhirani Dakhi, the owner of the building. He has been in charge of the shop since Shome’s death. “Today Ashish da (brother) gave me 400 rupees ($4.65) as the day’s income,” says Ashok, as he poured tea into clay cups. He says he has never faced any problems with customers not paying; without fail, they always leave the correct amount for tea in the cash box or return later to pay what they owe. “We sell around 200 cups most days,” he adds. “I love the tea with masala (spice mixture) made by Ashok da,” says 50-year-old Anima, who has been a customer for years. “If Kolkata has a coffee house where people meet for some quality time and adda, well, this tea shop is our humble equivalent.” Anima used to come with her father when she was a child and remembers Shome. Now, she sometimes visits with her family. “The tea shop remains an enduring symbol of tradition, community living and a love for tea. Every morning and evening, people are drawn not just by the tea, but by a profound sense of belonging and shared history,” Anima says. At 9pm, Ashok pours the last pot of tea for the four remaining customers and prepares to call it a day. In the past couple of years, he has started to worry about the future of his iconic shop. “I doubt whether the younger generation will carry forward this cherished legacy of trust. There are very few visitors from the younger generation who come and participate in the tea shop,” he says. His son, Ashok says, is an engineer and hasn’t shown much interest in the shop. Restoration activist Ranadip shares his concerns: “The younger generation is so busy that they have little time for adda, which seriously puts a question mark on the future of the shop like this.” Despite the shop’s uncertain future, Ashok remains hopeful that others will step forward to preserve it, just as previous generations have. “I choose to stay optimistic that the shop will continue its legacy, as it has for so many years,” Ashok says.",

    "title": "US judge rules Rumeysa Ozturk must be transferred from Louisiana to Vermont",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –A federal judge in the United States has ordered the government to transfer a pro-Palestine Turkish student,Rumeysa Ozturk, to Vermont for the court to assess legal challenges to her detention. In a ruling on Friday, District Court Judge William S Sessions found that Ozturk – who is currently held in Louisiana – has presented “significant evidence” to back the allegations that her detention violated her free speech and due process rights. Ozturkwas arrestedand had her visa revoked in March. Supporters say she was targeted over an op-ed she co-authored last year, criticising Tufts University for dismissing a student government resolution that called on the school to divest from Israeli companies. For these claims to be assessed, Sessions wrote, Ozturk’s case needs to be heard in court. “The Court concludes that this case will continue in this Court with Ms Ozturk physically present for the remainder of the proceedings,” he wrote. The judge gave the government until May 1 to transfer Ozturk and set a bond hearing on May 9 for her to argue for a temporary release. Ozturk was sent to a detention facility in Louisiana, in what critics say is part of a government effort to keep detainees away from their supporters and lawyers – and place them in conservative-leaning legal districts. The Tufts University student was arrested near her home in Massachusetts on March 30. Surveillance footage of the incident shows masked immigration officers, who did not identify themselves as law enforcement, approaching her on the street and grabbing her hands. Critics have described the incident asan abduction. Her student visa has been revoked as part of amassive crackdownby President Donald Trump’s administration on foreign students who have protested or criticised Israel’s war on Gaza. Sessions confirmed that the only identifiable evidence that the US government is using to detain and deport Ozturk is the op-ed. “Her evidence supports her argument that the government’s motivation or purpose for her detention is to punish her for co-authoring an op-ed in a campus newspaper which criticized the Tufts University administration, and to chill the political speech of others,” Sessions said. “The government has so far offered no evidence to support an alternative, lawful motivation or purpose for Ms Ozturk’s detention.” He also stressed that theFirst Amendment, which protects free speech, “has long extended” to non-citizens living in the US. The case Sessions is overseeing is known as a habeas corpus petition. It challenges Ozturk’s detention, not the broader push to deport her. Deportation matters are reviewed through a separate system, where non-citizens bring their cases in front of an immigration judge who works within the executive branch. It is not a separate part of the government, as the independent judiciary is. Advocates say immigrationjudges often“rubber-stamp” the decisions of the executive branch under which they work. An immigration judge in Louisiana denied Ozturk’s release on bail earlier this week. Immigration cases can be appealed to a board of immigration appeals, an administrative body. As a last resort, immigrants can petition to bring their case in front of a court of appeals that is part of the regular judicial system. The Trump administration has been stressing that the law gives it leeway over immigration issues – and that, in turn, offers the presidency broad powers that supersede concerns about free speech and due process. To authorise the deportations, Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohas invoked a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that grants him the authority to remove non-citizens whom he deems to “have serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the US. But part of Friday’s ruling could have sweeping implications for Ozturk and other students facing deportation. Sessions dismissed the notion that detained immigrants can have their constitutional rights ignored because of an administrative process. The judge said the government is arguing that an immigration law “grants practically limitless, unreviewable power to detain individuals for weeks or months, even if the detention is patently unconstitutional”.",

    "article_text": "The restrictions are coming in new models, but existing Synology NAS systems won’t be affected. The restrictions are coming in new models, but existing Synology NAS systems won’t be affected. byWes Davis Synology is preparing to roll out new restrictions on third-party hard drives in its future network attached storage (NAS) devices later this year, the companyconfirmed toArs Technica.The changes could make it much harder to use third-party drives in Synology’s devices for typical use cases, like backing up household computers or as local media servers. The good news is that if you already own a Synology NAS, the company says the change won’t affect you. Synology says in an EUpress releasethat “starting with Plus Series models released in 2025,” only Synology-branded drives and those the company has certified to meet its specifications will “offer the full range of features and support.” According toArs, Synology plans to update its compatibility lists to reflect which third-party drives that it has certified. The new restrictions mean that without Synology-approved drives, you might not be able to do things like pool storage between disks or take advantage of drive lifespan analysis offered by the company’s software. The change doesn’t apply to Synology J- and- Value-series devices, and won’t affect consumer-grade Synology Plus devices that were released in 2024 and earlier. Nor will it affect hard drives that are migrated to this year’s devices from its existing NAS systems, according to Synology’s press release. As for why it’s making this change, a Synology spokesperson toldArs, “Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues.” The company says similar things in its press release, writing that the restrictions will “reduce compatibility issues and increase system reliability and performance.” Synology did not immediately respond toThe Verge’s request for comment. Restrictions like this are irritating. To Synology’s credit, it’s introducing them in a way that’s less egregious than something like a printer companyblocking third-party ink with a software update. But that doesn’t fix the fact that owners of its future NAS devices will have fewer choices — and therefore fewer chances to save money — when it comes to buying the drives to stick into them.

More protests against President Donald Trump are taking place today as part of “A National Day of Action”largely spearheadedby the decentralized 50501 movement. Events arescheduled in all 50 states, two weeks after millions of people attendedmore than 1,300 “Hands Off!” protestsacross the US and the world. This time,over 700 ralliesand community events are planned.Apost on the official 50501 websitedescribes some of the other efforts underway today: Yes, there are marches, rallies, and courthouse demonstrations. But there are alsodiaper drives, skill shares, free community meals, and teach-inshappening all over the country. This is intentional. Because real change doesn’t just come from loud chants — it comes fromdeep connections. “No one single march wins demands or ends injustice,” Ben Zinevich, an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition, which is participating in the protests,toldThe Washington Postyesterday, “It’s really about building a sustained movement that can show itself as a political force.” Today’s actions, like those earlier “Hands Off!” demonstrations, are broadly aimed against the actions of President Donald Trump since his inauguration in January. That includes the rapid dismantling of the US administrative state at the hands of Elon Musk’s DOGE, chaotic tariffs, and apparent defiance of court orders, includingone from the Supreme Court. Notably, today is the 250th anniversary of thefirst two major battlesat the start of the American Revolutionary War. People are generally posting about the protests under the same “#handsoff” hashtag that was used earlier in the month. Below are scenes from some of the most visible protest actions taking place today, starting with what looks like hundreds preparing for amarch from New York City’s Bryant Park: Protesters alsogathered in Chicago’s Daley Plaza: A large crowd showed up early this morning atPiatt Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, where protesters in the video below can be heard chanting “bring him home:” They seem to be referring to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration initially admitted was sent to an El Salvador prison by mistake.

If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to pull the trigger on theApple Watch Series 10, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better time than now. That’s because Apple’s latest flagship is on sale atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyright now in its 42mm base configuration starting at $299 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date. You can also purchase the 46mm model with Wi-Fi atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor just $329 ($100 off), which remains the best price we’ve seen for the larger configuration since its debut in September. The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s thinner and lighter than its predecessors, yet it charges faster and features the same fitness and wellness features.Read our review. Overall, the Series 10 is a relatively minor upgrade overthe Series 9— though, that’s not a bad thing. The last-gen model was an excellent smartwatch, and the Series 10 primarily builds upon it with a bigger, brighter wide-angle OLED display that makes reading texts and notifications that much easier. What’s more it does so without adding any unwanted bulk; in fact, the Series 10 is actually 10 percent thinner than the Series 9 and a whopping 30 percent thinner than the Apple Watch Ultra, ensuring it will likely never catch on your sleeves. As for other changes, the Series 10 charges significantly faster than the last-gen model, allowing your watch to go from zero to 80 percent in just 30 minutes. It features Apple’s newest S10 SiP (System in Package), as well asFDA-cleared sleep apnea detectionand a range of fitness-centric features. Some of those — such as the new Vitals app and the ability topause your Activity Rings— come courtesy ofwatchOS11 as opposed to the new hardware, though they’re welcome all the same.

Haste: Broken Worlds is a thrilling, high-speed roguelike. byJay Peters Haste: Broken Worldstakes the relaxing loop of sliding down and leaping off hills from iOS classicTiny Wingsand turns it into a thrilling, high-speed, and 3D roguelike. InHaste, you play as Zoe, a girl who typically delivers letters but has found herself mysteriously transported to the new worlds you run through. When I say run, I mean it: Zoecannonsthrough the game. Levels are filled with rolling hills, and your goal is to leap off the upslopes and land on the downslopes. The better your landings, the more you’ll increase your speed and build a boost meter that can be used for things like a burst forward or a grappling hook. You’re incentivized to keep your speed up. The faster you complete a level, the higher grade you’ll get; higher grades give you better bonuses of things like “sparks,” which you can use to buy items. Throughout the vibrant, procedurally generated levels, you’ll also have to avoid obstacles like rocks, giantSarlacc-like pits, and machines that shoot lasers and bullets at you. If you crash into an object, you’ll lose health and slow down. If you’re too slow, a crackling, damaging energy will sneak up behind you. If you run out of health, you’ll lose a life. Lose all your lives, and your run will end. There are some familiar roguelike mechanics inHaste, like a currency you can spend between runs to permanently improve things like your health and boost meters. During runs, you’ll also pick each stage on a map.Hastehas a great map feature that lets you pick some or all of your route in advance so that you can play a series of levels without interruption. It really helps with the momentum. When things are going well, it’s easy to reach an amazing flow state where you’re leaping from hills at breakneck speed, timing your landings and boosts, dodging obstacles in your path, and racing to the end of every level as fast as you can. But at the end of each zone (technically a “shard”), there’s a large boss — like a giant flying snake — and they were often total buzzkills. The boss levels force you to run through more open-ended zones instead of just blasting forward, and the game just isn’t as fun and feels tougher in the open environments. Thankfully, you can change the game’s difficulty level. The game’s storytelling messes up the flow, too. You’ll meet a bunch of characters, and while their personalities are fun and their character portraits are illustrated well, they often show up in lengthy, forced conversations between levels. For a game calledHaste, there are a lot of long chats! Those quibbles only detracted a little from how much I enjoyedHaste. At its best,Hastekeeps you on the edge of your seat as you leap up and down from hills and careen through worlds. But when the game changes pace, it can be frustrating. I just want to go fast.

    "article_text": "Google will fight to keep its Chrome browser in a search antitrust trial starting Monday, after losing an ad-tech suit. Google will fight to keep its Chrome browser in a search antitrust trial starting Monday, after losing an ad-tech suit. byLauren Feiner After half a decade fighting to keep its empire together, Google’s defenses are wearing thin. The company is facing a two-front war that could fundamentally reshape its business, and, the US Department of Justice argues, open new opportunities for its competitors. Last year a federal judge deemed Google an unlawful monopolist in the online search market, and this past week, a different judge declared it hadmonopolized the ad tech market, too. On Monday, it will face a new stage in that first battle: a three-week trial in Washington, DC to determine the appropriate remedies to restore competition to online search. Google has vowed to appeal both rulings, but it can’t do so until after it’s gone through remedies trials for each case, letting the DOJ argue for its breakup and other restraints. In court starting Monday, the government will make the case for forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser, share search data with competitors, keep the government abreast of new AI investments, and end exclusionary deals with browser and phone makers. In this and the coming ad-tech remedies trial, the judges may find that less extreme measures can address the harms they believe Google inflicted. But it’s still the greatest antitrust threat a major tech company has faced in the US for decades — since Microsoft’s landmark loss over its PC operating system monopoly 25 years ago. Outside the US, Google has incurred fines for anticompetition charges and had to make business changes to comply with international regulations. But none of these have approached what the DOJ is asking for. If the DOJ gets its way, Google and Apple could end one of the most lucrative partnerships in Silicon Valley, while rivals like Microsoft could get access to some of Google’s most valuable data. During the first phase of the US antitrust trials, known as the liability phase, Google was defiant in arguing that it has competed fairly to win users with its superior products. In this next phase, Google will be facing judges who have already determined that’s not the case — and Google will be forced to argue for simply limiting the penalties. The DOJ believes that serious measures are necessary to bust up Google’s search monopoly. Google’s exclusionary deals with Apple, it’s argued, made it exceedingly difficult for even quality competitors to break through. Owning Chrome lets Google control one of the major access points for search engines. And Google search’s popularity means users give it huge volumes of query data that competitors don’t have. The DOJ also wants to ensure any remedies imposed by the court are future-proof so Google can’t regain monopoly power later on. That’s why it’s included a focus on AI, which it worries could become a major search platform. The governmentbacked off of its requestfor Google to sell its AI investments after President Donald Trump took office, but itstill wants to requirethe company to notify the government about future investments in the space. The DOJ wants to ensure any remedies imposed by the court are future-proof The court will hear from Google executives involved in its Search, Android, and Chrome businesses, as well as executives from online search competitors like DuckDuckGo, Microsoft’s Bing, and Yahoo. AI executives from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity will weigh in as well. Witnesses last time testified about whether Google had taken anticompetitive moves in a definable market; this time the government will use them to argue for why its proposed fixes are important — while Google will argue they could break tools consumers enjoy. Virginia-based Judge Leonie Binkema has not yet set trial dates for the remedies proceedings in the ad tech case. But in the coming months, both sides will present their wishlists for changing how the company works. These remedies will likely be more straightforward than those in the Search case. Brinkema agreed with DOJ arguments that Google monopolizes markets through two illegally tied services: a publisher ad server known as DFP and its ad exchange AdX. (She agreed with Google on one count — that it did not have a monopoly in the market for its advertiser-side tools.) The government could reasonably seek to make Google split off one or both. That might feel less dramatic than a Chrome spin-off. But the ad market Google dominates underlies large parts of the internet economy — it’s where publishers can make money outside big social networks. And these publishers testified throughout the trial that they’re chafing under Google’s whims. Making that ecosystem more competitive could revitalize the open web. Mehta could rule by the end of the summer on search remedies. And Brinkema — who’s on a court that’s nicknamed the “rocket docket” for its comparatively speedy pace — could also possibly set a trial and make a ruling this year. But Google could push any tangible changes out for years. The company has vowed to appeal the decisions, a route that could take it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Trump’s DOJ could also decide to settle either case, although since several states are also tied into the lawsuits, they could pursue remedies themselves.Microsoft’s big antitrust loss, famously, didn’t result in a breakup. As George W. Bush’s administration took over the case in 2001, it settled for milder remedies. Even so, experts say thelandscape opened upfor new, innovative companies. One of those said to be one of the biggest beneficiaries? Google.

    "title": "Inside WWE’s divide-and-conquer YouTube strategy",
    "article_text": "WWE Vault has become a beloved nostalgia hub for fans who grew up on the company’s programming. Now it’s taking a similar approach for WCW (and soon ECW) content. WWE Vault has become a beloved nostalgia hub for fans who grew up on the company’s programming. Now it’s taking a similar approach for WCW (and soon ECW) content. byChris Welch With over 108 million subscribers,WWEhas truly colossal reach on YouTube. The company currently sits just behind PewDiePie at number 11 on the list ofmost-subscribed channelsacross the entire platform. When you’re at that level of popularity, there’s constant communication with YouTube about best practices, key viewership metrics, and the latest strategies for pulling in even more eyeballs. Last year, WWE decided to shake up (and split up) its YouTube strategy. The company introduced a new standalone channel calledWWE Vaultthat became the new destination for classic live events, full matches, and rare archival footage — much of which fans are seeing for the very first time. For a company with a fanbase that’s never universally happy withanything, the Vault became an instant hit. Scroll down to the comments of any video, and fans heap praise upon the channel. For some, it has filled the void that was left when WWE Network went dark after WWE and Peacock announced their streaming partnership several years ago. The Vault also helps the flagship channel stay focused on modern WWE programming as the company continues to do big business with stars like Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Gunther, and CM Punk. “The current product on our main channel seemed to be outpacing a lot of what we were doing from a historical perspective,” Steve Braband, who oversees WWE’s digital team, told me this week. “So a few of us sat around and said, ‘our historical content still means a lot to us on YouTube.’” Older programming still has its place on the main WWE channel; this month has featured a countdown of the 50 all-time greatestWrestleManiamatches as part of the run-up toWrestleMania 41in Las Vegas this weekend. But the majority of it now gets forked off to the Vault. “It’s fun to see the internet wrestling community kind of try and figure out who the admin of the Vault is,” Braband said. In reality, it’s a group effort that involves many longtime employees. “We have a ton of knowledge within the building of clips from years in the past and clips that we haven’t unearthed,” he told me. “As much as people want to believe it’s one person just clipping and posting the best video they could find off a server, there’s a whole cohesive digital strategy to it.” Being able to stream some of yesteryear’s best pay-per-views (now “premium live events” in WWE parlance) for free on YouTube without a Peacock subscription is nice, but it’s the unpolished, never-before-seen clips that have kept lifelong fans coming back and hitting the notification bell. Not all that long ago, it would’ve been unthinkable for WWE to pull back the curtain to this degree. Maybe you’d catch some raw, unrehearsed moments during a DVD documentary — but now they’re popping up weekly on the WWE Vault channel. Full matches easily still get the most views, but it’s these random segments that prove so addictive. Easily the highlight among them is the “Found Footage” series. WWE’s team of archivists, researchers, and video editors sift through the company’s vast library to find backstage gems, fan signings, and even footage from un-televised live events. “There’s been a few examples of content that was filmed from house shows, which in the past we wouldn’t have shown,” Braband said. “Now we’re a little more flexible with some of that unseen footage going out on Vault.” In the clip above, you’ll see wrestlers playing on an arcade cabinet in between takes forMonday Night Raw’s TV opening. At the end, Bret “Hitman” Hart very casually offers Jerry Lawler — his longtime rival in WWE lore — a hookup for Cavaliers / Celtics tickets. Even if you stopped watching WWE decades ago, these shots of nostalgia might reel you back in. The Vault also includes “The Story Of” compilations that pack entire feuds and storylines into single videos, which means viewers don’t have to hop between a playlist to see everything. “We have people that really, really like to do it,” Braband said of wading through all that footage. “It’s a good team of people led by Ryan Murphy and John Clapp utilizing both content research and ultimately our video editing teams. As much as people want to believe it’s one person just clipping and posting the best video they could find off a server, there’s a whole cohesive digital strategy to it.” Like WWE’s primary YouTube channel, some videos posted to the Vault will eventually disappear. But others are meant to be more evergreen. As John Cena continues his final year of in-ring action for the company, a collection like the one below is guaranteed to rack up views. “The edit is really raw and it’s not a full in and out of each moment,” Braband said. “So we’re hoping that sits on the channel for a while as Cena does this last run.” Encouraged by Vault’s success, WWE has recently launched a dedicated channel forWCW, the wrestling promotion that it famously spent decades competing against and eventually acquired. Soon there will be another for ECW and its extremely brutal events. “It’s a clear destination telling fans where to go,” Braband said of the strategy. For now, the recipe is largely the same with new matches and full events posted weekly. But eventually more original programming might weave its way into these split-off WWE channels as the company makes every effort to reach fans wherever they are.

    "title": "The creator of Papers, Please wants developers to make weirder, more personal games",
    "article_text": "For Lucas Pope, games have always been about ‘making something that I want to play.’ For Lucas Pope, games have always been about ‘making something that I want to play.’ byJay Peters Lucas Pope, the solo creator of games likePapers, PleaseandReturn of the Obra Dinn, received thePioneer Awardfrom the annual Game Developers Choice Awards this year. It’s a major achievement that puts him in a league with industry giants like Gabe Newell, Yu Suzuki, and Roberta Williams. “Now that I’m an official pioneer, I have some requests,” he said in hisbrief acceptance speech. “World peace, obviously. But for this crowd, I’d be happy if you kept making the kinds of unique off-beat, experimental, creative, and especially personal games that I love.” It was similar to something Pope had said to me earlier — especially the personal part. I had asked him what advice he might have for developers just starting out. “Make something personal, make it small, release on [Itch.io]. Try to find the people who like the same things you do and then make the things you enjoy.” “I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.” Games, for him, have always been about “making something that I want to play,” Pope said. WithPapers, Please, where you have to make tough decisions while working as an immigration inspector in a fictional country, “it was, ‘I want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.’ Nobody else really likes that, was my thinking. And then I made it and I found out, actually, lots of people like the same things I do.” That experience gave him the confidence to follow a similar path for his next game. “I’m just going to try that again. I’m going to make a game that doesn’t exist, that I wish I had and that I could play, and I’ll make that. And just based on faith, I’m going to hope that other people also like it,” he said. “If there’s something that you’re passionate about, then make a game about it.” That game turned out to beReturn of the Obra Dinn, where you’re an insurance inspector investigating deaths and mysteries on the namesake ship. Pope’s latest title isMars After Midnight, a game for the Playdate about screening aliens at a fictional Martian support center. It’s much sillier thanPapers, PleaseandObra Dinn; one scenario inMarsasks you to only admit aliens that fart. Ina blog postabout the game, Pope described it as “something my kids might like,” and he told me that while the kids know aboutPapers, PleaseandObra Dinn, they’re too young to play them because they’re M-rated. “That’s kind of why I wanted to makeMars. I wanted a game where they could just full-on play it and enjoy it.” Pope said they playedMars“dozens of times” and offered suggestions for some of the sessions in the game. As kids, they don’t have a lot of preconceived notions, he said, so while some of their ideas might have been “a little ridiculous,” he could see “the core of a really cool thing that I could munge it a little bit and get it in there.” He added, “I think about games a certain way, but the kids have no framing like that. So having kids does help me see how they play games.” As for what Pope wants to explore next? “When I could reflect onObra DinnandPapers, Please, I kind of realized [that] maybe I should be going back to 2D,” he said, noting thatMarsis “more or less” a 2D game, too. From a production and creativity standpoint, “it’s nice to work in 2D,” he said. “But as far as actual topics and mechanics and things like that, I’m working on a few things. Nothing that is ready for announcement, unfortunately.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. 7 Verge Score ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Surge pricing, the scourge of ridehailing, is evolving for the robotaxi era",
    "article_text": "Waymo and other robotaxi operators argue they need to charge higher fares to control demand. Are they risking public backlash? byDavid Zipper If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Waymo and other robotaxi operators argue they need to charge higher fares to control demand. Are they risking public backlash? byDavid Zipper If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. It’s a familiar frustration for ridehail users: you open the Uber or Lyft app, enter your destination, and discover that your intended trip costs several times more than expected. The culprit is surge pricing, one of ridehail’s most important and controversial innovations. Customers grumble about higher fares, but Uber and Lyft executives haveinsistedthat surge pricing benefits them by attracting additional drivers, which allows the companies to fulfill more trips and reduce wait times. That justification makes intuitive sense, but it raises an awkward question about robotaxis, which are expanding across the US, fromSan Jose, California, toWashington, DC. If surge pricing is intended to expand the driver pool, why is it now being used by companies with driverless vehicles? Waymo, which offers robotaxi trips in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix,charges surge pricingduring peak times, as didCruise, its now-defunct competitor. Assuming a robotaxi fleet is already fully deployed, higher fares cannot expand vehicle supply in the way they could for Uber or Lyft. Instead, riders simply need to pay extra, assuming they can afford to, or search for another way to travel. Surge pricing, one of ridehail’s defining features, may need a rethink for an autonomous era. Uberbegan experimentingwith surge pricing in 2012, and customers have been grumbling about it ever since. In 2014, one exasperated Aussie described the practice toMashableas “price gouging at its worst.” (Price gouging isbannedin many US states, but such laws typically kick in only during emergencies or natural disasters.) Screenshots of astronomical fares, like an$800 ride on New Year’s Eve in 2015, frequently went viral. Aware of the pushback, Uber and Lyftadjusted their app designsin recent years to conceal temporary price increases, but surge pricing (sometimes called “dynamic pricing”) has endured. Harry Campbell began driving for Uber a decade ago. He now runsThe Rideshare Guy, a publication devoted to ridehail, andThe Driverless Digest, focused on the robotaxi industry. “At Uber, their number one [key performance indicator] from basically day one has been reliability,” he told me. “When you open the app, they want you to see cars available within three to five minutes.” Given the vagaries of trip requests and driver availability, keeping wait times within that window is no easy task. Surge pricing may need a rethink for an autonomous era. Defenders of surge pricing argue that it convinces more drivers to work during times of high demand, which avoids lengthy wait times. “Surge pricing doesn’t just make rides more expensive,” James Surowieckiwrotein an article entitled “In Praise of Efficient Price Gouging” forMIT Tech Reviewin 2014. “It also expands the number of people who are actually able to get a ride.” The additional drivers allow fares to drift back toward normal levels. But this supply-side narrative has always omitted part of the story. “Surge pricing also tempers demand,” Campbell said. “When people see that their ride is more expensive, they may not take it.” By deterring some potential customers, surge pricing makes it easier to serve those who remain. Would-be customers who can’t stomach the higher price are left to figure out a Plan B. Voicing concerns about consumer protection, legislators in states likeMassachusetts,New York, andWashingtonhave proposed caps on temporary price hikes (and New Delhi, India, hasimposedone). Surge pricing has become a generally accepted aspect of ridehailing. And now it’s been adopted by Waymo, a company whose service is, apart from the empty driver’s seat, largely indistinguishable from Uber or Lyft. But while higher fares may convince part-time ridehail drivers to work during periods of high demand, surge pricing can do nothing to expand the tightly limited size of Waymo’s fleets. As of January, for example, the company operated onlyaround 100 vehiclesin Los Angeles. “I think Uber and Lyft have a very strong justification for using surge pricing that gets more drivers on the road and gets you home,” Campbell said. “Waymo doesn’t have a good justification. They just say, ‘Hey, we’re charging you more because a lot of people want rides, even though we literally cannot add more vehicles to the fleet.’” Surge pricing can’t attract additional robotaxi vehicles, but it does suppress rider demand, thereby narrowing the gap between requested and available trips during peak times. In an email, Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli wrote, “During busier times, temporarily increasing prices may help reduce demand and keep wait times reasonable for a good rider experience.” “Reasonable” is doing a lot of work there; Campbell shared ascreenshotof Waymo wait times hitting 24 minutes in Los Angeles, where he lives. “When people see that their ride is more expensive, they may not take it.” Still, surge pricing’s ability to at least temper demand is enough for Brad Templeton, a consultant and veteran of the self-driving industry, to deem it useful. “The societal benefit is that you have scarcity instead of shortages,” he said. “If you really need a trip, you can get it — it’s just really going to cost you.” He drew a comparison with airline tickets that cost more during popular travel times like Thanksgiving weekend. But Templeton acknowledged that surge pricing creates winners and losers, particularly if it cannot expand vehicle supply to soften price hikes. Those who can afford surge pricing will pay it; everyone else will have to find another way to travel — or forgo the trip entirely. “It does allocate more to the wealthy than the poor,” he said. “That may or may not match public goals” around fairness. This, after all, was the underlying critique of ridehail’s pioneering use of surge pricing, which the companies parried by noting how higher prices expand vehicle availability — something that Waymo and its ilk cannot claim. Such tensions could dissipate if the supply of robotaxi vehicles becomes more flexible in the future. There are several ways that might happen. In a Marchblog postand a recentepisodeof theAutonocastpodcast, mobility investor Reilly Brennan divided the on-demand trip market into “base load,” consisting of trips taken during periods of typical demand, and “peak load,” representing those requested when demand temporarily spikes. One future scenario involves a fixed fleet of full-time robotaxis providing requested trips when demand is normal, while surge pricing during peak times encourages human drivers to grab their keys, thereby expanding the supply of vehicles (and reducing customer wait times). Such an arrangement could appeal to ridehail companies, which benefit from the lower cost of operations during non-peak times, as well as robotaxi companies, which can tap human drivers to add vehicle capacity when they most need it. Therecently announced collaborationbetween Uber and Waymo in Austin suggests such a partnership may be plausible. “It does allocate more to the wealthy than the poor.” Brennan outlined another possibility that seems specific to Tesla: If the company’s promisedCybercabsbecome a reality (a big if) and its autonomous technology works reliably (ditto), the company could deploy its Cybercab fleet to fulfill base load demands while augmenting it during peak periods with personally-owned and self-driven Teslas, dispatched willingly by their owners when surge pricing hits a threshold of, say, $4 per mile. It’s a nice vision, but caution seems warranted given CEO Elon Musk’sfailuresto fulfill previous promises around self-driving tech. Templeton believes robotaxi companies could accommodate more trips with limited fleets during peak times by offering customers discounts if they split their trip with strangers. Although ridehail’s experiments with shared rides havefizzledin part due to a lack of privacy, robotaxis might have more success if they use partitions to physically separate passengers from one another. For now, at least, robotaxi companies like Waymo are free to charge whatever they like during peak periods, even though they can’t deploy additional vehicles to meet the higher demand. Templeton thinks that’s appropriate given the nascent stage of the robotaxi industry. “I think we should wait, watch, and learn,” he said.

    "title": "Supreme Court temporarily blocks new deportations under Alien Enemies Act",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 19, 2025 / 7:16 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The high court acted overnight following anemergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals. \"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\" \"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said. \"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post. On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported. The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order. The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act. In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law. Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly. \"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said. Mr. Trump invoked theAlien Enemies Act in Marchto order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S. The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status. Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges inColorado,New York and southern Texaspromptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state. Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet. But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said. Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing beforeDistrict Judge James E. Boasbergin Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport. With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday. \"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\" Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committedcriminal contemptby ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated. Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then. ICE said it would not comment on the litigation. Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there. Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in itsnotoriousmain prison.

    "title": "2 Pentagon officials fired amid sweeping leak investigation",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 19, 2025 / 6:37 PM EDT/ CBS News The week of turmoil affecting the Pentagon's inner circle continued Friday, when two political appointees suspended earlier this week were terminated, multiple officials told CBS News. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, ordered an investigation into unauthorized disclosures in March. His memo said the investigation would seek \"a complete record\" of leaks and use polygraph tests if necessary. The two now-fired officials are Hegseth's senior advisor Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick, the sources said. Both were put on administrative leave earlier this week pending the leak investigation,CBS News reported. Politico wasfirst to reporttheir termination. A third official, Colin Carroll, the chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also put on administrative leave this week amid the investigation. In a joint statement posted on X on Saturday, Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" by how their service with the department ended, calling the experience unconscionable. \"Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All three of us served our country honorably in uniform - for two of us, this included deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, based on our collective service, we understand the importance of information security and worked every day to protect it,\" the statement read. \"At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with,\" they said. Kasper is also under review as part of the probe, two sources said. A senior Defense official told CBS News on Saturday: \"At this time, no final senior staffing changes have been decided, and the secretary will make any future announcements on his own timetable.\" Officials have told CBS News there are discussions about suspending more officials in what appears to be a widespread investigation into leaks to news outlets. Kasper's memo was released the same day that the Pentagon vehemently denied billionaire Elon Musk was coming to the Pentagon for a classified briefing on war plans with China, but officials say the investigation is looking at more than just one story.

    "article_text": "When a group of Senate Democrats helpedpass a government funding billin March, it caused a major fissure within the party, with the base itching to fight the Trump administration even if it came at the cost of a shutdown. But just over a month later, President Donald Trump’s tariff policy has resulted in historic swings in the stock market and levels of economic uncertainty that are now landing squarely on his shoulders. And the Democrats who were criticized for keeping the government open are now feeling vindicated. “I was right,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, told NBC News of his vote to keep the government open. “I concluded, along with others, that a shutdown would actually further empower Trump and Musk to pursue what they’re doing,” King said. “We would have handed him a gift. Anything bad that happened to the economy would have been blamed on us.” The 10 Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance a six-month funding bill largely did so because of the uncertainty a government shutdown would bring, particularly in the face of the sweeping cuts being implemented by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Many Democrats feared that those federal workers who were sidelined during the lapse in funding would be targeted for firings as soon as the government was reopened, or that the reopening would be done in a piecemeal fashion, creating a chaotic and painful fight in Congress over which programs needed to be reinstated and which could wait. “We’d be deciding what we’re going to do with the shutdown or how we’re going to handle that,” Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told NBC News of what would have happened if they voted to block the funding bill. “The main reason why I felt very strongly that we wouldn’t have a shutdown is that by having a shutdown you basically ceded power to the president,” he said. Many of the Democrats who voted to avert a shutdown faced an outspoken group of activists, voters and fellow lawmakers who saw the funding bill as one of their only points of leverage. While Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, funding legislation still requires 60 votes in the Senate, giving Democrats the ability to block bills in protest. “I got my ass kicked in,” Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told NBC News. “How would that look right now, if the government would be on fire and closed for a month because of what we would have done?” “We would be owning that,” Fetterman said. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., added, “I think the decision vindicated itself.” “But I think it does point out one of the reasons that I explained to people who asked me about it was that if the economy went south, that the president would blame the Democrats, and that was not in anybody’s interest,” she said. But Democrats who voted to block the funding bill say they still feel their strategy was the right one. “I don’t think we should have supported that [continuing resolution], and I don’t think we should support a CR in the future unless it commits the administration to following the law,” Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told NBC News. “There’s no way I can vote to give them continued free rein to do that.” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who voted against the funding bill, said he found the vote to be particularly vexing, telling NBC News: “That was one of those votes where I voted the way I thought was the right vote, but I couldn’t tell you with certainty that I was confident I was right.” “I thought it was a very risky vote either way,” Welch said. “Our base, and rightly so, was demanding that we fight, and that was a moment where we had some leverage. On the other hand, the Schumer concern about what happened to the shutdown that Musk wanted was legitimate. There could have been an immense amount of additional damage.” And Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who was an outspoken advocate for blocking the GOP funding bill, expressed a desire to move on. “This is not about the rearview mirror. Nobody wants to relitigate what happened. It’s about what we’re going to do going forward,” Warren told NBC News. “Donald Trump has proven himself to be an even bigger threat to the American economy and to the worldwide economy than anyone had predicted.” No Democrat took more heat for voting to advance the GOP funding bill than Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who faced calls to step down as the party’s leader in the chamber. Voters at town halls across the country called for new leadership, and lawmakers like Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said “the American people are fed up with the old guard.” But Schumer remained defiant, arguing the vote was needed to keep the spotlight on Trump in the long term. “I think I made the right decision,” Schumer told NBC News in an interview. “We’re all united in looking forward, because they have shown how incompetent they are in just about every issue.” “The Republican Party is in shambles, it’s a mess. This last week has been terrible for them,” Schumer said, describing the effects Trump’s tariffs have had on the economy. But public criticism of Schumer after the government funding vote did not come from fellow Senate Democrats, and murmurs of a need for change at the top appear to have subsided in recent weeks. “I think he was correct in the decision that he made,” Shaheen said of Schumer’s support for advancing the bill. Even Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said Schumer’s support for the funding bill was “the noble thing,” noting that leadership on both sides of the aisle has to, at times, make difficult decisions. “I think of how many times John Thune and John Barrasso and Mitch McConnell took the arrows for people who didn’t have the guts to do it, but who were happy to trash them on their Twitter feed and use it for fundraising,” Cramer told NBC News. “I always thought that was noble of those that he had the guts to do it, and tragic for those that would use them as a pin cushion, and I thought the same for Chuck and his team when they did it on their side, it was unfair.” But while Cramer gave Schumer credit for voting to keep the government open, he also noted that political circumstances can quickly change. “Does [Schumer] look smart today? Well yeah, but Donald Trump might look really smart tomorrow,” he said.",

    "title": "Florida International University students are on edge over campus police's cooperation with ICE",
    "article_text": "MIAMI — After Florida International University’s police department entered into an agreement with the federal government to carry out immigration enforcement on campus, some students say they are terrified. “It’s scary and nerve-racking,” said an undergraduate at the university. The student, who's not being identified because he lacks legal immigration status, told NBC News he came to the U.S. when he was 5 with his family after they were threatened by gangs in their native El Salvador. He said he was very focused in middle school and high school and took many Advanced Placement classes, knowing he had to work harder to have a shot at college. Now, the student is not sure if he'll continue at FIU next year. For now, he said he’s avoiding certain parts of the university he considers risky. “I've been trying to not go to the main areas of campus where police are,” the student said. FIU is one of a number of universities in Florida that have signed agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the 287(g) program, which trains local law enforcement officers to interrogate immigrants and detain them for potential deportation. In addition to FIU, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida State University in Tallahassee, the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and the University of South Florida in Tampa have in place agreements with ICE. Florida is the state with the most local agencies signing 287(g) agreements, including all of Florida’s67 county sheriffs. Dozens of cities have signed on, including some with large immigrant populations like Hialeah, Miami Springs and West Miami. It's part of Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' sweeping immigration measures, which are aligned with President Donald Trump’s pledge to carry out the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. “Florida is setting the example for states in combating illegal immigration and working with the Trump administration to restore the rule of law,”DeSantis said in February about the agreements with ICE.“By allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed.” At FIU, whereover 63%of the student population is Hispanic or Latino, the cooperation has alarmed many. Early in the week, many FIU students on campus seemed unaware of the new collaboration with ICE, but among those at risk of deportation, the fear is palpable. Faculty and students have mobilized and held protests against FIU’s decision to collaborate with ICE. At a protest Tuesday, students held a banner that read “No ICE @FIU.” In an emailed statement, FIU said their police department “has signed a cooperation agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in compliance with Governor Ron DeSantis’ directive to law enforcement agencies.” ICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment. On Friday at a faculty senate session, professors issued a resolution asking FIU President Jeanette Nuñez and the campus police chief to withdraw from the agreement with ICE. Nuñez was DeSantis' former lieutenant governor who becameFIU’s acting presidentin February, following a board vote requested by the governor. After nearly four years as an undergraduate at FIU, a student said he was looking over his shoulder. The student requested anonymity because he lacks legal immigration status. He came with his parents from Central America when he was 9. “It feels like I’m being persecuted even though I haven’t done anything,” he said. “I feel more anxious. I don’t know why but I see more police on campus recently. I try to act normal and dress nice.” The student said that when he and other undocumented students found out about the collaboration, “everyone was scared. People cried. Everyone feels it’s unfair.” One FIU professor described the atmosphere as \"reminiscent\" of Latin American universities and what it was like in the Soviet Union. The professor's name is being withheld because they're not authorized to speak in areas outside their expertise. “This is how it used to be in Latin America. The government would look into the university to make sure that you were towing the line,” the professor said. “We’re going in that direction now.” “The campus police is here to protect students from crime. They are not supposed to enforce the policy of the federal government. Immigration policy is federal policy,” the professor said. The cooperation with ICE comes as the Trump administration has cracked down on some foreign students, revoking their visas and ordering them to leave the country immediately. At least 36 students in Florida have been stripped of their visas, 18 at FIU. The administration's actions are a stark departure from the policy set in place over a decade ago that restricted federal immigration agencies from carrying out immigration enforcement in sensitive locations like schools and churches. The Trump administrationended that guidancein January, making students on college campuses potential immigration enforcement targets. Universities in Florida have seen a number of changes under DeSantis. Teachingcritical race theoryhas been banned;centers to promotecenter-right ideas have been created; a recent lawlimits the contenttaught at public universities; and multiple faculty members have been terminated after the state adoptedpost-tenure reviewsof professors. The Dream.US, an organization that awards college scholarships to  \"Dreamers\" —  young adults who've been in the U.S. since they were very young but lack legal immigration status — announced it's withdrawing scholarships for hundreds of students in eight Florida universities. Gaby Pacheco, president of Dream.US, cited Florida's  decision to end in-state tuition for students without legal immigration status — which takes effect in July — as well as the universities' 286(g) agreements with ICE. “We do not feel our students will be safe on campus,\"Pacheco told the Miami Herald. Melissa Tavara and Katerin Crespo, both theater majors at FIU, said they worried about how the campus police will carry out their new duties as they walked across campus on a recent afternoon. Both are U.S. citizens but worry about racial profiling. “How else would you look for these students,” said Tavara. Crespo said, “This creates fear. It’s an international school. We are supposed to be a melting pot.”",

    "title": "Oklahoma wins seventh national gymnastics championship, besting multiple Olympic medalists",
    "article_text": "The Oklahoma Sooners may not have an Olympic medalist on their team, but in gymnastics, stuck landings never go out of style. The Sooners won their seventh national title at the NCAA gymnastics championships in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday. They narrowly edged out the UCLA Bruins, helmed by Olympic gold medalistJordan Chiles. Despite an indomitable performance from Chiles and her teammates, the Bruins claimed second place, finishing four tenths of a point behind Oklahoma. Missouri and Utah rounded out the top four. Oklahoma started their night on the balance beam, where nerves tend to creep in for even the most experienced teams. If they were jittery, it didn’t show — every score the Sooners counted on the beam was a 9.900 or above. UCLA mirrored Oklahoma’s early momentum, going lights-out on their best event, the floor exercise. Chiles anchored the Bruins with a near-perfect 9.975, tying Oklahoma after the first rotation. Five Olympians competed in Saturday’s final, including Chiles and her 2021 Olympic teammate Grace McCallum (Utah), Team Canada’s Brooklyn Moors (UCLA), Emma Malabuyo (UCLA) who represented the Philippines and Olympic bronze medalist Amelie Morgan of Great Britain (Utah). In the second and third rotations, Oklahoma accumulated a healthy buffer over the rest of the field. A hungry beam rotation from UCLA led to a tight race, but Oklahoma clinched the win with a stellar final rotation on the uneven bars. “Truly a fairytale ending,” Oklahoma’s Jordan Bowers said on the ABC broadcast. “Obviously, last year was a tough loss, but you have to grow from it and we have learned so much this season … This little girl when I was 13 committed here and I dreamed of moments like these.” Bowers also claimed the individual all-around title in Thursday’s competition. The biggest shock of the night came in the second rotation, when McCallum fell off the balance beam. The uncharacteristic error hampered the Utes’ quest to win their first national championship since 1995. Defending champion and No. 1 seedLSU failed to advanceout of Thursday’s semifinal, trailing UCLA and Utah. Missouri earned their first berth to the final in program history after a clutch beam routine from 5th-year Helen Hu, who also won the individual national title in that event. LSU’s freshman star Kailin Chio claimed the vault title and Chiles won the uneven bars, while her teammate Brooklyn Moors took home the floor exercise title. Chiles became the first Bruin to win two uneven bars national titles. Her Olympic teammate Jade Carey (Oregon State) was close to tying Bowers for the all-around title, but an imperfect landing on the vault kept her in fourth place. This year’s field offered one of the closest match-ups in recent years, with LSU missing the final four by two tenths of a point — a stuck landing away from advancing.",

    "title": "Annual Lyrid meteor shower peaks overnight Monday",
    "article_text": "It’s spring skywatching at its best: The annual Lyrid meteor shower is back, offering people across the Northern Hemisphere a chance to catch shooting stars in the night sky. The meteor shower began on April 16, but will reach its peak Monday night and into the early-morning hours of Tuesday. Weather permitting, skywatchers could see up to 15 shooting stars per hour during that period, as long as they’re in a dark location. The Lyrids are typically one of the year’s most reliablemeteor showers, and their timing coincides with more temperate spring temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere, making them a popular celestial show. This year’s peak occurs with a waning crescent moon that will be about 27% full,according to NASA, which means the shooting stars are less likely to be washed out by bright moonlight. In order to best enjoy the peak, NASA recommends watching outside from Monday night anytime after 10 p.m. local time until dawn the next morning, with a sweet spot at roughly 5 a.m. local time on Tuesday. But anytime late in the evening on Monday and before the moon rises overnight at around 3:30 a.m. local time should offer good chances to see meteors streaking across the night sky. The Lyrids are usually observed most clearly from the Northern Hemisphere, but eagle-eyed skywatchers in the Southern Hemisphere may be able to spot some shooting stars, according to NASA. If conditions are clear, it’s best to pick an unobstructed viewing location under the darkest possible skies, away from city lights and other forms of light pollution. Skywatchers should face roughly toward the east and look straight ahead. Meteors can streak from any point and the Lyrids are known to occasionally leave bright trails as they dart across the night sky. Meteor showers can be enjoyed without any special equipment, but experts suggest giving your eyes time to adjust to the dark, spending about 45 minutes without looking at cellphones or any bright points of light. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through bits of debris left over fromcometsor asteroids. As our planet orbits the sun and swings through these clouds of rocks and dust, the pieces vaporize in the atmosphere and appear as streaks of light in the sky. The Lyrids are caused by debris from a comet known asC/1861 G1, or Comet Thatcher, named for the amateur astronomer Alfred E. Thatcher, who first observed the comet in 1861. After its peak, the Lyrid meteor shower will continue to be on display until April 29.",

    "title": "Survivor, witness describe terror at FSU: 'Yeah, keep running,' the gunman said",
    "article_text": "Two Florida State University students recounted the horror of Thursday's deadly campus shooting, with one survivor saying the gunman told students, \"Keep running.\" On Friday, the two people killed in the attack were identified by family members and their representatives as Robert Morales, an FSU dining coordinator and former Leon High School football team assistant coach; and Tiru Chabba, 45, a regional vice president at Aramark Collegiate Hospitality, a campus vendor that provides college dining services. Several others were injured, authorities said, when a student opened fire just before noon on Thursday at the Tallahassee institution. At a vigil on Friday, FSU President Richard McCullough said, \"This kind of tragedy that shouldn’t happen, not here, not anywhere. We are heartbroken.\" Madison Askins, an FSU urban and regional planning graduate student, was headed to the school's student union with a friend for lunch when they heard gunfire. The building contains a mall-like food court, meeting rooms and offices for student groups. She ran, tripped, and fell to the ground, Askins said. Her friend helped her up, but she was quickly struck in the buttocks by a round, went down, and decided to \"play dead,\" she said. Askins pondered calling her parents \"in case I passed away,\" she said. \"I started to spiral a little bit.\" She thought the better of it when she realized the gunman was standing over her. \"I remember him saying, ‘Yeah, keep running,'” Askins said. “I heard the shooter come up next to me, and I heard him reload,\" she said. \"There was a clip at my feet when everything was said and done.\" Authorities said suspect Phoenix Ikner, 20, believed to be a student as well, opened fire outside the student union with his stepmother's former law enforcement service weapon, a handgun she had purchased for personal use. She was identified as a current Leon County Sheriff's Office deputy. Askins stayed down until an officer came to her side. \"She packed my wound, she stood over me, and she kept an eye on the surroundings,\" Askins said. She said her emotions, including thoughts of never seeing family again, overpowered the physical pain of being shot. “I hadn’t cried once about the wound,\" Askins said. \"This gunshot wound is nothing to me in the grand scheme of things.” Doctors told her it would be best to leave the bullet and let her heal and then return to the task of removing it. \"Do I think it’s 100% his mother’s fault?\" Askins said. \"No. He’s a grown adult. He’s 20 years old. I hope it’s something that he will live with forever.” Sage Toussaint, a 20-year-old psychology and premed junior who spoke by phone, was inside the student union with a friend, headed toward a Starbucks counter, when they heard gunfire late Thursday morning. \"I was 15 feet away from him and I didn’t think it was real,\" she said. \"I thought it was a flash mob or a student production or something.” Toussaint said she ran out, but her friend \"was just standing there in shock.\" Once outside the union, Toussaint looked for her friend and called her. The friend answered -- she had been shot. \"All I heard was her screaming and crying, so I just ran,\" Toussaint said. She ended up inside the nearby Leach Center, a campus recreation facility, where a group participating in a yoga session was also hiding inside a bathroom. They stayed on lockdown for nearly two hours, until SWAT team members cleared the area and pulled them out, Toussaint said. Her friend is recovering and could be released in the coming days, she said. Toussaint said she headed home, a three-hour drive, after being released from the Leach Center. But she said she hopes to return to campus Monday. \"If we still have class.\"",

    "title": "Christmas is in the crosshairs as toy industry faces brunt of China tariffs",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s tariffs are threatening to put a crimp in Christmas. The United States imports as much as 75% of the toy products it sells from China, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, making itone of the industries most reliant on that country’s supply chain. Along with sports equipment and games, it is the fourth-largest import category from that nation. As a result, toy industry officials are warning U.S. consumers to expect higher prices and fewer choices this year, including for the holidays, as a result of Trump’s tariffs. “Christmas is in danger,” said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, the industry’s principal trade group. He said production in China continues to slow every time Trump ratchets up the tariffs on that country. And it’s happening at an inopportune time. Traditionally, production starts to ramp up around this point of the year for goods to be ready for the fall and winter shopping season, he said. As Trump revealed China would face some of the highest tariffs in his country-by-country “Liberation Day” rollout of the levies — and later said the duties on China would rise as high as 145% —shares in Hasbro and Mattel have tanked. While both firms had earlier incorporated a 20% tariff impact from China into their financial projections for 2025, they have not yet publicly discussed the impact of a 145% levy. It’s one reason why the Toy Association is co-sponsoring this year’s White House Easter Egg Roll — part of a push to keep toys, which have traditionally avoided trade duties, free from Trump’s tariffs. “The Administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans about our trade and economic policies. President Trump, however, has been clear: if you’re worried about tariffs, the solution is simple. Make your product in America,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. That’s not so easy, toy industry officials say. Chinese toy manufacturing expertise has been honed through decades of experience, and the U.S. industry’s supply chain has become dependent on molds, dyes, labor and safety techniques that are uniquely found there. “This is skilled labor, and there’s no getting around that,” Ahearn said. “And they are significantly less expensive and more experienced than it ever can be in U.S., he added, referring to China’s toy supply chain.” It would be virtually impossible to replicate the industry’s efficiencies in the U.S. in a reasonable time frame, he said. Jonathan Silva, co-owner of the Massachusetts-based WS Game Company, said he fears he will have to lay off his 22 employees if the situation drags on. His firm designs high-end versions of classic games and 100% of their manufacturing occurs in China, he said. “We’re at standstill,” Silva said. He estimates they have about four months of product runway built up, but after that it’s up in the air. “We’re investigating every option we can, but right now our business is pretty much on hold,” he said. Even firms that don’t rely on China say Trump’s tariffs are having a ripple effect. Beate Caso, head of Bruder Toys America, which manufactures its product in Germany, says that in addition to having to reckon with 10% tariffs there, the entire industry will face higher costs due to worldwide shipping container shortages as production in China for all products slows down. “Prices will go up tremendously,” Caso said. “There will also be limited supply, and then you have to add tariff costs. So everything is just going to become more expensive, and consumers will definitely feel that.”",

    "title": "Lori Vallow Daybell plans to rest her murder trial case — without providing evidence or witnesses",
    "article_text": "A “doomsday” murder trial that has gripped the nation for the past week may come to an end much more quickly than expected after Lori Vallow Daybell announced plans to rest her case without providing evidence or witnesses. Prosecutors on Wednesday rested their case against Vallow Daybell, the 51-year-old “doomsday mom” who is on trial in connection with the July 2019 death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, who was fatally shot by her brother, Alex Cox. Vallow Daybell, who is acting as her own counsel in the case, is accused of conspiring with her brother to kill Charles Vallow at her home in Chandler, Arizona. She has pleaded not guilty and argued that the shooting was in self-defense following a family argument that escalated. Prosecutors, however, have presented evidence to a Maricopa County Superior Court jury that they say proves Vallow Daybell and her brother wanted the 62-year-old dead. Mesa-based attorney Adam Ashby of JacksonWhite Law, who is not involved in the case, toldNBC affiliate KPNXof Mesa that he would be shocked if Vallow Daybell went ahead with her plan. “I would be shocked, and I may be proven wrong, if she doesn’t take the stand herself. Her legal advocate would then be asking questions to her,” Ashby said in an interview that aired Thursday. “But I would be shocked if she didn’t want to take that opportunity to speak for herself and say whatever she wanted.” Vallow Daybell has until Monday to make a final decision. If she does rest, closing arguments would begin that day. Here are some key moments from the trial: Vallow Daybell waived her right to an attorney and is representing herself. She does have advising attorneys who can step in if needed, but Vallow Daybell has handled opening statements and cross-examinations on her own. In an interview withTrue Crime Arizonabefore the trial began, she was asked why she chose to represent herself. “Being pro per is not an easy job. I’m not an attorney. I don’t have training to be an attorney,” she responded. “There’s something I figured out when I got to this jail, you know, this experience has been five years running. I went through a whole trial before in my other state, and then I was brought here to Arizona to face some more serious charges.” She added: “I’m just gonna do the best that I can. That’s all I can do.” In March, shetold NBC’s “Dateline”that she felt “great” about acting as her own counsel. But that doesn’t mean Vallow Daybell hasn’t had a few rocky moments in the courtroom. Prosecutors have repeatedly objected to Vallow Daybell’s line of questioning, accusing her of being argumentative. At one point, she had to apologize to the judge for making what prosecutors deemed as unwarranted side remarks during cross-examination. She has also had some difficulties lining up witnesses, The Associated Press reported. Ashby said Vallow Daybell “has done a much better job than I thought.” “I’ve been very impressed with her legal phraseology, with the words that she’s saying many times,” Ashby toldKPNX. “But then she’ll have a lot of mess-ups where she’s testifying for herself, she’s badgering witnesses, she’s harassing witnesses, things like that,” he said. “And that’s been pretty telling.” Vallow Daybell suggested that her estranged husband’s anger, as well as an argument with her 16-year-old daughter, sparked the shooting. “Alex shot Charles in self-defense,” shetold the court in her opening statements. According to Vallow Daybell, her husband got into an argument with her daughter, Tylee Ryan, and threatened the teen with a bat. Charles Vallow, 62, was at his wife’s home in Chandler, Arizona, to take their son, Joshua “JJ” Vallow, to school. “Charles lifted up the bat to hit Tylee,” Vallow Daybell said. “Alex then intervened.” Vallow Daybell described a struggle for the bat in which she said Charles Vallow came at her with it. “At some point” during her effort to flee, “Alex apparently retrieved his gun,” she said. It wasn’t until Vallow Daybell had returned from taking Joshua to school that she learned from police that her husband had died, she said. “A family tragedy is not a crime,” Vallow Daybell said to conclude her opening remarks. Prosecutor Treena Kay, however, said Vallow Daybell had several reasons to want her husband dead. “Lori Vallow wanted to be Lori Daybell, wife of Chad Daybell. And in July of 2019, Lori Vallow wanted to keep the same lifestyle that she had with Charles. And she could get all of this if Charles was dead,” she said. “She could marry Chad Daybell and become Lori Daybell. She would get a million-dollar life insurance policy from Charles Vallow. She would get Social Security for herself and their son, JJ, as the child of a dead spouse. And all of this would be true if Charles Vallow was dead.” Kay argued Vallow Daybell would label people who disagreed with her as “dark” or “possessed by evil spirits” and used religion to justify killing her husband. Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell, a doomsday author, married in November 2019. In 2023, Vallow Daybell was sentencedto life in prison without the possibility of paroleafter she was convicted of the murders of her children, JJ and Tylee, as well as conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her husband’s first wife, Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell had a tense exchange with Nancy Jo Hancock, a witness for the prosecution, as Hancock described her brief relationship with Charles Vallow. Hancock, 61, testified that she met Charles Vallow in early July 2019 on a dating site for members of their church. They met in person for dinner at a restaurant the night before he was killed, she said. Hancock said the pair exchanged “hundreds” of text messages, and Charles Vallow talked “a lot” about Vallow Daybell and the issues they were allegedly having. She testified that Charles Vallow said he was in the process of a divorce — a revelation that seemed to frustrate Vallow Daybell. “You stated that my husband told you that he was going through a divorce,” Vallow Daybell said during cross-examination. “Did you have any way of verifying that?” “No, I didn’t try and verify that,” Hancock responded. The tension increased as Vallow Daybell continued to question Hancock, ultimately leading prosecutors to object several times and accuse Vallow Daybell of being argumentative and asking irrelevant questions. “Would you have gone on a date with him if he would have said he was married?” Vallow Daybell asked, telling Hancock that they weren’t in the process of divorcing. “Um, if I would have realized how married he still was, maybe not,” Hancock answered. “But I just met for dinner. I wasn’t sleeping with him or anything.” “Do you go on dates with married men?” Vallow Daybell shot back. The prosecution objected, saying Vallow Daybell was being argumentative. The judge sustained the objection. The prosecution objected again after Vallow Daybell asked whether Charles Vallow had responded to a text message from Hancock asking if he was a good kisser. Kay said the question was irrelevant and the judge sustained the objection. Hancock was also asked whether Charles Vallow had opened up about his rocky relationship with Tylee. Hancock said she didn’t recall their having that conversation. “I’m sure you don’t,” Vallow Daybell mumbled. The prosecution objected to her making side remarks. The judge sustained the objection. At one point, Vallow Daybell apologized to the judge for making comments after her questioning. “I’m sorry, your honor. I won’t do that again,” she said. “Please stop,” the judge said. Adam Cox, a witness for the prosecution, testified that shortly before the shooting, he had flown to Arizona because he and Charles Vallow wanted to hold an intervention for Vallow Daybell over what he described as odd religious comments. He told the court that his sister had previously revealed that “she was in the process of translating from a mortal human being to an immortal human being.” Cox, 56, said those remarks did not align with what they believed as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He testified that he was supposed to stay at Alex Cox’s Arizona home during that 2019 trip, but his brother did not respond to his text messages. On the day of the shooting, Charles Vallow texted Adam Cox and told him that Alex was at Vallow Daybell’s home. “Alex being at Lori’s house that morning felt like something was really off,” he testified. After learning days later that Charles Vallow had died, Cox said he told his family that he believed his sister and brother had conspired to kill him. “Lori had told people that Charles was no longer living, that some guy named ‘Ned’ was inside of his body, that there was a zombie living inside of him. And Alex didn’t respond to any of my text messages when I was supposed to be with him, and he was at that house that morning,” he told the court. “Lori talking crazy about how she’s a translated being — all these things all added up into that moment and that morning, once I found out on Saturday that Charles was shot and killed, no doubt in my mind that they killed him. That’s a feeling that I got.” Derek Bumgarner, the medical examiner who performed Charles Vallow’s autopsy, testified that the first shot came at a range of 2 to 4 feet, and the second shot had a “shored” exit wound, meaning Charles Vallow could have been lying on a firm surface like a floor when he was shot. The second wound was to the abdomen and upward, Bumgarner said.  The fatal wound went through his heart. Charles Vallow also had abrasions on his knees, Bumgarner said, that could have been caused when he fell to the ground after he was shot. Cassandra Ynclan, who was one of the Chandler police officers who arrived at the home when Charles Vallow was shot, testified to how calm Vallow Daybell was that day. “[She] just seemed very kind of ordinary and kind of nonchalant,” she told the court. A recording of Vallow Daybell’s interview with police was played for the court. It showed her laughing at times as she casually told Ynclan about the moments leading up to the fatal shooting. During cross-examination, Vallow Daybell suggested that Ynclan could not determine how she was supposed to act. “Do you have a degree in psychology?” Vallow Daybell asked. “Do you know what a person should act like if they’re in a stressful situation?” “There isn’t one way to act, there’s just behavior that is striking,” Ynclan said. Vallow Daybell said her daughter needed her “panic attack medicine” and asked Ynclan if her “nonemotional” demeanor was because she was trying to stay calm for Tylee. The prosecution objected to speculation. The judge sustained the objection. Kay Woodcock, the sister of Charles Vallow, testified that she had concerns about his marriage to Vallow Daybell and that he had fears for his safety. “Charles was absolutely concerned for his safety,” she told the court. Woodcock testified that she learned of her brother’s death from “Google that my husband found.” She broke down in tears as she recalled finding out the news. “It was horrible. I had to call my siblings and let them know,” she said through tears. “And everybody was freaking out. I didn’t know what to do.” Woodcock said she reached out to Vallow Daybell at the time, but that her sister-in-law was “too busy to even call his family to say that he was dead by her brother killing him.” Vallow Daybell only asked Woodcock four questions during cross-examination: where she was on the day of Charles Vallow’s death; if she knew about his relationship with Tylee; if she was aware of the events that happened on the morning Charles Vallow was killed; and if she personally saw or heard Vallow Daybell conspire with Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow. The state concluded its presentation and rested on Wednesday. After the jury left the room, Vallow Daybell told the judge she plans to rest her case. It was initially believed that she would testify. She must confirm on Monday whether she intends to proceed with closing her case without witnesses or presenting evidence. The Associated Press reportedthat Vallow Daybell had issues lining up witnesses. A few witnesses were served subpoenas, but two were stricken from the witness list by the judge, according to the AP. At least five others could not be located or served with subpoenas. Before telling the judge her plans to rest, Vallow Daybell had said the state failed to show substantial evidence that she conspired to commit murder. She said there was a “lack of evidence to show any evidence of a conspiracy to commit murder. There was no plan to murder Charles. No evidence has shown that.” “In fact, evidence suggested self-defense on the part of Alex,” Vallow Daybell added. Prosecutor Kay, however, argued that there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find Vallow Daybell guilty. The judge agreed.",

    "title": "Progressive icon and ex-Rep. Barbara Lee wins race for mayor of struggling Oakland, California",
    "article_text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Progressive icon and former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee declared victory Saturday as the new mayor of troubled Oakland, aSan Francisco Bay Area cityreeling from economic stagnation, crime and homelessness. Lee issued a statement Saturday as mayor-elect, saying that her chief opponent, Loren Taylor, had called to concede the April 15 race. “While I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and ballots will continue to be counted ... the results are clear that the people of Oakland have elected me as your next Mayor,” she said. “Thank you, Oakland!” Lee, 78, is a Black female trailblazer who represented the city in Congress for over two decades before retiring last year after running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. “Oakland is a deeply divided City,” she said, adding that she “answered the call to run” so the community could work together to solve its problems. Lee was endorsed by former Gov. Jerry Brown and other previous Oakland mayors who said she was the seasoned, uniting presence the city needed after a divisive recall of former Mayor Sheng Thao in November. Thao was indicted on federal bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges in January. Oakland has about 400,000 residents and is deeply liberal and multicultural, the birthplace of the Black Panther Party and claimed by former Vice President Kamala Harris as her hometown. But Oakland also is reeling from homeless tents, public drug use, illegal sideshows, gun violence and brazen robberies that prompted In-N-Out Burger to close its first location ever last year. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent California Highway Patrol officers to help combat what he called an alarming and unacceptable rise in crime. And the city doesn’t have enough money to pay for public services. Despite her high name recognition, the race was surprisingly heated with Taylor, 47, a former Oakland city council member who pledged to bolster police, reduce crime and revitalize the city’s economy. Taylor said in a statement that “while the outcome was not what we worked for and hoped for,” he was proud of the campaign and the bold ideas he introduced. On the campaign trail, Lee emphasized the need for more community services as well as more police. Economic development, job creation and ensuring core city services like fire hydrants work properly are among her priorities. She will finish out the remainder of Thao’s term and would be up for reelection in November 2026. Lee was first elected to the U.S. House in 1998 and became best known nationally as the only lawmaker to vote against the 2001 authorization for the use of military force in response to the Sept. 11 attacks.",

    "title": "Protesters rally outside White House amid nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations",
    "article_text": "A large number of people gathered near the White House on Saturday to protestPresident Donald Trump’sagenda, building on a widespread effort by anti-Trump organizers to galvanize voters concerned with the administration’s policies and significant use of executive authority. Attendees of the protest, which took place at Lafayette Square Park in Washington, D.C., told NBC News that the treatment ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration says was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was among the issues that led them to participate in the demonstration. “Everyone should have due process. No one should be just taken away and locked up. I don’t care if he is a murderer, he still should get due process,” protester Susie Stern of Ohio said. “That’s what this country is based on. Laws.” The White House alleges that Abrego Garcia is a gang member, and the administration has said that if he re-enters the country he will be deported again. Court records indicate that Abrego Garcia has never been criminally charged in the U.S. or El Salvador, and his wife and lawyers deny he is a gang member. Other protesters took issue with what they described as the administration’s disregard for federal court rulings, including a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court ordering Trump to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States. “What’s happening is very concerning as far as due process of law and how democracy is supposed to work,” first-time protester Samantha Echols of Silver Spring, Maryland, told NBC News. “You shouldn’t just be able to decide what the laws are, to disappear people, to punish people for disagreeing with you. That’s things that dictators do, and I don’t want to see our country to slide in that direction.” Concerns over Abrego Garcia's case were at the center of a similar protest in midtown New York, where thousands of people gathered in front of the New York Public Library to protest Trump's immigration policies,accordingto NBC New York.One protester said the policies are creating a chilling effect throughout the city. “People are scared to go to church. People are scared to go to work. People are scared to take their kids to school,\" said Amanda Harvey, a resident of Brooklyn, New York. Two different demonstrations in Georgia, including a protest in front of the state Capitol building on Saturday, drew scores of protesters,according toWXIA-TV, an NBC affiliate.Attendees listed a litany of reasons for the demonstrations, including efforts by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Trump to reshape the government. “They’re attacking DEI, doing this witch hunt. They’re firing many federal workers and trying to gut all the social programs that we need, like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,” aprotesterat the Georgia Capitol told WXIA. “Every day it’s something new.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the demonstrations. The nationwide protests are a part of an effort that beganearlier this monthwith a series of “Hands Off” demonstrations across the country. The events are coordinated by 50501. Organizers describe the movement as a diverse group of Americans “who stand for democracy, and who stand against the authoritarian actions of the Trump Administration.” The name 50501 refers to the group’s goal of 50 states, 50 protests, 1 movement. According to a list published online by the group, Saturday’s day of action saw nearly 700 events nationwide, from a “Potluck & Protest” event in Kanab, Utah, to a “Tesla Takedown” protest in Woodstock, Virginia, to a “Take America Back” rally in Paw Paw, Michigan. The nationwide protests come as Democrats work to more aggressively counter Trump’s agenda, a top demand for the party’s voters, according to recent polling. AnNBC News pollconducted in March found that nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters said they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if it leads to gridlock, while one-third wanted their leaders to compromise with Trump. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have held a series of“Fighting Oligarchy Tour”stopsacross the country, including an event last week in Los Angeles that drew more than 30,000 people, according to the senator’s office. Congressional Democrats in recent months have held dozens of smallertown hall eventsin a bid to capitalize on the political backlash to Trump’s major cuts to the federal workforce and tariff policy plan. Regarding Saturday’s protests, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, “I believe that public sentiment is everything. And public sentiment is growing against Donald Trump as more Americans face rising costs and less freedom under Donald Trump’s chaotic failed leadership.”",

    "title": "Ice bucket challenge returns with new focus on mental health",
    "article_text": "The “Ice Bucket Challenge,” a viral fundraising campaign thatraised millions for ALS researchin 2014, has been reimagined by students at the University of South Carolina to tackle a new issue: mental health awareness. TheMental Illness Needs Discussion (MIND) club’s #SpeakYourMIND campaign, launched on Instagram in March, adapts the challenge’s format to raise funds for Active Minds, a nonprofit whose mission is to mobilize youth and change mental health norms.Participants pour ice water over themselves, post the videos and nominate others to join — all while emphasizing the importance of speaking candidly about mental health. Thecampaign surpassed $100,000in donations on Friday and has attracted participation from high-profile figures such as former NFL players Peyton Manning and Emmanuel Sanders. Wade Jefferson, a USC junior who founded the MIND club after losing two friends to suicide, said the campaign aims to normalize conversations around mental health and make them more accessible. Jefferson was shocked by how widely the social media trend gained traction, having initially set a modest fundraising goal of $500 while expecting it to remain confined to the USC campus. He said witnessing its viral popularity has been surreal for the students involved. Brett Curtis, director of community fundraising and events at Active Minds, said many nonprofits have long sought a similarly effective movement. “I think fundraising professionals and nonprofits and causes have sat around tables for years trying to say, ‘What’s going to be our ice bucket challenge,’” Curtis said. “I do think there’s a little irony in that it is just the ice bucket challenge again, this time to talk about mental health.” The ALS Association, which originally benefited from the 2014 challenge, has expressed support for the new effort. “We’re thrilled to see the spirit of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge live on in new forms of activism,” the ALS Association said in a statement to NBC News. At its peak popularity, the ALS ice bucket challenge garnered widespread attention, with public figures including former President George W. Bush, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey and Derek Jeter among those taking part. Skeptics expressed concernthat the challenge’s popularity was a fleeting trend and questioned whether it would lead to sustained funding and attention for ALS research. As for the new challenge, Cutis emphasized that it was never solely about donations for Active Minds. “Donations were always secondary,” he said. “This was a chance for us to support a group of students, and that’s always been our mission. And I’m just excited to see it keep going for as long as it does.”",

    "title": "Aftershocks and lack of resources hinder recovery work 3 weeks after Myanmar’s deadly earthquake",
    "article_text": "BANGKOK — Basic services have yet to be restored to the areas ofMyanmar worst hit by a huge earthquake three weeks ago, and emergency workers recovering bodies and clearing debris are contending with regular aftershocks and lack of resources, humanitarian services say. A situation report issued late Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents,disrupting response efforts and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services. “Three weeks after catastrophic twin earthquakes hit Myanmar on 28 March, the worst-affected communities are still without safe shelter, clean water and sanitation, stable electricity, health care and essential services,” the report said. The epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, but it hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw. It also worsened an already direhumanitarian crisistriggered by the country’s civil war that had internally displaced more than 3 million people and left nearly 20 million in need, according to the United Nations. A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper published on Saturday said the quake’s death toll had reached 3,726, with 5,105 people injured and 129 still missing. It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble. Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country’s main highway were damaged by the earthquake. Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners. It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay. An official from Myanmar Rescue Federation (Mandalay), which has been operating along with the firefighters, told The Associated Press on Friday that the priority three weeks on from the earthquake was to clear bodies and debris from under bigger buildings, while also providing assistance to the survivors affected by the earthquake. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two. Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number ofrescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasingas most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance. The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites. UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions. In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own. Saturday’s report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned. Naypyitaw became Myanmar’s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads.",

    "article_text": "In a video,Mahmoud Ajjouris beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood. At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by anIsraeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographerSamar Abu Elouffor The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children. Mahmoud now lives inDoha, Qatar, with his family, after becomingone of a very small numberof Palestiniansto be evacuated from Gazafor urgent medical treatment. When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. “There are bad moments for him,” his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar’s capital. “He doesn’t want to play or go outside.” “We keep him busy and have fun with him,” Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay. For now, Ajjour said, there’s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he’s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family. “He likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,” Ajjour said. Doctors at Doha’s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms. In Gaza, such treatment isn’t possible, and Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to havelost at least one limbduring the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel’s siege. “The first few days were very difficult,” Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain. “He would look at his hands and not see them,” the boy’s mother said. “He would scream and say, ‘Where are my hands,’ and the first thing he said was, ‘How will I hug you, how will I pray?’” These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza’s children.",

    "title": "'Very good progress' reported in high-stakes U.S. talks with Iran",
    "article_text": "TEHRAN — A second round of high-stakes talks between the United States and Iran concluded Saturday in Rome with \"very good progress,\" a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration said. Talks will continue next week, the official said in a statement. “Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" the official said. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.” Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi both arrived late Saturday morning for thenegotiationsat the Omani Embassy in Rome. The talks took place as both sides sought to ease growing tensions over potential military action and Iran’s nuclear ambitions. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran’s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue a nuclear weapon. Following the talks, Araghchi told Iranian state television they were \"held in a constructive atmosphere\" and \"moving forward.\" \"There is no reason for too much optimism, we cannot say that we are really optimistic,\" he told the outlet. \"We must be very cautious, but there is no reason for much pessimism either.\" In a statement, Oman’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Witkoff and Araghchi agreed to enter the next phase of discussions “that aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal.” The statement said the deal will ensure Iran is free of nuclear weapons and lift sanctions against the country while continuing to allow it “to develop peaceful nuclear energy.” The next round of discussions will take place in Oman’s capital, Muscat, “in the next few days,” according to the country’s foreign ministry. The talks were mediated by Oman, which also hosteda first round of negotiationsbetween the two men in Muscat last Saturday. That paved the way for another meeting as both countries move toward cautious diplomacy. “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,” Trump said Friday. “I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.” The New York Timesreportedon Wednesday that Trump had privately waved off Israeli proposals to strikeIranian nuclear sites, preferring instead topursue a renegotiated deal. Last week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that actions taken during the first stage of talks in Oman were “good,” and must be “pursued carefully.” The talks represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew a U.S.-backed regime, and a U.S. embassy hostage crisis that same year. Since then, the U.S. has imposed rounds of crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, he unilaterally withdrew from an accord Iran had struck with world leaders that had drastically limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The heart of the current talks remains Iran’s uranium enrichment, a key indicator of how close a country may be to developing a nuclear weapon. Under the 2015 nuclear accord, Iran agreed to cap enrichment at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. The limit was intended to ensure the program remained civilian in nature. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the deal offered Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear ambitions. The deal was signed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom — as well as Germany and the European Union. But that agreement began to unravel in 2018 when Trump pulled the U.S. out, calling it “the worst deal ever.” His first administration imposed sweeping sanctions that choked Iran’s economy and isolated its financial and energy sectors. In turn, Iran rolled back its limits and  is believed to have enriched uranium up to 60%,closer to the weapons-grade level of 90%. Araghchi and Witkoff met in Oman last Saturday in talks both sides described as positive and constructive, though Iran has said since that it has been confused over the mixed messaging by the Trump administration on whether it wants Iran to completely dismantle its entire nuclear program. Last week, Witkoff posted on X that Iran must “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.” The previous day, on Fox News, the special envoy had stated that “the conversation with the Iranians” would focus on limiting uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes. Witkoff’s apparent contradiction underscores the tensions that have surrounded the current talks, clouded also by lingering suspicion of Trump following the collapse of the JCPOA in 2018. Tehran remains deeply wary. Further signs of a potential shift emerged during aFriday prayer service in Tehran attended by hardline clerics and military figures, the message from the imam was revealing — Iran should remain open to negotiations. As some in the crowd of thousands at the University of Tehran campus chanted “death to America,” and the imam warned that talks should be pursued with caution, and that the U.S. and the Trump administration had shown they could not be trusted. Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if no agreement is reached. Ahead of Saturday’s talks, the U.S. moved a second aircraft carrier into regional waters. The president also threatened to extend tariffs on nations that continue buying Iranian oil, atop the litany of sanctions already in force.",

    "title": "Severe storms from the South to the Northeast put a damper on Easter travel",
    "article_text": "Severe stormstriggered tornado warnings and produced baseball-sized hail across an area stretching from the South to the Northeast. Around24million people are at risk from Texas to Ohio Saturday, including in Dallas, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The main threats Saturday are large hail, damaging winds and a few tornadoes. Over the next couple of hours, storms in the Ohio Valley and Interior Northeast will be capable of producing localized 60 mph wind gusts and quarter-sized hail. The “nearly stationary” spring weather system brought multiple tornado warnings to North Central Texas early Friday evening, according to the National Weather Service. As warnings expired, others were issued. The system, a clash of cool and warm air that’s headed for northern Missouri and the Upper Great Lakes, is already blamed for more than 70 reports of baseball-sized hail in southern Wisconsin. In social media imagery verified by NBC News, vortexes were seen in the sky in Southwest Iowa and near Sterling City, Texas, on Friday. It wasn't clear if they have been confirmed as tornadoes by the weather service, which usually sends trained spotters out the next day to survey possible tracks and damage. A long line of showers and thunderstorms are continuingSaturday afternoon in the region stretching from Texas to the Northeast. The strongest storms were expected to start in the late afternoon for hours over central Texas, then expand east through the overnight hours. There is an enhanced risk of storms over parts of central Texas, including Abilene and San Angelo, where the risk is highest for very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes. Through the evening, storms will slowly progress east and impact the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Storms will be capable of producing golf ball-sized hail, 2 to 3 inches of rain, 70 mph wind gusts and possible tornadoes. Flight cancellations and delays started Saturday morning in Texas’ Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, with 52 cancelations and 531 delays, according toFlightAware.com. Rounds of heavy rain caused flooding Friday, and the risk of more flooding is expected Saturday, with a moderate risk of flash flooding extending from north-central Texas to Missouri. Around 11 million people are under Flood Alerts through to Sunday from Texas to Illinois, including St Louis, Missouri; Springfield, Ohio; Tulsa and Oklahoma City are included in these alerts through Sunday evening as storm totals range from 3 to 5 inches, with up to 7 inches possible in some areas. On Easter Sunday, 11million people are at risk for thunderstorms from east Texas to Illinois, including in St. Louis; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. Tornado activity is possible, with the greatest risk for tornadoes and damaging winds over Missouri and into western Illinois. This weather pattern will also create a divide well above and well below average temperatures through the weekend. Highs in the Rockies, Plains and Southwest will drop 10 to 30 degrees below average, with temperatures maxing out in the 40's to 70's. Meanwhile, from the South to the Northeast, highs will soar 10 to 20 degrees above average, with temperatures maxing out in the 70's to 90's. A few record highs will be threatened this afternoon in Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Highs will stay about 10 to 15 degrees above average across the Southeast through Sunday and into early next week.",

    "title": "She grew up believing she was a U.S. citizen. Then she applied for a passport",
    "article_text": "Juliana Kim In her earliest memories, A sensed a difference between her and her white parents. Yet, she also remembers feeling special, chosen and cared for.Family photohide caption For the better part of A's life, she never suspected anything was wrong. She breezed through getting her driver's license. She applied to college and filed her taxes year after year without any hiccups. That is, until she applied for her passport. Suddenly, the document she always relied on — a delayed registration of birth, which is fairly common among adoptees — was no longer enough. She realized the papers that would prove she was a citizen were not just missing — they had never existed in the first place. \" I just sensed there was something wrong and it seemed frightening,\" said A, who asked to be referred to by her last initial out of fear of deportation. A later found out that her adoptive parents never completed her naturalization. It meant she was technically barred from accessing things that she took for granted all her life — like college financial aid. It also left A, who is now in her 40s, vulnerable to deportation to her native South Korea — a country she has never been to, where she doesn't speak the language or know of any family. Congress tried to address this issue by passing the Child Citizenship Act in 2000, which grants automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees and those under 18 at the time the law went into effect, or only those born after February 1983. It also did not apply to children who were brought to the U.S. on the wrong type of visa. For the past 25 years, advocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cutoff and narrow the citizenship gap among adoptees. A bill was reintroduced several times, but it has yet to make it past the House. Now, advocates say President Trump's second term has ushered in a new era of fear for adoptees without citizenship. Trump has consistently vowed to carry out thelargest deportation programthat the country has ever seen. To do so, his administration is castinga far wider net on who to deport — making adoptees like A question if they will be next. \"I definitely didn't think it was possible for any adoptee to be in my state of limbo. I know now that it's not only possible but common,\" A said. It's difficult to determine how many adoptees lack citizenship in the U.S. Many are unaware of their circumstances until adulthood, when they attempt to apply for a passport, try to obtain a Real ID or, in the worst-case scenario, get convicted of a crime, which makes them a priority for removal. Arissa Oh, a history professor at Boston College who has written extensively about the origins of international adoptions, said a host of factors contributed to the phenomenon of noncitizen adoptees. In some cases, the adoptive parents were to blame. \"Either the adoptive parents did not know that naturalization was a separate process from immigration and adoption, or they couldn't get around to it for whatever reason,\" Oh said. Sometimes, the adoptions were never fully legal in the first place. Last month, the government of South Korea, where A is from, admitted that its adoption agenciesengaged in fraud or malpracticeto keep up with demand, including not properly vetting prospective parents. The report, led by the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, urged the Korean government to investigate citizenship issues among adoptees sent to the U.S. and take steps to support those without citizenship, theAssociated Pressreported. Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairperson Park Sun Young (right) comforts adoptee Yooree Kim during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, on March 26. Before the 1990s, South Korea was the top country for international adoptions to the U.S. A 2000 U.S. law's age cutoff makes the issue of adoptees without citizenship especially pertinent to those from South Korea.Ahn Young-joon/APhide caption According to Oh, all of the systemic factors that kept adoptees from being naturalized underscore a long-standing discrepancy between federal and state roles in international adoptions. While U.S. citizenship is governed at the federal level, adoptions themselves are generally regarded as domestic matters, much like marriage, which is why they are processed through state courts, Oh said. \"That's where you see a failure, in terms of the protection of the children,\" she said. \"Because they could fall through the gap between federal law and state law.\" A was just 3 weeks old when she was brought to the West Coast from South Korea. Her adoptive parents had trouble conceiving, she was told. It never occurred to A to ask if she was indeed a U.S. citizen. Then in her 20s, while working at a coffee shop, A opened a letter from the U.S. State Department asking for more proof of her citizenship. She had no idea who to turn to and couldn't afford a lawyer. \"I think I just felt really alone and scared,\" A said. \"I didn't know who to ask for help.\" So, she tucked the letter away and returned to the mountain of dishes she needed to wash. Although part of her was worried, A figured it was some misunderstanding and could be easily resolved. Later, when she asked her parents about her citizenship, they told her: \"You were adopted by a U.S. citizen. So you're a U.S. citizen,\" she recalled. Years later, in a Facebook group for adoptees, she confided to another member about her situation, who then urged her to contact attorney Gregory Luce as soon as possible. An adoptee himself, Luce specializes in this area. After he and A connected in 2019, Luce spent the next two years going back and forth with various government agencies to determine if A was a citizen. The drawn-out wait was typical, he said. The truth was nothing short of gut-wrenching. \"Greg said officially: 'You're not a U.S. citizen,' \" A said. \"It was hard to hear, but a lot of it was that I was scared.\" Adoptees are supposed to be granted the same rights as if they were the biological children of their adoptive parents. Yet adoptees who lack citizenship live in limbo almost as if they newly arrived. It makes them ineligible for most college financial aid, federal benefits and certain government jobs. Soon, they'll also lose the ability to fly domestically when enforcement ofReal ID, a driver's license or ID card with stricter standards, kicks off in May. Joy Alessi, a Korean adoptee who's with the Adoptee Rights Campaign, did not gain citizenship until she was 52 years old. She worries about how the years she spent working as a noncitizen will impact her future retirement benefits. \"As children, we didn't broker our own adoptions, nor did we bring ourselves across the border without the proper documentation. Nor did we fail to apply for our own citizenship,\" she said. \"So why are we holding children responsible for their parents' mistakes?\" For decades, attorneys often advised Alessi to simply \"lay low\" rather than try to take steps to correct her immigration status. But leaving the issue unresolved puts adoptees at another kind of risk:a criminal conviction, no matter how minor, can expose them to the full weight of immigration enforcement. NPR previously reported ofan adoptee and father of fivewho was convicted of marijuana possession in Texas. Because his adoption was filed improperly, he was sent to his birth country of Mexico after having served a few years in prison. Amanda Cho, a spokesperson for Adoptees for Justice, said adoptees who are deported often receive little to no support to navigate life in an unfamiliar country, putting them at significant risk of unemployment, homelessness, and mental health crises. \"They're kind of just left to struggle and survive on their own,\" she said. In one case, an adoptee named Phillip Clay killed himselfafter struggling to adjustto life in South Korea. The State Department said in a statement that it works to ensure intercountry adoptions are \"safe, ethical, legal and transparent\" but \"[its] role in issues regarding adoptee citizenship is generally limited to adjudicating applications for a U.S. passport.\" Adoptee advocates argue the solution lies in eliminating the age cutoff from the 2000 law. Legislative efforts to do just that have historically received bipartisan support. But progress has been slow because the issue had been tied to immigration, an area that has been persistently difficult to reform, according Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., who has previously sponsored the bill. \"So it's really paralyzed our ability to right a very simple and straightforward wrong,\" he added. But Cho said at its core, the bill is about preventing family separation. \"Adoptees were adopted into a family as children,\" she said. \"It's not fair that a biological child can commit a crime, do their time and continue on with their life. But an adopted child is treated [differently].\" Beyond the federal level, states can also better support adoptees by allowing them greater access to their adoption records, according to Luce, who is also the founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center. These documents are often considered the most secretive of all court files given their sensitive nature. In many states, including California, Kentucky and Virginia, adult adoptees must securea court order or permissionfrom their adoptive parents in order to gain access to certain adoption papers. The fee to obtain these files can also be far higher than the cost to retrieve a non-adoptee birth certificate. The issue impacts both those who were adopted domestically and internationally. In A's case, Luce said he requested documents essential to her immigration case in state court three times over two years. Had it been easier to get those papers, A would have obtained her green card by now, according to Luce. \"It's incredibly frustrating if not insane and ultimately dangerous for intercountry adopted people like A when they cannot get basic documents to prove they are lawfully in the United States,\" he said. \"It is an issue of human rights and individual dignity that we've been fighting for more than 50 years,\" he added. In 2022, A married a U.S. citizen — opening up a new viable pathway toward citizenship. It's promising, but A won't be able to get a green card until she has obtained adoption papers. A said her husband is \"more nervous now than ever before because of the current administration.\" Soon, A won't be able to fly within the country because she's not eligible fora Real ID. It means missing work trips and her best friend's birthday in New York, breaking a 12-year tradition. \"It's a really big loss,\" A said. It also comes at a time when she feels the most grateful for the life that she has built — securing her dream two-bedroom apartment nestled between parks and hiking paths, working a job she loves and having a close-knit group of friends, many of whom are fellow adoptees. \"I am so in tune with how lucky I am and somehow it feels like a way to measure how long and hard I worked and how many times I moved trying to find my place,\" she said.

    "title": "Iran and the U.S. plan expert-level talks over Tehran's nuclear program",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi speaks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their meeting in Moscow on Friday.Tatyana Makeyeva/Pool AFP/APhide caption ROME — Iran and the United States will begin having experts meet to discuss details of a possible deal over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, the top Iranian diplomat said Saturday after a second round of negotiations in Rome. The comments by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who met with U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff for several hours, suggest movementin the talks. The experts will meet in Oman before Araghchi and Witkoff meet again in Oman on April 26, Araghchi said. There was no immediate readout from the U.S. side after the meeting at the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood. However, President Donald Trump has been pushing for a rapid deal with Iran while threatening military action against it. \"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\" He added: \"This time, we succeeded to reach a better understanding about a sort of principles and aims.\" Iranian officials described the talks as indirect, like those last weekend in Muscat, Oman, with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi shuttling between them in different rooms. That talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and after U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens more. \"I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said Friday. \"I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\" Araghchi met Saturday morning with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani ahead of the talks with Witkoff. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, also met Tajani on Saturday. Grossi's agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers. Tajani said Italy was ready \"to facilitate the continuation of the talks even for sessions at the technical level.\" A diplomat deal \"is built patiently, day after day, with dialogue and mutual respect,\" he said in a statement. Both men have been traveling in recent days. Witkoff had been in Paris for talks about Ukraine as Russia's full-scale war there grinds on. Araghchi paid a visit to Moscow, where he met with officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia, one of the world powers involved in Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran's uranium enriched to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Oman's capital, Muscat, hosted the first round of negotiations between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an interlocutor between Iran and the West. Ahead of the talks, however, Iran seized on comments by Witkoff first suggesting Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on X before the talks that Iran would not accept giving up its enrichment program like Libya, or agreeing to using uranium enriched abroad for its nuclear program. \"Iran has come for a balanced agreement, not a surrender,\" he wrote. Iran's internal politics are still inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past Iran's rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar earlier this month. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue. Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China's Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran. The aircraft have Rolls-Royce engines, which include significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. Under the 2015 deal, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined up tens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co. However, the manufacturers backed away from the deals over Trump's threats to the nuclear accord. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Ukraine wary of Putin's Easter truce and says it will reciprocate only a genuine ceasefire",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. By The Associated Press A Ukrainian soldier hugs his comrade after returning from captivity in a POW exchange in Ukraine, on Saturday.Evgeniy Maloletka/APhide caption Ukraine said it would reciprocate any genuine ceasefire by Moscow, but voiced skepticism after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary Easter truce in Ukraine starting Saturday. The announcement from Kyiv came as Russia and Ukraine conducted their largest prisoner exchange since Moscow's full-scale invasion started over three years ago. Putin announced a temporary Easter ceasefire in Ukraine starting Saturday, citing humanitarian reasons. According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said if Russia is genuinely ready to observe a full and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will mirror that approach and strike only in defense. He said such a gesture, particularly over the Easter weekend, could reveal Moscow's true intentions. \"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. \"That will reveal Russia's true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.\" Zelenskyy added that, according to military reports, Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) long front line. In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March \"agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,\" which Russia rejected. \"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,\" Sybiha continued, writing on X. \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.\" Putin's ceasefire announcement came afterU.S. President Donald Trumpon Friday said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are \"coming to a head\" and insisted that neither side is \"playing\" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war. Largest POW exchange so far The two sides meanwhile exchanged hundreds of POWs on Saturday. Russia's Ministry of Defense said that 246 Russian service members were returned from Ukraine, and 31 wounded Ukrainian POWs were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care. Zelenskyy said that 277 Ukrainian \"warriors\" have returned home from Russian captivity. Both sides thanked the United Arab Emirates for their mediation. Most of the Ukrainians freed in the latest prisoner exchange are young people born after 2000, Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Friday. Outside a hospital in Ukraine's Northern Chernihiv region, where recently freed POWs were brought after the exchange at the border, dozens of relatives stood waiting. Among them was 48-year-old Nataliia Lohvynchuk, who rushed toward the bus the moment it arrived. She hadn't seen her son in three years, since he was captured during the battle for Mariupol in the spring of 2022. Her son, 23-year-old Ihor Lohvynchuk, lost about 40 kilograms (88 pounds) in captivity. \"It still doesn't feel real,\" he said softly. \"We're not really here yet. We all made it back, but we're still not here. His mother, overcome with emotion and embracing her son, issued a plea: \"We call on the entire world, on every country — help us bring all our boys home.\" Thousands of POWs remain in captivity. The exchange is the fourth this year and the 63rd since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. Since the outbreak of the war, a total of 4,552 Ukrainians, both military and civilians, have been returned from captivity. Russia says its forces have retaken nearly all of Kursk Russia's Defense Ministry said Saturday its forces pushed Ukrainian troops from the village of Oleshnya, one of their last remaining footholds in Russia's Kursk region, where the Ukrainians staged a surprise incursion last year. Gerasimov said Saturday in a report to Putin, quoted by Russian state media, that Russia had retaken nearly all of the territory from Ukrainian forces. \"The main part of the region's territory, where the invasion took place, has now been liberated. This is 1,260 square kilometers, 99.5%,\" Gerasimov said. Zelenskyy wrote on X that Ukrainian forces \"continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions.\" Ukraine also claimed that it holds a presence beyond the Kursk region in Russian territory with an aim of preventing the offensive on the Sumy region and to fight on enemy's soil. The Associated Press was unable to verify the claim immediately from Russia. According to the Russian state news agency Tass, Russia is still fighting to push Ukrainian forces out of the village of Gornal, some 7 miles (11 kilometers) south of Oleshnya. In other developments, the Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 87 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Saturday. It said 33 of them were intercepted and another 36 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed. Russian attacks damaged farms in the Odesa region and sparked fires in the Sumy region overnight, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Saturday. Fires were contained, and no casualties were reported. Russia's Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, said its air defense systems shot down two Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday.

    "title": "Opinion: When a hat becomes a threat",
    "article_text": "Scott Simon Chicago Bulls Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, coach Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan celebrating their 4th NBA championship in 1996. Chicago's dominance of basketball in the 1990s established the Bulls as a cultural force and worldwide brand.Beth A. Keiser/APhide caption I have seen Chicago Bulls hats all over the world. I remember covering the siege of Sarajevo in 1993, and being astonished to see so many Bulls hats worn by people who bravely persisted in a city besieged by bombs and sniper fire. Basketball was hugely popular in Bosnia. But the adulation for the Bulls seemed something more. Michael Jordan's soaring leaps toward the basket made it look as if human beings really could fly, if only across a basketball court. I would later see Bulls hats in Paris, Beijing, Tel Aviv and Baghdad, as well as across America. That team of Jordan, Pippen, Steve Kerr and Dennis Rodman had players on the roster from all over the world, who seemed to evoke the energy of America. And so it stood out for me this week in the reporting about what the Trump Administration calls an \"administrative error\" that sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran prison, that the cause might date back to 2019. Abrego Garcia was stopped for loitering in front of a Home Depot in Prince George's County, Maryland, and interrogated by police who thought he was part of the violent MS-13 gang. A Prince George's County Police Department Gang Field Interview Sheet of March 28, 2019 notes that Kilmar Abrego Garcia denied being part of the gang. But he wore a Bulls cap. The officers wrote, \"Wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents [that] they are a member in good standing with the MS-13.\" The Chicago Bulls—and I say this as their fan—have been mostly mediocre since that team of the 1990s won six championships. But they remain one of the most popular brands in sports. Lids, the sports store, reported in 2022 that Bulls merchandise is their best-seller in more than half the country. I wonder if all those people buying Bulls hats know they're declaring themselves gang members. A U.S. immigration judge ultimately granted Abrego Garcia protection from being deported, because he had actually faced persecution by gangs in El Salvador. He gained a federal work permit, married, and was raising his family, taking classes and doing an apprenticeship. His lawyers say he's not part of MS-13 or any other gang. When he met this week with Senator Chris Van Hollen, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was wearing a Kansas City Chiefs hat. Maybe sometimes, a hat is just a hat. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Hundreds of protests, rallies and other actions against the Trump administration are taking place in cities across the U.S. this weekend. In Washington, D.C., hundreds of protesters gathered in Lafayette Square outside the White House on Saturday morning to voice their opposition to the Trump administration. Demonstrators cited a range of concerns, including the deportation ofKilmar Abrego Garciaand the administration's moves tocut funding for researchandhigher education.

The name stands for 50 protests in 50 states and one movement — referring to thegroup's first nationwide protestat state capitols. More than 800 local protests, teach-ins, and mutual aid efforts were planned for Saturday in response towhat organizers sayare \"anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration.\" Demonstrators march in Washington, D.C., during nationwide protests against the Trump administration.Pierre Kattar/NPRhide caption The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment. The 50501 Movement, which has orchestrated protests since early February, is one of several anti-Trump movements.The \"Tesla Takedown\" campaignis holding more than 100 protests this weekend, according to organizers. That group is protesting Tesla CEO Elon Musk's influential role in the Trump administration. Hunter Dunn, the national press coordinator for the 50501 Movement, says that Tesla Takedown rallies and other similar efforts are part of the same decentralized movement. The sprawling effort encompasses any protest guided by four tenets, according to Dunn. \"We're pro-democracy, we're in favor of preserving the Constitution, we're against executive overreach, and we're non-violent,\" he said. While the\"Hands Off!\" rallieson April 5 were billed as a day of protests, Saturday broadened the resistance effort to include community-focused events. A protester holds a sign saying \"Hands off\" in New York City. Organizers of the nationwide protests said the demonstrations were to denounce the \"hostile government takeover\" by the Trump administration.Adam Gray/Getty Imageshide caption \"It's all about actions that support your community against the Trump administration — strengthening your community so that they can weather these assaults on democracy,\" Dunn said. In Southern California, for example, food drives were planned to support people who continue to struggle in the wake of the January wildfires as well as those who may be affected by the rising price of goods amidPresident Trump's tariffs. \"Resistance is about more than just protesting,\" Dunn said. \"It's about strengthening your community so that they can weather these assaults on democracy, and so that they can get ready to make a better future for everyone.\" The 50501 campaign says it has quickly built momentum since its first call to action. For its nationwide protest on Feb. 5, the organization estimates there were about 80 protests in 88 cities. Demonstrators rally near the White House during nationwide protests against the Trump administration.Richard Pierrin/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Likewise, as the Tesla Takedown protests enter their 11th week, organizers say momentum hasn't slowed and they have consistently seen about 150 actions globally each week. David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University who studies political communication, says that \"in normal times,\" having a bunch of different names and issues for protests might ordinarily weaken a movement. But these times are unprecedented, he said. The blitz of controversial actions by the Trump administration week to week has resulted in a cascade of messaging from opponents. \"It's kind of OK to have another rally every weekend that has people who are complaining about Tesla and also people complaining about [cuts to] cancer research,\" Karpf said. \"What they're all saying is not, 'Hey, political elites, we have this one simple demand.' It's more mass outrage saying: 'Nobody voted for this.' \" WEKU's John McGary contributed to this story from Lexington, Ky. WVXU's Bill Rinehart reported from Cincinnati.

    "title": "Here's how to use nasal spray right and more tips for managing spring allergies",
    "article_text": "By Andrea Muraskin If you feel like your seasonal allergies are getting worse every year, it's not just you. Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer, and more people are going to the doctor each year looking for relief, according to a recentresearch reviewpublished in the journalThe Laryngoscope. One study the reviewers looked at found the pollen season had already gotten 20 days longer in North America between 1990 and 2018, and several studies found an increase in average daily pollen concentrations. Luckily, there are ways to keep the pollen from taking over your life. NPR asked doctors for tips to help you manage your spring allergies before they manage you. This story comes from NPR'sHealth newsletter. Want more stories on the science of healthy living?Subscribe here. Pollen can be carried in on just about any surface, warns Dr. Zachary Rubin, a pediatric allergist and clinical immunologist whoblogs about allergiesand sharesallergy-related tips on social media. Taking your shoes off when you enter your home is a good start, but there's more. \"Before you sit down on furniture or in your bed, you ideally should take off any clothes that would have been touching the outside world,\" Rubin says. Socks, pants, shirts all go directly in your laundry. Rubin also recommends taking a shower or a bath before bed to rinse pollen from your skin and hair. When indoors, Rubin recommends keeping your windows and doors closed as much as possible. That may be a bummer if you love a spring breeze, but you're inviting pollen and mold into your house when they're open, says Rubin. If you're allergic to pollen, the stuff is more likely to float through windows on a dry and windy day. Rubin says rainy days are good for flushing it out of the air. But if you're allergic to mold, it's better to keep windows shut on rainy days too. If you've just got to open those windows, Rubin says an indoor air purifier can provide some relief. If you have a dog, cat or any pet who spends time outside, wipe the animal off whenever they come inside, says Rubin. You can pick up allergy-friendly wipes at pet stores. It's also worth giving pets more frequent baths to remove pollen, says Dr. Neelima Tummala, an ENT physician and clinical assistant professor in otolaryngology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. First, look at when pollen counts are really high and try to avoid being outdoors during those times of day, advises Tummala. Right now we're in tree pollen season and that tends to be highest in the mornings, she says. Want to enjoy nature with fewer sneezes? It turns out the masks we got used to wearing to prevent COVID transmission \"can be very helpful actually,\" says Rubin, for keeping out pollen and mold. He points toresearchwhere health care workers during COVID reported reduced allergy symptoms when wearing masks. It's also a good idea to rinse out your nose when you get home, says Rubin. You can do that with a neti pot or a saline spray. If you go the neti pot route, be sure to use distilled water, or tap water that's been boiled and cooled down, Rubin cautions. (Water straight from the tap comes with a small risk of infection from abrain-eating amoeba— eek!) Different allergy medications treat different symptoms. Here are a few common ones, and what to know about how to use them. You're probably doing it wrong. I know I was. \"A lot of people just naturally go, snort, spray, snort. What that does is it just shoots the medicine to the back of your throat where you taste it. And if you taste it, you waste it,\" Rubin says. Hedemonstrated how to use nasal spray properlyin a TikTok that went viral. Here's his secret to getting it right: \"I tell people 'nose to toes.' So you look down and then you place the nozzle up, but then you tilt it slightly towards the ear on the same side as your nostril. And after you spray on each side, you look forward and breathe through your mouth. Breathe normally, maybe a slight inhalation through your nose, but you never snort it,\" Rubin advises. Why aim towards the ear? The ear is connected to the back of the throat and nasal cavity through the eustachian tube, so decreasing inflammation in that area will lower the risk of getting fluid behind your ear. Pointing the spray bottle towards the ear also targets openings between your nasal passages and your sinuses, lowering your risk of developing a sinus infection, says Rubin. Rubin uses a concept calledthe allergy symptom thresholdto explain how exposure to multiple allergens, along with other factors, can trigger symptoms.  \"You could be exposed to one pollen grain and not sneeze, but if you're exposed to a thousand, you're going to sneeze because there's enough there that will activate the immune system,\" he explains. That goes for different kinds of allergens too. For instance, last week I was in Washington D.C., contending with pollen from the lovely cherry blossoms outside, and my sister's cat Felicia indoors. My sinuses were not pleased. \"It's like you have a cup and you're filling it with different allergens and exposures, says Rubin.\" (Heillustrates the conceptin another video.) Other factors can also increase your likelihood of having an allergic reaction. For some people Rubin says, drinking alcohol lowers the threshold, and some are more vulnerable when they exercise, particularly outdoors. If you happen to be sick, \"your immune system is aggravated and hyperactive,\" Rubin says, and more likely to respond to allergens. (It can also work the other way around – if mucus builds up in your sinuses because of allergies, you're less able to fend off a respiratory infection that comes your way, he says.) It goes back to reducing exposure, says Rubin: The more you can cut back your exposures to all kinds of allergens and irritants, the more successful you'll be at preventing an allergic reaction.

    "title": "One city prides itself as the cradle of the working class. Here's why",
    "article_text": "By Fatima Al-Kassab , Lauren Frayer British forces charge crowds during bread riots in Manchester, England, in 1819. The event became known as the Peterloo Massacre, when troops were ordered to disperse the crowds.Rischgitz/Getty Imageshide caption MANCHESTER, England — In the center of this industrial city in northern England, amemorialcommemorates protesters killed here at a demonstration for workers' rights in 1819, in what became known as thePeterloo Massacre. The British cavalry charged at workers who had gathered to demand political representation, killing at least 18 people and injuring hundreds. On the monument to those killed, arrows point outward to Pennsylvania, where unarmed strikers were killed at theLattimer minein 1897, and to South Africa, where peaceful protesters were killed at an anti-apartheid rally inSharpevillein 1960. What links these places is a shared history of workers' struggles and people's uprisings around the world. The monument is not the only thing putting Manchester at the center of this long tradition. Nowadays, politiciansfrom across the political spectrum, from the United States to the United Kingdom and many countries around the world, scramble to appeal to working people, but discussions about the political power of the working class first gained prominence in 19th century Britain. This is where, during theIndustrial Revolution, a new urban working class was formed and came together to demand rights and representation. Nowhere was this more evident than in Manchester. People and horse-drawn carriages are seen in Manchester circa 1880.Francis Frith/Getty Imageshide caption Manchester was the world'sfirst modern industrial city,and its urban working class — and the abysmal conditions they were living in — inspired the theories of German philosophersFriedrich Engels, who lived in the city for two decades, and his friend and collaboratorKarl Marx. Engelswrote about the emergence of this group of laborers in his 1845 book,The Condition of the Working Class in England. In it, he describes \"the working-men's dwellings of Manchester\" as being so terrible that \"only a physically degenerate race, robbed of all humanity … could feel comfortable and at home.\" \"Manchester becomes a symbol for the working classes\" in the 1800s, says Charlotte Wildman, a historian at the University of Manchester. The city's political significance continues to reverberate around the world today. In the early 19th century, Manchester became thecenterof the world's cotton trade. The demand for cotton goods as part of thetrans-Atlantic slave tradeplayed a key role in the rapid industrialization of the city. Agricultural workers from across Britain moved there to work. Cotton mills on Union Street in Manchester in 1850.Rischgitz/Getty Imageshide caption \"There wasn't really anywhere for them to live,\" Wildman explains. \"There were high levels of poverty, illness and diseases.\" At the same time, the Industrial Revolution was making some people wealthy. The huge wealth gap fueled resentment and demands for better conditions. \"That very visible sense of rich and poor gives this new urban working class a clear identity and a sense of oppression,\" Wildman says. Workers were notallowed to vote. Those in power were reluctant to give working men the vote because they didn't trust them, she says. \"They were trying to keep away the men that they saw as undesirable, particularly the kind of men who they deemed as criminal or feckless,\" she says. Women of any class weren't even considered as deserving of the franchise. But working-classmovementsbegan to gather pace throughout the 19th century, gradually winning over some rights for these new urban workers — althoughuniversal suffragefor men in the United Kingdom did not happen until World War I, in February 1918. The 1918 Representation of the People Act gave some women the right to vote for the first time too — but only those over 30 who owned a house or were married to a homeowner. Women did not gainuniversal suffrageuntil 1928. German philosopher Friedrich Engels circa 1860.Amsler & Ruthardt/Edward Gooch Collection/Getty Imageshide caption Nineteenth century thinkers flocked to Manchester to chronicle the working class, including Engels and Marx. Engels moved to Manchester in 1842, at age 22, to manage his father'scotton factoryon the city's outskirts. \"Engels lived in Manchester for 22 years and Marx visited him there for months at a time,\" says Manchester-based writer John Schofield. Engels' father had sent him to work at the family's factory there \"to rid him of his extreme political views,\" says local historian Ed Glinert, who gives walking tours of the German philosophers' old haunts around the city. \"His father said a proper job at the family firm in Manchester would make him drop all the politics and become a good citizen.\" In fact, the city had the opposite effect on him. \"Friedrich Engels walked into a very febrile situation in Manchester in 1842,\" says Schofield. There had just been a riot of millworkers in the city andunrestand protests continued throughout the 1840s. Engels even believed they might lead to revolution in the city. Engels and Marx would work together at adeskin the city's Chetham's Library, writing about workers and class struggle. German philosopher Karl Marx circa 1866.Hulton Archive/Getty Imageshide caption The small wooden desk in the library reading room is \"one of the most important desks in the history of the world,\" Schofield says. Drafts of theCommunist ManifestoandDas Kapital(Capital)were written at that desk, he says, with Marx sitting at one end and Engels at the other. Historian Wildman says the suffering the philosophers witnessed right on their doorstep helped shape their ideas. \"Marx and Engels would literally look out of the window of Chetham's Library where they were writing and see this huge amount of poverty and people suffering,\" she says. Although Engels continued to think a revolution might happen in Manchester, in the end, it never did. But what was happening in the city was linked to and inspired othermovementshappening in the mid-19th century in Europe. \"There were waves of rebellions throughout Europe in the mid-19th century,\" Wildman says. \"People were picking up on similar processes and on the desire to have better standards of living.\" Politicians began to pay attention, too. \"What Engels and Marx did was turn the working class into a political commodity,\" says local historian Glinert. \"For the first time, there was a class analysis of society which people hadn't really thought of in the past.\" In Manchester'sPeople's History Museum, dedicated to working-class history, the world'soldest-survivingtrade union banner hangs alongside posters linking international workers' struggles from the 19th century to the present day. What began in Manchester with an 1819 massacre of peasants gave birth to the world's first workers' movements,trade unionsand an idea of equality that has fueled social justice and labor movements around the world. The museum charts a history of international solidarity with workers that started in Manchester and that has reverberated through political discourse ever since.

    "title": "Supreme Court blocks, for now, new deportations under 18th century wartime law",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States arrive at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, Sunday, March 30, 2025.Cristian Hernandez/APhide caption The Supreme Court on Saturday blocked, for now, the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th century wartime law. In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order of this court.\" Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The high court acted in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals. \"We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email. On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to act. One of the judges said the case raised legitimate concerns but he could not issue an order. The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act. In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to President Donald Trump's use of the act. The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended it gave them power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status. Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas promptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet. But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. In one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials, was told to sign papers in English even though the client only spoke Spanish. \"ICE informed F.G.M. that these papers were coming from the President, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,\" Brown wrote. Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport. With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless Friday. \"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\" Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed criminal contempt by disobeying his initial deportation ban. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated. Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then. ICE said it would not comment on the litigation. Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there. Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its notorious main prison. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Jasmine Garsd The U.S. Supreme Court is seen near sunset in Washington on Oct. 18, 2018.Manuel Balce Ceneta/APhide caption The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting any Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center, in west-central Texas, under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century wartime law that allows for accelerated removal of foreigners deemed a threat by authorities. \"The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,\" the court said in a brief early Saturday note. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. The American Civil Liberties Union late Friday had warned that immigration authorities were moving to quickly restart removals underthe Alien Enemies Actdespite the previous Supreme Court's restrictions on how it can use the act. Late Thursday a group of Venezuelans detained at the Bluebonnet Detention Center was advised that they would be immediately deported. ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told NPR that migrants at the Anson, Texas, facility were being loaded onto buses for removal late Friday. This came despite a recentU.S. Supreme Court rulingthat found the Trump administration could continue deporting under the act — only if detainees are given due process to challenge their removal. The government says 137 migrants accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including a group of men sent to a prison in El Salvador, have already been deported under the Alien Enemies Act. NPR was unable to independently confirm the number of people who may be deported from the Bluebonnet Detention facility. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to provide details or answer additional questions about the case. \"We are not going to reveal the details of counter terrorism operations, and we are complying with the Supreme Court's ruling,\" said Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin. The ACLU late Friday had asked the Supreme Court for an emergency injunction and stay of removal. The group asked that migrants being subjected to the Alien Enemies Act be given at least 30 days advance notice. \"The notice the government is providing does not remotely comply with the Supreme Court's order,\" the ACLU argued in the request for an injunction. \"At a minimum, the notice must be translated into a language that individuals can understand. Most importantly, there must be sufficient time for individuals to seek review. As during World War II, that notice must be at least 30 days in advance of any attempted removal.\" The group also unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to halt any new deportations. At an emergency hearing Friday evening federal Judge James Boasberg seemed to agree the forms migrants were asked to sign regarding the Act had no information regarding their right to contest and were inadequate. \"It doesn't say you have the right to contest, you have the right to challenge anything. It's just telling you here's the notice, you're getting removed,\" Boasberg told Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign. \"That certainly seems problematic to me.\" The Justice Department argued that the notice complies with the previous Supreme Court's guidance on the issue. Federal judges in several districts have blocked the deportation of people using the Alien Enemies Act. TheACLU suedthe administration again this week, in order to block deportations at several additional Texas detention centers, including Bluebonnet, a facility in west-central Texas about halfway between Lubbock and Fort Worth. The ACLU alleges that in recent days, many Venezuelan migrants were specifically brought to Bluebonnet for that reason. The government denies this. Boasberg earlier this weekfound probable causethat the Trump administration committed criminal contempt by disobeying his ruling, only to see the Supreme Court rule that only judges where migrants are being held have jurisdiction to halt their removal.

To see if some species of lichen had what it takes to survive on Mars, a team of researchers led by botanist Kaja Skubała used the Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences to expose the lichen speciesDiploschistes muscorumandCetrarea aculeatato simulate Mars conditions. “Our study is the first to demonstrate that the metabolism of the fungal partner in lichen symbiosis was active while being in a Mars-like environment,” the researchers said in astudyrecently published in IMA Fungus. “X-rays associated with solar flares and SEPs reaching Mars should not affect the potential habitability of lichens on this planet.” Martian ionizing radiation is threatening to most forms of life because it can cause damage at the cellular level. It can also get in the way of physical, genetic, morphological, and biochemical processes, depending on the organism and radiation level. Lichens have an edge when it comes to survival. They share characteristics with other organisms that can handle high levels of stress, including a low metabolism, not needing much in the way of nutrition, and longevity. Much like tardigrades, lichens can stay in a desiccated state for extended periods until they are rehydrated. Other lichen adaptations to extreme conditions include metabolites that screen out UV rays and melanin pigments that also defend against radiation. Because the effects of UV radiation on lichens have been studied before, Skubała decided to focus on something that had not previously been explored, which is what happens to them when exposed to ionizing radiation while they are still metabolically active (lichens need water to keep their metabolism going). To do so, the researchers sprayed the lichens with water for hydration to keep them in a metabolically active state. Each species spent five hours inside a dark chamber with simulated Martian conditions. This meantlow pressure, low humidity, an “atmosphere” that was mostly carbon dioxide, and temperatures that started at a daytime 18° C (64° F), then plunged down to a nighttime minus-26° C (minus-14° F). X-ray radiation levels in the chamber were similar to those on the surface of Mars when there is strong solar activity, though solar flares and fluctuations in solar wind make actual Martian levels unpredictable. When the lichens emerged from their simulated Martian habitat, both species were found to have retained some moisture despite a lack of humidity, so the researchers assumed that at least some metabolic activity was going on in both the fungal and photosynthetic components. Earlier, the photosynethic component of lichenshad been testedduring exposure to ionizing radiation, but not the fungal component. Lichens that are not dehydrated aremore prone to damagefrom ionizing radiation. Both fungal and algal cells in metabolically active lichens have repair mechanisms they can activate, butD. muscorumwas much more resistant to the radiation thanC. aculeata.This species suffered lessoxidative stress, meaning that fewerreactive oxygen speciesbuilt up in its cells. These unstable molecules contain oxygen and can severely damage cellular components and even lead to cell death. Other adverse Martian conditions, such as an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, can affect lichen metabolism but not completely shut it down. The fungal component needs oxygen so it can metabolize carbohydrates, but the metabolic processes of both species kept going even though there was little oxygen available. The researchers think it is also possible that the photosynthetic portion of the lichens might have produced oxygen that the fungal components could use. Surprisingly, the process of photosynthesis was not that sensitive to X-rays in dark conditions. Fluorescence imaging measurements of chlorophyll concentrations showed that the photosynthetic component ofD. muscorumremained undamaged throughout the experiment, while that inC. aculeataexperienced a decrease in chlorophyll when exposed to X-rays. Both lichens were frozen after the experiment. When thawed, both became photosynthetically active again, withC. aculeataquickly regaining its initial chlorophyll levels. Whether lichens can survive on Mars really depends on the species. Skubała thinks that further research is needed to determine all the features and adaptations that make them likely to survive in the face of intense ionizing radiation. “Our findings lay the foundation for future studies, including long-term exposure experiments on the Mars surface,” she and her teamsaidoptimistically in the same paper. We haven’t yet intentionally landed an Earth organism on Mars, and it will likely be a long time before we can carry out anin situexperiment on the red planet. WhyD. muscorumwas more effective at mitigating radiation damage is not completely known. After the experiment, concentrations of antioxidants (especiallyglutathione) were found to have increased during exposure. Glutathione can also limit cellular damage in humans and other organisms. It may help a lichen to survive ionizing radiation, but that doesn’t mean it can provide equivalent protection to us—we should think twice before we attempt to put boots on Mars. IMA Fungus, 2025.

    "title": "Ryan Coogler on Sinners‘ Personal Post-Credits Scene",
    "article_text": "SinnersÂhas mainly been advertised on the prospect ofMichael B. Jordanplaying twins and going up against vampires. Both of those are in the film, but its true protagonist is Sammie (Miles Caton), the SmokeStack twins’ young cousin. Much of the events center on his musical talents and how its brings the people of 1930s Clarksdale to the twins’ juke jointâincluding the vampires that just wanna join in on the festivities. But what becomes a polite request to be let in turns into a hostile takeover, and then the rest of the movie happens. After all’s said and done, Sammie’s the only human to survive the night at the juke joint. Instead of returning to his family and leaving music behind, Sammie leaves town altogether and becomes a famous blues player. Flash forward to 1992, and the older Sammie (played by real-world Chicago guitarist Buddy Guy) has just performed when two familiar faces show up: Stack and his girlfriend Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), who were both turned in 1932 and skipped town as the other vampires before the sun burnt up the other vampires. Smoke let Stack live on the promise he leave Sammie alone, but the ageless pair just had to see how the preacher boy was doing for himself. The vampires offer to turn him so he can live forever and keep on playing, but he kindly refuses, and bids them farewell with some old school blues like he used to play back in the day. Speaking toEntertainment Weekly, director/writer Ryan Coogler revealed he initially had trouble shooting the scene. When he asked Jordan what Stack would do in this moment, his longtime collaborator decided to put his fake fangs in and get in close to Guy’s neck. Jordan was already wearing his 90s costume and contact lenses for Stack’s glowing eyes, and Guy’s 88 years old, so Coogler initially freaked out. But it was just a hug, and quite an eye-opening moment for the filmmaker. “Bro, I broke down in crying tears because I realized this whole movie was about that,” Coogler said. “In many ways, it was a reason for the movie. It was about me not saying goodbye to my uncle. […] The scene is incredibly important to the narrative in many ways, and the movie’s driving towards that moment.” He’s previously describedSinnersas alove letterto his family history and in particular his uncle James, who passed in 2015 as he was in post-production on the firstCreed. Upon hearing his uncle died, Coogler remembered “feeling like shit. It was something I felt I had to reckon with.” Loss is a major theme for several characters inSinners,several of whom recently lost family or remember those who’ve been gone for some time. Smoke dies thinking of his estranged wife Annie (Wunmi Osaku), who died during the vampire attack, and their baby daughter, who passed before the events of the film. Coogler’s loss drove him to the blues music his late uncle used to love, including Guy. When he was alive, his uncle loved “listening to blues records on vinyl and listening to or watching the San Francisco Giants play baseball. If the music was good and you had enough to drink, you might get a story out of him.” As Coogler told EW, going back to the blues years later felt like “conjuring [James’] spirit,” which came to inform how Sammie’s musicâlike other music of the African diasporaâcan summon spirits of the past and future, as seen earlier in the film. For Sammie, that night at the juke joint was the best of his life, and he felt alive playing for the patrons. The same is true for Stack, since it was the last time he saw Smoke, got to see the sun, and felt “truly free.” Despite music ultimately being what led to that traumatic night, it’s what brought them together then and now for the final time, and it can keep loved ones alive long after they’re gone.

    "title": "Dave Filoni Explains the Impact Losing Ray Stevenson Had on Ahsoka Season 2",
    "article_text": "WhenRay Stevenson died,Ahsokaseason two almost died with it. Dave Filoni, the show’s creator, was at Star WarsCelebration Japan this weekend and did a panelabout his Disney+ show. Along the way, the topic of Stevenson’s passing came up and Filoni got visibly emotional. Stevenson played fallen Jedi Master Baylan Skoll, a character that clearlyhad a huge role to playin the future of the seriesâhowever, Filoni revealed it went much deeper than that. “Season two was obviously a big challenge anyway, but it was a particularly big challenge because of a losing Ray,” Filoni said during the panel. “He was just the greatest person and such a great spirit on the show. I knew Ray from working in voice acting with him, I just always instantly connected with him and thought, ‘When I make live-action, I need this guy to portray a powerful Jedi Knight that have had in mind.’ And he did not disappoint in any way. Ray was the most beautiful person on screen and off, he was wonderful to all of us. However big of a loss you think it is, it’s bigger.” “It was a challenge for me even to consider continuing [Ahsoka] for a while,” he continued. “But I have a great support group with Jon [Favreau] and Rosario [Dawson] and I found a way. I had Ray in my head and I’m grateful for all the conversations with him about Baylan. So I understood what to do, it just took a while to get there. But I’m very confident now that Ray would be happy with the direction that weâve chosen.” Season one ended with Baylan on a personal quest to find deeper meaning in the Force, with Ahsoka and Sabine hot on his tail. But according to Filoni, the reason for Baylan existing is more than just as a bad guy. “The character was meant to be important,” Filoni said. “He’s meant to be the parallel to Ahsoka in every way. If thereâs a light, thereâs a dark and Baylan is representing a different journey of a Jedi that’s lost his way. As much as [Ahsoka] represents one thatâs kind of walked away from the Order, so did he. And that parallel is something that must continue.” Knowing he wanted to continue the story to honor Stevenson, Filoni and executive producer Jon Favreau knew there was only one option: recast the character. And aspreviously reported, they found their man in Scottish actor Rory McCann. “In essence, because Ray performed it so iconically, there is a blueprint for what this character should be,” Filoni said. “And then I talked to Jon and Jon and I decided that we just needed to find the right person that would not just understand the character, but also understand a bit of what Ray brought to it as well. It’s something imperceptible. Something just in the eyes, to be honest, and I think we both felt very fortunate that we met Rory McCann. So Rory will be taking over the role.” Filoni said that McCann, best known for roles inGame of ThronesandHot Fuzz, is coming in with one main goal: make the legacy of Ray Stevenson live on. “[Rory] takes it very seriously. He’s a big man with a big heart, and he has such respect for Ray and what he brought to this. I know this sole focus is not letting Ray down and not letting you guys down. Youâll love them, and we love him and I love what he’s taking on. It’s a big deal, so the force is with him.” Ahsokaseason two starts shooting by the end of April.

    "title": "Final Destination Bloodlines Posters Will Convince You to Stay Indoors",
    "article_text": "It’s been a long time since we’ve had aÂFinal DestinationÂmovie, and next month’sÂBloodlinesÂlooks at bringing back the franchise with a bang. You come to these movies forthe kills, and some posters recently released by New Line tease how bloody things are about to go down. Life isn’t just a death trap like the tagline says, it’s also right in your backyard. Careful where you step, eat, and jump! Like the previous movies,ÂFinal Destination Bloodlinescenters on a group of people who cheated death and now find themselves dying in elaborate ways as the universe balances the scales. Gifted with the foresight to see how everyone at their house party is about to die, Stefani (Kaitlyn Juana Santana) narrowly prevents them from meeting a bad end. But there’s an extra twist to things: her grandmother Iris (Gabrielle Rose/Brec Bassinger) also narrowly evaded death decades earlier, meaning fate’s coming after the Lewis and Campbell families with extreme prejudice. New Line also released screenshots of the various Lewis and Campbell family members before they become death’s punching bags. Thanks to the trailer and Cinemacon, we already know two deaths inÂBloodlineswill involve a lawnmower and avending machine(partially), but those might be the least painful ways to go when all’s dead and done. Sadly, this film also marks the last appearance of the late Tony Todd, who’s played the all-knowing mortician William Bludworth since the originalFinal Destination. It’ll reportedly delve into his backstory, though it’s unclear what that all entails. Final Destination BloodlinesÂkills it in theaters on May 16. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Controversial DeSantis-Linked Charity’s Zoom Meeting Hijacked by Porn and Nazis",
    "article_text": "The Hope Florida Foundation was supposed to be the kind of organization that would help Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ wife, Casey, build her resume for future political aspirations. It’s starting to look like it’ll sink them, instead. In the latest turn in the story of the charity-turned-trainwreck, a virtual board meeting for the DeSantis-backed organization was derailed by trolls who flooded the Zoom call with porn and Nazi symbols, according to areport from the Tallahassee Democrat. The meeting of Hope Florida Foundation’s leadership was scheduled for the morning of April 17, but,per the Tallahassee Democrat’s account, was quickly interrupted because the members didn’t know how to prevent audience members from sharing their screens. That led to folks hanging in the crowd stealing the show, displaying all sorts of unwanted content. The meeting was paused, and a “technical difficulties â please stand by” message was displayed while the admins tried (and failed) to get a handle on things before ending the affair altogether. When they tried to restart the meeting, it failed because, according to a pop-up message seen by people trying to join the second attempt, “Host has another meeting in progress.” So, about the “why” of that meeting, which did eventually happen six hours after its scheduled time,according to the Tampa Bay Times. TheHope Florida Foundationis in a bit of hot water. The organization, which was started by Casey DeSantis to reduce government spending on social welfare programs by replacing them with faith-based organizations and non-profits, is at the center of a probe over an allegedly illegal donation that is rapidly unraveling the board and even has Ron DeSantis trying to distance himself from his wife. It all started with a suspicious $10 million donation made to Hope Florida, which came from Medicaid care operator Centene. That big check was part of a larger $67 million out-of-court settlement between the company and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.According to Politico, Centene was directed to put $10 million of that settlement directly in the coffers of Hope Florida Foundation, which may have amounted to an illegal transfer of funds that should have gone to the state. That $10 million wasallegedly used by Hope Floridato help two organizationsâSave Our Society from Drugs and Secure Floridaâs Futureâwith their efforts to defeat a ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana in the state, which ultimatelyfailed to garner the 60% supportneeded to pass last November. Those donations from Hope Florida to the groups were reportedly encouraged by Governor DeSantisâ then-chief of staff James Uthmeier, and,according to the Tampa Bay Times, those two groups went on to make significant donations to the political action committee controlled by Uthmeier, who wasnamed Florida attorney generalearlier this year. The web is already pretty tangled, and that’s just the start of it. Republican state representative Alex Andrade hasaccusedUthmeier and Hope Florida of engaging in fraud and money laundering, and they don’t seem to have any good answers for those accusations. In the initially hijacked meeting, Hope Florida president Joshua Hayadmittedthat he couldn’t account for the $10 million donation, nor what it was used for. “We have no monitoring procedures. We have no staff,” he said on the call. The developing scandal appears like it might put an end to Casey DeSantis’ political ambitions before they even start, as it wasexpected that she would launch her own bidto become Governor of Florida in 2026 after her husband’s second term comes to an end. Now, Ron seems like he’s making sure that it’s only her career that is over. Earlier this week, when asked about the situation at Hope Florida, DeSantis took the opportunity to throw his wife under the bus and back it up just to make sure he hit her. “I really had no ownership of this,” hetold the media. “I didn’t devise it. She devised it. She set the vision. She executed the vision.” He did say that the organization has had “positive results,â but that seems like a cherry on top of a shit sundae that he served to her. Sure seems like he’s not interested in being the first man. That said, being an alleged fraudster is anything but a career-ender in Florida. Republican Rick Scott was the CEO of a company that was hit with thebiggest fine ever for Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and he managed to win not just two terms as Florida’s governor but is still representing the state in the US Senate.

    "title": "Congress Is Investigating 23andMe’s Handling of Personal Data",
    "article_text": "Republican lawmakers associated with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce are probing the 23andMe bankruptcy out of concern for Americans’ DNA information. The troubled genomics company has been in a downward spiral ever since it suffered an unfortunate data breach in 2023. The company has since endured a maelstrom of conflict and controversy, including layoffs, litigation, and a plummeting financial valuation. In March, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and has been looking for a buyer for its genetic data business ever since. On Friday, Congressmen Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Gary Palmer (R-AL),sent a letterto 23andMe making several inquiries about the company’s handling of Americans’ data. The letter notes that a judge “recently ruled 23andMe has the right to sell the sensitive medical and genetic information of its 15 million customers, which is considered to be the companyâs most valuable asset” and states that, with âthe lack of a federal comprehensive data privacy and security law, we write to express our great concern about the safety of Americansâ most sensitive personal information.â The letter notes that some customers have reported difficulties in deleting their accounts and information, and asks the company to explain how many of those deletion requests have been fulfilled. It also asks whether the company has a “vetting process” in place to determine whether its prospective buyer has a “history of implementing data security protections and compliance with sectoral, state, or any other data privacy and security laws.” It should be noted that while the Republican letter complains of a lack of a “federal comprehensive data privacy” law, lawmakers have only themselves to blame for this, given the fact that there have been multiple (failed) attempts to pass such a law. Gizmodo reached out to 23andMe for comment. Concern for 23andMe user data may be high, although the company has repeatedly promised to continue protecting customers’ information. Apress releasefrom March notes that to “constitute a qualified bid, potential buyers must, among other requirements, agree to comply with 23andMeâs consumer privacy policy and all applicable laws with respect to the treatment of customer data.â In other words, the data privacy assurances that the company currently promises will be carried over to whatever company buys the business. You may feel that doesn’t amount to much, given the fact that the company has already allowed user information to be compromised via its previous data leak. If so, you can still ask the company to delete your information via the process describedhere, courtesy of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

    "title": "A Meteorite From Alaska Challenges Theory of How Earth Got Its Water",
    "article_text": "Water is essential to life as we know it, but scientists are still unsure about how it originated on Earth. One theory is that asteroids express-shipped us hydrogen, essential to the formation of water molecules, by colliding with our planet in its early history. New research, however, suggests Earth already had enough hydrogen of its own, thank you very much. Researchers in the UK discovered previously unknown quantities of hydrogen in a type of meteorite called an enstatite chondrite. I know what you’re thinking: What does hydrogen on a meteorite have to do with the origin of water on Earth? The composition of enstatite chondrite meteorites closely resembles that of Earth 4.55 billion years ago. So if the meteorite has its own source of hydrogen, then early Earth likely did, tooâmeaning it could have produced water without the help of foreign emissaries. âA fundamental question for planetary scientists is how Earth came to look like it does today. We now think that the material that built our planetâwhich we can study using these rare meteoritesâwas far richer in hydrogen than we thought previously,” James Bryson of the University of Oxford’s Department of Earth Sciences said in a universitystatement. “This finding supports the idea that the formation of water on Earth was a natural process, rather than a fluke of hydrated asteroids bombarding our planet after it formed.â Bryson, a co-author on thestudypublished earlier this month in Icarus, and his colleagues investigated an enstatite chondrite meteorite from Alaska known as LAR 12252. While a previousstudyof the same meteorite had already found traces of hydrogen, those traces may have resulted from Earthly contamination, according to the statement. The scientists behind the new studyÂ speculated that LAR 12252 might host large quantities of “native” hydrogen bonded to sulfur. As a result, they used an intense beam of X-rays to search the meteorite for sulfur compounds. While studying the matter, called thematrix, surrounding one of the chondrules (tiny spherical components), the team hit the jackpot: hydrogen sulfide. They discovered that the entire matrix had large amounts of the compound, amounting to five times as much hydrogen as that found in the non-crystalline parts of the meteorite’s chondrules, where the previous study had already detected traces of hydrogen. Significantly, parts of the meteorite that had obviously experienced terrestrial contamination, like rust, had little or no hydrogen. This implies that the hydrogen sulfide in the matrix is most likely intrinsic. Since the meteorite’s composition is analogous to that of Earth 4.55 billion years ago, this indicates that by the time Earth was being struck by asteroids, it would have had enough of its own hydrogen to eventually produce the amount of water our planet hosts today, according to the researchers. “We were incredibly excited when the analysis told us the sample contained hydrogen sulfideâjust not where we expected,” said Tom Barrett, lead author of the study and a scientist from the University of Oxford’s Department of Earth Sciences. “Because the likelihood of this hydrogen sulfide originating from terrestrial contamination is very low, this research provides vital evidence to support the theory that water on Earth is nativeâthat it is a natural outcome of what our planet is made of.” Water is essential to all known living creatures. As such, by providing new insight on how Earth got its water, the study also sheds light on the enduring mystery of the origin of life on our planet. meteoritesorigin of lifeWater Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A study of thousands of space rocks may explain why a common type in space is so uncommon on our planet. The study supports a new take on a controversial hypothesis from the 1950s. Researchers manipulated water waves to move ping pong balls with a level of precision that seems straight out of a sci-fi movie. A rocky stretch in Western Australia's Pilbara, near Earth's earliest-confirmed lifeforms, was hit by a meteorite about 3.5 billion years ago. Water was present just a couple hundred million years after the Big Bang, according to a new study, shaking up the timeline of planetary evolution.

    "title": "Amazon Is Going All In, The Newest Echo Speaker Hits a Record Low in 2025 Despite Rising Tariffs",
    "article_text": "If youâve been thinking about bringing Alexa into your home, now here’s your chance to do it. Amazonâs latest most premiumEcho speakerÂ (don’t confuse it with the more basic Echo Dot and Echo Spot models…) which features premium sound and smart home capabilities is currentlyon flash sale for just $64, which is a full 35% off its regular $99 price. With tariff hikes expecting to hit electronics costs across the US, this might be your time to get one of the best Alexa speakers available at such a low price. See at Amazon This Echo is more than a standard speaker and it’s presented as “a smart home gateway and entertainment centerpiece” in its own right which is designed to fill spacious bedrooms, living rooms or kitchens with immersive audio. Amazon has improved the sound experience and provides detailed sound that adjusts automatically to the acoustics of your room. Streaming lossless HD audio fromAmazonMusic or your go-to playlists fromSpotify,Echo makes your music sound its absolute best. The Amazon Echo’s abilities go far beyond music: WithAlexa built-in, you can control your entire smart home system with your voice. The integrated smart home hub supports Zigbee and Matter, so you can add and control compatible locks, lights and sensors with ease. Want to start your morning routine with lights turning on, your coffee brewer starting, and your favorite news briefing playingâall triggered by motion as you enter the room? The Echo makes it all simple. Alexa is always at your service,waiting to set timers, reminders, or alarms, check the weather or answer silly questions. Far-field microphones on the Echo ensure Alexa picks up your voice from across the room even as music is playing. Families will also love the ability to place hands-free calls, drop in on other Echo speakers throughout the house or call out others dinner’s ready as another method of connection. Privacy is Amazon’s number one concern and theEcho has multiple layers of privacy controls integratedÂ including a clear microphone off button. Amazon maintains that it never sells your personal information, and you always have control over your data. Why this is so pressing an issue is… timing. Since tariffs on electronics are about to increase in the coming weeks, price rises have been expected by analysts on the prices of speakers and many other gadgets. The current Easter flash sale by Amazon might just be a way to shift current stock prior to changeovers becoming effective so waiting could end up meaning very high costs for the same piece of hardware. In fact, this may actually be the last opportunity to own an Alexa-enabled speaker at this price point, and it may be a very long time before prices go that low again.

    "title": "Good News! Endangered Sea Turtle Populations May Be Recovering",
    "article_text": "Finally, some good news: endangered sea turtles are recovering because ome conservation efforts seem to be working. Apaperpublished earlier this month in Inter-Research Science Publisher reveals that more than half of the 48 surveyed “regional management units” (RMUs), or groups of sea turtles that share the same habitat and face similar population threats from around the world, show signs of recovery. While some individual species are still at risk of extinction, the global trends highlight a heartening improvement. The researchers, including wildlife ecologist Bryan Wallace from Ecolibrium wrote that the survey “results demonstrate the apparent efficacy of many existing conservation strategies,” and that it highlighted “several cases of favorable â and improving â conservation status at the RMU scale.” According to the results the population of those RMUs increased “on average” andÂ “threat impact scores improved for nearly twice as many RMUs (53%) as worsened (28%).” There are only seven species of sea turtles, also known as marine turtles, in the world. Six of them areclassified as threatened or endangered, with the seventhâflatback turtlesânot includedbecause of insufficient data. Despite the limited number of species, sea turtles live in many of the world’s oceans across numerous diverse habitats, according to the study. Unsurprisingly, most threats to sea turtles are human-caused, including climate change, fishing bycatch, habitat loss, plastic pollution, collisions with sea vessels, coastal developments, and poaching for consumption and tortoiseshell trading. There are also nuances to this promising new data. The Pacific Ocean hosts most sea turtle populations facing high-risk threats, while a majority of the populations with low-risk threats are in the Atlantic. Furthermore, “the sole Kempâs ridleyLepidochelys kempiiRMU had the highest species-level risk score, while risk and threat scores for leatherbacks were the highest among species with multiple RMUs,” the researchers wrote. In fact, Kemp’s ridleys are themost endangered sea turtles in the world, according to the National Park Service, and leatherback sea turtles are suffering fromdeclining nesting populations in the Pacific. In the US,all sea turtles are now protected by the Endangered Species Act, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)bans international trade of sea turtle species and their parts. âMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some havenât,â Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who did not participate in the research, told theAssociated Press. âOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.â While it’s important to keep a realistic view of humanity’s persistent harmful impact on sea turtles, the survey is proof that conservation endeavors bring about positive change and will hopefully inspire further efforts. We can’t fix everything we destroy, but when we try to we get real positive results. Marine biologymarine conservationmarine turtles Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Wealthy Collectors Are Snatching Up T. Rex Fossils, Leaving Scientists Behind",
    "article_text": "Tyrannosaurus rexmay be the most famous dinosaur to ever roam the Earth, but these days, itâs at the center of a very modern problem: the luxury fossil trade. According to a studypublishedinPalaeontologia Electronica, commercial fossil collecting has walled off so manyT. rexfossils to scientists that it has severely hindered the scientific record. The study reveals a sobering stat: of the 141 scientifically usefulT. rexfossils known to exist, over halfâ71 specimensâare in private or commercial hands, rather than public museums or accredited research institutions. That’s a major problem, because in science, replicability is everything. Even if researchers once studied a fossil, its scientific value drops if future teams canât access it. If a fossil is locked in a collectorâs mansion or a storage unit, other scientists canât study it. They canât confirm findings, test new hypotheses, or build on the research. And this isnât a fringe issue. Since the blockbuster auction of âSueâ theT. rexin 1997 for $8.36 million,T. rexfossils have become the Picassos of the paleontology worldâhigh-status art pieces fetching many millions of dollars at auction. In 2020,Christie’s auctioned off Stan, one of the most completeT. rexskeletons ever found, for a record-shattering $31.8 million, to a museum in Abu Dhabi. That kind of price tag puts aT. rexfossil far out of reach for most museums, unless a philanthropic donor steps in (which, letâs be real, isnât the norm). Last year, Stan lost its title as the most expensive fossil when billionaire Ken Griffinpurchasedthe Stegosaurus fossil dubbed “Apex” for $44.6 million; Griffin loaned Apex to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where it is currently on display. But of the fiveÂT. rexfossils sold at auction, only one lot (that of Sue) was purchased by a museum. Commercial fossil collectors argue that theyâre rescuing specimens from erosion and uncovering more fossils than public institutions. And technically, theyâre right: Paleontologist Thomas D. Carr, who authored the study, found that commercial outfits have discovered nearly 2.4 times moreT. rexspecimens than public institutions since the early 1990s. But hereâs the catchâonly 11% of those commercially discovered fossils are in a public trust where science can actually benefit from them. The rest are put up in living rooms, in storage units to accrue value, or otherwise made to serve other interests than science. Even worse, many fossils being bought privately or commercially are the most scientifically valuable: juveniles and subadults, which make up the least understood phase ofT. rexdevelopment. Twenty percent of privately held fossils fall into this category, according to Carr. Without access to these specimens, scientists canât build a reliable picture of howT. rexgrew, matured, or even whether the species showed sexual dimorphism (differences between males and females). According to previous teams, a sample size of 70 to 100 specimens of adult nonavian dinosaurs are required to measure the likelihood of sexual dimorphism in a population with a high degree of certainty. Carr’s study also takes issue with the trend of publishing peer-reviewed studies based on privately owned fossilsâessentially giving scientific legitimacy to inaccessible data. And while defenders of the market argue that fossils often end up in museums eventually, Carrâs data suggests otherwise: only a tiny fraction of privately heldT. rexfossils are ever donated or sold to public institutions. “So far, none of the privately ownedÂT. rexfossils have been donated to, or offered for purchase to a public trust, by a private estate,” Carr wrote. “However, not enough time has elapsed to assess if transfer ofT. rexfossils from a private collection to a public trust will be a trend or ever happen.” T. rexis long extinct, but scientifically speaking, its fossils are becoming an endangered species. Unless scientific understanding of the terrible reptiles becomes a greater priority than the value of the dollar, we may see the science ofT. rexgo the way of the dodo.

The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix starts just before Easter. We’re looking at some of the most amazing tracks, with many tricky curves and long-haul, high-speed sections. Looking to stream the F1 Saudi Arabia Grand Prix for free?Â Well, you’ll find no luck on conventional streaming platforms. Luckily, there’s a free channel that streams the F1 Saudi Arabia GP live and doesn’t even require an account. Let’s see which channel is in question, how to access it, and when to tune into not miss a single beat. If you don’t want to spend a superfluous amount of money on F1 TV Pro, here’s an alternative âSRF. SRF is a popular Swiss TV channel that broadcasts many sports events.Free live streams of Formula 1 racesare among them. SRF isn’t an English channel, and there’s no way to get English commentary. However,it broadcasts the Saudi Arabian GP online for free in Full HD, without a subscription. You don’t even need an account. The trick is,SRF works exclusively in Switzerland. Thus, if you’re in the USA, the UK, Canada, India, or any other country, you’ll be met with a geo-restriction.We explained how to overcome geo-blocksrecently, and it’s simple. The solution that many people use revolves around changing their IP. The IP address is tied to the user’s location. When the IP changes to Switzerland, for example, the user can access SRF, and by extension, this free live stream. According to thousands of people online, VPNs are particularly handy for this purpose.NordVPN, as the most popular VPN in the world, is frequently mentioned. When you examine it, it makes a lot of sense. Watch the Saudi Arabian GP With NordVPN This VPN is used outside Switzerlandbecause it offers servers in this country. This means it can alsoassign a Swiss IP address. Plus, it doesn’t limit users’ bandwidth and offersmarket-leading speeds for Ultra HD streaming. While it’s not free, people are well aware of its30-day refund policy. It’s unconditional, which allows users to obtain a full refund within this period. This, in turn, makes watching the Saudi Arabian GP online for free anywhere much easier. The user cansubscribe and install the VPN on every device. Once they connect to the Swiss server, access to SRF is permitted. Once the race ends on the 20th of April, the user canrequest (and get) a refund from NordVPN. This is a surefire way of streaming the race for free anywhere. Now that you know how to watch the F1 Saudi Arabia online for free, let’s see when to tune in. As is the case with previous Grand Prix races, the main race is on Sunday, while free practices and qualifying are on Saturday and Friday. To watch exclusively the race, tune in on Sunday. However, if you’d like to follow through the entire weekend, here’s a schedule with dates and times (EST, PT, CET): So, there you go. You don’t have to watch a replay of the entire thing when you can watch the F1 Saudi Arabian GP live on a free channel like SRF. The trick we explained is used by thousands of people for other races, too. However,unblocking any foreign TV channel, including SRF, often goes against the channel’s terms and conditions.Gizmodo doesn’t promote such violations.

Now there’s a laser vape. Meet Luminaryâs The Beam, a handheld, pocket-sized vaporizer that uses a class-1 laser you can actually see to heat weed extracts. I thought for sure it was a gimmick. Turns out, itâs rather ingenious for a first-generation product. Letâs start with the basic. From the outside the Beam doesnât look much different from other handheld vaporizers. It has a black metal body that measures,4 x 2 x 1 inchesand weighs 7 ounces. It disappeared into the front pocket of my (fairly skinny) jeans without issue. If you pop out the bottom compartment youâll see a little cylinder cartridge in a holder, and thatâs where you put your goodies. Itâs a modular system so you can swap in thicker concentrates or thinner oils (more on that in a minute). The device has just one button for turning it on/off, adjusting temperature, and firing the eponymous beam. On the other side is a glass window where you can actually see the blue laser beam streak through the vapor-filled chamber, and yes, it is very cool looking. Luminary Beam It's finicky but who cares? There's a LASER. Pros Cons But letâs back up here: Why a laser, aside from looking totally bitchinâ, man? Thereâs actually a functional reason for it. Most concentrate vaporizers (including all the disposable pens and such) use metal wires or coils to heat up the oil. This can cause a number of issues, including metal residue and corrosion, uneven heating (and burning), terpene (the compounds in your weed that gives it its flavor and some psychoactive effects) breakdown, and a notorious and unpleasant metallic taste. This cartridge system doesnât have any metal in it (which also means no e-waste). Itâs just pure light hitting your product of choice against a black ceramic tile. The result is you get unadulterated flavor, even heating, and very smooth vapor (especially at the lower temperatures). Opening the box is at first a little overwhelming because itâs pretty packed with accessories. Thereâs a metal tool for loading and stirring, a silicone sleeve thing (that I later learned is to hold the metal tool), some cleaning tools, one cartridge for oils (of the runnier variety), one extra cartridge for concentrates (of the stickier variety), instructions, and a USB charging cable. The vaporizer itself has one cartridge already in it. You going to want to read those instructions, because the worst thing I can say about this device is that it isnât very intuitive to use. As I was going through it I found myself feeling very grateful that I was sober, but once you get the hang of it, itâs actually pretty easy. For the concentrates cartridge, use the little metal tool to scoop up some thicker concentrate about the size of a grain of rice. Then you play your own little game of Operation to try and get that goop down onto the tiny black ceramic plate in the middle of the white ceramic cartridge. Itâs certainly a bit fiddly. Youâll scrape the goop off on the sides of the little window, but the laser canât really get to it there, so youâll want to use the pokey end of the tool to try and push the stuff down into the little hole. Then you reinsert the cartridge into the base plate and fit it back into the vaporizer. The concentrates cartridge has a silicone cylinder at the base of it, which is just for holding more concentrate, making the whole thing a bit more portable. The oil cartridge is a bit more work up front, but then it stays ready to use for a while, more like a vape pen. You screw the top off and load your oil into the (food-grade) plastic cylinder at the bottom (I was told this will be upgraded to borosilicate glass in the next version). This is for runnier oils, that typically come in a syringe, so loading it in is easy enough, and itâs designed to hold 0.95 grams of material (Luminary is partnering with some farms to release pre-filled cartridges soon). Then you screw the top back on which looks similar to the concentrates top, but has a longer âwickâ that dips down into the container below. I say âwickâ because thatâs how it functions, but it (and the black plate in the concentrates cartridge) is actually a type of ceramic, similar the heat tiles on spacecraft, which nets this thing two extra cool-points. Once your cartridge of choice is loaded, with the device turned off, you hold down the power button to cycle through the different power levels. It starts on white, which is the hottest at about 400 degrees. Then it cycles down to green (lowest power), then blue (medium power). Again, this isnât intuitive, but itâs fine once you get the hang of it. For the next version, Iâd recommend it start at green/low and go up from there rather than starting at the top. Once your power-level is set, you press the button three times rapidly, and the device buzzes to let you know itâs powered-on and ready. Then you just hold down the button, and inhales as the beam blasts into your substance of choice for as long as you hold it down. One of the benefits of the laser system is that itâs instantly on. Other handheld vapes (like the excellentDaVinci ICQ) can take up to a minute for their little ovens to heat up. A laser is either on or off. It can take a few puffs before the goop melts onto the black plate and it really gets going, though, especially the oil cartridge, but once itâs going itâs about as fast as an instant-inhale vape pen. The glass chamber glows blue, and if you blow a little of the vapor back into the mouthpiece, the laser shows up bright and clear, which has some real wow-factor. And whatâs the verdict on how it works? Oh my goodness itâs tasty and smooth. For the oil cartridge I used some fairly liquidy live resin from Jetty Extracts, and I found that the low setting was incredible. It tasted delicious, almost like fresh flower, and I really felt like I was getting all those subtle little terpenes in there. It also hit so smoothly that I wasnât sure if I was getting anything until I exhaled, and a big cloud came out. I also tried it at the medium power level, which produced a thicker cloud, but it was a bit more harsh and chokey for my sweet, innocent lungs. I turned it up to white (in the name of science) and it tasted noticeably burned. I didnât really enjoy the flavor and it made me cough, too (though, in fairness, Iâm not a big smoker or vaper), so I preferred keeping it on low. For the concentrates cartridge I mostly used some more viscous live resin (upwards of 80-percent THC) from Raw Garden, which is known for making extremely pure concentrates, as well as some Live Resin Diamonds (92 to 96-percent pure) I had lying around from a previous review. For those, the medium/blue setting seemed to be the sweet spot. Again, the flavors were absolutely delicious, and the cloud I exhaled was unexpectedly thick, not to mention potent. The vaporizer vibrates every two seconds while the laser is engaged which helps you gauge your dose. Thatâs smart, because it hits so smoothly you might very well over-shoot your first couple of times and become one with your living room furniture. It’s recommended that you take the time to clean the various components fairly frequently. Most important would be the glass lens that the laser shoots through. Obviously, if that gets cloudy thatâs going to reduce the amount of light (and therefore heat) that gets to the goods. It comes with a couple foam-tipped swabs (Q-Tips arenât recommended because cotton fibers may block the lens), which you dib in rubbing alcohol and use to wipe any residue off. Itâs also recommended that you clean the cartridges and cores, also with alcohol, every couple of weeks or so, depending how frequently youâre using it. It’s worth noting that this is a first-generation product (theyâve shipped the first 500 to early backers, and the next batch of 1,000 is in pre-order now, shipping 4/20/2025), and as such there are definitely some things that could be improved. I already mentioned that the oil cartridgeâs reservoir will soon be glass, which is good, since the less plastic that come in contact with your concentrates the better. Personally, Iâd like to see a second button added, so youâve got a separate button for temperature control. More granular temp control would be cool, too (the DaVinci mentioned above can be adjusted in one-degree increments). Iâd really like to see them figure out a way for the metal scooping/stirring tool to be housed within the body of the device itself, too. The silicone sleeve it comes with to attach the tool to the outside of the device adds a fair amount of bulk, and your pockets would get very sticky/stinky since it doesnât cover either end. Luminary is at least in the late-stages of developing an accessory that will help alleviate some of that. Currently in late-stage prototype is a next-gen version of the concentrates cartridge called the âEverDabber.â This would work a bit more like the oil cartridge, where you load a larger reservoir, but once you do you can click a wheel to load the concentrate from the reservoir into the little chamber that ignites. It will dispense in 25-milligram increments, which should help you monitor your dosage, too. This will be an optional accessory, likely launching in the next few months. (Luminary is working on a cartridge for dry herb, too, but thatâs likely much further out). Those gripes aside, this thing is unexpectedly great. I wanted to make sure that it wasnât just me, though, so I brought it to a party where I could test it with three friends who are much heavier smokers. They were loading up a very large bong when I interrupted them and asked if they wanted to try the Beam. I had the oil cartridge in place and the temperature set to low, and all three of them absolutely loved it. They said it was delicious and crazy smooth. All three said they donât normally like oils or concentrates, but this was so good they all wanted to know how much it was. When I told them that itâs $200, they all thought it was well worth it, and I do, too. Beyond looking cool (which it absolutely does) the laser works really well. It heats up fast, it tastes great, and itâs very easy on the throat and lungs. Iâm definitely interested in checking out the EverDabber accessory, which will make fiddling with the metal tool a less-frequent endeavor, and I look forward to seeing what they cook up for the next generation, but for now, this is the smoothest portable concentrate vaporizer Iâve ever used.

    "title": "NASA’s Lucy Spacecraft Set for High-Stakes Asteroid Encounter on Sunday",
    "article_text": "The Lucy mission is on a 12-year journey to explore a peculiar set of asteroids that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. As it journeys to these Trojan asteroids, the probe is preparing for its second stop at the main belt, approaching a mysterious space rock to practice for the main event. NASA’s Lucy spacecraft will carry out a flyby of the small main belt asteroid Donaldjohanson on April 20 at 1:51 p.m. ET, when it will come within an eerily close distance of 596 miles (960 kilometers) from the target. This is Lucy’s second encounter with an asteroid, but it is far more complicated than its first flyby, with NASA describing it as a “comprehensive dress rehearsal for Lucyâs main mission,” the space agency wrote in anews release. Lucy firstlaid its robotic eyes on Donaldjohanson in Februaryand has been tracking the asteroid over the past two months to prepare for its flyby. Donaldjohanson, named after the discoverer of the Lucy hominid fossil, is a carbonaceous asteroid that’s approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) wide. The asteroid is a fragment from a collision that took place around 150 million years ago, making it one of the youngest main belt asteroids ever visited by a spacecraft. Although it’s not a Trojan asteroid, it is located in a convenient spot for Lucy to swing by it on its way to the Jovian system. The upcoming flyby will provide the team with an opportunity to test Lucy’s systems and carry out observations using all three of the spacecraft’s science instruments. The spacecraft will orient itself to track the asteroid around 30 minutes before its close approach. During that time, Lucy’s high-gain antenna, which it uses to communicate with ground control, will be turned away from Earth, suspending communication. For the remainder of the flyby, Lucy will be on its own, autonomously rotating using its terminal tracking system to keep Donaldjohanson in view. Lucy will then use its science instruments to conduct observation sequences of the asteroid that are very similar to the one it will perform once it reaches the Trojans. Around 40 seconds before its closest approach to the asteroid, however, Lucy will stop tracking Donaldjohanson to protect its sensitive instruments from intense sunlight. “If you were sitting on the asteroid watching the Lucy spacecraft approaching, you would have to shield your eyes staring at the Sun while waiting for Lucy to emerge from the glare. After Lucy passes the asteroid, the positions will be reversed, so we have to shield the instruments in the same way,” Michael Vincent of Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, and encounter phase lead of the mission, said in a statement. “These instruments are designed to photograph objects illuminated by sunlight 25 times dimmer than at Earth, so looking toward the Sun could damage our cameras.” After its closest approach, the spacecraft will reorient its solar arrays back toward the Sun. It will reestablish communication with Earth about an hour after its flyby, hopefully beaming back all the precious data it collected. The team, however, does have to be patient considering how far Lucy is from Earth, so the process will take several days. “One of the weird things to wrap your brain around with these deep space missions is how slow the speed of light is,” Vincent said. “Lucy is 12.5 light minutes away from Earth, meaning it takes that long for any signal we send to reach the spacecraft. Then it takes another 12.5 minutes before we get Lucyâs response telling us we were heard. So, when we command the data playback after closest approach, it takes 25 minutes from when we ask to see the pictures before we get any of them to the ground.” Lucy launched in October 2021, and pulled off a flyby of the tiny main belt asteroid Dinkinesh in November 2023. The mission’s first asteroid encounter was far more rewarding than initially anticipated as thebrief rendezvous revealed a binary pairÂ with the discovery of a tiny satellite closely orbiting Dinkinesh. The mission’s primary focus is studying the Trojan asteroids, a group of rocky bodies that lead and follow Jupiter as it orbits the Sun. Lucy will begin its tour of the Trojan asteroids in 2027 by visiting Eurybates and its binary partner Queta, followed by Polymele and its binary partner, Leucus, Orus, and the binary pair Patroclus and Menoetius. “Every asteroid has a different story to tell, and these stories weave together to paint the history of our solar system,” Tom Statler, Lucy mission program scientist at NASA, said in a statement. “The fact that each new asteroid we visit knocks our socks off means weâre only beginning to understand the depth and richness of that history. Telescopic observations are hinting that Donaldjohanson is going to have an interesting story, and Iâm fully expecting to be surprisedâagain.” asteroidsLucy missionNASA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

There are also concepts for \"4 original Tequila Works projects\" that are billed as \"ready for production\" since their creative, narrative, visual elements, and copyright are all lined up. It's an inevitable consequence of the industry, but a middle-tier, independent publisher-developer like this doesn't always go out in such a direct and public way: In my experience they're more often acquired by a larger publisher and quietly shuttered years later. Though that scenario isn't too far off from what happened here—Tequila Works' majority shareholder was Tencent, as of 2022. Not surprisingly absent from the auction is Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story, which Tequila Works developed for the League of Legends juggernaut's now-defunctRiot Forgelabel. Late last year, Tequila Works general manager Térence Mosca said in a statement that he was “proud\" of the Tequila Works team's accomplishments, but that \"prolonged market conditions\" meant insolvency was the company's only choice. “Since its founding in 2009, Tequila Works' game-development philosophy has always focused on 'creating things with gusto',” said the company's statement. “We are doing everything we can to provide support and guidance to our teams during this difficult time.” Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "This subreddit dedicated to the worst computer setups on Earth makes me weirdly proud to be a PC gamer",
    "article_text": "Celebrating the gloriously terrible PC gaming setups of r/shittybattlestations. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. PC gaming can be an expensive hobby, so it's understandable that many players want to give their big black graphics machine a surrounding setup it deserves. I get the appeal of having the neatest, smartest desk, or colour-coordinating your room with your peripherals' RGB settings. I totally see why you might want all your merch neatly arranged in glass display cases behind you, or have a perfectly aligned triptych of screens to envelop you in Elite Dangerous or Farming Simulator. I, however, am not one of these people. My setup is a memorial to my time-poor existence and inability to plan. It's cluttered with coins, notebooks, stationary, plug adapters, and random parts from toys my daughter has brought through to my office. My webcam sits atop a box folder, height-adjusted with three paperback books (two Stephen Kings and a Bob Mortimer, thanks for asking). Somehow, my headphones actually have their own stand. But I did not buy the stand, have no memory of where it came from, and the headphones themselves are held together with electrician's tape. Oh yes, the rolls of electrician's tape are also on the desk, because I haven’t bothered to put them away. Does the state of my desk bother me? Well, it's a little embarrassing to write about, though clearly not enough to stop me from doing so. And like a raccoon, I am generally content amid my filth. Indeed, there are only two occasions when it starts to get on my nerves: when I'm trying to find something and can't, and when I see another gaming setup that's far nicer than mine. Because of the way the modern internet works, the latter happens quite a lot. My social media feeds are often bombarded by Twitch streamers, game developers, and just regular gamers who have setups more elaborate than the bridge from the starship Enterprise. Expertly matched furniture, carefully selected wall art, maybe a few (well looked after) plants, and of course, all their Kirby plushies and Tifa figurines perfectly arranged behind them. When I witness setups like these, I worry that I'm the grubbiest gamer on the planet. But in such moments of existential crisis, I turn to the comforting swamp that isr/ShittyBattleStations. Created in 2011, this subreddit is dedicated to freaks like me, all proudly posting images of their mucky, messy, or outright bizarre gaming setups. You won't see any magenta backlights or IKEA Kallax units here. Often you’re lucky if the person posting owns a chair. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are three things I love about r/ShittyBattleStations. The first I've already mentioned: the simple reassurance that I'm not alone. The second is the sheer diversity of dire gaming setups on show. At the least remarkable level are extreme versions of my own scenario, gamers who play surrounded by a dragon’s hoard of detritus. Some have desks so jam-packed with stuff it’s impressive they can play games at all, as a rogue twitch of the mouse would surely trigger a domino effect of cascading clutter. Many of these above setups fall into categories that are acknowledged by the community. There's even an automoderator that asks the community to define why a particular setup qualifies as \"shitty\", suggesting things like \"Incomplete\", \"Trash all around\" and perhaps my favourite \"Not a computer\". However, I've seen numerous themes through the subreddit yet to be formalised by the community, so I thought I'd suggest a few below: The late Sir Terry Pratchett's workspace was built around thisincredible six-monitor setup. Once, he was asked why he used six screens, to which he famously replied \"because I can't have eight\". This award goes to those gamers for whom nonumber of screens seems sufficient, and any screen, no matter how old it is or where it has come from, isripe for incorporation. This could, admittedly, include setups from various other categories. But there aresome setupswhere your immediate reaction is to reach for the phone to dial the fire brigade. You can definitely go overboard on fire safety, like my dad who used to insist on switching off every plug in the house before he went to bed. But some of the subreddit's gamers seem downright determined to burn themselves to death. Among the more immediately bizarre battlestations are setups that initially seem fairly unremarkable, but then you spot that one detail that elevates it to the highest tier of shittery. Like this rig that follows the shot of thepreposterous headset holder, with the chaser that the PC has two mice. Or this setup where the posterpresumably has a rubber spine. Yet out of all the differently horrible setups on the subreddit, my favourite type of shitty battle station is probably the most common. The PC gamers for whom the lack of furniture is no obstacle. The subreddit is filled with pictures of deskless PC gamers playing onshelving units,chests of drawers,piles of cardboard boxes,storage tubs, or just anamalgamation of stuff. Some players forego not just a desk, but also a chair, setting up their rigsstraight on the floor. It'd be easy to laugh at these floor-gamers and improvised tabletops, and indeed, some of the posts arepretty darn funny. Mainly though, with the exception of setups that are gross or outright dangerous, I find them strangely endearing. Many of these players are in temporary living situations, or forced into an unusual gaming setup bylife events like injuries. Some of these arrangements arekinda ingenious, while others seem borderline torturous, making you wince for the poster'skneesorspine. But it seems no amount of inconvenience or discomfort will stop some people from PC gaming, and that makes me weirdly proud. While I wouldn't encourage anyone to adopt any of these setups—PC gaming should, ideally, not come with a risk of sciatica or burning your house down—ultimately,whereyou play your games doesn't matter. It'swhatyou play that counts. If you're willing to forgo something as basic as a desk to get your game on, going to extraordinary, even painful lengths to conjure an alternative, that probably shows more dedication to your hobby than the shiniest rig on the planet. Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom. He grew up on a diet of similarly unsuitable games, with favourites including Quake, Thief, Half-Life and Deus Ex. Between 2013 and 2022, Rick was games editor of Custom PC magazine and associated websitebit-tech.net. But he's always kept one foot in freelance games journalism, writing for publications like Edge, Eurogamer, the Guardian and, naturally, PC Gamer. While he'll play anything that can be controlled with a keyboard and mouse, he has a particular passion for first-person shooters and immersive sims.

    "title": "You don't see the Havok logo much anymore, but the legendary physics middleware used in Half-Life 2 never went away—just the splash screens",
    "article_text": "An icon of 2000s gaming wants us to know that it's still being used in big games, even if SSDs mean hardly anyone has time to show its logo anymore. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Say the name \"Havok,\" and I instantly picture the yellow sawblade in the company's logo. For PC gamers of the 2000s, that logo was a promise:Wonderful things await. But do younger PC gamers know what the name signifies? And do the rest know that the Irish middleware company, made famous through its use in games like Max Payne 2 and Half-Life 2, is still working its physics magic in big, recent games likeElden Ringand Helldivers 2? Perhaps not, and if not, Havok GM David Coghlan suggests a funny reason for the diminished name recognition: SSDs. \"The logo appears a little less in splash screens these days, as splash screens are sort of being done away with,\" Coghlan said on a recent call with PC Gamer. \"The speed of hard disks meant that you needed something to occupy the player while the game was loading, and as we've moved to faster SSDs, now the emphasis is on trying to get the player in the experience as early as possible.\" Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I saw the Bink Video tornado. What have we done in the name of progress!? \"I suppose we just want to make sure that people don't forget that Havok is out there powering many of the franchises that they play and love,\" Coghlan said. And people did forget. When Havok started posting new tech demo videos this year—one of them is embedded above—commenters were excited to see that the company was back. But it never went away. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Havok has been owned by Microsoft since 2015, and its tech is still used in lots of games, including Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Destiny 2, Doom Eternal, and Rainbow Six Siege. It was used in Astro Bot, which won a gazillion GOTY awards last year. Havok's software helps game developers with physics and cloth simulation, as well as NPC behavior. And although I do buy the idea that splash screens going out of style reduced its notoriety, Coghlan agrees that it's also just harder to impress gamers with a tech demo these days. Even the most basic and janky real-time 3D physics simulations were mind-blowing back in the 2000s. Max Payne 2 was worth playing just for the ragdolls, and after Half-Life 2 came out, with its Gravity Gun and sawblade-flinging, Havok became firmly associated with the cutting edge—we looked for the name on game boxes. Today, however, you're not going to blow anyone's mind with a box stacking puzzle, and even the destruction in the new tech demo below—cool as it is—doesn't quite stir up the same excitement it would've back when videos of bouncing balls and floating rubber duckies were shown to rapt E3 audiences. But that doesn't mean Havok has run out of math to do; we might just have to look deeper to be impressed by it. The company continues to make its simulations of objects, fluids, particles, and cloth more efficient, allowing game devs to pursue more complex scenes and systems. And, Coghlan noted, Havok's work to make physics simulations harder to break allows developers to give players a longer leash. \"If I think about the early days of physics, strange things could happen, like the key that opened the door could slip through a crack in the polygons, and then the developers have to get conservative, because they don't want to allow players to get themselves into trouble,\" he said. \"And a lot of what we've been focusing on is to give developers the ability to actually put an awful lot of choice in the hands of the player, let players tackle things in a pretty open ended way.\" Coghlan also highlighted a lesser-known aspect of Havok's offering, which is related to NPC pathfinding. \"We're seeing a significantly greater range of NPCs in terms of scale, in terms of movement types, in terms of movement capabilities,\" said Coghlan. \"And a lot of our focus is on enabling developers to do a lot of the behind-the-scenes computation that a creative developer then will use to put together a really interesting, challenging set of NPCs and enemies for the player to interact with.\" Havok recently introduceda new pricing structure. At $50,000 per product at the low end, the software still isn't intended for no-budget garage studios, but Coghlan hopes the price will open it up to ambitious mid-sized teams. \"I think what we're seeing overall is a little bit of an evolution in the games industry, where more mid-sized teams—teams that might have, say, 10s of employees—actually have quite a lot of ambition,\" he said. \"You know, it's possible for teams to pick up one of the commercial engines, like Unreal or Unity, and actually be pretty ambitious in terms of what they want to achieve.\" I can back that idea up anecdotally, as I happened to speak to such a team very recently: Neon Giant, a Swedish studio of a little over 20 people that'smaking a first-person gameit calls \"ludicrously ambitious.\" (I don't know whether that particular studio and game are using Havok.) Wherever the physics middleware is used next, I wouldn't mind seeing the logo pop up again. Maybe now that every game seems to need 10 minutes to compile shaders at first launch, developers will find a new place for that little yellow sawblade.

    "article_text": "The specifics of the claim are contested, but the ability to precisely stimulate the retina with lasers is cool whether or not it's really a 'new color.' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. By very precisely shooting lasers directly into the eye (do no try this at home), researchers claim it's possible to experience a color never previously experienced. The five people who have seen the color, which the team calls \"olo,\" say that it's a blue-green hue, but more saturated than any blue-green ever seen before. As reported byThe Guardian, a team at the University of California, Berkeley have published anew paperoutlining a method for using a laser to stimulate individual cells in the retina in order to create stimulus that natural light couldn't otherwise produce. The color-sensitive eye cells, known as cones, are sensitive to long, medium, and short wavelengths of light. The laser in the UC Berkeley experiment stimulates just the medium cones, which are otherwise never stimulated in isolation. The result of the targeted laser stimulation is a patch of color in the recipient's vision that cannot be produced under any natural lighting conditions. \"It was jaw-dropping. It's incredibly saturated,\" said UC Berkeley electrical engineer Ren Ng. A vision expert consulted by the Guardian said that olo \"is not a new color\" and was instead simply a \"more saturated green.\" For their part, the researchers are very open about this being a tiny stepping stone toward stimulating individual parts of the eye to create vision, but they hope that their new vision tool, named Oz, will enable research into scientific questions about how the brain processes vision to continue. \"This is basic science,\" study engineer Ng told The Guardian. \"We're not going to see olo on any smartphone displays or any TVs any time soon. And this is very, very far beyond VR headset technology.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Which goes ahead and preempts what I figured the logical next step was: Direct laser insertion into your eyeballs to program impossibly high-resolution landscapes right into your mind as you play videogames. Shame, I was hoping we'd jump right into some anime full-dive VR stuff from here. Jokes about shooting lasers in your eyes aside, to be clear, the study was approved as humane by the review boards at both UC Berkeley and the University of Washington, and the study scientists \"obtained informed consent from all participants.\" For my part I think we should not tempt whatever cosmic horrors exist in the realm of unseen, unseeable colors and leave well enough alone. What if by seeing it once you're now vulnerable to their existence? There are plenty of colors already. How many more colors could we really need?

    "article_text": "Close call for the dedicated community. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fret not,Baldur's Gate 3fans, because your favorite bug is still in the gameeven after Larian's \"final\" big patch. That's right: The thing where your character portraits can render misaligned, or with the wrong background, or shirtless, is still around and still really funny. Not long after the patch released one fan that clearly has their priorities straight took to Reddit to dispel any fears you might have had. Other fans quickly chimed in with screenshots of their shirtless flexing Halsins, moody album cover Shadowhearts, and mid-2000s black and white underwear model Astarions. In all seriousness, this is definitely the kind of bug that gets fixed last if at all. It's a small aesthetic thing that doesn't really mess with your game experience other than to make you laugh. Since this is the \"final\" patch, well, the bug might just exist forever—and to the people who laugh hardest at the awkward and/or sexy poses that's a good thing. I mean, let's be honest, nobody's going to complain about this not getting fixed over Wild Shape: Panther being broken, or Xbox co-op joins going wrong sometimes, or a freeze when you were dragging items to trade, or the other stuff amongthe last update's thousands of words of patch notes. Besides, how could I have faith in this game if I didn't know that I could, at any time, load into a new area jumpscare by stupid, sexy shirtless Minsc? I'm sure others agree with me.

    "title": "When a game's identity becomes wrapped up in its rarity, what happens when it's re-released on Steam for 20 bucks?",
    "article_text": "Collector's items no more. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Once upon a time I happily handed over $170 (plus shipping and import taxes) for a brand new copy ofYs: The Oath in Felghanafor my trusty Windows XP machine. Does that sound like a lot? It certainly felt like a lot at the time, but I didn't regret my purchase. That was just what a rare, obscure, and never-to-be-translated (as we believed at the time) Japanese PC exclusive cost back then—I either paid up or missed out. Stripped of scarcity, do these games still feel as good to buy and play? Back in the distant past of 2005 the entirety of Falcom's PC catalogue, everything from Ancient Ys to Zwei, were little more than expensive and impenetrable curiosities of next to no interest to most people, only available via tiny boutique websites or by emailing a guy who knew a guy. Their embossed, oversized boxes (and bonus music CDs!) looked special, and by extension they made me feel special too, as shallow as that may sound. I put in the time, money, and effort, and I got something truly unique as my reward. Thanks to Steam my old wallet-busting purchases seem more than ridiculous today—they almost sound impossible. It's been years since Felghana was anything other than another action RPG on a store stuffed with them, frequently on sale for the price of a coffee. It's the most terrifying and exhilarating trial any rare game can go through. Stripped of its scarcity, collector's clout, and superfans and forced into the unforgiving colosseum of general public opinion, do these games still feel as good to buy and play when there's no \"point\" to owning them beyond personal pleasure? Suikoden 2's one of the most recent games to receive this treatment, and it's been one heck of a roller coaster ride for Konami's now-beloved RPG. It's been praised from the rooftops for so long it's easy to believe the game's always been understood and adored, but in truth early reactions to the game's English release were actually pretty tepid: These mild takes were the perfect foundation for a true gaming legend. It wasn't until it was far too late, when all the English language copies (which were always in short supply) had been snapped up and resale prices had shot through the roof, that whispers started getting around and people finally realised what they'd missed—and how much it would now cost to correct their mistake. Price-related questions come up frequently on message boards, sometimes serve as the headlinefor personal reviews, and dedicated fansite Suikosource hasan entire forum categorydedicated to buying the games, with topics going back decades. There's no escaping the fact that before last month, owning Suikoden 2 took serious commitment and a lot of money. Thanks to theHD Remasterthe game is easier to buy and play than it ever was when it was new, and the general mood is one of relief and gratitude. Variants of\"Thank you Konami for bringing back my childhood game!\"are common, and comments focussing on the games themselves are almost universally positive. It's generally a happy ending for the much sought after RPG (even if the remaster it's wrapped up in still needs some work), its modern reception at a relatively high price tag echoing the years of positivity that came before it. The game is good, Luca Blight is a monster, Clive's quest is still tripping people up, and people are passing around cooking contest tips like it's 1999. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A quick check of some other equally wonderful rarities soon reveals similar happy sentiments: Sometimes, being good and available is enough to see an older game through. What happens when games like these are released on Steam for 20 bucks? They get to live again. But not always. Gimmick, a NES platformer most famous for being expensive and releasing years after everyone stopped caring about NES platformers, has received a more muddled response. Is it a masterpiece or some haggard relic of the past?It kinda depends on who you ask, with modern points of view based on more affordable and readily available versions of the game notably skewing towards the negative. At least everyone can agree on one thing: it's not easy.Over 70% of GameFAQS users, the multiformat gaming website that will surely outlive us all, rated it as \"Tough,\" with the next most popular option being \"Unforgiving.\" Ouch. Judgement Silverswordreceived a more generally positive welcome to the modern era, although certainly not one that reflects the WonderSwan original's incredible scarcity and hyper-inflated price tags (at the time of writing, the cheapest used physical copy of the game I could find on eBay costs over $2,000). People generally quite like it when they play it. It's fine. Nice enough. A perfectly reasonable way to spend $4.99. These muted compliments are as precious as any amount of enthusiastic praise, because they can only happen when these games are taken out of their ever-shrinking retro bubbles and given back to everyone. The pressure is off, for the game and the person playing it. The game doesn't have to offer a religious experience to be worthwhile. Nobody has to make a snap decision to grab a copy because it's available in infinite supply at a fixed price. Being fun (or annoying) for a bit can be enough now there are no carts to produce, aging hardware to maintain, region locks to circumvent, or import charges to cover. So, what happens when games like these are released on Steam for 20 bucks, without the (sometimes overbearing) guiding hand of historical context to declare them important and unmissable? They get to be celebrated again. Played for the first time again. Misunderstood again. Loathed again. Ordinary again. Recommended again. Most importantly of all, they get to live again. Discussed and dissected online, old tips and tricks dusted off and passed on to grateful new fans. Ancient grumbles and frustrating sticking points can be validated by today's players—yes, that segment was stupid and unfair and you were right to turn it off and never touch the game again. Childhood hype can mature into detailed dissections of deeper themes, and friendly after-school rivalries revived as online speedrun sessions. You can't put a price on that. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "Gloomwood's research update transforms it from Thief with guns into Dishonored with mutations, letting you inject dissected monster juice into yourself to gain their powers",
    "article_text": "Jekyll and hide. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We still don't know the real name ofGloomwood's doctor protagonist, but I'm beginning to suspect it might be 'Jekyll' given what he gets up to in the game's new Research update. This latest addition to New Blood's Thief-inspired immersive sim folds in some game-changing abilities, which you essentially steal from Gloomwood's enemies in the grisliest manner possible. As explained in the update's Steamblog, the research update introduces the lab. The update's trailer implies this where you'll attempt to synthesise a cure for the plague that afflicts Gloomwood's Victorian gothic world. But the more immediate function of the lab is ethically murkier, letting you research serums that can transform you into several of the game's monsters. A crucial tool in this operation is the new bonesaw, used to chop up felled foes before you stuff the body parts into your suitcase and lug them back to the lab, where—after the appropriate \"research\"—you'll reduce these body parts into powerful, mutative serums. Currently, your good doctor can transform into three of the game's nonhuman creatures. Injecting some goatman goo into your veins will turn you into a \"walking tank\", while a dose of bat barber blood will let you jump extra high and then slow-fall so you don't take damage. Finally, a shot of crowman juice will enhance your movement speed, helping you flee from alerted enemies (or perhaps get the jump on them). New Blood also says these various serums will allow you to \"blend in with your new…friends\". Presumably, this means you can use them as disguises to slip past the matching monsters unnoticed. Does it count as social stealth when the creatures you're sneaking past are rabidly hostile monsters? Answers on a postcard please. Seriously though, this is a radical enhancement of Gloomwood's possibility space, one that would seem to shift the needle from its original 'Thief with guns' premise toward the more exotic magical powers of Dishonored. Admittedly, Gloomwood's abilities have more limitations attached, you have to work a bit harder to acquire them, and they are one-shot serums rather than consistent powers. Also, New Blood notes that these abilities are optional, and you'll still be able to skulk through the game as a normal, everyday gunslinging doctor. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The research update also brings an overhaul to the doctor's journal, which features new art, sound and animations. There's a video of that below. It's pretty swish. Players will be able to commence research once they reach the game'smirror realm. But New Blood says this is only a temporary situation, with research shifting to later in the game as of the next update. New Blood doesn't say when this next update will arrive. But since the studio updates the game every few months, we can probably expect another chunk of Gloomwood to turn up sometime in the summer. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "But the work continues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's finally happened.Dwarf Fortress, the dazzlingly complex colony sim that was free for almost 20 years before becoming a massive hit on Steam, has sold 1 million copies since it tunnelled onto the platform. PublisherKitfox Gamesshared the news on Bluesky. \"We've reached an exciting milestone: Dwarf Fortress surpassed 1,000,000 sales on Steam,\" it wrote. \"Each copy brings countless dwarves, fortresses, and unique worlds to life. Thank you to everyone who’s supported us!\" Given Dwarf Fortress' trajectory, this isn't enormously surprising. Dwarf Fortress approachedhalf a millioncopies sold just two months after launching on Steam in late 2022. The Steam version's UI overhaul and replacement of the original ASCII art with hand-drawn tiles proved hugely popular with fans of the game, quickly making creators Tarn and Zach Adams millionaires (so naturally, they splashed out on aHonda Civic). That figure had risen to 800,000 copies by this time last year, as Bay 12 Games geared up for the launch of theadventure modeupdate. There were rumblings that the update would push Dwarf Fortress past the million mark then, and less than three months on since the update landed, this notion was proved correct. Indeed, the only person who hadn't considered the prospect of Dwarf Fortress hitting a million sales was Tarn Adams himself. \"I mean, I didn't actually think of [hitting a million sales],\" Adamssaid to PCG last year. \"Because you're like, when is that going to happen?\" Now, Tarn. It's happened now. The Adams brothers did reveal how they might celebrate in the event Dwarf Fortress surpassed six zeroes. \"There's probably going to be a little party,\" Tarn said, while Zach added. \"Probably a trip to somewhere exotic.\" Better put on your party hats and Hawaiian shirts, boys. And I demand pictures when you get back. Although it's a big milestone for both Bay 12 and Kitfox, it's unlikely to change anything regarding Dwarf Fortress' future. Kitfox announced the game would beenteringa \"new era of development\" after the release of adventure mode, with the focus shifting to new features and expanding the deliriously intricate systems the game is known for. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In aseasonal update videoposted earlier this month, Tarn Adams delved into some of what Bay 12 is currently working on.

    "article_text": "The cel-shaded action game's rerelease comes courtesy of Limited Run. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I have fond memories of the original Fear Effect despite never actually owning it. It's one of those games that I enjoyed vicariously by reading about it in magazines, at a time when coveting games was sometimes the closest you'd ever get to actually playing them. It's a phenomenon that probably isn't exclusive to the pre-digital distribution age, but it was certainly more common when games were less readily available. Anyway, it looks like I might finally be able to play Fear Effect for myself soon, as it's coming to PC \"for the first time ever\" 25 years on from its original release. According to Fear Effect's shiny newSteam page, the rerelease is being published by Limited Run Games. It looks like this will be a straightforward rerelease, as the page mainly lists the game's core features, with no hints of a remaster or other modernisations. At the time, Fear Effect stood out thanks to its cel-shaded style and flashy cinematics, making it one of the best-looking games around at the turn of the millennium. While it's fair to say this is no longer the case, having rewatched the trailer on the Steam page, the art style holds up pretty darned well. Obviously, I can't comment on how Fear Effect played, but I recall the general consensus being that it was a decent action adventure, if not quite a great one. I hope that Fear Effect can hold its own in 2025, though, because the series' history on PC is otherwise fairly torrid. A remake of the original Fear Effect, titledFear Effect Reinvented, was announced in 2017, aiming to reinterpret the fixed-camera original as a third-person shooter à la Resident Evil 4. But this never saw the light of day. Weirdly, its cancellation was never formally announced, but it wasconfirmedby developer Forever Entertainment via its Discord in 2023. That leaves us PC gamers withFear Effect Sedna, the third game in the series, released in 2018. Developed by French outlet Sushee, this reworked Fear Effect as an isometric stealth action game. Sadly, it was pretty universally disliked, garnering a 'Mixed' rating on Steam with 44% positive reviews. There's no set date for the Fear Effect rerelease—Steam simply says that it's \"Coming soon\". Let's hope a more definitive launch arrives in short order, and that it doesn't share the same fate as its reinvented overhaul.

    "article_text": "Own a shard of Tamriel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Videogames have always been cavalier with numbers. For decades, series like Final Fantasy and Unreal Tournament havebrazenly ignoredthe fundamentals of sequel ordering, not to mention the whole 'making art with mathematics' thing videogames are wont to do. But now they've started playing fast and loose with the concept of anniversaries too, and I simply refuse to accept it. Nightdive Studios started this trend by recently unveiling its25thanniversary remaster of System Shock 2, which is actually coming out 26 years after launch. Now, Bethesda has announced it is selling shards ofThe Elder Scrolls Online'sservers to celebrate the game's 10thanniversary, which was in April last year. You can't have a birthday that lasts a whole year, Bethesda! Even a five-year-old wouldn't try to swing that one. Nonetheless, Bethesda has forged ahead with The Elder Scrolls Online 10-year anniversary server keepsake, which was announced earlier this week (viaKotaku). According to the keepsake's page on the Bethesdawebsite, this has been created for players who wish for \"something truly meaningful to commemorate over a decade of adventure with friends\" (one year over a decade, to be specific) letting them own an \"actual physical piece of The Elder Scrolls Online history.\" That 'piece' is specifically a disused stick of RAM removed from one of The Elder Scrolls Online's server racks. Of course, it won't just be sent to you in a jiffy bag. It comes neatly framed alongside a shiny zinc alloy commemorative plate engraved with ESO's ouroboros logo and the (temporally inaccurate) declaration \"10 Years\". The whole package costs $110, which personally I would put toward some brand new sticks of RAM for my increasingly decrepit PC. But if you're a die-hard Elder Scrolls Online fan, I can see the appeal. If this does tickle your fancy, the keepsake is available for pre-order now, and will be delivered in July. Only 2,000 of these will be made, apparently, each coming with a certificate of authenticity and a sequentially numbered holographic sticker. This isn't the only way Bethesda is celebrating1011 years of The Elder Scrolls Online. After years of annual updates expanding into new areas of Tamriel, the MMO is shifting to a more \"seasonal structure\" to deliver abrand new storycalled Seasons of the Worm Cult. \"This is a sequel to the base game storyline,\" game director Rich Lambert told Harvey earlier this month. \"Ten years in the making.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Yes, Zero Company really is Star Wars XCOM, and it's got the permadeath to prove it",
    "article_text": "It's ticking all the right boxes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When Bit Reactor's game director Greg Foertsch confirms to me that Star Wars Zero Company has permadeath, I can't help but grin. In retrospect, it might be a bit odd for me to get so psyched about the shadow of mortality, but this one choice says so much about what kind of game—and what kind of Star Wars—Zero Company is going to be. We've been calling this game \"Star Wars XCOM\" for a long time now, thanks to the studio's deep bench of former Firaxis developers. But at this point we've been bitten by an awful lot of supposed spiritual successors that really are just turn-based tactics games. XCOM is that, but it's more as well. XCOM isn't just about directing your soldiers around a battlefield, but being invested in their emergent little stories. Caring who succeeds and who fails, and risking something when you send them out into the firing line. If anything, Zero Company seems ready to take that idea even further. Soldiers you create can be customised to the class and appearance you want, but appropriately for Star Wars you can also choose their species. Then the game also has authored characters—the crew seen in the trailer and art—who turn up already armed with personalities, backstories, and roles in the story. But not only will they have a degree of customisation too, they're not exempt from permadeath, and if they are lost in some Outer Rim skirmish, that will actually affect how elements of the story play out. I should say, there'soptionalpermadeath—the difficulty settings will allow you to turn it off if the idea of watching your favourite Jedi fall to blaster fire doesn't float your boat. A key goal of Zero Company is to bring new players to the genre. One part of that equation is accessibility—providing those difficulty options and not overwhelming players with abilities and unlocks early on, so that \"if you want to play it just for the story, great… but if you want to play it for the pain, then you're welcome to play it for that too,\" as Foertsch puts it. The thing he's keen to hammer home—as he waswhen I spoke to him last year—is that appealing to new players doesn't mean sacrificing depth for the hardcore strategy fans. \"I don't think it's a choice in that sense,\" says Foertsch. \"You can absolutely do both.\" That's backed up this time by Orion Kellogg, executive producer at LucasFilm Games—one of the people linking Bit Reactor to the wider Star Wars ecosystem. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"For Lucasfilm Games, this is our strategy game,\" says Kellogg. \"So we're not saying, like, 'Oh, can you make it less strategy-y?' We want this to be a strategy game first and foremost, and it is, and that's why we're working with Bit Reactor.\" So no, it turns outthose leaks we saw in Marchseemingly depicting screens of the game did not give an accurate sense of things.\"The leaked images do not represent the game today, nor what it will be at launch,\"says a representative for Bit Reactor. Basically they were just very early concepts, from before the premise of the game had even been finalised. The other part of the equation is the story. Foertsch promises something more \"immersive\" and \"cinematic\" than we're used to for the genre, and the inclusion of a fully customisable main protagonist—called Hawks—suggests an RPG-like sheen to the adventure. Set during the Clone Wars, Zero Company follows essentially the Star Wars equivalent of a black ops team, making surgical strikes into enemy territory. It's definitely a darker, more serious tone than you might expect from a Star Wars game—more Rogue One than A New Hope, and certainly not a million miles away from XCOM's grim sci-fi narrative. For Star Wars fans, there are deep cuts right out of the gate. The crew of premade characters includes a Tognath Jedi (remember that guy with the tubes from Rogue One? One of them), and there's an Umbaran in full battle armour, as last seen in one of The Clone Wars' most beloved story arcs. You can even recruit astromechs to your team. The trailer's brief combat footage shows off battle droid enemies, including B1s and B2s—that part's certainly not surprising, though I continue to think that those arethe perfect choice of bad guy for any Star Wars videogame. It's a strong hook to tempt everyone who playedJedi SurvivororOutlawsto try a genre they might not be used to. But the goal is also that if you are here for the strategy first and foremost you'll feel just as welcomed in. \"It could be your first Star Wars,\" says Kelsey Sharpe, creative executive at Lucasfilm. \"I would love to find out that there is some hardcore strategy player out there who's like 'a Star Wars game? All right, fine, I simply must play this turn-based tactics game' and then Star Wars: Zero Company is their introduction to the Star Wars universe. Because if we've done our jobs, it should be a great introduction to Star Wars.\" Much like last year, when Bit Reactor wassharing its ambitious goals with me before it had even announced a title, I am a little skeptical. Completely accessible to newcomers yet rich and deep for genre veterans, and both a treat for Star Wars fans and those who've barely touched the franchise alike… setting out to please everyone is ambitious, and it's a lot easier to promise you can do it all than it is to deliver. But I'm also optimistic, because I've come out of this chat and this brief look at the game feeling like Bit Reactor is making all the right choices. The XCOM-lover in me hears about permadeath and customisation, and sees that clean combat UI and polished action, and feels like a proper successor could be looming. And the Star Wars nerd in me sees a genuinely fresh take on an iconic point in the timeline, with the kind of pulls that point to an interest in the wider texture of the setting, not just snagging people's attention with obvious and overused touchstones. After years of build up to this reveal, I do wish they'd showed and discussed more of the substance of what we'll be playing—and with a release date currently set for 2026, we've still got a while to go before we can actually sit down and try it. But this is an exciting first step into the spotlight for Star Wars: Zero Company, and while my hope may not be very new at this point, I'm still pinning it on this being one of the most promising XCOM successors we've seen in years.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's Saturday, so why not celebrate the start of the weekend with a nice easyWordlewin? Today's answer is here whenever you want to click on it, whether that's before you've touched the first row or you're one line away from the bottom of the board. As always, we've got a clue for the April 19 (1400) game here if you need it too. A fun little opener. Something a bit different to kick things off. A fresh start. It sounded like such a good idea for the half a second I actually thought about it. Thanks to that, I spent the rest of the Wordle fighting for my win streak's life, and I only had myself to blame for the mess. Ouch. That place on your phone or PC where all the emails you promise you will read but not today live. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Let's make this easy. The answer to the April 19 (1400) Wordle isINBOX. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "title": "Sniper Elite 4 is a mini marvel on the iPhone 16 Pro",
    "article_text": "A promising sign for serious gaming on iOS When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve heard the term ‘console-quality graphics' touted around a fair bit for first-person shooter or action adventure mobile games. But few have really delivered on the promise of such visual wizardry, even when looking back at last-generation consoles – at least not until now. With theiPhone 15 Pro,Apple’s A17 Pro chip brought the ability to run actual console games likeDeath Stranding, albeit with slightly choppy performance and at a low resolution. But we’re still taking a proper AAA, full-fat console game running on a slim device that you can slip into your pocket. TheiPhone 16 Prothen upped the game - literally - with the A18 Pro chip, which promised a gaming performance boost. I recently had the chance to try out the iOS version ofSniper Elite 4on such a chip with myiPhone 16 Pro Max. If you’re not already familiar, theSniper Elitegames are third-person tactical shooters set in WW2. Players are tasked with taking out targets using stealth and ranged shots on large open world maps. The game became renowned for its gory kills, where a bullet’s trajectory is shown in slow motion, complete with an X-Ray look at how it entered a Nazi soldier's body, splitting bones, sinew, and guts in glorious detail. Released back in 2017 for thePlayStation 4,Xbox Oneand PC,Sniper Elite 4wasn’t exactly cutting-edge but it was still a great-looking game. I played it a few years ago on anXbox One X, after it had been enhanced for that powered-up console, and had a fantastic time, especially in the co-op mode with a friend. Coming back all these years later, I was curious how it would hold up on a modern smartphone. Going in, I’ll be honest and admit my hopes weren’t too high… though they weren’t exactly low either given the performance that Apple claims its in-house chip can achieve – especially when we’re talking about running a somewhat old game rather than the likes ofCyberpunk 2077. And so with the help of aBackbone One Gen 2mobile controller, I dived intoSniper Elite 4. Straight off the bat (or should that be rifle butt) I’m surprised at how good the game looks on iOS; sunlight pierces the puffy clouds realistically, buildings are suitably detailed, and the realistic character models are miles from the low-poly plastic soldiers I was expecting. It’s not flawless, though as some of the foliage looks a little flat and, running at a 720p resolution, there’s no shortage of jagged edges. There are other caveats too. First off, the frame rate caps out at around 30 frames per second – that’s ok on paper, but in a game that rewards smooth pinpoint accuracy, it’s not exactly ideal. Add in some dips and the experience can be a little ropey when the action picks up. The second issue is the built-in touchscreen controls are asking a bit much of a modest 6.7 inch display. Maybe people who are adept atCall of Duty Warzone Mobilewill have a different experience, but my recommendation would be to play with one of thebest mobile controllersinstead. Yet the experience impressed me on the whole. It’s like playing something on mySteam Deck; the game still looks perfectly pleasant, despite clear compromises in detail and sharpness. As such, I could see myself ploughing a decent amount of time intoSniper Elite 4to pass the time on a tedious journey or when sitting out in the sun. It’s also promising in another way: iOS could become the home of proper console-quality gaming on smartphones. When the currently rumoured but almost inevitableiPhone 17comes around, I expect Apple to equip it with a new and improved chip. While AI performance will likely be the focus thanks to its currentApple Intelligencepush, I’m hoping to see a generational boost in gaming power too. If that happens, it could open up the door for even more demanding console games to come to iOS. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Digital data decluttering could save you hundreds of dollars every year: here's how you can do it",
    "article_text": "People are spending a fortune on digital storage rather than hitting delete When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Americans are facing a growing digital clutter problem, according to a recent survey by Compass Datacenters, which found over three-quarters (77%) of people admitted - unsurprisingly - to having more digital files than they need. Conducted between January 21 and February 5, 2025, the poll of 1,000 people revealed digital hoarding is not only out of control, but many are unsure how to even begin managing it. One-third of respondents said managing their digital files made them feel overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed. A mere 10% reported feeling confident when it comes to deleting unnecessary files. Although they recognized that excess data can slow devices, drain batteries, and make it harder to find important information, they were not ready to hit the delete key and take action. Digital clutter is not just a minor inconvenience - it can be a costly one too, as storage prices are climbing. The survey found that younger generations, in particular, are paying to store files rather than deleting them. The survey authors note, “Accounting for a 3% inflation rate, assuming a 25-year-old pays $20/month for data storage until the age of 85, they will spend $40,000 over their lifetime on digital storage.” Compass Datacenters partnered with expert digital minimalist Kath Younger to inspire and assist people in cleaning out their digital closet.

Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Digital decluttering does not have to be a huge project. Taking small, regular steps can protect devices, save money, and reduce stress. The first place to start is by cleaning out your photo library. Delete blurry shots, duplicates, and old screenshots you no longer need. Aim to do this monthly rather than waiting for years to pass. Next, sort through your apps. Check what you have and what you actually use. If you have apps you haven't opened in months, get rid of them. You can always reinstall any you need. Review your downloads folder and email inbox. Old receipts, newsletters, and random files add up fast. Focus on emails with attachments to free up the most storage space. Consider setting up a simple backup system with anexternal hard driveinstead of paying for cloud storage. HDDs and SSDs with 4TB of storage are available for a one-time purchase price that is far less than you would pay for years of cloud fees. Schedule a “digital spring cleaning” day a couple of times a year. Treat it like cleaning out a closet - a little annoying at first, but rewarding once done. By being more mindful of the digital clutter you create and keep, it becomes easier to manage over time. Taking action today can save you from bigger hassles down the road.

    "title": "Lenovo is set to launch its first 12-core AMD laptop, presented as a lightweight AI-ready mobile workstation",
    "article_text": "Lenovo's ThinkPad P14s Gen 6 weighs just 1.39kg When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lenovohas announced its most powerfulAMDlaptop yet: the ThinkPad P14s Gen 6, which is set to launch with the 12-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX Pro 370, making it the company's first AMD-powered model to break past the eight-core ceiling. Aimed at creative professionals and mobile users who need both AI processing and core-heavy performance, the ThinkPad P14s Gen 6 supports up to 96GB of DDR5-5600 RAM - but only in configurations using the Krackan Point CPUs, namely the Ryzen AI 5 Pro 340 and Ryzen AI 7 Pro 350. That means the 12-core Strix Point model may be capped at 64GB of soldered memory. While it's a limitation, it still offers enough for demanding workloads like 3D rendering orPhotoshop, making it a strong candidate for users searching for thebest laptop for photo editing. While the processing capacity could place it among thebest workstationcontenders in terms of raw power, there’s a drawback: the model’s battery may struggle to match the chip’s power demands. Weighing 1.39 kg (3.06 lbs) and measuring 10.9–16.3 mm thick, the device uses either a 57Whr or 52.5Whr battery, depending on the CPU. Although both batteries are larger than theweedy 39.3Whr batteryon the previous ThinkPad P14s Gen 5, they may still struggle under the load of the new, more powerful processors. However, the laptop supports Rapid Charge with a 65W adapter, capable of reaching 80% battery in 60 minutes. This lightweightmobile workstation,currently listed onLenovo Malaysia’s website, features a 14-inch 2.8KOLEDpanel with 100% DCI-P3 coverage and an anti-glare coating. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! It includes TÜV certifications for Eyesafe and Low Blue Light, a touchscreen, integrated PrivacyGuard, and will be available in different IPS variants offering up to 500-nit brightness. Graphics are handled by an integrated AMD Radeon 890M, built on RDNA 3.5 architecture, delivering up to 32 TOPS and supported by AMD’s PRO Graphics Driver. For connectivity, the device offers WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, optional 5G or CAT16 WWAN with eSIM, and optional NFC. Physical ports include two USB-C (Thunderbolt 4) ports, two USB-A (5 Gbps) ports, HDMI 2.1, RJ45 Ethernet, a headphone/mic combo jack, and optional Nano SIM and smart card readers. Price and availability remain unclear, as the listing simply states “available soon.” Given that the T14 Gen 6 AMD models are unlikely to ship before May or June 2025, the P14s variant likely won’t hit shelves before summer either.

    "title": "ChatGPT can remember more about you than ever before – should you be worried?",
    "article_text": "AI memory is evolving. More helpful? Definitely. More intrusive? Absolutely When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. ChatGPT’s memory used to be simple. You told it what to remember, and it listened. Since 2024,ChatGPThas had a memory feature that lets users store helpful context. From your tone of voice and writing style to your goals, interests, and ongoing projects. You could go into settings to view, update, or delete these memories. Occasionally, it would note something important on its own. But largely, it remembered whatyouasked it to. Now, that’s changing. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isrolling out a major upgrade to its memory. Beyond the handful of facts you manually saved, ChatGPT will now draw from all of your past conversations to inform future responses by itself. According to OpenAI, memory now works in two ways: “saved memories,” added directly by the user, and insights from “chat history,” which are the ones that ChatGPT will gather automatically. This feature, called long-term or persistent memory, is rolling out to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. However, at the time of writing, it’s not available in the UK, EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland due to regional regulations. The idea here is simple: the more ChatGPT remembers, the more helpful it becomes. It’s a big leap for personalization. But it’s also a good moment to pause and ask what we might be giving up in return. It’s easy to see the appeal here. A more personalized experience from ChatGPT means you explain yourself less and get more relevant answers. It’s helpful, efficient, and familiar. “Personalization has always been about memory,” says Rohan Sarin, Product Manager atSpeechmatics, an AI speech tech company. “Knowing someone for longer means you don’t need to explain everything to them anymore.” He gives an example: ask ChatGPT to recommend a pizza place, and it might gently steer you toward something more aligned with your fitness goals – a subtle nudge based on what it knows about you. It's not just following instructions, it’s reading between the lines. “That’s how we get close to someone,” Sarin says. “It’s also how we trust them.” That emotional resonance is what makes these tools feel so useful – maybe even comforting. But it also raises the risk of emotional dependence. Which, arguably, is the whole point. “From a product perspective, storage has always been about stickiness,” Sarin tells me. “It keeps users coming back. With each interaction, the switching cost increases.” OpenAI doesn’t hide this. The company's CEO,.Sam Altman, tweetedthat memory enables “AI systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized.” That usefulness is clear. But so is the risk of depending on them not just to help us, but toknowus. A challenge with long-term memory in AI is its inability to understand context in the same way humans do. We instinctively compartmentalize, separating what’s private from what’s professional, what’s important from what’s fleeting. ChatGPT may struggle with that sort of context switching. Sarin points out that because people use ChatGPT for so many different things, those lines may blur. “IRL, we rely on non-verbal cues to prioritize. AI doesn’t have those. So memory without context could bring up uncomfortable triggers.” He gives the example of ChatGPT referencing magic and fantasy in every story or creative suggestion just because you mentioned liking Harry Potter once. Will it draw from past memories even if they're no longer relevant? “Our ability to forget is part of how we grow,” he says. “If AI only reflects who we were, it might limit who we become.” Without a way to rank, the model may surface things that feel random, outdated, or even inappropriate for the moment. Persistent memory could be hugely useful for work. Julian Wiffen, Chief of AI and Data Science atMatillion, a data integration platform with AI built in, sees strong use cases: “It could improve continuity for long-term projects, reduce repeated prompts, and offer a more tailored assistant experience,\" he says. But he’s also wary. “In practice, there are serious nuances that users, and especially companies, need to consider.” His biggest concerns here are privacy, control, and data security. “I often experiment or think out loud in prompts. I wouldn’t want that retained – or worse, surfaced again in another context,” Wiffen says. He also flags risks in technical environments, where fragments of code or sensitive data might carry over between projects, raising IP or compliance concerns. “These issues are magnified in regulated industries or collaborative settings.” OpenAI stresses that users can still manage memory – delete individual memories that aren't relevant anymore, turn it off entirely, or use the new “Temporary Chat” button. This now appears at the top of the chat screen for conversations that are not informed by past memories and won't be used to build new ones either. However, Wiffen says that might not be enough. “What worries me is the lack of fine-grained control and transparency,” he says. “It's often unclear what the model remembers, how long it retains information, and whether it can be truly forgotten.” He’s also concerned about compliance with data protection laws, like GDPR: “Even well-meaning memory features could accidentally retain sensitive personal data or internal information from projects. And from a security standpoint, persistent memory expands the attack surface.” This is likely why the new update hasn't rolled out globally yet. What’s the answer? “We need clearer guardrails, more transparent memory indicators, and the ability to fully control what’s remembered and what’s not,\" Wiffen explains. Other AI tools are taking different approaches to memory. For example, AI assistantClaudedoesn’t store persistent memory outside your current conversation. That means fewer personalization features, but more control and privacy. Perplexity, an AI search engine, doesn’t focus on memory at all – it retrieves real-time web information instead. Whereas Replika, AI designed for emotional companionship, goes the other way, storing long-term emotional context to deepen relationships with users. So, each system handles memory differently based on its goals. And the more they know about us, the better they fulfill those goals – whether that’s helping us write, connect, search, or feel understood. The question isn’t whether memory is useful; I think it clearly is. The question is whether we want AI to becomethisgood at fulfilling these roles. It’s easy to say yes because these tools are designed to be helpful, efficient, even indispensable. But that usefulness isn’t neutral, it’s intentional. These systems are built by companies that benefit when we rely on them more. You wouldn’t willingly give up a second brain that remembers everything about you, possibly better than you do.

    "article_text": "Consistent volume for the people When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Having a track come crashing in at an unexpectedly high volume level – or being much quieter than what's come before – isn't a great listening experience, and it's somethingYouTubeMusic is aiming to prevent with its latest feature update. As spotted by the team at9to5Google, a new option called 'consistent volume' is now making its way to the YouTube Music apps for Android and iOS. The idea is, all your tracks, no matter where you've got them from, will use a similar volume range. Loud songs will still be loud and quiet songs will still be quiet of course, but it should help with tracks that have been recorded or converted at noticeably different volume levels, so your ears know more or less what to expect. The feature follows on from the 'stable volume' feature that's been available across different YouTube appsfor some time. It's also something you can find inside Spotify's range of apps, where it's called 'audio normalization'. It seems that the consistent volume feature is being rolled out quite slowly, or perhaps just being tested with a limited group of people for now. The9to5Googleteam has seen it on some of their phones, but it hasn't shown up for theAndroid Authorityteam. If you don't have it yet, you'll just have to be patient. To check if you've got it, open up the YouTube Music app for Android or iOS, then tap your profile picture (top right) andSettings, then choosePlayback(Android) orPlayback and restrictions(iOS). Here in the UK I can't see it on either my Android phone or my iPhone, so don't be surprised if it hasn't shown up yet for you. According to 9to5Google, you need version 8.15 of the YouTube Music app, so check to see if any updates are pending. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Shrinking season 3: everything we know about what's coming next for the Apple TV+ show",
    "article_text": "The wait for more Shrinking may be short... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Production on season 3 has already begun- It will return to Apple TV+- The main cast are returning- A new cast member has been added- The theme of the show is “moving forward” Shrinkingseason 3 is officially on the way, and fans of the heartwarming (and often hilarious)AppleTV+ series have plenty to look forward to. Created by Bill Lawrence, Jason Segel, and Brett Goldstein, the comedy-drama follows therapist Jimmy Laird (played by Segel) as he starts breaking the rules with his patients while grieving the loss of his wife. His unconventional approach shakes up their lives, and his, in unexpected ways. The show has been praised for its emotional depth, excellent performances, and its ability to balance sharp humor with heartfelt storytelling. It's easily one of thebest Apple TV+ showsand season 2 was even more acclaimed than the first, so it’s no surprise there’s already serious buzz about what’s next. WhileApple's renewal ofShrinkingseason 3itself wasn’t a shock – Bill Lawrence has always said that the show was originally pitched as a three-season arc – the speed of the green light shows Apple’s confidence in where it’s headed. So, what can we expect from season 3 ofShrinking? Below, we’ve gathered everything we know so far, from returning cast members to potential storylines for Jimmy, Alice, and the rest of the crew. There are no official details yet about whenShrinkingseason 3 will be released. But the good news is that the third season was greenlit just as season 2 was launching – and everything seems to be moving quickly since. That suggests we may still have a bit of a wait, but likely not as long as some other shows. In even better news, production is now already underway. Apple TV+ recently sharedan update on Twitter/Xconfirming thatShrinkingseason 3 has officially started filming. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The post includes a behind-the-scenes video featuring co-creator Bill Lawrence welcoming back the main cast, including Jason Segel, Harrison Ford, Jessica Williams, Christa Miller, Michael Urie, and Ted McGinley. A word from Bill Lawrence: #Shrinking Season 3 is now in production. pic.twitter.com/nYWIRdTrOFMarch 19, 2025 While there’s still no confirmed release window, we can make a few educated guesses. It took two years for season 2 to arrive after season 1, but that gap was largely due to the Hollywood strikes in 2023. This time, the turnaround is expected to be much faster, since season 3 was renewed early and filming is already in progress. For comparison, season 2 was filmed between January and June 2024 and released in the fall of that year. If season 3 follows a similar production schedule – and so far it seems to be – a fall 2025 release feels like a realistic estimate. Even before Apple’s video update, Christa Miller (who plays Liz) had already confirmed that filming was about to begin. In a heartfelt Instagram video, she spoke about the shoot taking place in Los Angeles – a meaningful decision for the cast and crew following recent wildfires in the area. A post shared by Christa Miller (@christabmiller) A photo posted by on “It’s a really special moment for our cast and crew. Because not only do we shoot in Pasadena, we film in Altadena as well,\" she says.“And after the devastating fires that hit Los Angeles, it feels more important than ever to support all of the communities that have been affected and this is the city where the magic happens and stories are told and dreams come true and that’s why our show is staying here.” There’s no trailer forShrinkingseason 3 just yet – it’s still early days, with filming only just underway. But that just means we’ve got something to look forward to. If we’re aiming for a late 2025 release (and yes, that’s still just speculation), a first teaser or trailer might drop sometime in the summer. As soon as it’s released, we’ll update this page and include it here. In the meantime, you can always revisit theShrinkingseason 2 trailer to have a look at where we left off. We know Jason Segel is returning, he’s the main character, co-creator, and one of the writers. But what about the rest of the cast? For the most part, yes. Most of the core cast is expected to return, and as always, we can look forward to some standout guest stars along the way. Speaking toVarietyin 2023 about the cast and the three seasons he had planned, Bill Lawrence said: “Part of the fun for me in doing shows with, like, Jason Segel and Harrison Ford, is that you can tell actors that you’ve always wanted to work with, ‘If you give me three seasons, that’s fine if you want to split.’ So all I can tell you is that all the gang that we roped in for this one was down for doing that.” We know a lot of the main cast from the first two seasons are returning, this includes: We’ve also got some early casting news. According toDeadline, Jeff Daniels is joining the series as Jimmy’s father. He’s been mentioned a few times across the first two seasons, but otherwise, Daniels’ character remains a mystery – no official details have been revealed about his role just yet. What we do know is that Harrison Ford’s Dr. Paul Rhoades has been a father figure to Jimmy and a grandfather figure to Alice, so it’ll be interesting to see how that dynamic shifts with Jimmy’s real dad now in the picture. It also looks like Brett Goldstein could be making a return as Louis. Lawrence was talking toDeadlineand, when asked if Louis would return for season 3, said: “Yeah, I gotta leverage that dude. I think the ending was satisfying. I hope it was for people. But I think I’ve been public about saying the first year is about grief, the second year was about forgiveness and third year’s about moving forward.” He continued: “I don’t think you can do this show about moving forward without knowing how that guy’s life moves forward, at least for an episode or two. So now I just got to leverage Brett into doing what I want him to do. He’s a very busy man. It’s very frustrating.” In another interview withTV Line, Lawrence said: “I’m going to strong-armBrett into showing his face, hopefully, at least a couple more times.” So although we don’t know for sure, it really sounds like Lawrence wants Goldstein back, at least for an episode or two. Potential spoilers follow forShrinkingbelow. Apple TV+ and theShrinkingteam haven’t shared any official plot details just yet, but the creators have dropped some interesting hints in interviews. In a 2023 conversation withVariety, co-creator Bill Lawrence revealed that the show was pitched with a clear three-season arc: “The second year is about forgiveness, and the third year is about moving forward [...] We pitched three seasons – the beginning, middle and end,” That kind of clarity is always reassuring. When a show knows exactly where it’s headed, it often means more satisfying stories and stronger emotional payoffs. That said, don’t expect a neatly wrapped ending. In a more recent interview withTV Insider, Lawrence explained: “You can imagine by just the overarching title of forgiveness that what we’re really going to be watching is whether – and by the way, it’s not always cut and dry. I think we all have people in our life that we can never get over the hump with. And soShrinking, it’s not necessarily going to be the most hunky dory, soft edges type of ending.” He added: “Whenever anybody undergoes a true catastrophic stick in the spokes in their life, like the characters in the show did, what you’re really talking about the first two years is what it means to survive and then kind of bury the hatchet and mend fences. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to be able to move forward in your life and start over again. I think that’s what people will probably be watching the third year.” And looking ahead to what’s next, he says: “And when you say moving forward, even off the top of my head so it’s not a spoiler, I think people are aware that we’ve intentionally made a young woman who’s a senior in high school. We’ve potentially gotten some people in serious relationships. We’ve intentionally been looking at Harrison Ford’s character and how much longer can he do this with the condition he has. And so I think it’s going to be a rich third year too. I say that because we’re already writing it.” So, while it's unlikelyShrinkingwill tie everything up in a neat bow, we can expect the characters to be facing some major crossroads – especially when it comes to aging, independence, parenting, and starting over. Even without teasers, we can make a few educated guesses about season 3 ofShrinkingbased on how season 2 wrapped. Jimmy ended up forgiving Louis and, ultimately, saving his life. That arc also helped Jimmy process his grief and forgive himself. His relationship with Alice began to heal too. After months of tension and emotional distance, she forgave him for how he’d acted in the wake of her mother’s death. As for the other characters, Paul (Harrison Ford) had his own moment of truth, admitting he’ll need support as his Parkinson’s disease worsens. In an interview withThe Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence said that Paul’s story is “gonna be a huge part of next year”. There’s also a hint at a new storyline from Christa Miller (Liz), who posted a behind-the-scenes photo of herself holding a baby on Instagram. A post shared by Christa Miller (@christabmiller) A photo posted by on This would line up with how season 2 ended. Brian and Charlie were preparing to adopt, and they asked Liz to help out. She agreed, possibly taking on a nanny role. With so many emotional threads in play, season 3 is shaping up to be an opportunity to dig deeper into growth, change, and how people move forward. Now that season 3 is officially happening, and Bill Lawrence has revealed that he knows where it’s headed, the big question is, couldShrinkingcontinue beyond that into future seasons? Right now, it doesn’t seem likely. Lawrence has been clear from the start thatShrinkingwas always envisioned as a three season story. He’s even hinted at how things will wrap up. That said, in TV land, we’ve learned to never say never. Just because season 4 isn’t part of the original arc doesn’t mean the show couldn’t return in some form – especially if the audience keeps showing up and Apple sees potential. Still, fans probably shouldn’t hold their breath for moreShrinkingafter season 3. And if it did happen? It would likely take longer to hit screens, since the first three seasons were plotted from the start, and anything beyond would require a whole new chapter. For now, it looks like this story has an end in sight, but stranger things have happened.

I have a friend in construction who spent 18 months building an enormous factory that was completely dedicated to year-round production of Easter EGGS. It seems crazy for a product that really should just be available for a couple of weeks a year. However, in the UK, Easter has a bigger build-up than any other chocolate-based holiday (let’s face it, they’re all about the chocolate). Almost as soon as Christmas is over the first hollow chocolate eggs start appearing – from actual egg-sized to chocolate eggs the size of your head – slowly multiplying and taking up entire supermarket aisles until tomorrow, when they will vanish completely. According to my research (erm, TikTok) things seem a bit calmer elsewhere in the world – although the US has PEEPS, a marshmallow delight that has failed to make it anywhere else in the world. Maybe they have really high tariffs or something. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. Strands is the NYT's not-so-new-any-more word game, following Wordle and Connections.

NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room.

    "title": "Daredevil: Born Again season 2 – everything we know so far about the popular Marvel TV show's return on Disney+",
    "article_text": "Daredevil: Born Again season 2 could be released sometime in 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - No release date announced yet- Filming began in late February- No trailer available to watch- Main cast set to return- New additions to its ensemble cast leaked online in March- No official story synopsis revealed- Season 1 finale sets the scene for next season- No word on whether there'll be a third season Daredevil: Born Againseason 2 will continue Matt Murdock and his vigilante alter-ego's journey in theMarvelCinematic Universe (MCU). The highly-ratedDisney+TV show, which mostly thrilled us during its first season, will be back for more R-rated, street-level action in the near future. Indeed, with principal photography beginning in late February, season 2 could be with us as early as next year. While we wait forDaredevil: Born Againto return, there's plenty to read about its sophomore chapter in this guide, including information on its cast, plot, and future.Major spoilers follow for the popular series' first season, so proceed with caution if you haven't watched it all yet. Daredevil: Born Againseason 2 doesn't have a confirmed release date. However, speaking on thePhase Zero podcastprior to season 1's release, Marvel's Head of TV, Animation, and Streaming, Brad Winderbaum, revealed season 2 would start shooting in late February. At the time of this article's publication (April 19), that means the cameras have been rolling for almost two months. As for when theMarvel Phase 6TV series might make its debut, Winderbaum toldScreenRantthat he hoped new seasons would be released annually. That meansBorn Againseason 2 could arrive sometime next year. My best guess? It'll begin airing in early 2026. Aside fromAvengers: DoomsdayandSpider-Man: Brand New Day, which will arrive in theaters in May and July 2026, no otherMCUprojects have official release dates. With such a big gap between Marvel's final release of 2025 andAvengers 5, a February or March 2026 release window feels like a perfect fit forBorn Again's next installment. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And it seems I've perfectly nailed my guess. Taking toInstagramafter the season 1 finale, showrunner Dario Scardapane all but confirmed season 2 will be released in March 2026. No, and there won't be aDaredevil: Born Againseason 2 trailer until much closer to its launch on Disney+. I'll update this section once one is released. Spoilers follow forDaredevil: Born Againseason 1. Based on the final episode ofDaredevil: Born Againseason 1, here's who I expect to return for its follow-up: They aren't the only actors we'll see in one of thebest Disney+ shows' next installment. PerDeadline, Matthew Lillard (Five Nights at Freddy's,Scooby-Doo) has apparently signed on in an undisclosed role.Deadlinehas also claimed Lili Taylor (Outer Range,Manhunt) will appear as a political rival to D'Onofrio's Fisk. Elsewhere, images snapped and uploaded toGetty Imagesby Bauer-Griffin photographer Jose Perez suggest Broadway star Sydney Parra will appear in some capacity. The biggest surprise when it comes to season 2's cast list, though, is the return of Elden Henson, who plays Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson. Murdock's fellow lawyer and closest friend was seemingly killed by Bullseye inBorn Again's first episode. However, following the show's two-episode premiere,Marvel fans came up with a wild theory that Foggy may still be alive. Some pointed out that Nelson's apparent death was eerily similar to how he faked his own demise in an Ed Brubaker-writtenDaredevilcomic series in the mid-2010s, whichBorn Againis loosely based on. Speaking toPhase Hero's Brandon Davisprior to season 1's debut, Winderbaum confirmed Elden Henson would be back as Foggy in the show's sophomore season. It's unclear in what capacity that'll be, though. Could it be a flashback sequence or two? Or, as some fans believe, is Foggy still alive? We'll find out when season 2 is released. Spoilers follow forDaredevil: Born Againseason 1. Born Againseason 2's story synopsis hasn't been revealed yet. But, based on how its predecessor ended, what its cast has teased, and some leaked images from where it's being filmed in real-world locations, we have a good idea of what might happen. I won't be covering what happened in last season's final episode here. For a full rundown of events in 'Straight to Hell', plus some key questions that season 2 needs to answer, myDaredevil: Born Againseason 1 ending explainedpiece should be your first port of call. Additionally, on the non-spoiler front, Cox hyped up the story that'll be told in season 2, the show's lead tellingColliderthat it's \"some of my favorite stuff I've read\". D'Onofrio also told a round table of journalists (perIGN) that he \"had to have a little cry about\" this season's scripts due to the emotional impact they'll have on viewers. Marvel Unlimited monthly subscription:was $9.99 per month now$4.99 at MarvelThe ultimate digital comics subscription for Marvel fans is offering new and returning customers 50% off their first month, which is much cheaper than a streaming subscription to watch all thebest superhero movies.

But, be quick – the deal expires on May 5! But what can we expect from season 2's overarching narrative from a spoiler-led perspective? For starters, this seasonhas been in development since March 2023. In light of thecreative troublesBorn Againseason 1 was met withlater that year, the show underwent an overhaul, which included thehiring of current showrunner Dario Scardapane and directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead. One thing that was retained, though, was its episodic structure. Like season 1, the show's sophomore outing will comprise eight episodes, which Scardapane reconfirmed toColliderin February. As its predecessor's finale revealed, Matt Murdock and Karen Page co-founded an underground resistance movement that'll fight Fisk's fascist regime to regain control of New York's streets. We already have a sense of how they'll start to do so, too. In late March, abunch of first-look season 2 images appeared onlinethat showed Murdock and Page wearing disguises (or what passes for a disguise in the MCU). Clearly, they're scoping out something or someone, or they're on the hunt for new allies to join their cause. pic.twitter.com/MkWIh1cIDVApril 11, 2025 That won't be the only costume overhaul that Cox's Murdock will get in season 2. As some leaked images in the above X/Twitter post reveal, Murdock will be sporting Daredevil's classic black suit, complete with its red-colored 'DD' logo on the chest, next time around. Bullseye, who Daredevil will pursue and/or escape from Fisk's Anti-Vigilante Task Force (AVTF) with, is also seen wearing an updated version of his classic costume. Clearly, the pair haven't heeded Fisk's warning about vigilantes taking to the streets amid the implementation of martial law in New York – part of his 'safer streets' initiative to eradicate the scourge of masked individuals from the city. There are plenty more superhuman characters who could populate the street corner of the MCU, including those who appeared inNetflix's now-defunct Marvel TV universe. So, what are the chances of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist not only making their MCU debuts in season 2 but helping Daredevil combat the threat that the Fisks pose? In conversation withEntertainment Weekly(EW), Winderbaum and fellow producer Sana Amanat wouldn't rule out one or all of those characters, or even the reintroduction of Elektra and The Hand, showing up inDaredevil: Born Againseason 2. One hero who's incredibly unlikely to join Daredevil's cause (on the small screen, anyway) is Tom Holland'sSpider-Man. There werereferences to Spider-Man inBorn Againepisode 2andBorn Againepisode 3. However,SonyPictures owns the live-action rights to the webslinger, so, unless Marvel strikes an expensive deal with the tech giant's entertainment division, the chances of Peter Parker popping in to help take down Fisk are effectively zero. We live in hope, then, that The Devil of Hell's Kitchen will team up with Spidey in a big-screen project instead. Daredevil: Born Againseason 1 is only available to stream on Disney+, aka one of the world'sbest streaming services. If you haven't watched its nine episodes to date but are interested in doing so, you'll need to sign up for an account. Check out ourDisney+ priceguide for more on how much a subscription will cost you. Daredevil: Born Againseason 2 is highly unlikely to have any impact on what'll happen in the next twoAvengersmovies orSpider-Man 4. However, other projects will be *ahem* born out of what happened last season and in the series' next outing. The first of those will be a Disney+ special presentation starring Frank Castle/The Punisher. PerThe Hollywood Reporter, it could be released in 2026, so events in this TV Special may run parallel toBorn Again's next chapter. It's being co-written by Bernthal andWe Own This Citydirector Reinaldo Marcus Green, who has called it a \"shotgun blast of a story\" (viaEW). As I mentioned earlier, Marvel may look to revisit characters from Netflix's Defenders-Verse, too. Speaking toComicBook.com, Winderbaum intimated it was \"inevitable\" that the likes of Jones, Cage et al. would make their MCU debuts before tellingEWthat the comic book giant was \"very much exploring\" ways to bring them over. The devil, though, is in the details, so we'll see what shakes out ofDaredevil: Born Againseason 2 first before expecting too much, too soon on a potentialThe Defendersreunion.

    "title": "“If AI erodes people's belief in photography, then we have problems” – we talk AI and cameras with the winner of the Sony World Photography Awards 2025",
    "article_text": "We can't afford to be disconnected from photography because of AI image generation When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"In a tiny fraction of Earth's history, humans have altered the world beyond anything it has experienced in tens of millions of years. Scientists are calling it a new epoch: The Anthropocene – the age of human\". These are the opening words describing theSony World Photography Awards 2025winner Zed Nelson's project,The Anthropocene Illusion. The project, spanning six years and four continents, explores humankind's consumer behaviour towards nature and wildlife. \"So, while we devastate the world around us, we have become masters of a stage-managed, artificial 'experience' of nature – a reassuring spectacle, an illusion...to mask our destructive impact on the natural world.\" Powerful words and confrontational images of wildlife in zoos, national parks, and museums across the world, some of which I have included below. As I prepared to interview Zed during the opening day of the SWPA 2025 exhibition, which is being held at Somerset House in London until May 5, it struck me how severely AI is impacting the landscape of imaging in an equally tiny fraction of the history of photography. I asked Zed for his thoughts on AI image generation in photography, and here's what he said. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"The biggest worry in documentary photography, is people stop believing in what they see. Already we're at the stage where we can see an image and the first questions are; Is this photoshopped? Did that really happen? Did you move something? Is that image real? \"The problem with that, is that the joy and beauty in photography is to see something and be amazed and think this did happen, this is real, this is a record – even for future generations – of who we were and what we did. \"If AI erodes people's belief in the medium (photography) then we have problems. On the other hand, it may be that we start valuing truth more. And if an image is declared real - this is not AI, but a document of reality – it may be that its value increases. There will also be a move, a valuing of what is real, and so documentary work will start to become more important, not less. \"As AI multiplies it will cause problems, people will question what's real and what isn't. But I imagine there will also be a move, a valuing of what is real, and so documentary work will start to become more important, not less. People will crave it, they'll want to know it's real. \"I think there will be a separation between what is utterly created through AI, and what is declared real. We will gravitate to what is verified as real, made by people that care, and have a genuine interest in telling stories.\" After our conversation, I amble through the SWPA exhibition, soaking in the diverse collection of very real images. A greater appreciation grows in me for those real stories, real people, real places, created in a real moment in time, and they impact me all the more. I concur with Zed – even as AI-generated images become increasingly believable and plentiful, and the tools become easier and cheaper to access, we'll still need to know and experience what is real, and be moved by it. We can't afford to be disconnected from photography because of AI image generation, in the same way that Zed suggests in his project that we have become disconnected from nature and are instead consumers of it. I've included a selection of the SWPA winning images below. Even so, if you're in London, I highly recommend experiencing the exhibition firsthand and seeking out other photography shows near you. More details can be found at theWorld Photography Organisation website. TheSonyWorld Photography Awards comprises 10 categories, and the winner of one of these categories is also awarded the overall photographer of the year. As mentioned, this year's award went to Zed Nelson, who also won the Wildlife & Nature category. In addition to those categories, there is a student photographer and a youth photographer of the year award. I've included an image from each of those winners below. In all, there were around 420,000 entries from 206 countries – a record for the 18-year-old contest. Tim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

    "title": "Fresh iPhone 17 dummy unit leak may show camera bumps and MagSafe connectors for all four models",
    "article_text": "September is on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Day by day we're getting closer to September and the expected launch of theiPhone 17, and ahead of the official reveal, we've seen several leaked images purporting to show off this series of handsets – including a new picture featuring all four models. This comes from well-known tipster@MajinBuOfficial, who posted an image to social media showing dummy units of what we think are the iPhone 17 Pro Max, the iPhone 17 Air, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17. They go down in size, starting with theiPhone 17 Pro Maxas the biggest. That phone has been tipped to have a 6.9-inch display, with a 6.6-inch screen for the iPhone 17 Air, a 6.3-inch screen for the iPhone 17 Pro, and a 6.1 inch screen for the iPhone 17. That's all largely similar to the current models in terms of screen size, though the iPhone 17 Air is a new addition, so we can't compare it to anything else. It's said to be replacing theiPhone 16 Plusin the line-up, which has a 6.7-inch display. iPhone 17 Lineup pic.twitter.com/JidhEInOofApril 18, 2025 We can see here the rear camera bumps on these iPhones, which in the case of the iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPhone 17 Pro, are going to look substantially different to the ones on the current models – as we've seen fromother leaked renders. The four phone dummy units shown here all show MagSafe connectors too, apparently confirming that the wireless charging tech will be coming to these handsets. Rather unexpectedly,Appleleft it off theiPhone 16elaunched in February. Dummy unitslike theseare built based on schematics obtained from the supply chain, and help accessory makers – third-party case manufacturers for example – get their products ready ahead of a phone actually going on sale.

However, a lot of the leaks and rumors we've seen so far areconsistent in the designs they're showingfor these 2025 iPhones.

    "title": "ICYMI: the 8 biggest tech stories of the week, from new ChatGPT upgrades to Polaroid's latest instant camera",
    "article_text": "Your speedy recap When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Gather 'round, because we've got some tech tales to tell: TechRadar stories from the last seven days, covering new movie trailers, new instant cameras, new open-ear earbuds, problems for Spotify andSamsung, and more advances in artificial intelligence. We keep waiting for the pace of tech news across gadgets, AI, and software to slow down, but it certainly hasn't happened this week. In fact, it feels like there's more news to cover than ever, and we aim to cover as many of the most important announcements as we can. This comprehensive In Case You Missed It round-up will bring you right up to speed with everything that's happened in tech news over the past week, giving you just enough time to take a moment before we go again for another seven days of news and rumors. With the original director-writer combo of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland from the first movie making a return for this third instalment, our hopes were already high for28 Years Later– and anticipation levels just went up an extra notch after another trailer drop. The 191-second clip manages to give us just enough of a look at the movie to whet our appetites without giving too much away. It certainly seems as though there will be enough jump scares and zombie gore to make the upcoming movie a treat for horror fans. The next OnePlus phone launch is almost upon us, with the OnePlus 13T officially arriving on April 24. We can take a good, long look at the handset before then, though, because OnePlus has released a short video showing the phone in three different colors. We can see a flat back, curvy corners, and a new button that's replacing the standard OnePlus alert slider on this handset. We've also had confirmation that the phone will sport a 6.32-inch screen, and a capacious 6,000 mAh battery as well. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Getting One UI 7 out to the masses has proved to be quite the challenge for Samsung, and just when we thought owners of Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 7 phones would be getting the update, the rollout was put on pause amid reports of a serious bug. It's likely to mean that owners of older phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S23, are going to have to wait even longer to get their One UI 7 upgrade. With Android 16 (and therefore One UI 8) just around the corner, it's not a good look if you're Samsung. We found ourselves scrambling for our CD decks and radio dials on Wednesday – or maybe justYouTube– as Spotify suffered one of the most serious outages in history. Reports of unresponsive apps came flooding in from across the world for most of the day. We still don't know exactly what happened to trigger such a major problem on Spotify's servers. Perhaps the music streaming service is too embarrassed to tell us, but the company did specifically say that it wasn't a cyberattack causing the extensive issues. Say hello to the Sennheiser Accentum Open, an AirPods-esque pair of open-ear earbuds that don't cost much at all: in Europe they're listed at €89.90, which should work out as around £100 / £78 / AU$161 when these attractive-looking earbuds go on sale elsewhere. As well as being affordable, they look lightweight and promise 28 hours of battery life between charges (if you include the case). We haven't had a chance to test them yet, but we're hoping they live up to the usual high fidelity standards of Sennheiser's audio gear. The Polaroid Flip is the newest analog instant camera on the market, and it might just be the best, too – take a look at some of the snaps we've managed to capture with the device, and make your own mind up about this $199.99 / £199.99 camera (Australia pricing is TBC). It's fast and fun to use, and it's a throwback to when photos weren't stuck inside your smartphone forever: these photos actually make you feel something. Our fullPolaroid Flip reviewwill give you the complete rundown on this camera and what it has to offer. Strava, meet Runna. These are both fantastic apps for tracking runs and other activities, and now they've joined forces: Strava has announced it's purchased Runna, although nothing is going to change in terms of how the two apps operate for the time being. The aim is to \"create even greater value for our users,\" according to Strava CEO Michael Martin, and we can expect to see some of the AI-powered personalized training plans that Runna specializes in making their way over to users on Strava as well, in due course. OpenAIhas been consistent in regularly pushing out upgrades forChatGPTusers, and the latest update brings new o3 and o4-mini models across all user plans. These models are smarter, faster, and better at working with different modes (including text and images). In fact, these models are a nod towards the eventual arrival of the big GPT-5 upgrade, which is somewhere in the pipeline, and will be able to do much more on its own. In the meantime, images in ChatGPT have also beengiven their own dedicated Library section.

    "title": "'We told the story we wanted to tell': Andor lead star opens up on Disney's decision to end the Star Wars show after two seasons on Disney+",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: 'A lot of shows start without knowing where or when they're going to end' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Diego Luna believes it's the right decision on Disney's part to allowAndorto end after two seasons rather than one. Chatting to TechRadar beforeAndorseason 2debuts onDisney+, Luna expressed satisfaction and relief over the opportunity to tell \"the story we wanted to\" in theRogue Oneprequel series. Indeed, Luna was glad that Disney afforded him, showrunner Tony Gilroy, and the rest of the cast and crew the chance to wrap up its narrative, rather than cancel the show after a single season. Luna's worries about theStar WarsTV series ending before its time aren't unfounded. Despite the critical acclaim and award nominationsAndor's first season was met with, it's no secret that its development was a costly endeavor. Originally,Andorwas supposed to run for five seasons, with its final installment leading directly into the events ofRogue One, However, per a report published byForbeslast December, it's estimated that the price for creating its first two seasons was an astronomical $645 million. With Disney cutting costs across the board during Bob Iger's second stint as CEO,Andor's five-season plan was never going to materialize. Thankfully, during development on one of thebest Disney+ shows' first season, Gilroy had a \"great idea\", according to Luna, to condense four seasons' worth of character arcs and wider storytelling into one more season comprising 12 episodes. It's a format that Gilroy discussed with me prior to season 1's release in August 2022, with theseries' head writer calling them \"very sexy\" time jumpsthat would depict a single yet important event in each of the four years leading up to the start ofRogue One. Each 12-month period will span three episodes apiece, therefore allowing each narrative the same time and space to depict their individual stories. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Empire must be stopped.

It takes a lot of energy, time, and money to make one, because each season takes two and a half years of our lives. \"But, while we were shooting season one, Tony had this great idea of squeezing four seasons into one and essentially make four chapters. \"I also think that, today in long format storytelling and TV in general, a lot of shows start without knowing where or when they're going to end. But, from beginning to end, we told the story we wanted to tell and that's a beautiful thing to be able to do.\" I'll have more exclusive content to bring you from my interviews with Diego and more ofAndor's cast in the build up to, during, and after season 2's debut.

    "title": "US aimed at setting ‘realistic’ terms during Iran talks – RT source",
    "article_text": "The US delegation attempted to present“realistic”demands to Iran during Omani-mediated negotiations in Rome on Saturday, an informed source told RT. The delegations, led by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, sat in separate rooms as Omani mediators relayed messages between them. The talks came two weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with“bombing”unless an agreement on its nuclear program was reached. An informed source familiar with the talks told RT that“the American delegation tried to set its demands realistically in the second round of negotiations.” “We made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,”a US official told CBS News. Araghchi wrote on X that the“relatively positive atmosphere in Rome has enabled progress on principles and objectives of a possible deal.”He added that many in Tehran believe the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, is“no longer good enough for us.” US President Donald Trump abandoned the JCPOA during his first term in office, accusing the Islamic Republic of secretly violating the deal. Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran and, in February, formally renewed his“maximum pressure”campaign. Iran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its commitments under the JCPOA, increasing its enrichment of uranium. “Iran’s nuclear program is completely peaceful, and Iran is ready to dispel any doubts in this regard,”Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Saturday. Technical experts are scheduled to meet again ahead of the next round of negotiations between Witkoff and Araghchi in Oman on April 26, according to the Iranian foreign minister.",

    "title": "Trump administration plans to send envoy to Russia again – CNN",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration is planning one more meeting between special envoy Steve Witkoff and senior Russian officials to get Moscow on board with its vision for peace in the Ukraine conflict, CNN has claimed, citing an anonymous source. Witkoff has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin three times this year as the US president tries to broker a ceasefire between Kiev and Moscow. In its article on Saturday, CNN further quoted its source as saying that Washington’s plan, which was reportedly presented to Ukrainian officials and several European leaders during a top-level meeting in Paris on Thursday, envisages a ceasefire along the current front line. The US government also supposedly signaled a willingness to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Commenting on his meeting with Putin in Moscow last Friday, Witkoff told Fox News on Monday that the nearly five-hour talks were“compelling”and that the Kremlin is seeking a lasting solution to the Ukraine conflict. Trump’s special envoy claimed that Moscow and Kiev“might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large.” According to the US official, any potential peace deal would include the recognition of Crimea, the Donetsk, and Lugansk People’s Republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions as part of Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that while there were“no clear outlines of any agreement yet,”Moscow values the“constructive and substantive”contact with the US. Witkoff’s remarks did not sit well with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, who on Thursday accused Trump’s envoy of“wittingly or unwittingly spreading Russian narratives.” He reiterated that Kiev will“never recognize any temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian.” Russia has maintained that it is open to peace talks with Ukraine in principle, as long as its key security concerns are addressed. Moscow demands among other things that Kiev renounce its NATO aspirations and recognize the territorial“realities on the ground.” The Kremlin has insisted it will not accept a mere freeze of the conflict. On Saturday, President Putin announced a temporary Easter truce effective from 18:00 Moscow time through midnight on Sunday night. While he expressed hope that Ukraine would reciprocate, he also stated that the“Kiev regime has violated the agreement on pausing energy infrastructure strikes more than a hundred times.” Putin argued that Ukraine’s reaction to the ceasefire would be a clear indicator of whether Kiev is serious about wanting to achieve peace.",

    "title": "RT successful at countering ‘Western news monopoly’ – Iranian minister",
    "article_text": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had some warm words to say about RT in an exclusive interview with the broadcaster, stressing the network’s effectiveness in countering attempts by the West to control the global news space. During the conversation on Saturday, Araghchi congratulated RT on its 20th anniversary this year. It began broadcasting out of Moscow on December 10, 2005. “I am a fan of this network. I usually follow its news, its analysis and programs,”he said. The top diplomat explained that“unfortunately, the current world is under the influence of the Western, mainly American, media that publish world news from their own perspective. Of course, with complex methods and because of their reach, they are trying to control public opinion in the world.” “RT’s efforts to create a news space and a new information channel have been very valuable and useful. It seems to have been an effective effort to counter the news monopoly in the Western world, and I hope that it will continue on this path… I wish you success,”he said. Last September, the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden announced a new raft of sanctions targeting several Russian media outlets, accusing them of attempting to“undermine democracy”and interfere in US elections. Then Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged that RT was“functioning as a de facto arm of [Russian] intelligence.” Moscow condemned the restrictions, alleging that Washington had“declared war on freedom of speech.” The curbs on RT remain in place despite continuing discussions between the Russian government and administration of US President Donald Trump aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries.",

    "title": "US sets timeline for Kiev to agree to ceasefire – media",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump reportedly expects to“make a determination for a full and comprehensive ceasefire”between Ukraine and Russia as early as next week. Both are to be presented with the final offer, the New York Post has claimed, citing an anonymous senior administration official. Trump has stated on multiple occasions that he wants to put an end to the Ukraine conflict as soon as possible. Since he assumed office in January, Washington and Moscow have been engaged in active diplomacy, holding several rounds of high-level talks. The newspaper quoted a source on Friday as saying that“this coming week in London, we want to make a determination for a full and comprehensive cease-fire.”The unnamed US official added that the“intent then is to have[discussions]with the Russians”and determine where Moscow and Kiev stand on this“final offer.” According to the publication, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff during their meeting in Paris on Thursday that Kiev is“90%”on board with Washington’s peace framework, which has yet to be made public. Ukraine’s remaining concerns mostly revolve around territories which Kiev claims as its own, but are in fact under Moscow’s control at present, the Post reported. Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially recognize the“reality on the ground,”while Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out such a scenario. The media outlet further alleged that the US could offer Russia a“carrot”: the relaxation of sanctions and the potential unfreezing of Moscow’s seized assets, which are currently held by Western institutions. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump echoed a remark made by Rubio earlier in the day, stating that“if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult… we’re going to just take a pass.” Russian authorities have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of a ceasefire with Ukraine and accused Kiev’s backers in Europe of undermining US efforts. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Moscow’s UN representative, Vassily Nebenzia, stated that due to the West’s record of using peace deals to help build up the Ukrainian military, expectations of a full ceasefire are“simply unrealistic at this stage.”",

    "title": "Ties with Russia and China key to global peace – Iranian foreign minister",
    "article_text": "Iran, Russia, and China intend to deepen their cooperation in order to promote global peace and security, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said in an exclusive interview with RT. Tehran has been strengthening its ties with Moscow and Beijing in recent years, joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 2023 and the BRICS group in 2024. Military cooperation has also expanded, most recently through joint naval drills conducted by the three countries off Iran’s coast in March. Given the current international climate, working closely with Moscow and Beijing is“a necessity”for Tehran, Araghchi told the broadcaster on Saturday. “We have started trilateral talks between Iran, Russia and China on the issue of Iran’s nuclear program for some time now,”he said, adding that two such meetings have already taken place.“We are ready to continue these talks and expand them to other issues,”the minister added. Araghchi expressed confidence that“Iran, China and Russia – in a coordinated move – can take effective steps towards international peace.”The three partners“are serious about this,”he insisted. Tehran’s top diplomat also said that bilateral“relations between Iran and Russia have never been so close and so strong”than at the current moment. “We now have a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that raises the level of our relations to a strategic level. Major economic projects are underway between us. The volume of trade between us has increased tremendously,”he said. Despite harsh Western restrictions slapped on both Iran and Russia, the two countries“are not waiting for the sanctions to be lifted, but we are expanding our relations in this situation,”Araghchi noted. “We have the same and close positions on many international issues. I do not want to say that there are no disagreements between us. Sometimes there are also differences of opinion, but in most cases we have close positions with each other and, most importantly, we are in constant exchange of views,”he said. Earlier this week, Russia’s Federation Council, the upper house of the country’s parliament, unanimously ratified the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Russia and Iran, which was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Masoud Peseshkian in January. The pact stipulates that the two nations will develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation in the fields of politics, defense, economy, security, trade, investment, energy, infrastructure and other areas.",

    "title": "Trump team explains letter to Harvard – NYT",
    "article_text": "A letter outlining sweeping demands on university admissions, hiring, and school curriculums, which the White House claims targeted antisemitism, was sent to Harvard University by mistake, the New York Times has cited senior US officials as saying. The White House had emailed the Ivy League university an“updated and expanded list of demands”last Friday, following a wave of pro-Palestinian protests across US campuses. The message warned Harvard that it“must comply”in order to maintain government financial support. The proposals called for changes to be made to governance, hiring, and admissions, including the elimination of all DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programs. Harvard rejected the demands, accusing the White House of trying to“control”its campus. In response, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced it would freeze over $2.2 billion in federal grants and $60 million in government contracts with the university. A little later on, however, an official from the Trump administration contacted Harvard, claiming that the letter was“unauthorized,”according to two people familiar with the matter. The letter had reportedly been seen by Sean Keveney, acting general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the antisemitism task force, according to three other sources briefed on the incident. Though the letter’s content was genuine, there were conflicting accounts within the administration about how it had been mishandled, an unnamed official told the newspaper. Some reportedly believed it was sent prematurely; others said it was meant for internal circulation only. May Mailman, a senior policy strategist at the White House, acknowledged the controversy when speaking to the New York Times, but criticized Harvard for not verifying the letter. Harvard rejected that criticism, saying the letter bore official federal signatures and appeared legitimate.“It remains unclear to us exactly what, among the government’s recent words and deeds, were mistakes or what the government actually meant to do and say. But even if the letter was a mistake, the actions the government took this week have real-life consequences”for students and employees as well as“the standing of American higher education in the world,”it said in a statement to the Times. In October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas, the militant organization which controls Gaza, after the Palestinian group launched a surprise attack against the Jewish state which claimed over 1,200 lives. The brutality of the large-scale offensive, which has left over 50,000 dead according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, has sparked university campus protests in the US, which has been providing West Jerusalem with weapons. Columbia, Harvard, UC Berkeley, Yale, Michigan, and Northwestern became key protest sites last year, forming the backdrop for heightened tensions that have influenced the administration’s push for stricter campus oversight. Last month, the task force also cut $400 million in funding to Columbia and warned of further cuts.",

    "title": "Germany wants the UK to hold its hand while it starts WWIII",
    "article_text": "Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz doesn’t officially take office until May 6, but that hasn’t stopped him from hitting the press circuit like it’s demolition day. Apparently, he’s got some lost time – and infrastructure – to make up for. In a chat with Germany’s public broadcaster, ARD, he floated the idea that Kiev, which seems to rank higher than Berlin on his priority list, needs to“get ahead of the situation”on the battlefield and“shape events”instead of playing defense. The event he seems most eager to shape? Oh, just the Third World War, apparently. Because he pivoted straight to the Kerch Bridge – mainland Russia’s lifeline to the Crimean peninsula – like it’s been living on borrowed time. Merzsaidthat“if for example, the most important land connection between Russia and Crimea is destroyed, or if something happens on Crimea itself, where most of the Russian military logistics are located, then that would be an opportunity to bring this country strategically back into the picture finally.”Cool, cool. Which picture would that be, exactly? The one labeled“Catastrophic Misjudgments of the 21st Century”? Probably. Which is why Merz needs a useful idiot to ride shotgun alongside him in the doltmobile to share in any responsibility for the eventual mayhem when things inevitably go pear-shaped. “You rang?”say the Brits. Or at least that’s what Merz is apparently hoping they say.“Our European partners are already supplying cruise missiles,”Merzsaidin an interview.“The British are doing it, the French are doing it, and the Americans are doing it anyway, this must be jointly agreed. And if it’s agreed, then Germany should take part.” Merz’s fellow Christian Democratic Party MPs have been floating the idea in the Western press that he’s waiting for an official permission slip from London. It would probably read something like this:“Dear Herr Friedrich, You are hereby authorized to partake in a highly coordinated, militarized pub crawl. First stop: a punch-up with Russia, followed by a wobbly march to a greasy spoon for black coffee, bad lighting, and a collective hangover.” “Ah, wunderbar!” Merz is just days away from grabbing the wheel, and he’s done pretending to be the guy in the backseat yelling directions at Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Scholz, for his part, always said that Germany wouldn’t hand Kiev the Taurus long-range missiles. Not that he had much wiggle room after last year’s leaked audio from Russian intelligence of German Air Force brass workshopping ways to hit the Kerch Bridge without leaving any German fingerprints. Kind of a bad look for a guy who keeps overtly declaring that he wants peace. So naturally, he was furious. Which is why, if Team Scholz suddenly turned around now and said,“You know what? Let’s try a few long-range missile strikes, just for funsies,”people might reasonably assume that he’d undergone a surprise lobotomy with a NATO letter opener. As the coalition partners for Merz’s incoming government, Scholz’s Social Democrats’ support would be needed on any vote. And so far, they’ve shown no interest in greenlighting his WW3 passion project. You know, democracy and all that. Minor hiccup, I know. If military ambition and musings alone were all it took, Merz would already be well on his way to having a Netflix original named after him and maybe even a seat with his name on it waiting at The Hague. But hey, hear the guy out. What if it’s, like, a group project?Das ist gut, ja? Nah, dude.Nicht gut. Nicht gutat all. What exactly does Team Merz think this would look like? Would the Brits and Germans sit side by side, fingers hovering over their respective missile buttons, doing a tense little“one, two, three, fire”and just praying that neither one flinches at the last second and leaves the other one with some very awkward phone calls to make? If so, that would certainly explain why they’re talking about specifically needing Britain’s non-negotiable participation and not France – the country that trained a flagship brigade for the Ukrainian army, who apparently learned how to bail out before even seeing action.“Paris hailed it as a ‘unique’ initiative,”reportedFrance24. Training 1,700 Ukrainiansin France to fight who then just end upsurrenderingto the foie gras and rosé at the local café prior to deployment is ‘unique’, alright. Britain isn’t exactly a great choice for a wingman either, though. If only because it says that its own participation in Ukraine is contingent on Washington holding its hand.“Europe must play its role, and I’m prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement, but there must be a US backstop,”British Prime Minister Keir Starmersaidin February. So for those keeping score at home. For deeper involvement in Ukraine, Merz would need the Brits. The Brits would need Washington. And what would Washington need? For them all to knock it off. But apparently that memo got lost in their inbox among all the world war fantasy fiction. “Pentagon figures recently questioned one ally about why it was still supplying weapons to Ukraine – a challenge that was ignored,”The Economistreportedon April 15. ”Diplomats in Washington also report that some Trump aides say privately that they are ‘fed up’ with Europe’s effort to strengthen Ukraine.” Doesn’t sound like Team Trump is up for holding hands as part of the West’s human chain in its reckless playground games against Russia.“Red Rover, Red Rover, send Putin right over!” It’s hard to believe that there was a time not too long ago that Germany wasn’t trusted with the sharp knives, like nukes. Oh wait, it still isn’t. Technically, the Bundeswehr is still supposed to be defense only, but Merz seems determined to assemble just enough multilateral hand-holding to justify pulling out the long knives – the 500-kilometer-long ones, to be precise. If this is the new leadership model, then someone better put all the launch codes in a childproof box.",

    "title": "War against Orthodoxy underway – iconic film director",
    "article_text": "The move by authorities in Chisinau to prevent a Moldovan bishop from attending an annual ceremony in Jerusalem is part of a wider war against Orthodox Christianity, renowned Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica has said. Bishop Marchel of the Moldovan Orthodox Church was set to fly to Israel on Thursday for the Holy Fire ritual on April 19. He told the media that border police at Chisinau airport had stopped him for a search and returned his passport only after his plane had departed, despite finding nothing suspicious. Marchel later said his second attempt to board a flight to Israel was also“unjustifiably”blocked by the authorities. The Holy Fire ritual at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, held on Holy Saturday, is a key event which precedes Orthodox Easter. The flame is believed to descend miraculously each year at the site of Christ’s crucifixion. Pilgrims light candles from it and take the fire back to their home countries to light others as part of an ancient holiday tradition. When asked by RIA Novosti on Friday about the Moldovan government’s treatment of the bishop, Kusturica said,“after the attack on the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, nothing surprises me anymore.” In late March, Ukrainian officials and police broke into the catacombs of the country’s most important monastery, the burial site of early Orthodox saints. The move came amid a power struggle over the Kiev Pechersk Lavra between the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), created only in 2018 and backed by the government of Vladimir Zelensky. “It was a sign of war against the Orthodox world, against Orthodox Russians and all Orthodox believers,”the two-time Palme d'Or winner said about the events in Kiev. The blocking of the Moldovan bishop’s trip to Jerusalem“continues that same battle. They think that with new secular political steps they will first intimidate and then destroy Orthodox civilization. But they will not succeed,”Kusturica insisted. As in neighboring Ukraine, Moldova has faced religious tensions involving two major Orthodox factions: the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, and the Metropolis of Bessarabia, under the Romanian Orthodox Church. Amid rising geopolitical tensions with Russia, the pro-EU government in Chisinau has largely backed the Bucharest-aligned metropolis.",

    "title": "Should you always be sore after a workout? Experts explain why pain isn't proof of progress",
    "article_text": "Entertainment CNA Lifestyle Entertainment Entertainment Living People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Women Living Remarkable Living Living Remarkable Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Obsessions Experiences Dining Dining Dining Dining Experiences Travel Singapore Dining Wellness Wellness “No pain, no gain” is a common mantra in the fitness world. Experts explain if it’s true. (Photo: Pexels/Victor Freitas) There’s a pervasive belief among fitness enthusiasts that if you aren’t sore after a workout, you’re not getting into shape or working your muscles hard enough to build strength. But soreness is not equivalent to progress, fitness experts say. And constant soreness is not something to strive for. “A common misconception is that soreness means a workout was effective,” said Cedric Bryant, an exercise physiologist and the president and chief executive of the American Council on Exercise. “While some soreness is normal, it is not a requirement for muscle growth.” When your muscles feel sore a day or two after exercise, it’s typically because of microscopic tears in your muscle fibres that canlead toinflammationand pain, said Laura Richardson, an exercise physiologist at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology. As your muscles repair during the days afterward, the pain dissipates, she said. Muscles also often grow stronger after soreness, but that discomfort is certainly not required for muscle growth, Dr Bryant added. Many athletes do not get sore after workouts, even when they are continuing to improve their fitness and build muscle. “This does not mean the workout was ineffective,” Dr Bryant said. It is usually a sign that their muscles have adapted to a regular training routine and have become “more efficient at handling the workload,” he said. Instead of using soreness as a metric for effectiveness, monitor your progress through improvements in strength, endurance or visible muscle changes, Dr Bryant said. If you’re able tolift progressively heavier weightsor increase the length or intensity of your cardio workouts, for instance, that’s a positive sign. Excessive soreness can even be counterproductive, Dr Bryant added. Because it’s hard toexercise through pain, it can worsen your athletic performance or increase your risk for injuries, particularly if you try to compensate for sore muscles by moving in unnatural ways. It’s beneficial togive your body time to repair itself, he said. If you feel sore after a workout, consider easing up on your exercise routine for a few days. Make sure to hydrate–with water, or if you had a particularly long or vigorous workout, an electrolyte drink–because dehydration is associated with cramping, said Dr Vijay Jotwani, a sports medicine physician at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas. If your soreness is bad enough that it interferes with your daily functioning, it’s fine to take a dose of anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen, he added. Gently massaging your sore muscles, such as by kneading or stroking them with your hands for 10 to 15 minutes, may also help, Dr Richardson added. Ina 2018 systematic review and analysisof 99 studies, researchers found that massage was one of the most effective ways to reduce the pain and fatigue of exercise-related muscle soreness, but more research on the topic is needed. Wearing compression garments around sore muscles and taking 10- to 15-minute-long cold-water baths were also effective, the scientists found. If you experience severe muscle pain or weakness hours or days after a particularly intense workout, or if your urine darkens to a brown colour or you aren’t urinating much at all, that could be a sign of a rare, potentially life-threatening condition calledrhabdomyolysis, and you should go to the emergency room, Dr Jotwani said. For muscles that are only slightly tender or stiff, it’s okay to work them again with the same form of exercise that caused the soreness in the first place, but reduce the intensity of your workout, Dr Bryant said. If the soreness is a little more intense, meaning you can still move but with some discomfort, he suggested more gentle movements, like walking, swimming or yoga–or low-intensity resistance training, like lifting light weights or doing body weight exercises, to promote blood flow and reduce stiffness. It can sometimes help to “keep moving through the soreness,” even if you’re moving just a little bit, Dr Richardson said. If your muscles are painful to the touch, you have a limited range of motion or your strength is very reduced, Dr Bryant said, it’s best to allow the muscle more time to recover and take a day off. “A good rule of thumb,” he added,“is to listen to your body.” By Melinda Wenner Moyer © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "title": "Meet the young artist reviving the art of traditional sign painting all over Singapore",
    "article_text": "Entertainment CNA Lifestyle Entertainment Entertainment Living People Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Women Living Remarkable Living Living Remarkable Living Style & Beauty Obsessions Obsessions Experiences Dining Dining Dining Dining Experiences Travel Singapore Dining Living Living From antiquated lettering in gold leaf on a glass shopfront to statement-making murals, Charmaine Chen’s philosophy is that “old is gold”. Singapore artist Charmaine Chen specialises in hand-painted signs, often working with gold leaf. (Photo: CNA/Jiakee Mak) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Something about letters and lettering speaks to Charmaine Chen more than any other art form. The core of the 36-year-old artist’s work revolves around painting signs by hand, the old-school way, often involving ornate lettering and gold leaf gilding. If you’ve been out and about visiting bars, cafes, restaurants and even some tailors and barbershops, you might have seen her work: The Dragon Chamber restaurant, Motherdough bakery, Kurasu, Dickson Nasi Lemak and Dolcetto at Conrad Singapore Orchard are just some of the establishments proudly advertising their businesses to passersby through her signs. Besides paint, she also specialises in working with gold leaf of all karats and colours in all kinds of finishes, from shiny 12k white gold to matte 24k yellow gold and everything in between – a skill that’s more than a little specialised. The rich detail on the Dragon Chamber’s door is one of her favourite projects, taking several days to complete; each of the dragon’s golden scales was painted individually. Some of her biggest and most elaborate signs can be found inside Novena Church, in the lobby as well as the carpark. During the course of painting these, \"I had people bringing me fruit and food, and random people coming up to me and thanking me and praying for my hands”, she recalled. “It was their place of worship and and I was painting it, so I was actually a little bit nervous as to how people would respond to it. “But, I'm extremely happy with the kind of response that I get, be it from the church or my clients, in their homes, their restaurants. It's been wonderful, because it is very intimate – your sign stays with you, hopefully, the whole time.” It is precisely this “human element” of a hand painted sign that continually captivates her, Chen said. “When you run your hands along a plastic sign, you don't get the same sensation as running your hands along an old, hand painted sign. It's got character, it's got soul. It ages quite beautifully,” she said. A vinyl sign might be cheaper, which is why you’ll find them everywhere; but far less durable or sustainable in the long run as they tend to bubble and peel at the edges, she explained. “If you want something that you know really lasts, I believe in getting it done by hand.” And, “You get the same result from every single printer you go to.” But, with a painted sign, “you’re the only one who has it”. Chen first encountered sign painting during her university days in Sydney, where she studied industrial design and went on to live for eight years. “I noticed that along the streets, in many of the neighbourhoods, the old signs were being retained. There was a bit of a revival going on where they realised they were quickly disappearing and that these skills needed to be passed on and shared,” she said. “Then, I started to realise, ‘There's a human behind all these signs. There's a trade behind them, one that's still very much practiced’.” She found a sign-painting class to sign up for, and, along with it, a community. The very first sign she painted read: “Let sleeping dogs lie”. A post shared by Charmaine Chen - Sign Painter (@oldworld_charm) “I was so curious and I had this fire in my belly,” she recalled. “I just started asking people if they would trust me to paint their sign. I started with the coffee shop downstairs of my house, and they put it up. After that, I got more confident. I painted more signs, asked more people, painted more signs and learnt more things, all while keeping a full-time job.” At her day job, “I did a little bit of scenic painting, and I did a lot of marquage painting, which is the customisation of luxury bags”, she said. “Eventually, I realised it felt like my full-time job was holding me back from getting into sign painting completely. My passion was overriding it very clearly.” Still, “For a long time, I was unsure. I wasn't too confident about how a sign painter was going to survive in Singapore,” she said. Fellow sign painters around the world, whom she’d met online or at conferences, encouraged her to take the leap. And, her parents were “extremely supportive”. Those who told her not to quit her job “eventually got behind me when I showed them, 'I can do this. I want to do this.’ And, I personally think I thrive better in an environment like this than in an office”. She explained: ”It's the lettering. It's the process. It’s the practice. I don't know why, as well. But, I've never really gotten myself immersed into anything like this, and it feels right. So, I’d like to keep at it until I can't anymore.\" What goes into painting a sign that emulates the look of vintage ones? “I start my process with a lot of observation and research. I like to go into archives from the early 1900s and get my brain going, juices flowing, and all sorts of inspiration. It could be from anything, like an old tin that I saved up. Then, I start drawing things out, seeing how they look. And then I create a pounce pattern, which is basically the design. I perforate the entire thing, and then pounce chalk or charcoal through it so that the pattern gets transferred onto the wall (or surface). And then, I paint.” It’s a process that requires “complete precision and patience”, and can take many days to complete. Working with gold leaf is especially challenging because “when you make a mistake, you can’t go back and fix it. You have to start again. If you want your job to be seamless, many moving parts have to come together at once”. Plus, “Gold leaf is an extremely delicate material, so if I so much as breathe, it will fly and just disappear. It’s really, really thin. And, It's probably about S$3 a sheet, at least. So, if you learn to handle it properly, and you get good at it, you're actually saving yourself money.” On top of that, there are other techniques, such as mastery of tools, perfecting layouts and making surfaces look naturally aged. Producing a flawless piece of work “used to be something I would strive for, but it's the beauty and imperfection that I realised I value a lot more than perfection itself,” she said. “If you think you're the best, you're not open to learning anymore, and your journey stops there.” For inspiration, she makes “pilgrimages” to countries like the UK and Japan. But, signs aren’t all she paints. In September last year, she spent five weeks painting a mural on a carefully aged wall as part of an event organised by arts organisation Art Outreach. And, last month, together with other local artists, she worked on an even larger mural spanning the facade of the six-storey Tampines North Community Club, quite literally scaling greater heights than ever before. A post shared by Charmaine Chen - Sign Painter (@oldworld_charm) Once she’s finished a work, though, “I have this feeling that I can't look at it any more”, she laughed. It’s because “I spent so many hours so immersed and almost stuck to this wall”. But, “After I shrug that off, it feels great, actually. It feels great to be able to put work out and have people understand that this is something done by hand, not by machine”. Chen’s philosophy is that “old is gold”. “I can spend a really, really long time in a thrift store or antique store, just looking at all the little details of things. The amount of detail you get is just kind of lost in things nowadays,” she said. “Everything is being streamlined, and we're going less ornate, when actually, we could be going the other way, because we can.” For her, “Antiques are never going to go out of style. Nostalgia is never going to go out of style. Everybody is going to want to go back and remember a time that used to be”. Anachronistic things “remind you of a time when things were slower, when people took time to make things, when craftsmanship was valued – not just fast, cheap and temporary, but quite the opposite. I think that's what draws people in. That is what draws me in.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone lamented his side's poor performance as their slim LaLiga title hopes were dealt a major blow in Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Las Palmas, admitting his side needed \"perfect numbers\" to stay in contention. Third-placed Atletico conceded a last-gasp goal to fall to the relegation-threatened hosts, remaining on 63 points, 10 behind leaders Barcelona and three adrift of second-placed Real Madrid, who host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. With six league games remaining, Simeone seemed resigned to losing the last title Atletico were still competing for this season, admitting the match \"did not go as they had imagined.\" \"If we had any chance of winning the league, we had to get perfect numbers. Today we didn't,\" the Argentine told reporters. \"The first half was fairly solid but we couldn’t take the lead. The second half started flat, and we weren’t able to create what we had imagined.\" Simeone denied any lack of attitude by his players, but admitted that their tactical execution and individual performance fell short. \"It wasn't a matter of attitude, we just played badly,\" he said. \"There was no fluidity, no chance to link up play. We set the game up a certain way and made changes to find solutions, but it didn't work.\" The coach added that, despite having virtually lost the title, he will continue to approach each game with the same determination, while aiming to improve the team's defensive play. \"We always prepare with the same enthusiasm, and we will continue to take care of it as we have been doing for the past 14 years,\" Simeone said. \"We have struggled more in this last stretch than we did at the beginning of the season.

    "title": "Meet Rose Ang, the hardworking Singaporean chef who’s been in-demand at the world’s top restaurants since 1998",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living People People Having carved her career in big-name restaurants abroad, 51-year-old Rose Ang has finally opened Domo, her first restaurant in Singapore. Chef Rose Ang. (Photo: Dillon Tan/CNA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. She may not have a Michelin star or a ranking on the World's 50 Best Restaurants, yet chef Rose Ang’s career would make most other chefs envious. The 51-year-old Singaporean hasn’t had to apply for a job since 1998. Instead, she’s been consistently headhunted by some of the world’s largest conglomerates in places as far-flung as Georgia, Azerbaijan, Mykonos and St Moritz, where she was not only the executive chef of Nobu but also the F&B manager for owner Nobu Matsuhisa’s restaurant group in Europe. How does a Singaporean from Queenstown Secondary School smash every barrier she's encountered in a notoriously male-dominated industry? By working triply hard to stand her ground, of course. “In the 1990s, women [in the kitchen] were usually given light jobs or something repetitive like peeling onions or the salad station. They wouldn't let us touch anything in the hot kitchen,” she recalled. “So, I did a lot of free work to prove I can do hot-side cooking.” That meant working her eight-hour shift as a trainee chef before working another eight for free in any other department that would have her. “After several months, one of the pastry chefs saw that I was keen to excel in the industry and took me under his wing. He eventually gave me all the recipes for the department. No one else had those recipes except the sous chef,” she said proudly. While working at the Park Hyatt Canberra as a banquet chef in 1997, Ang found it hard to understand why the front of house insisted on doing things a certain way. To remedy that, she spent her off hours volunteering in a cafe downstairs to learn how restaurant service works. “Firstly, I worked for free because if I got paid, my employers would not be happy. So I spent a few months learning how to do service on my days off. After that, whenever a manager or waiter at the restaurant tried to tell me about something that happened in the front of house, I had some experience of what that feels like. I can do my job better because I understand the whole flow.” This doggedness has shaped Ang into a rarity in the F&B industry — someone with the skill, adaptability and business acumen who’s as comfortable heading the kitchen as she is handling the business of hospitality. This has made her an asset to some of the most prominent international hotel and restaurant groups, including the award-winning Zest Catering in Sydney, Australia, where she was the only woman in the kitchen heading a team of up to 40 chefs. She assures me that she has remained friends with the Scottish chef who didn’t get the job. To say that work has a way of finding her might be understating it. Consider the time in 2012 when she returned to Singapore to take a break after working with the Nobu Group. “I came back on a Monday and a head hunter called me on Thursday saying there’s an opportunity in Melbourne. I told them I’m home taking a break, but they said they needed someone urgently,” she said. Long story short, within four days, Ang and her possessions arrived in Melbourne, where she became the executive chef of Sake Restaurant. “That was the quickest job interview ever!”In 2020, after nearly three decades abroad, Ang returned to Singapore to ride out the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I was based in Georgia and was supposed to develop F&B projects for a couple of hotels (in the Georgia Real Estate Group). I decided to come back to Singapore because I think it was the safest country to be in times like that,” she said. What Ang didn’t know was that this would be her homecoming. In February 2025, she opened her own restaurant Domo, a sprawling modern Japanese establishment that occupies the space vacated by multi-concept Japanese restaurant Mikuni at Fairmont Singapore. “Chau Pak Heen, the second-generation owner of Asia Grand (the Chinese restaurant beside Domo), approached me when the hotel asked if he was interested in taking over the space,” Ang said. “He knows my background, and when we started discussing it in 2024, there weren't many Japanese restaurants like this in Singapore. I love Japanese culture and cuisine, and of course I was very excited.” Ang describes Domo as a modern Japanese restaurant with European influences, much like those she helmed across the world. “It’s based on my life experiences,” she said. “I’ve spent a lot of time in Europe — Switzerland, Munich, Zurich, and even Central Asia — and that’s why I describe it as modern Japanese with European influences. It’s not traditional Japanese food, but it’s not confused either. It’s what I know, and it’s what I do best.\" At Domo’s heart is charcoal robata that yields dishes like miso cod and A5 wagyu steak flambe with truffle teriyaki. Diners can also order from the extensive selection of sashimi, maki, sushi, appetisers, salads, soups, noodles and tempura. Domo may not be of the ilk that comes to mind when Singaporeans think of Japanese food, but Ang is confident that the dining public will embrace its possibilities. “My focus is to offer my customers and guests a fun and nice place where you won’t feel any pressure when you walk in. You can come and just have a plate of noodles, and we will welcome you as much as if you come here and spend bigger on king crabs or wagyu beef,” she explained. “It's not some high and mighty place where you must have a reservation. Anyone can walk in. We can joke around… it's a friendly place.” A post shared by Domo Restaurant (@domorestaurantsg) If nothing else, her track record elicits optimism — a bit of hardship has never gotten her down. “There's always a solution to any problem,” she chirped. “If you see it as a problem, you’ll never resolve it. If you see it as an experience and take it as part and parcel of the journey… then you can work through it.” It’s a philosophy that has taken her across the world, after all.

    "title": "Commentary: Xi Jinping’s visit to Vietnam is not all about Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Hanoi’s welcome of the Chinese president amid the global tariff war is about serving Vietnam’s national interests and development, says this ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute researcher. SINGAPORE: Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Vietnam from Apr 14 to Apr 15 came just days after US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement ofsweeping global tariffs, amid Washington’s looming 46 per cent tariff on Vietnamese goods and escalating China-US geoeconomic confrontation. Caught squarely in the crossfire, Vietnam faces mounting pressure from both sides: Xi has cautioned Hanoi against appeasing Washington, while Trump swiftly framed Xi’s visit asan attempt to “screw” the US. Yet, for all the shadows cast by Trump’s tariffs, the true significance of Xi’s visit lies in the deeper political and economic currents that can potentially reshape the future of Vietnam-China relations. For China, Xi’s trip to Vietnam – as part ofa bigger Southeast Asia tour– came on the heels of its Central Conference on Work Relating to Neighbouring Countries that took place between Apr 8 and Apr 9. The conference underscored the strategic imperative of China’s neighbourhood diplomacy as it enters “a critical phase of deep linkage between regional landscape and… world changes”, hence China’s need to “view neighbouring regions through a global perspective”. China’s renewed emphasis on its periphery as a buffer against Western confrontation and isolation is a time-tested strategy. After the 1989 Tiananmen incident and the collapse of the Communist bloc, Beijing turned to ASEAN to stabilise its external environment, while Vietnam seized the moment to normalise ties with China and resolve the Kampuchea issue. This resulted in a diplomatic breakthrough that ended over a decade of hostility between the two countries. For Vietnam, China’s strategic focus on its neighbourhood could present another important opening for national development. As the country ushers in a “new era” under the Vietnamese Communist Party’s (VCP) new leader, To Lam, strategic stability in its external environment is paramount. With internal political transitions underway and the 14th National Party Congress on the horizon, the Vietnamese leadership understands that the success of their ambitious reform agenda rests on shielding the domestic landscape from external volatility. The disruptive forces that Trump has unleashed in the international system only incentivise Vietnam to cultivate a constructive and stable relationship with China: not as a counterweight to Washington, but as a strategic necessity to safeguard Vietnam’s security and development. Of note, Hanoi’s ongoing efforts to recalibrate its development model calls for a pragmatic and productive relationship with China. While reversing Trump’s tariffs is an immediate imperative, the situation also exposes the structural limits of Vietnam’s long-standing growth formula – an export-driven economy based on cheap labour, low-cost land, and little local value-add, whether in textiles, electronics or mobile phones. Under To Lam’s leadership, Hanoi is setting its sights on a more resilient path, built on not only foreign direct investment and export but also new local growth drivers of infrastructural investment, innovation, and technology. This strategic pivot is taking shape in policy terms. The VCP Central Committee’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (December 2024) places breakthrough development in science, technology, innovation and digital transformation at the heart of Vietnam’s economic transition, identifying people and enterprises as the principal agents of change. Resolution 59 (January 2025) reaffirms Vietnam’s commitment to proactive and comprehensive international integration despite global headwinds. Concurrently, the sweeping streamlining of the bureaucratic apparatus to address institutional bottlenecks underscores Hanoi’s determination to remove internal barriers to development. Xi’s visit offered Vietnam an opportunity to secure Chinese backing for its ambitious development agenda. Foremost among Hanoi’s priorities is advancing investment-led growth over the coming decade, necessitating enhanced infrastructure cooperation with China. While Vietnam has traditionally approached China’s Belt and Road Initiative with caution, recent developments suggest a subtle shift. This is reflected inmultiple cooperation agreements signed during Xi’s visit, covering road transport, energy infrastructure, seaports, logistics, aviation, and notably, the establishment of a joint committee on railway cooperation. The committee’s priority is the construction of cross-border railways linking China to key cities in northern Vietnam, with Chinese technical assistance and concessional loans. This time around, Hanoi has strongly emphasised China’s technology transfer and capacity building, aiming to enhance domestic firms’ participation in its upcoming flagship project: the North-South high-speed railway. Another key priority for Hanoi is increasing Vietnamese firms’ integration into high-value supply chains in sectors where China already commands technological and industrial leadership, such as high-speed railways, artificial intelligence, and green technologies. Like China, Vietnam is nurturing its national economic champions, including Viettel and FPT in tech sectors, VinFast in EVs and Hoa Phat in steelmaking. Vietnamese leaders are intent on steering these firms beyond being mere technology adopters to become technology innovators capable of capturing greater value shares, particularly in Vietnam’s rapidly expanding market. Economic cooperation with China offers a practical, albeit complex, pathway towards fulfilling this ambition. Granted, challenges persist: from the risk of Vietnam’s market being flooded with Chinese products amid their now constrained access to the US market and Washington’s intense scrutiny on Vietnam-China economic entanglement to Chinese restrictions on technology transfer and Beijing’s caution against Chinese firms shifting supply chains overseas. Yet, Vietnam’s growing openness to deeper Chinese involvement in its infrastructure and technological ecosystems – as shown during Xi’s visit – reflects a level of political courage and trust among the current Vietnamese leadership towards China, which is unseen in recent times. The strategic logic behind Xi’s visit – and Hanoi’s welcome – was set in motion long before Trump’s shocking tariffs made headlines. The trip’s significance lies not in Hanoi’s allegiance to any camp but was a litmus test of Hanoi’s ability to balance great power relations while keeping national development at the heart of its foreign policy. The real question is not which way the Vietnamese bamboo bends but how deeply its roots are anchored and how carefully its strategy aligns external partnerships with domestic priorities. The compass guiding Vietnam remains steady: stability, development, internal resilience and an openness to engage all partners on terms that serve its national interest.

    "title": "Munoz strikes late as Las Palmas stun Atletico 1-0 in blow to slim title hopes",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA, Spain :Javi Munoz scored a stoppage-time winner to earn relegation-threatened Las Palmas a shock 1-0 victory over Atletico Madrid on Saturday, dealing a major blow to the visitors’ slim LaLiga title hopes. Diego Simeone's side remain third in the standings with 63 points, three behind second-placed Real Madrid, who host Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. \"It was a tough match, a defeat we have to put behind us and move on. But today is tough,\" Atletico defender Robin Le Normand told Movistar. \"It's clear that every point is important. Beyond fighting for the title, we wanted to play a very good match... They didn't create much, but they're playing for salvation, fighting for every ball. We didn't get it right.\" Both sides had chances to break the deadlock before halftime, with Las Palmas coming close through a close-range header from Alex Suarez and a Dario Essugo effort that went just wide. At the other end, goalkeeper Dinko Horkas produced sharp saves to deny Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth before the break. In a slower-paced second half, Atletico dominated possession but were unable to create clear scoring chances against a disciplined defence from the hosts. Seconds before the match ended in a goalless draw, Munoz capitalised on sloppy defending by Atletico, who failed to clear the ball, allowing the midfielder to shoot from close range and finally beat goalkeeper Jan Oblak. The goal was initially ruled out for offside, but a VAR review overturned the decision three minutes into stoppage time, sparking wild celebrations at the Estadio Gran Canaria. \"They took a desperate long shot and scored. We had a couple of chances in the first half that their goalkeeper saved,\" Atletico captain Koke said. \"We have to keep going. We know that LaLiga is almost impossible, but we have to prepare ourselves by working hard. We have to win against the teams at the bottom if we want to fight for LaLiga.\" The surprising victory allowed Las Palmas to climb to 17th place and temporarily escape the drop zone with 32 points, two ahead of Alaves, who play at Sevilla on Sunday. \"I was certain that I wasn't offside. When I saw that the ball was dead, I went to take advantage of the play,\" Las Palmas' Munoz said. \"There's a lot of fighting left but we're going to fight until the end. Let's enjoy the victory and hope it helps us to keep believing that the team can do it.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "World World Protesters form a \"Impeach & Remove\" human banner on Ocean Beach during a protest against US President Donald Trump, in San Francisco, Apr 19, 2025. (Photo: San Francisco Chronicle via AP/Stephen Lam) WASHINGTON: Thousands of protesters rallied in Washington and other cities across the US on Saturday (Apr 19) to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump's policies ondeportations,government firings, and the wars inGazaandUkraine. Outside the White House, protesters carried banners that read \"Workers should have the power,\" \"No kingship,\" \"Stop arming Israel\" and \"Due process,\" media footage showed. Some demonstrators chanted in support of migrants whom the Trump administration has deported or has been attempting to deport while expressing solidarity with people fired by the federal government and with universities whose funding is threatened by Trump. \"As Trump and his administration mobilize the use of the US deportation machine, we are going to organize networks and systems of resistance to defend our neighbors,\" a protester said in a rally at Lafayette Square near the White House. Other protesters waved Palestinian flags while wearing keffiyeh scarves, chanting \"free Palestine\" and expressing solidarity with Palestinians killed in Israel's war in Gaza. Some demonstrators carried symbols expressing support for Ukraine and urging Washington to be more decisive in opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Since his January inauguration, Trump and his billionaire ally, Elon Musk, have gutted the federal government, firing over 200,000 workers and attempting to dismantle various agencies. The administration has also detained scores of foreign students and threatened to stop federal funding to universities over diversity, equity and inclusion programs, climate initiatives and pro-Palestinian protests. Rights groups have condemned the policies. Near the Washington Monument, banners from protesters read: \"hate never made any nation great\" and \"equal rights for all does not mean less rights for you.\" Demonstrations were also held in New York City and Chicago, among dozens of other locations. It marked the second day of nationwide demonstrations since Trump took office.

    "title": "Sabalenka dials up tension by using phone to photograph contested mark",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport World number one Aryna Sabalenka took matters into her own hands and used a mobile phone to photograph a disputed ball mark when the umpire refused her request to take another look during her win over Elise Mertens at the Stuttgart Open on Saturday. Sabalenka looked bemused when an out call went against her to give Belgian Mertens the first service break and a 4-3 lead in the opening set of their quarter-final, and a check by umpire Miriam Bley confirmed the call. The Belarusian went to look for herself and when Bley refused her call to check again, Sabalenka borrowed a phone from one of her team members and took a photo of the mark to a mixture of cheers and whistles from the crowd. Bley then gave Sabalenka a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct but the player put the incident behind her to break back immediately and went on to win 6-4 6-1. Bley and Sabalenka shook hands after the match, which left the player with the impression that all was not forgiven. \"When I gave her a handshake there was a very interesting look and a very strong handshake, never had it before,\" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. Asked if she had returned the pressure in the handshake, Sabalenka said: \"No, it's okay, why would I play this game with someone like her?\" Sabalenka will meet Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals after the Italian defeated American Coco Gauff 6-4 6-3.

    "title": "US, Iran report progress in nuclear talks, will meet again",
    "article_text": "World World Omani embassy, Rome, Apr 19, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Vincenzo Livieri) ROME: The United States and Iran made progress in asecond round of high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear programmeon Saturday (Apr 19) and agreed to meet again next week, both sides said. The Oman-mediated talks in Rome lasted about four hours, Iranian state television and a senior US official said. Tehran's top diplomat Abbas Araghchi declared it a \"good meeting\" that yielded progress. \"This time we managed to reach a better understanding on a series of principles and goals,\" he told Iranian state TV. The senior US official said in a statement, \"Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions.\" Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the parties had \"agreed to resume indirect talks at a technical level over the next few days and subsequently continue at the level of two senior negotiators next Saturday\", Apr 26. Oman said the third round would be in Muscat, returning to the site of the first talks a week ago. Those were the first discussions at such a high level between the foes since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord in 2018. Western countries including the United States have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran has consistently denied, insisting that its programme is for peaceful civilian purposes. After Saturday's talks, Oman's foreign ministry said Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had agreed to keep negotiating. The talks, it said, \"aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal which will ensure Iran (is) completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, and maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy\". Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the talks were \"gaining momentum and now even the unlikely is possible\". Baqaei said the delegations had been \"in two different rooms\" at the Omani ambassador's residence, with Albusaidi passing messages between them. Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. After returning to office in January, Trump revived his \"maximum pressure\" campaign of sanctions against Iran. In March he wrote to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging renewed nuclear talks while also warning of military action if diplomacy failed. \"I'm not in a rush\" to use the military option, Trump said Thursday. \"I think Iran wants to talk.\" On Friday, Araghchi said Iran \"observed a degree of seriousness\" on the US side during the first round but questioned their \"intentions and motivations\". In an interview published Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, the United Nations nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran was \"not far\" from possessing a nuclear bomb, noting a day later that talks were \"at a very crucial stage\". During Trump's first term, Washington withdrew from the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers that offered Iran relief from international sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Tehran complied with the agreement for a year after Trump's withdrawal before scaling back its compliance. Araghchi was a negotiator of the 2015 deal. His US counterpart, Witkoff, is a real estate magnate Trump has also tasked with talks on Ukraine. Iran currently enriches uranium up to 60 percent, far above the 3.67 percent limit in the deal but still below the 90 percent threshold required for weapons-grade material. On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged European countries to decide whether to trigger the \"snapback\" mechanism under the 2015 agreement, which would automatically reinstate UN sanctions on Iran over its non-compliance. The option to trigger the mechanism expires in October. Iran has previously warned it could withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if the mechanism were triggered. Analysts had said the United States would push to include discussions over Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for militants in the Middle East. But Araghchi said Saturday the US side had \"not raised any issues unrelated to the nuclear topic so far\". He said earlier this week Iran's right to enrich uranium was \"non-negotiable\", after Witkoff called for its complete halt. Witkoff had previously demanded only that Iran return to the ceiling set by the 2015 deal. On Friday US ally Israel affirmed its commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, saying it had a \"clear course of action\" to do so, a stance Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Saturday. \"I will not give up on this, I will not let go of it, and I will not retreat from it, not even by a millimetre,\" he said.

    "title": "Man City leave it late to boost European hopes, Villa thump Newcastle",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport LIVERPOOL, England :Two late goals boosted Manchester City's hopes of Champions League qualification as they beat Everton 2-0 to move to fourth in the Premier League on Saturday, while Aston Villa also stayed in the hunt with a thumping home defeat of Newcastle United. With Liverpool potentially sealing the title on Sunday and the relegation places looking set, the race to finish in the top five and qualify for next season's Champions League is adding some much-needed tension to the run-in. Outgoing champions Manchester City are by no means certain to secure their spot and for long periods at Goodison Park they were flat and looked in danger of dropping more points. But goals by Nico O'Reilly and Mateo Kovacic in the final minutes secured a win to move them above Nottingham Forest into fourth spot with 58 points from 33 matches, one point behind third-placed Newcastle and one ahead of Forest and sixth-placed Villa who crushed Newcastle 4-1 in the late kickoff. City host Villa on Tuesday in a crunch game. \"Of course, we are miles away from (league leaders) Liverpool. But now it (Champions League qualification) is in our hands, we need a final on Tuesday. Hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League,\" relieved manager Pep Guardiola said after the win at Everton. O'Reilly stabbed home the ball from four metres after connecting with Matheus Nunes's low cross before Kovacic drilled in the second goal from the edge of the box. Everton's defender James Tarkowski had struck the post with a header from a corner in the first half for Everton, who remain 13th with 38 points from 33 games. Villa bowed out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage on Tuesday despite a thrilling 3-2 second-leg win at home to Paris St Germain, but showed no sign of a hangover. Ollie Watkins, recalled to the starting line-up, scored with a deflected shot after 33 seconds - moving him to a joint club-record 74 goals in the Premier League. Fabian Schar equalised for in-form Newcastle but Villa blazed clear after the break with Ian Maatsen restoring their lead from a Watkins assist before a Dan Burn own goal and substitute Amadou Onana's superb finish sealed the points. \"The players responded fantastically (to Champions League disappointment),\" manager Unai Emery said. \"Villa Park is special. It is our fortress. The supporters are excited and they are motivating us, pushing us and helping us. \"We are happy and we want to keep going, keep balanced because there is still a lot to do.\" BRIGHTON'S PEDRO SENT OFF Brentford kept alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe when they beat Brighton & Hove Albion 4-2 with Bryan Mbeumo scoring twice and creating another goal for Yoane Wissa. Mbeumo and Wissa have notched up 18 and 16 league goals respectively this season and, with Brentford in 11th place but only three points off eighth-placed Bournemouth, they could propel the London club into Europe. \"That's an incredible achievement from the two of them,\" manager Thomas Frank said of the duo. \"If you want to have any hope of European dreams or ambitions, we had to win today. Now there's five games to go, extremely interesting end to the season.\" Brighton, who are two points ahead of Brentford in 10th place, were not helped by having Joao Pedro sent off. Bournemouth's European challenge is stalling after a 0-0 stalemate against Crystal Palace meant they have won only once in their last eight league games. Palace ground out a point in a forgettable game despite being reduced to 10 men late in the first half after defender Chris Richards was sent off for a second yellow card. Bournemouth have 49 points, their highest ever tally in a Premier League season, with five games still to play. \"It's a point where before the game it's not a bad result. But considering how this game has gone, it's a big missed opportunity,\" manager Andoni Iraola told reporters. Bottom club Southampton are already relegated but earned a rare point as Lesley Ugochukwu scored an equaliser in added time for a 1-1 draw at West Ham United. The draw meant Southampton have 11 points and have five games left to avoid being labelled the joint-worst team in Premier League history, a record that belongs to the 2007/08 Derby County side which finished with 11 points. Liverpool could clinch a record-equalling 20th English title on Sunday if they beat Leicester City and second-placed Arsenal suffer a surprise defeat at 18th-placed Ipswich Town.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport CESKE BUDEJOVICE, Czech Republic :Defending champions Canada thumped Finland 8-1 in the semi-final of the women's ice hockey world championship on Saturday to set up a somewhat predictable final against the United States. Canada and the U.S. have contested all but one of the 23 previous finals, with Finland denying Canada a place in the 2019 decider, and the two hockey powerhouses will meet again on Sunday after the U.S. edged hosts Czech Republic 2-1 in their semi-final at the Arena Ceske Budejovice. Finland, beaten 5-0 by Canada in the preliminary round, made a bright start but were ultimately undone in the final minutes of the second period by a ruthless Canadian side who had hammered Japan 9-1 in the previous round. The Finns took a shock lead in the opening minute, with Michelle Karvinen getting to the puck ahead of the goaltender. Canada calmly dealt with the early blow, and drew level through Erin Ambrose within two minutes and Marie-Philip Poulin put the champions ahead before the end of the first period. That goal made Poulin Canada's all-time leading points scorer at Women's World Championships with 87, overtaking Hayley Wickenheiser. Finland were unable to take advantage of the first power play of the match in the second period, and when Canada were restored to full strength they stretched their lead with Daryl Watts strike from behind the goal going in off the keeper. The goal was challenged by Finland for a missed offside, but the score stood and with the Finns punished for delaying the game, Watts scored again during the power play to make it 4-1. Emily Clark and Danielle Serdachny added another two goals for Canada before the end of the second period to leave Finland needing a miracle. Early in the final period, Finland had a five-minute power play, but it was Canada who scored again, through Claire Thompson and Sarah Nurse finished off the rout. Finland will now look to retain their bronze medal against the Czechs on Sunday.

A second-half header by Scott McTominay gave Napoli a 1-0 win at relegation-threatened Monza on Saturday as Conte's side provisionally moved level with leaders Inter Milan, before the defending champions visit Bologna on Sunday. \"We are fighting for something unexpected and unimaginable,\" Conte told a press conference. \"At the beginning of the year who would have said that Napoli would fight with Inter for first place? ...

    "title": "Watkins takes out his anger on Newcastle to send Emery a message",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport BIRMINGHAM, England :Recalled Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins took out his anger on Newcastle United on Saturday with a dazzling display in his side's 4-1 victory in the Premier League. Watkins scored inside the opening minute, was twice denied by the woodwork in the first half and then set up team mate Ian Maatsen to restore Villa's lead in a rampant second half. Villa's emphatic win lifted them into sixth place and right in to the mix for Champions League qualification. It was quite a statement from Watkins after the England forward had found himself on the bench in five of Villa's last six games, including both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Paris St Germain, with manager Unai Emery opting for on-loan forward Marcus Rashford instead. Watkins, whose deflected shot after 33 seconds was his 74th Premier League goal for Villa - a joint club record - admitted he had been left fuming after losing his place. \"So I think the manager's got a little bit of a headache because I'm banging on his door saying why am I not playing,\" former Brentford striker Watkins told Sky Sports. \"We've put in a lot of hard graft the last few years to get to that position. And obviously I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games. I'm not going to lie. I was fuming I wasn't playing and I let him know that. \"But he's the manager at the end of the day and you've got to respect his decision, but I'm not one of those players that's happy to sit on the bench.\" Watkins has scored 15 Premier League goals this season, more than any other English player, and his omission will not have gone unnoticed by clubs keen to sign the 29-year-old. Asked about his demotion to the bench, Watkins added: \"I think it's something I haven't experienced before, and then obviously to miss out on the biggest stage, you always want to be playing, especially in the Champions League,\" he said. \"I think me and a few others were disappointed that we didn't start the game. We did end up beating (PSG) but obviously not, not across both legs. The team played really well but I wanted to be out on the pitch much longer. \"I wanted to be starting in the important games, because I've played a big part to get to where we are today.\" Villa go to Manchester City on Tuesday where Watkins will expect to start and move past Gabriel Agbonlahor as the club's leading all-time scorer in the Premier League. \"I'd set my eyes on that target since when I signed for the club and I'm not far away now,\" he said.

We’ve called the latterthe most influential assembler of timepieces on earthwhile the former sold over$4 million worth of watches at Sotheby’s in December. So, it’s not entirely surprising to see that they are often on the same page. In the fall of 2023, when Rolex started rolling out its“Puzzle dial” Day-Date, Mayer andBrady were both spottedwith the piece within a few days. If you wanted any further proof that Audemars Piguet has a hit on its hands with its new 150th anniversary Royal Oak, look no further than the wrists of Mayer and Brady, who were both seen wearing the brand-new piece this week. A couple of months ago,Audemars Piguet launched a groundbreaking new perpetual calendar movementin time for its 150th anniversary. Dubbed the Calibre 7138, it’s controlled entirely through the crown—there are no tiny pushers in the case sides, and no miniscule corrector tool to potentially misplace. You pull the crown out to successive positions to adjust various calendar information, and as you push it back in, it engagesdifferentfunctions than on its way out. (We know—all this sounds fairly nerdly and unexciting. But for watch guys, it’s truly groundbreaking stuff.) One thing we hadn’t seen until this week was someone wearing one of the new QPs in the wild. First up wasTom Brady, who indulged us at the opening of his new store Card Vault by Tom Brady at the American Dream mall in New Jersey—finally, my family’s tax revenue put to good use! The GOAT rocked the Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar ref. 26674SG.OO.1320SG.01 in sand gold, the company’s insanely beautiful 18K precious metal alloy of rose and white gold. (The movement has also been fitted to a stainless steelRoyal Oakas well as a white-gold Code 11.59.) Measuring 41 mm wide by just 9.5 mm tall, it features a gold-tone Grand Tappisserie dial with black indices as well as the classic Royal Oak integrated bracelet. Besides the magic going on inside the watch, much of the appeal of the new QPs is in subtle dial tweaks. The display features the months and leap year at 3 o’clock, the moon phase at 6 o’clock, the day and 24-hour indicator at 9 o’clock, the date at 12 o’clock, and the week number along the rehaut (the outermost edge of the dial). “Monday” and “1” align perfectly with 12 o’clock, while a red indicator within the 9 o’clock register serves as a reminder not to set the watch between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. in the morning. (It won’t break the movement—which is a possibility on otherQPs—if you set the watch between this time, but the indications might not update properly.) The date numbers, furthermore, are all perfectly spaced—a difficult feat that requires different-sized teeth for each date increment within the date wheel. Five years of careful development went into the Calibre 7138, whose design was granted three patents A dedicated watch collector, Brady has earned several other notable AP references in the past, so it comes as no surprise that he’d be among the first to snag this special QP. In his December auction, Brady parted with a pièce unique Royal Oak in white gold with a diamond-set bezel, a salmon dial, and his name spelled out in calibré-cut and baguette-cut diamonds in the indices. (The watch’s winding rotor also has Brady’s signature in it.) No stranger to QPs, he’s also been spotted in a Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar in blue ceramic as well as a Royal Oak Grande Complication. The Calibre 7138 solves a problem—if you can call it that—that has long bothered serious watch heads. Its debut within three striking AP references, timed perfectly with the brand’s 150th birthday, was one of the biggest watch stories of the year, outshining many of the debuts atWatches & Wonders. Where better to spot such a watch than on the wrist of one of the world’s biggest collectors? This must’ve been the week that AP delivered its first batch of new Calibre 7138-powered QPs, because Christmas, it would appear, came early for Brady andJohn Mayer. Spotted performing withZeddat Coachella, Mayer rocked the same sand gold ref. 26674SG.OO.1320SG.01 on Brady’s wrist this week. Mayer is, of course, more than just an AP brand ambassador—as “Creative Conduit,” he connects with collectors and works on special projects with the brand, including his ownfabulously sparkly QPthat was launched in early 2024. (Here’s to hoping he releases a second watch using the new Calibre 7138!) SinnersdirectorRyan Cooglerrocked a hell of a watch while seated courtside at the Memphis Grizzlies-Golden State Warriors play-in game this week. During the week of his new film’s highly anticipated opening, Coogler wore aRolex Day-Datein Everose gold (Rolex’s version of rose gold) with a dark-colored dial. Fitted to its famed President bracelet and powered by the brand’s automatic Calibre 3255 movement, the Day-Date features both a date display as well as the day spelled out in full in an arc-shaped window at 12 o’clock. (It was the first watch in the world to feature such a configuration upon its launch back in 1956.) It’s also a watch with astrong Oscars association…possibly an auspicious sign for Coogler! Donning the green jacket following his victory at the 89th Masters at Augusta National,RoryMcIlroy wore the Omega Speedmaster “Silver Snoopy Award” 50th Anniversary. Built to celebrate a half-century sinceOmegawas given the famedSilver Snoopy Awardby NASA for its part in helping the Apollo 13 crew return safely to Earth, this fun take on the Speedy features America’s favorite beagle in the 9 o’clock register. Flip it over, and you’re presented with possibly the coolest non-exhibition caseback ever made. On it, Snoopy actually shoots across the scene as the chronograph is engaged, and the Earth disc rotates once per minute. Harry Styles. On a Lime bike. In London. With aCartier Tankon his wrist.That’s one delicious serving of word salad. Styles was never much of a watch guy, as far as we could tell, but that seems to be changing. Out for a ride in the British capital, heappeared to be wearing the Tank Louis Cartier. While it wasn’t the first Tank ever launched—that would be the Normale—the LC is what many would consider the prototypical Tank model, with rounded brancards, a cabochon-set crown, and a rectangular (rather than square) profile. It looks like Styles chose the yellow-gold version with a silvered dial, though it also comes in rose gold as well as numerous other configurations.",

    "title": "Supreme Court Blocks Trump Admin's Use Of Wartime Law To Deport Venezuelan Migrants, At Least For Now",
    "article_text": "The US Supreme Courttemporarily barredPresidentDonald Trump’s administration from deporting Venezuelan men in immigration custody early Saturday morning after their lawyers feared their clients were at imminent risk of being sent out of the country. “The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the justices said in a brief, unsigned decision. Conservative JusticesClarence ThomasandSamuel Alitodissented in a ruling that was issued just after midnight. Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union filed an urgent request on Friday with the Supreme Court, and multiple other courts, after receiving reports that some of the men had already been loaded onto buses and were being told they were going to be deported—possibly to the notorious prison in El Salvador where others have been jailed. But the ACLU argued that these men had not been given due process by the Trump administration, as required by the Supreme Court. Migrants, recently released from a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center, depart from a transportation bus as they arrive at the Shreveport Regional Airport (SHV) in Shreveport, Louisiana, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024. According to the defense team, the men had received a notice saying they had been classified as members ofTren de Aragua, a criminal gang originating from Venezuelan prisons that Trump and his administration haslabeleda terrorist group, and that they have “been determined to be an Alien Enemy subject to apprehension, restraint, and removal.” Trump previously invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a centuries-old wartime authority that grants the president the ability to detain or deport the natives and citizens of another nation, to remove men that immigration enforcement claimed were members of Tren de Aragua. “These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court. We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month,”Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney in the case, said in a statement on Saturday. A prison officer guards a cell at maximum security penitentiary CECOT (Center for the Compulsory Housing of Terrorism) on April 4, 2025 in Tecoluca, San Vicente, El Salvador. As of Saturday morning, the White House had not immediately responded to a request from Reuters for comment. When President Trump was asked on Friday about the planned deportations of the Venezuelan men, he claimed he was unfamiliar with the particular case, but said that “if they’re bad people,” he would “certainly authorize it.” The Trump administration—including the president, Homeland Security AdvisorStephen Miller, Secretary of StateMarco Rubio, and Secretary of Homeland SecurityKristi Noem, and other immigration officials—have in the few months sincetaking officerolled out a coordinatedonslaughtagainst immigrants, both documented and not, across the country. This comes after Trump, when running for office,referredto immigrants as “animals” andsaidthat they are “poisoning the blood of our country.” In March, more than 130 men whom the Trump administration claimed were Tren de Aragua members were deported to El Salvador. Family members and lawyers for the men have said they weresingled outbecause of tattoos that they have, but an expert on the gangtoldNBC that tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua and that “Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos.” (Immigration officials have maintained that they did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the deportees as alleged gang members.) In early April, the Supreme Courtruledin favor of the Trump administration’s use of the 1798 law, with certain limits. The justices, in a 5-4 decision, said that detainees must receive notice that they are subject to removalandbe given enough time to seek what due process is granted to them. The latter requirement is what the ACLU is claiming the Trump administration failed to do. It’s unclear if the president and those in control of immigration enforcement within his administration will follow the Supreme Court ruling. In this handout provided by Sen. Van Hollen's Office, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) meets with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (L) at an undisclosed location in San Salvador, El Salvador on April 17, 2025. The administration has so far failed to comply with another directive from the court to facilitate thereturnofKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant living in Maryland who wasillegally deportedto El Salvador’s high-security mega prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. The case of Abrego Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, has resulted in anongoing legal battleinvolving the Trump administration, local and nationalcourts, Democratic US SenatorChris Van Hollenof Maryland,andthe president of El Salvador,Nayib Bukele. As of Saturday, Abrego Garcia was reportedly moved from CECOT to a detention center hours away. It’s still unclear if or when he will be returned to his family in Maryland, despite the Supreme Court’s directive.

    "title": "All-Women Blue Origin Flight Gets Social Media Flack From US Secretary of Transportation",
    "article_text": "Monday’s Blue Originall-female space flighthas seemingly accomplished the impossible. In a world where everything fromlife-saving medical advancesto Disney’sprogramming slatehas been the victim of a massively divided nation,very fine people on both sideshave made an effort to chide the high-profile jaunt, including US Secretary of TransportationSean Duffy. The privately owned Blue Origin NS-31 self-flying rocket counted broadcast journalistGayle King, singerKaty Perry, andLauren Sánchez(engaged to Blue Origin founderJeff Bezos) in its seats, as well as STEM advocate and entrepreneurAisha Bowe, civil rights activistAmanda Nguyễn,and film producerKerianne Flynn. Sánchez, whowith her fiancée proudlystood alongside a passel of tech billionaires suchElon MuskandMark ZuckerbergasDonald Trumpwas sworn inas president this year, “led the organization of the historic mission,”Ellereports, and “chose each of the women because of their proven ability to inspire others.” Sánchez’s proximity to power wasn’t enough to keep folks likeOlivia Munnfrom raising questions about the flight. Arguably one of the earliest public critics of the trip, during an April 3 appearance on NBC’sToday With Jenna and Friends, the actor said, “I know this probably isn’t the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are so important in the world right now. What are you guys gonna do up in space? What are you doing up there?” “What’s the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it’s a bit gluttonous…Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they gonna do up there that has made it better for us down here?” (L-R) CEO of Meta and Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk arrive for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Donald Trump takes office for his second term as the 47th President of the United States. After the 11-minute flight, criticism grew louder, withEmily Ratajkowskisayingvia TikTokthat the flight is “end-time shit. Like, this is beyond parody.” “Look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space. For what? What was the marketing there?” Olivia Wildewas just as biting, if more succinct, sharing a photo of Katy Perry kissing the ground upon the flight’s landing to Instagram Stories,with the caption“Billion dollars bought some good memes, I guess.” The backlash has been enough that Kingfired back at criticsthis week, saying, “I know there are cranky Yankees. I know there are some haters. I’m not going to let people steal my joy.” “I still have a hard time calling myself an astronaut, but two of the astronauts on board—[Aisha Bowe]is a rocket scientist,[Amanda Nguyen]is an astrophysicist-activist—were actually doing experiments. Every time one of those goes up, you get some information that can be used for something else, so I wish people would do more due diligence.” Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket carrying astronauts Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyn, Kerianne Flynn, Gayle King, Katy Perry, and Lauren Sánchez lifts off from Launch Site One on April 14, 2025 in Van Horn, Texas. According to US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, King’s “hard time” is warranted. Via X (formerly Twitter), the former Republican congressman andstar of the Boston-set sixth seasonofThe Real Worldsaid thatBlue Origin’s use of “astronaut crew” to describe the flight’s passengers (asit did here) is incorrect. Echoing Munn’s critique, Duffy tweeted that “the last FAA guidelines under the Commercial Space Astronaut Wings Program were clear: Crewmembers who travel into space must have ‘demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety.’” Duffy concluded with a subtle dig that suggests that those questioning the flight might not be the only ones who need to employ some of King’s “due diligence.” “The crew who flew to space this week on an automated flight by Blue Origin were brave and glam, but you cannot identify as an astronaut,” Duffy said. “They do not meet the FAA astronaut criteria.” Roman Reigns’s Quest to Be WWE’s Next Great Crossover Star Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought This Is HowMeta AI StaffersDeemed More Than 7 Million Books to Have No “Economic Value” TheResurrectionofDexter EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked An IncipientNew Anti-Trump ResistanceIs Upon Us WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive: Behind theNixon-Kennedy Rivalry",

    "title": "Liza Minnelli Makes Rare Public Appearance For RuPaul's Drag Race Finale",
    "article_text": "The true star of Friday’s season 17 finale ofRuPaul’sDrag Racewasn’t its winning queen or its host,RuPaul Charles. Instead, it wasLiza Minnelliwho stole the show, taking a seat in a massive, onstage throne for a pre-crowning bit of banter with RuPaul. Minnelli, the 79-year-old stage and screen icon and daughterof Judy Garlandanddirector Vincente Minnelli, was awarded the show’s third-ever “Giving Us Lifetime Achievement Award.” Previous recipients includeCassandra Peterson(better known, perhaps,as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) anddesignerBob Mackie. Revealed to the crowd as her 1972 version of “Ring Them Bells”played, a Halston-clad Minnelli reclined on her throne as the audience stood, clapped, and chanted “Liza.” “Look at you!” she said to RuPaul, admiring the host’s tulle-laden look. “I know. It only took six hours,” replied the 64-year-old RuPaul. “Seven for me,” Liza Minnelli shot back. “I’m older than you.” RuPaul, a notedappreciator of old Hollywood lore, asked Minnelli about her childhood on the MGM lot. “Everybody would rush to see whatever my mother was doing, and my father, especially, because he was making people do magic,” Minnelli said. “Oh, he was the best.” The Drag Race host also asked about a 1980s-era newspaper photo of Minnelli “holding a guitar to go record with the Pet Shop Boys … why were you holding a guitar?” “Because they told me to hold it,” Minnelli responded. “What would you do?” she asked the chuckling crowd. “I’m a director’s daughter!” SpeakingwithVariety,Drag RaceproducerTom Campbellsays that Minnelli’s appearance on the finale came straight from Ru, herself. “She seemed un-gettable, like that’s too much to ask for,” Campbell said, but the competition show lucked out. “Her management were also big fans ofDrag Race, and they know what we’ve done, and they know the heart of the show, and they’re invested as viewers.” (L-R) Lady Gaga and Liza Minnelli speak onstage during the 94th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on March 27, 2022 in Hollywood, California. Friday’s appearance was one of Minnelli’s highest profile appearances since 2022, when she appeared at the Oscars for an onstage bit withLady Gaga—an appearance that longtime friend and collaboratorMichael Feinsteincharacterized as “sabotage.” “She only agreed to appear on the Oscars if she would be in the director’s chair, because she’s been having back trouble,” Feinstein said then. “She said, ‘I don’t want people to see me limping out there.’ She said, ‘You know, I want to look good. I don’t want people to worry about me.’” But minutes before her appearance, Feinstein says she was told she’d have to enter in a wheelchair instead. “She was nervous, and it made her look like she was out of it,” said Feinstein. “Can you imagine being suddenly forced to be seen by millions of people the way you don’t want to be seen? That’s what happened to her.” By contrast, the Minnelli that I saw Friday night seemed sharp as a tack—and also appeared delighted to appear on stage with RuPaul. “I don’t know what else to say, except, if it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be me. You made me,” Minnelli said to the room at large. “Well, you made us, actually,” RuPaul responded, before moving on to the final lip sync battles of the evening between the final four queens,Lexi Love,Onya Nurve,Jewels Sparkles, andSam Star. And while Cleveland-based Nurve emerged the victor, it’s likely that many of us will remember the finale as Liza’s night, instead.

    "title": "US worked to ‘set its demands realistically’ in talks with Iran – RT source",
    "article_text": "A US delegation attempted to present realistic demands to Iran during Omani-mediated negotiations in Rome on Saturday, an informed source has told RT. The delegations, led by US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, sat in separate rooms as Omani mediators relayed messages between them. The talks came two weeks after US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with“bombing”unless an agreement on its nuclear program was reached. An informed source familiar with the talks told RT that“the American delegation tried to set its demands realistically in the second round of negotiations.” “We made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,”a US official told CBS News. Araghchi wrote on X that the“relatively positive atmosphere in Rome has enabled progress on principles and objectives of a possible deal.”He added that many in Tehran believe the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the original nuclear deal, is“no longer good enough for us.” Trump abandoned the JCPOA during his first term in office, accusing the Islamic Republic of secretly violating the deal. His administration reimposed sanctions on Iran and, in February, after returning to office, he formally renewed his“maximum pressure”campaign. Tehran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its commitments under the 2015 plan, increasing its enrichment of uranium. “Iran’s nuclear program is completely peaceful, and Iran is ready to dispel any doubts in this regard,”Esmaeil Baghaei, the spokesman for Tehran’s foreign ministry, said on Saturday. Technical experts are scheduled to meet again ahead of the next round of negotiations between Witkoff and Araghchi in Oman on April 26, according to the Iranian foreign minister.",

    "title": "Trump plans new envoy trip to Russia – CNN",
    "article_text": "Plans are afoot in the White House to send US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff to Moscow, in a last attempt to get senior Russian officials on board with its vision for peace in the Ukraine conflict, CNN has claimed, citing an anonymous source. Witkoff has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin three times this year, as part of Trump's ongoing initiative to broker a ceasefire between Kiev and Moscow. The CNN source claimed that Washington’s plan, reportedly presented to Ukrainian and several European leaders during a top-level meeting in Paris on Thursday, envisages a ceasefire along the current front line. The US government also signaled a willingness to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, according to the source. Witkoff told Fox News on Monday that the his talks with Putin in Moscow were“compelling”and that the Kremlin is seeking a lasting solution to the Ukraine conflict. Moscow and Kiev“might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large,”he claimed. According to the US official, a potential peace deal would include the recognition of Crimea, the Donetsk, and Lugansk People’s Republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions as part of Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that while there were“no clear outlines of any agreement yet,”Moscow values the“constructive and substantive”contact with the US. Witkoff’s remarks did not sit well with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, who on Thursday accused Trump’s envoy of“wittingly or unwittingly spreading Russian narratives.” Kiev will“never recognize any temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian,”he said. Russia has maintained that it is open to peace talks with Ukraine in principle, as long as its key security concerns are addressed. Moscow demands among other things that Kiev renounce its NATO aspirations and recognize the territorial“realities on the ground.” The Kremlin has insisted it will not accept a mere freeze of the conflict. On Saturday, President Putin announced a temporary Easter truce effective from 18:00 Moscow time through midnight on Sunday night. While he expressed hope that Ukraine would reciprocate, he also stated that the“Kiev regime has violated the agreement on pausing energy infrastructure strikes more than a hundred times.” Putin argued that Ukraine’s reaction to the ceasefire would be a clear indicator of whether Kiev is serious about wanting to achieve peace.",
