    "article_text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., explains why he considers the nation's political system 'largely corrupt' and aims to fight 'authoritarianism' under President Donald Trump's administration on 'Special Report.' Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is making \"no apologies\" for chartering private jets to travel for his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour stops across the country. The Vermont lawmaker and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been gaining influence through their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, quickly becoming the face of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Organizers started the tour in response to PresidentDonald Trump'ssecond term to \"take on the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power and influence in this country.\" With multiple rallies a week, Sanders defended his mode of travel, telling \"Special Report\" executive editor Bret Baier in an exclusive interview Wednesday \"that's the only way to get around.\" \"You run a campaign, and you do three or four or five rallies in a week. [It is] the only way you can get around to talk to 30,000 people. You think I'm gonna be sitting on a waiting line at United…while 30, 000 people are waiting?\" Sanders said on\"Special Report.\" \"That's the only way to get around. No apologies for that. That's what campaign travel is about. We've done it in the past. We're gonna do it in future.\" JAMES CARVILLE SAYS DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP LETTING BERNIE SANDERS AND AOC DEFINE THE PARTY Sanders' campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, spent over $221,000 chartering private jets during the first quarter of 2025, according toFederal Election Commission (FEC) filingsreviewed by Fox News Digital. The filing, which was released last month, shows that Sanders dropped the massive haul between three private jet companies: Ventura Jets, Cirrus Aviation Services and N-Jet. Some of these flights included Sanders andOcasio-Cortez'schartered private jet worth up to a staggering $15,000 an hour for several West Coast stops on their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. AOC, SANDERS FALL FLAT WITH YOUNG VOTERS AS GEN Z REJECTS ‘WEIRD, RADICAL WING’: RNC YOUTH CHAIR While defending histravel choices,Sanders, an Independent with considerable influence in the Democratic Party, also offered his take on the considerable success of his country-wide campaign. Sanders claimed the crowds were a mix of Americans across the political spectrum who have \"concerns\" about the state of U.S. politics. He pointed to alleged concerns over a \"government of the billionaire class,\" \"movement toward authoritarianism\" andRepublican Partypolicies. \"I think at a time when the people on top are doing phenomenally well, when seniors, working-class people are struggling, people want to hear action to stand up to the people who have the wealth and the power and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top,\" Sanders concluded.

    "title": "More Maine schools ban transgender athletes from girls sports, defying Dem leadership and siding with Trump",
    "article_text": "Maine School Administrative District 70 Superintendent Tyler Putnam discusses how the Trump administration is suing Maine for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports on ‘Fox & Friends.’ AnotherMaine school districthas taken matters into its own hands in the state's dispute over transgender athletes in girls sports. On Tuesday, the board of directors for Maine's Region School Unit (RSU) No. 24 voted 7-1 to rescind a policy that allowstrans athletesto compete in girls sports. The rescinded policy, Policy JB, stated that \"students shall be able to participate in accordance with the gender identity asserted at school.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM RSU No. 24 Superintendent Michael Eastman confirmed to Fox News Digital that the district and its schools will stop following the policy immediately. \"At its meeting last night, after respectful deliberation, the RSU No. 24 Board of Directors voted 7-1 (one director was absent) to rescind Policy JB — Transgender and Gender-Expansive Students,\" Eastman said. \"This change will take place immediately. We appreciate the turnout last evening and thank those residents who addressed the board with their thoughts regarding the policy.\" MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER RSU No. 24 operates five public schools in Sullivan, Maine. Hancock county, where Sullivan is located, voted in favor ofDonald Trumpin November's election by a margin of 52.9% to 45.3%. Eastman's district is not the first to amend a gender eligibility policy in recent weeks. The MSAD No. 70 School Board voted unanimously in mid-April to comply withTitle IX, \"recognizing only two sexes — biological male and biological female — and that all private spaces be separated by biological sex.\" MSAD No. 70 Superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital that, due to this vote, he is now directed to amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls sports. \"The motion directs me to rewrite our policies to adhere to the motion,\" Putnam said. \"It is my interpretation that the school board will be looking to approve policies that align biological sex to their specific athletic teams too, i.e. biological males will be playing with only other biological males and the same for biological females. These policies will need to be approved by the policy committee and the board once rewritten.\" Maine is being sued by the Department of Justice for failing to come to an agreement to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. Maine has loosely allowed trans athletes to compete with girls since 2005, when the Maine Human Rights Act prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Maine Principals' Association (MPA) updated its policies in 2024 to explicitly allow transgender students to compete on teams matching their gender identity. The state, particularly its Democratic leadership led by Gov. Janet Mills, is doubling down to defy Trump and protect its trans athletes' rights to compete against girls and share girls locker rooms. Many residents, and now school districts, have taken steps to oppose Mills. There have been multiple protests across the state, including two at the state Capitol in August, by activists looking to protect girls from trans competitors. Attention to the issue was magnified this past week after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls track meet. A trans-identifying athlete who competed for North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Maine, at the Poland-NYA-Yarmouth-Seacoast meet, won the 1600-meter with a time of 5:57.27, blowing away the second-place runner who finished with a time of 6:16.32. In the 800-meter, the trans athlete had a closer first-place finish with a time of 2:43.31, just around a second better than the second-place finisher with a time of 2:44.87. In October 2023,Fox News Digital reportedthat this athlete was transgender. Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls sports tobiological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris watches the black smoke pour out of the Sistine Chapel as no pope is selected in the first round of votes on 'The Story.' Once a new pope is voted in, the name he chooses could signal the direction theCatholic Churchmoves in the coming years. The announcement \"Habemus Papa,\" or, \"We have a pope,\" will be made from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica. It will then be followed by the pontiff’s baptismal name in Latin, along with his chosen papal name and meaning. Should the pope choose to go with Pope Francis II, it could signify continuity with the late pontiff’s pastoral legacy, though Francis himself quipped that whoever succeeds him would be John XXIV, named after theVatican II-era pope. In the 20th century, the most popular name for popes was Pius, and if chosen, that could signal that a traditionalist is taking back the throne of St. Peter. THE POPE'S SALARY: HOW DOES THE PONTIFF GET PAID? Pope Francis, right, greets Pope Benedict XVI prior to the start of a meeting with elderly faithful in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sept. 28, 2014.(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia/File) \"In the deepest recesses of their mind, when they start the conclave, everyone will walk in there with a name in their head,\" Natalia Imperatori-Lee, chair of religious studies at Manhattan University, told The Associated Press. For the majority of the Church’s first 1,000 years, popes used their given names, though the first exception was Roman Mercurius in the 6th century, who was named for a pagan god and chose the name John II. Adopting a name became common practice during the 11th century, a period of German popes who chose the names of early bishops out of a \"desire to signify continuity,\" Rev. Roberto Regoli, a historian at Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University, told the wire service. CARDINALS GATHER IN ST. PETER'S BASILICA FOR FINAL MASS BEFORE CONCLAVE TO CHOSE NEW POPE President Ronald Reagan sits with Pope John Paul II in Vizcaya Mansion on Sept. 10, 1987.(Getty Images) It was not until the mid-20th century that new popes began to choose names signaling the direction of their papacy, Regoli added. \"Even now, as we are waiting for the new pope, the name with which he will present himself will help us to understand the horizon towards which he wants to proceed,\" Regoli said. Names like Urban and Innocent have not been used for centuries, and Imperatori-Lee said he did not think anyone would pick the latter, given the abuse and scandals that have rocked the church.

Pope Benedict XVI greets the crowd gathered in St Mark's Square in Venice while crossing the square in an electric cart on May 7, 2011.(Marco Secchi/Getty Images) \"I don’t think that would be the right choice,\" he said.

The AP saidFrancis signaled a papacyfocused on those who are often seen as outsiders, including the poor, prisoners and the LGBTQ+ community, while promoting peace, brotherhood and care for the environment.

John Paul chose his name, signaling a commitment to reforms, including the sidelining of the Latin Mass in favor of local languages and other faiths, most significantly Judaism. But it is still a new pope’s choice to choose a name never used before. \"This would open a new season and could mean that his program is not in line with any of his predecessors, so an even more personalized program,\" Regoli said. CLICK HERE TO GET TO THE FOX NEWS APP Imperatori-Lee suggested another name that might signal a continuation of Francis’ legacy: Ignatius, for the founder of Francis’ Jesuit order. \"It would be interesting,\" she said. \"We’ve never had one of those.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Seth Wolfe, whose son is under investigation, and Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler join 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the incident and the possible legal ramifications stemming from Title IX. A Virginiafather said on Wednesday that Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) officials launched an investigation into his son and two others for questioning why a biological female student was in the boys' locker room. According to a May 5 report by Northern Virginia news outletWJLA, the biological female student who identified as male recorded the three male students in the locker room talking about being uncomfortable about the transgender student being there. The transgender student then allegedly filed a complaint, which turned into a formal Title IX investigation for sexual harassment by LCPS. Seth Wolfe told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday that his son, a sophomore at Stone Bridge High School, was one of the three boys in the locker room that day and finds the whole situation confusing. \"This was a conversation that he was having among his peers. He wasn't even questioning the student or anything like that,\" Wolfe said. \"And then not being able to have those rights to even question that, and on top of that, being investigated, it's very confusing.\" DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROBING SOME VIRGINIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER GENDER IDENTITY POLICIES Loudoun County Public Schools is currently under investigation by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights over its gender identity policies.(Fox News Digital) The boys' lawyer, Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler, said, \"I want to make very clear: These boys did absolutely nothing wrong. All they did was ask, ‘Why is there a girl in our locker room?’ and they expressed concern. None of the boys ever spoke to this girl once, so there is no basis for this investigation.\" He said the school's gender policy violates state law and federal policy, citing President Donald Trump's executive orders on gender identity. \"That's a big problem for them, and we're going to have to address that,\" Hetzler told Fox & Friends. \"It's truly an insane situation where the ones who are the real victims are the ones being punished.\" Virginia Gov. Glenn YoungkinannouncedTuesday that he and Attorney General Jason Miyares were launching an investigation into the locker room incident after WJLA's report. \"It’s deeply concerning to read reports of yet another incident in Loudoun County schools where members of the opposite sex are violating the privacy of students in locker rooms. Even more alarming, the victims of this violation are the ones being investigated—this is beyond belief. I’ve asked Attorney General Miyares to investigate this situation immediately so that every student’s privacy, dignity and safety are upheld,\" the governor said.

Student privacy is a fundamental right protected by both policy and law, and LCPS is firmly committed to upholding that principle without exception. Our decision not to comment on the matter should not be taken as license for any news organization to determine what the facts are without verification,\" it continued. LCPS said they could not discuss details of the matter to protect students' privacy, but said it was \"deeply disheartening to see\" Virginia officials publicly criticizing the school \"solely\" based off the WJLA report. Seth Wolfe and Founding Freedoms Law Center attorney Josh Hetzler spoke to 'Fox & Friends' about a Title IX investigation.(Fox News) \"We reject any characterization that implies our schools are unsafe or that we fail to protect the rights of all students.

Eight days after the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner tested positive again in an out-of-competition sample. According to the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s initial findings, Sinner explained that he tested positive after receiving a massage from a trainer who had used an over-the-counter spray that contained clostebol to treat a small wound after cutting his own finger. While WADA accepted the no-fault explanation, the organization said the three-month suspension was necessary as \"an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage’s negligence.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "'New sheriff in town': State finance leader rallies around key Trump victory saving 'taxpayer dollars'",
    "article_text": "OJ Oleka, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, spoke to Fox News Digital about what his group is doing to end DEI PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government has returned financial power to the people, OJ Oleka, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, told Fox News Digital. Oleka said there's a \"new sheriff in town\" and that Trump is \"making good\" on his promise to eliminate DEI by shifting financial policies \"away from the left and back to the center,\" empowering state financial officers and building trust with the American people. \"We know that when companies focus on business, their business does better. If their business does better, shareholders make more money, their employees have a better quality of life within their business and their consumers get a better product,\" Oleka told Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida. Oleka said focusing on financial returns and merit-basedincentives over DEIor environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies creates \"more money for shareholders, better culture in the office for employees and better products for consumers and customers,\" exactly what state financial officers have been asking for. WHITE HOUSE VOWS TO IMPLEMENT 'SYSTEM OF MERIT' IN US, DISMANTLE DEI 'STRANGULATION' Fox News Digital spoke to State Financial Officers Foundation CEO OJ Oleka in Orlando, Fla.(Getty/Fox Digital) \"The American people want every individual to succeed,\" Oleka said. \"They want people to succeed on their merit, on their ability, on their skill. It's very important to us as Americans. But what they don't want is for people to get preferences just because of some political ideology.\" He said there are misconceptions about DEI \"because people hear diversity, equity and inclusion, and they think, ‘Well, those are good things. I support diversity. I want people to be included, and people should have the resources that they need.’ \"To be very clear, when we're talking about DEI, we're saying that DEI is trying to provide racial or gender preferences for people based on past grievances. It effectively has nothing to do with merit or looking at somebody's skill for a job or for an opportunity.\" MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT Equal opportunity is giving people access to create their own opportunities, to try to be as successful as they can be with their skills, ability and merit, according to Oleka. Oleka explained that DEI is subjective because it prefers \"folks based on what you think is important, based on your own politics.\" \"It's bad to say, from a company's perspective, 'Let's just hire people based on race, based on gender,' as opposed to skill and ability,\" Oleka said. \"It's bad because it can harm the performance of what that company actually does with their business responsibilities. That matters to our financial officers because they invest in a lot of these companies. It's their job as fiduciary leaders to make sure that the pensions that they invest, the public funds that they invest by virtue of their positions, are actually done so by companies and with funds where the returns are going to be high. OJ Oleka, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, spoke with Fox News Digital at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida.(Fox News Digital) \"We can't guarantee that the returns are going to be as high as they can be if the companies aren't even focusing on their specific mandate, on their responsibility. Instead, they're focusing on their politics and trying to force an ideology or social agenda through their businesses. That's not what business is for.\" Oleka said his experience as someone with a Ph.D. in higher education who is also the son of Nigerian immigrants informs his rejection of political ideology or agendas in government-funded programs, including in public education, because these policies don't improve students' learning experience or academic performance. \"That doesn't actually contribute to kids' learning,\" Oleka said. \"It doesn't contribute to human flourishing. There really is no reason why people's taxpayer dollars should be spent on that.\" President Donald Trump speaks during an event on energy production in the East Room of the White House April 8, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Oleka told Fox News Digital the Orlando conference was critical to reminding state financial officers across the country they are not alone in pushing back against DEI and ESG policies that were promoted by former PresidentJoe Biden'sadministration. \"It goes back to what I think most Americans believe. Their state government is closer to them than the federal government,\" he said. \"As a result, state leaders should have more power, as it relates to their finances, than the federal government, and what a state leader should do with that power is give it back to the people.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By empowering state financial officers to focus on financial returns and fiduciary duty instead of ideology and politics, Oleka said more Americans are incentivized financially. \"It's important that we have that same kind of leadership in the White House at the state level, making good on their promise to bring a Golden Age to America and to each state,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris and The Catholic Project executive director Stephen White join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss as the cardinals prepare to choose a new leader for the Catholic Church. The leader of theRoman Catholic Churchdoes not get paid what many consider a traditional salary. Instead, the Vatican provides for the pontiff's needs, from housing, food, transportation and other expenses in the form of stipends and allowances. The Vatican,referred to as \"the world's smallest country,\" is sustained by \"an economy that relies on a combination of donations, private enterprises, and investments to generate revenue,\"according to Investopedia. Pope Francis declined any sort of salary when he took office in 2013,The Economic Times reportedback in February, adding that the pontiff at the time had a net worth of \"around $16 million, which includes various assets provided to him as the pope.\" The Vatican's financial situation has been in peril for years, with its annual operating deficit growing to over $90 million in 2023, according to reports. In November, Pope Francis warned that the Vatican's pension fund — which provides pensions to employees of the Holy See and Vatican City State — has been facing a \"severe prospective imbalance\" that \"tends to grow over time in the absence of interventions,\" according to theVatican News.

It generates this money through various avenues. According to the Michigan Journal of Economics, the Holy See generates some of its revenue through Peter’s Pence, which is a term thatdescribesdonationscollected from Catholics around the world and given to the Pope on an annual basis.

    "title": "Antisemitism spiking around the world, ADL task force finds in its 1st-ever global report",
    "article_text": "ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and ADL Senior VP of Counter-Extremism and Intelligence Oren Segal spoke with Fox News Digital about the organization's bombshell report. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has released its first-ever J7 Annual Report on Antisemitism as the world prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day. The report details therise in antisemitismseen in countries that have the largest Jewish populations outside Israel, including the U.S., the U.K., Argentina, Canada, France, Germany and Australia. The J7 Task Force was founded in July 2023, just months before Hamas launched its deadly attacks on Israel. In the wake of the massacre, the ADL has noted an uptick in antisemitic incidents and sentiments around the world. Anti-Israel demonstrators deface property on the day of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on July 24, 2024.(Katie Pavlich) ANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS BREAK RECORD FOR 4TH STRAIGHT YEAR, ADL FINDS From 2021 to 2023, antisemitic incidents increased by 11% in Australia, 23% in Argentina, 75% in Germany, 82% in the U.K., 83% in Canada, 185% in France and 227% in the U.S., according to the ADL’s report. Additionally, the organization noted a \"troubling\" pattern in antisemitic incidents per Jewish capita in the J7 countries, including more than 38 incidents per 1,000 Jewish residents in Germany in 2023. Additionally, in Australia, incidents per Jewish capita quadrupled from 2023 to 2024. The J7 Task Force report reveals common themes across all nations, such as increases in violent attacks, spikes in antisemitic rhetoric online and growing feelings of fear and insecurity among Jews. In the report, the rising antisemitism in each of the J7 countries was documented by the Jewish communities directly impacted. The Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas (DAIA) found that antisemitism had become deeply embedded in social media and academic institutions. Argentinian Jewish students are reportedly choosing schools \"based on whether or not they will be a target of antisemitic incidents, both from their fellow students and from their professors,\" according to DAIA. The organization recommends more \"work and engagement\" in combatting antisemitism in academia. In 2023, Argentina saw a 44% increase in antisemitic incidents compared to 2022. Like many other countries included in the report, the country saw a rise in antisemitism and anti-Zionism following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks. Additionally, DAIA noted that Argentinian President Javier Milei’s strong support of Israel and the U.S. has led to \"an increase in antisemitic and other conspiratorial rhetoric.\" DAIA also found some bright spots in Argentina, noting that 60% of Argentinians, especially those aged 25-34, have a favorable view of Israel and just 7% favor boycotting Israeli products and businesses. This could be because Argentina has felt the impact of a terrorist organization that has also attacked Israel. Hezbollah carried out two deadly bombing attacks in Buenos Aires, one in 1992 at the Israeli Embassy and another in 1994 at the AMIA-DAIA Jewish Center. \"Free Palestine\" graffiti is seen on a fence praising the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre against Israelis.(Executive Council of Australian Jewry ) AUSTRALIA'S JEWISH COMMUNITY ALARMED BY RISING ANTISEMITISM The Executive Council of Australian Jewry’s (ECAJ) report, which covers Oct. 1, 2023-Sept. 30, 2024, showed a sizable 316% increase in antisemitic incidents. In the 12-month period the ECAJ studied, it found 2,062 antisemitic incidents compared to 495 incidents in the previous year. In the decade prior, the number of antisemitic incidents each year ranged from 190 to 495. ECAJ cited Dr. Adina Bankier-Karp and Dr. David Graham’s survey, \"Australian Jews in the Shadow of War,\" which found that 64% of Australian Jews felt that antisemitism was \"very much\" a big problem in the country. This, according to the report, is 10 times higher than the response in 2017. The Australian federal government in 2024, as well as many state governments, banned hate symbols such as swastikas and the Nazi salute. Symbols of terrorist organizations were also banned. However, ECAJ said it does not believe these laws do enough to combat \"post-Oct. 7 sources of antisemitism.\" \"While these laws are welcomed, they are not addressing the post-October 7 sources of antisemitism in Australia which makes up the majority of incidents, nor will the laws counter anti-Jewish attitudes and incidents,\" ECAJ wrote in the report. The report on Canada was compiled by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA). The organization said Canada’s main challenges include increased threats of violence and \"anti- Israel actions taken by the federal government that display a double standard towards the Jewish state, such as the imposition of an arms embargo.\" While the data for 2024 is not yet available, CIJA noted that the 2023 statistics show \"disturbing trends.\" While Jews make up just 1% of the country’s population, 19% of reported hate crimes were motivated by antisemitism. Additionally, hate crimes against Jews increased by 71% from 2022 to 2023, according to CIJA. In the report, CIJA called out the Canadian government’s \"inaction\" on antisemitism. The organization called for action and legal reform to help fight rising antisemitism. Nearly all Canadian Jews, 98%, said antisemitism is a \"serious or somewhat serious problem,\" according to CIJA. Additionally, 82% said \"Canada has become less safe for Jews\" since Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre.

According to CRIF, more than 30% of antisemitic incidents in 2024 included references to \"Palestine.\" French schools also saw antisemitic incidents more than quadruple, reaching 1,670 in the 2023-2024 academic year, compared to 400 the year before. CRIF found that antisemitic incidents became more violent in 2024. These incidents included the rape and assault of a 12-year-old Jewish girl because of her \"bad words on Palestine\" and the arson and antisemitic graffiti at the Rouen synagogue. The organization said it welcomed the French government’s adoption of a national plan to fight racism, antisemitism and discrimination. The plan was adopted in 2023 and is set to be implemented through 2026. CRIF said in its report that many French Jews have stopped displaying or speaking about their religious identity out of fear. Even children steer clear of the topic to avoid harassment in school. GLOBAL RISE IN ANTISEMITISM LEAVES JEWISH COMMUNITY ISOLATED, RABBI SAYS WORLD AT 'A TIPPING POINT' Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (ZJD) sounded the alarm over rising antisemitism, pointing out that \"October 7, 2023, has massively accelerated a development that was already looming.\" Antisemitism in Germany is not unique to one side of the political aisle, though ZJD points out the rise ofAlternative für Deutschland(AfD) \"poses a major challenge.\" AfD holds multiple positions that, if turned into reality, would make life extremely difficult for observant German Jews, including the banning of religious slaughter of animals, which could effectively make kosher meat illegal. German police found 3,200 crimes from Jan. 1, 2024, to Oct. 7, 2024, were motivated by antisemitism. This comes after the Office on Research and Information on Antisemitism in Hessen found 3,000 antisemitic incidents between Oct. 7, 2023, and the end of that same year. A January 2025 study by the Claims Conference found that approximately 40% of 18- to 29-year-olds in Germany did not know that more than 6,000,000 Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. However, the ADL’s 2024 Global 100 survey shows Holocaust distortion and denial is lower in Germany compared to other Western European nations. ZJD concluded that ongoing debates in Germany surrounding social issues have direct impacts on the Jewish community. Antisemitic hate on display at an anti-Israel protest in London. Antisemitism in the U.K. is hitting record levels since the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7.(Campaign Against Antisemitism on X) The Board of Deputies of British Jews (the Board) said in its section of the report that antisemitism has dropped since Q4 2023 but still remains above pre-Oct. 7 levels. Meanwhile, British Jews are \"finding everyday life in the U.K. an increasing challenge\" with 25% ofBritish Jewsfeeling unsafe in the country. The Community Security Trust’s 2024 Antisemitic Incidents Report showed 3,528 antisemitic incidents in the U.K., representing an 18% decrease from the 4,296 incidents reported in 2023. \"Posters of Israeli hostages are regularly torn down, and in major cities the UK has faced weekly hate marches calling for Israel’s destruction,\" the Board wrote. It also stated that the Institute of Jewish Policy Research called this phenomenon \"ambient antisemitism.\" The Board acknowledged the government’s actions to fight antisemitism but said that statistics showed that further action was needed. \"Enhanced law enforcement, stricter regulations on online hate speech, and comprehensive educational programs are essential to effectively combat antisemitic attitudes and behaviors,\" the Board wrote. Overall, the Board believes the U.K.’s three main areas of focus should be addressing antisemitic incidents, fighting online hate speech and restoring a sense of security among British Jews. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The ADL and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations worked together to compile a report on rising antisemitism in the U.S., noting the \"alarming rise\" in antisemitic incidents and attitudes. In its 2024 antisemitism audit, which was released last month, the ADL identified 9,354 antisemitic incidents in 2024, a 5% increase from 2023 and a staggering 926% increase since it began tracking in 1979. \"Let’s be clear, antisemitism is an irrational hatred of individuals or institutions just because they are Jewish,\"ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatttold Fox News Digital upon the release of the audit. He also noted that \"ADL has been conducting an annual audit of antisemitic incidents since the 1970s. And we've simply never seen numbers like this.\" The ADL and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations found that \"the groundswell of antisemitism in the United States shows no signs of abating.\" In the report, both organizations said that the polarized political environment makes it hard to predict how antisemitism will develop.

    "title": "Family of American hostage tortured in Lebanon wins landmark case against Iran",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. After a nearly four-year search for justice, a U.S. court has found in favor of the family ofa Lebanese American man held hostage in Lebanon,finding that the Islamic Republic of Iran, working through its proxy Hezbollah, should be held liable for their father’s kidnap and torture. Two of Amer Fakhoury’s daughters, Guila and Zoya Fakhoury, told Fox News Digital that on May 1, aU.S. District Courtjudge found Iran responsible for Fakhoury’s imprisonment. \"This is the first lawsuit to prove Iran’s influence over Lebanon,\" Guila said. \"We were very happy about the judgment.\" ‘HOSTAGE IN LEBANON:’ NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILY RECOUNTS FATHER’S DETAINMENT, TORTURE IN NEW BOOK During President Trump's first term, his administration helped secure the release of New Hampshire businessman Amer Fakhoury.(Fakhoury Family) Amer Fakhoury was arrested a week after traveling to Lebanon with his family in September 2019. After his arrest, a newspaper linked with Hezbollah alleged that Fakhoury, formerly a member of the South Lebanon Army,had been the \"butcher\" of Khiam, a detention center where grave human rights abuses were reported to have taken place. Though he was released from a military prison in December 2019, it was only after the Lebanese Supreme Court dropped charges against Fakhoury in March 2020 that he was able to return to the U.S. By the time of his return, Fakhoury had lost 60 pounds and was suffering from late-stage lymphoma, along with rib fractures and other health complications. He died in September 2020 at the age of 57. Proving Fakhoury’s suffering and torture was a battle for the family, though Guila said the State Department’s classification of her father as a hostage was instrumental in proving the nature of Fakhoury’s captivity. SENS. CRUZ, SHAHEEN PROPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST LEBANESE OFFIICALS OVER AMERICAN PRISONER Provingthat Iran was behind the imprisonmentwas more difficult. In fact, while Guila said some people \"kind of laughed\" that the family blamed Iran for their father’s mistreatment, Zoya said \"Iran’s influence in Lebanon in recent years further proves our point.\" Because Iran never responded to the suit, Guila said the family was forced to provide evidence her father witnessed of Hezbollah’s control over \"every government agency in Lebanon,\" including the military hospital, military court, and the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security, the country’s intelligence apparatus that Guila said arrested and tortured Fakhoury.

Zoya says Hezbollah officials in Lebanon have been issuing threats to the family since Fakhoury’s death.

Long periods of silence from the court also made the wait for justice difficult, Zoya said. \"The last four years, we were fearful,\" she explained. \"We were worried maybe nothing’s going to come out of this.\" While the family is grateful for the judgment they received, Guila says they believe the settlement awarded through the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was \"a bit of an unfair decision\" and did not \"take into account the pain and the suffering of the family.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Amer Fakhoury and his family during Christmas 2018.

(Credit: APTN) Pakistan is calling airstrikes launched byIndiaan \"act of war\" Wednesday, with its military claiming it shot down five Indian fighter jets in retaliation. The strikes targeted at least nine sites \"whereterrorist attacksagainst India have been planned,\" India’s Defense Ministry said. Pakistan's military said the missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country’s eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people, including women and children. \"Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,\" Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared. Tensions have soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an April attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, in the India-controlled portion of Kashmir. India accuses its neighbor of being behind that attack, which was claimed by a militant group calling itself Kashmir Resistance that India says is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a disbanded Pakistani militant group.

Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif, Pakistan’s military spokesperson, said the country’s air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation.

    "title": "REAL ID mishaps minimal, airports report; expert warns there’s potential chaos to come",
    "article_text": "Fox News Digital speaks with politicians on Capitol Hill about how their constituents are preparing for the REAL ID deadline on May 7. (Nicholas Ballasy) As airports across the country are reporting relatively few issues on the first day ofREAL IDenforcement, at least one aviation expert and former pilot tells Fox News Digital he doesn’t expect that kind of peace to last. \"From an airport operations perspective, neither [George W. Bush Intercontinental] or [Houston-Hobby] have responded to any issues,\" a representative for Houston’s airports authority said Wednesday. The official added that Texas law enforcement began issuing REAL IDs nine years ago and that the Lone Star State is well covered with 90% of its population listed as havinga REAL ID. On the other side of the country, an official with the Port Authority, which operates JFK, La Guardia and Newark-Liberty in the New York City area, said there were \"no issues\" at the latter. IDENTITY OF SECOND DEPORTED MAN WHO JUDGE WANTS RETURNED TO US REVEALED AS TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS ORDER Passengers line up for the security checkpoint at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on May 7, 2025, the first day when REAL ID is required for Americans to board flights.(Robin Rayne for Fox News Digital) A Fox News producer reporting from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey was able to go through security with an escort to get lunch without issue. Officials at Newark Liberty were giving a slip of paper to passengers not yet REAL ID compliant as part of phase 1 of the rollout. Moving down the Jersey Turnpike to Philadelphia, an official said they are having a \"smooth REAL ID Day.\" \"Checkpoint lines have been flowing all day and the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) has had staff on hand to answer questions and process passengers,\" the official said. \"PHL (Philadelphia International Airport) also had its customer care team pre-security to greet passengers and answer or direct questions. We saw most passengers ready with passports orthe REAL IDstate-issued identification as they approached the checkpoints.\" At the other end of I-95, Miami International Airport reported normal traffic at checkpoints and underlined that over the past year, the hub has partnered with the TSA to communicate with passengers, including terminal-wide signage, about the REAL ID deadline and alternate forms of identification. REAL ID RENEWS AMERICA'S AGE-OLD DREAD OF THE DMV TSA agents check airline passengers for REAL IDs or passports at the security checkpoint at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on May 7, 2025.(Robin Rayne for Fox News Digital) At Charlotte-Douglas in North Carolina, wait times averaged 10 minutes throughout the day, and an official said its staff had been \"well-prepared\" for the adjustment. At the busiest airport in the U.S., an official said everything was running smoothly. \"I was just downstairs (near the checkpoint). We did not see any adverse impact,\" said Herschel Grangent Jr. of Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. Boston-Logan officials echoed that assessment, adding they also utilized the same advertising strategy as Miami for its REAL ID deadline preparation. \"At Logan, our customer service team will have extra staff on hand during the rollout to greet passengers and remind them to have their IDs out before they get into the TSA line,\" an official said. However, former commercial and private pilot Ryan Tseko told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday interview that any lull won’t last for long. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The amount of delays it's going to put on the system is massive,\" said Tseko, who formerly worked for United Express and is now a vice president at Cardone Capital. \"I don’t think the public was aware. I think it wasn’t clear,\" he said, adding he expects a bottleneck at airports. \"A lot of these people are students who now have to drive up to 12 hours back and forth.\" He predicted that when issues begin appearing, there will be calls to delay full implementation once again, as has been the norm since the Bush era.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley weighs in on New York Attorney General Letitia James suing the Trump administration over funding cuts to the Health and Human Services Department on 'America Reports.' Language in a new budget bill up for a vote later Wednesday evening could put New York taxpayers on the hook for state Attorney General Letitia James' legal fees in a fraud case being brought against her by the Trump administration. Democratic New YorkGov. Kathy Hochulissued her proposed $254 billion budget last week, and the state legislature is set to begin voting on it as soon as Wednesday. Part of what state legislators will be voting on includes the state operations section of the budget. That section, according to a draft copy provided to Fox News Digital by the stateRepublican Party,includes draft language which – if approved – would compel taxpayers to provide the money for a legal defense fund that, while James is not named in the bill, would theoretically cover the New York attorney general's legal costs pertaining to fraud allegations brought against her by the Trump administration's Federal Housing Finance Agency. TRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES LEADING CHARGE ON NEW MULTISTATE LAWSUIT OVER HHS CUTS President Donald Trump and Letitia James(AP/Getty) The draft language, compiled by theDemocrat-controlledexecutive branch, Senate majority and Assembly majority, would set aside $10 million for elected officials in the state to use for their legal defense when the case is in direct response to the official's exercise of their duties. James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, who was obtained for her by the New York State Attorney General's Office, characterized the Trump administration's mortgage fraud claims against James as \"political retribution\" for her decision to go afterDonald Trumpover allegations he falsified business documents to obtain favorable business positions. NY AG'S OFFICE HIRES ATTORNEY THAT REPPED HUNTER BIDEN TO DEFEND LETITIA JAMES AGAINST FRAUD ACCUSATIONS The New York Attorney General's Office hired high-powered political attorney Abbe Lowell to represent Letitia James against accusations of fraud.(AP/Reuters/Fox News) According to the draft language of the New York operations budget bill, a state official would be permitted to use money from the legal defense fund if the official has previously had interactions with the U.S. government or a U.S. government official in the course of their official duties. There are additional criteria which would also apply to James, particularly when considering her former case brought against Trump that led to thefirst ever felony conviction of a U.S. president. The sources who provided the operations budget draft language said it should be made publicly available some time Wednesday. ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST LETITIA JAMES CALLS FOR NY STATE COURTS TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP ADMIN FRAUD CLAIMS \"Donald Trump promised a vicious revenge tour when he ran in 2024, and he’s put Attorney General James at the top of his list, and we’re ready to respond to these attacks,\" a spokesperson for James told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Protesters gathered outside Illinois governor JB Pritzker's mansion on Wednesday thinking that Department of Homeland SecuritySecretary Kristi Noemwas holding a presser around the property. Secretary Noem did hold a press conference in Illinois on Wednesday, but it was more than half a mile away from the governor’s mansion, leaving the protesters \"screaming\" into the wind. \"While we aren’t entirely sure what the protesters were protesting (we aren’t sure they know either), or why they were screaming in front of their governor’s mansion, we stand with every victim of illegal immigrant crime,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital.

Pritzker's home in Springfield, Illinois.(AP/Getty) \"Secretary Noem went to Springfield, Illinois to join Angel families to call for the end of dangerous sanctuary city policies under J.B. Pritzker and bring attention to an at-large illegal alien murderer who has been evading justice for two years for the stabbing of Emma Shafer.\" As protesters shouted outside Pritzker’s mansion, Noem’s presser was held at the site where Emma Shafer, 24, was stabbed to death by Grabriel Calixto Pichardo, 25, anillegal migrantwho is wanted on three first-degree murder charges and an aggravated domestic battery charge. Pichardo was reportedly dating Shafer at the time of the murder. Noem was also joined by the \"Angel families\" of Denny McCann and Jimmy Walden, who both lost their lives to illegal migrant crime.

Yet, they are taking no real action to promote public safety and deport violent criminals within the clear and defined legal process.\" \"Illinoisans are sending a clear message to Trump’s lackeys that we will not let you mess with us without a resistance,\" Pritzker concluded. The governor's office alleged that Secretary Noem changed her schedule to dodge protesters. Matt Hill, Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement that \"despite being in Illinois today and falsely accusing the state of not following the law, Secretary Noem and her team does not communicate with the State of Illinois about enforcing immigration laws.\" \"As the Governor’s office oversees the Governor’s Mansion, we know the Secretary originally planned her publicity stunt at the Governor’s home but decided to relocate,\" Hill said. \"We would have hoped she wouldn’t be scared to speak with Illinoisans exercising their Constitutional rights but are not surprised given her lack of ability to follow the Constitution.\" Pritzker's office also sent a statement from Cathy Schwartz and John Shafer, Emma Shafer's parents, to Fox News Digital which addressed Noem holding the presser at the site their daughter was killed. \"To see her used by Secretary Noem and others to advance a cruel and heartless political agenda is not just deeply painful to us – it is an insult to her memory. Noem’s words are in direct conflict with who Emma was as a person,\" the parents' statement via the governor's office read. \"No parent should have to experience the loss of a child. But every time her name is brought into these conversations – conversations she would have wanted nothing to do with – we have to relive the pain of her death.\" Schwartz and Shafer were unavailable to speak with Fox News Digital at the time of publication.

    "title": "Boasberg grills DOJ over remarks from Trump and Noem, floats moving migrants to Gitmo in action-packed hearing",
    "article_text": "Former Acting ICE Director Jonathan Fahey discusses a federal judge halting deportations of suspected Venezuelan gang members on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' U.S. District Judge James Boasberg pressed Justice Department lawyers Wednesday evening over public comments PresidentDonald Trumpand other Cabinet officials made about deportation proceedings under the Alien Enemies Act and floated the idea of moving some migrants to Guantánamo Bay. During the hearing, Boasberg specifically pressed Justice Department lawyers about statements made by Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem about CECOT, the maximum-security prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has deported hundreds of migrants, and the White House’s ability to secure someone’s release. He asked specifically about Trump's remarks in an interview with ABC News, in which Trump toldABC Newshe \"could\" secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran and alleged gang member, back to the U.S. from El Salvador if he chose to. \"Is the president not telling the truth?\" Boasberg asked Justice Department lawyer Abhishek Kambli. \"Or could he secure his release?\" WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? The question goes to the heart of whether El Salvador has custody of the deported migrants, a major question at the heart of the case. Another key part of the hearing focused on the lawfulness of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation used by Trump to quickly deport migrants from the U.S. to the Salvadoran prison. Boasberg asserted that the Supreme Court had not, in fact, upheld Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants, quoting from the high court's ruling before noting to Justice Department lawyers that the Supreme Court \"did not decide one way or another\" on the validity of Trump's proclamation. Boasberg floated the idea of moving the migrants detained at CECOT to the U.S. Guantánamo Bay detention center, where the government could then ascertain if they are members of Tren de Aragua, the violent Venezuelan gang the Trump administration said prompted its use of the Alien Enemies Act. He also grilled Kambli over Noem's comment that CECOT is \"one of the tools in our toolkit\" the U.S. \"can use\" against individuals who commit crimes against the American people, and comments from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt that the U.S. has provided $6 million to El Salvador to house migrants at the CECOT prison. In response, Kambli said these remarks sometimes \"lack nuance\" and described the payments to El Salvador as \"grants.\" U.S. District Judge James Boasberg and President Donald Trump(Getty Images) The fast-paced hearing was marked by sharp lines of questioning from Boasberg, both over the claims made by Trump officials and whether the early wave of migrants deported to CECOT received any due process or prior notice before they were deported to El Salvador. Boasberg asked Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer arguing for the plaintiffs, if they had any representations on whether the first class of migrants deported to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act had prior notice or received any due process protections. Gelernt reiterated that the first group of migrants deported received no prior notice, telling the court the individuals had received declarations from the government as they were being loaded onto buses on the way to the airport from which they would be sent to the Salvadoran prison. TRUMP ADMIN SEEKS EMERGENCY RELIEF OF BOASBERG CONTEMPT THREAT Gelernt also noted that the notices handed to migrants said \"NO REVIEW IS AVAILABLE\" in English at the top. That phrase has since been removed from the declarations but has not been replaced with any details on eligibility for review or habeas relief. \"They got some notice,\" Kambli told Boasberg, notring he was not sure of the \"precise contours of that.\" \"If it wasn't even 12 hours, you're not going to say that they got due process,\" Boasberg fired back. Boasberg ended the hearing by telling both parties he planned to issue an order Thursday explaining next steps and giving the government until Friday to file any further declarations. From there, plaintiffs will have until Monday to review discovery, including requests for additional information. Judge James E. Boasberg at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C.(Carolyn Van Houten/Washington Post via Getty) Trump officials have sought to portray Boasberg, a high-profile judge in D.C., as the face of judicial overreach, and today's hearing could put him back in their crosshairs. Unlike the previous lawsuit heard by Boasberg in March, which sought to temporarily block Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport certain U.S. migrants, the plaintiffs are asking the court to hear a larger request for more lasting relief. The preliminary injunction was filed as a class and seeks to protect two classes of migrants — detainees already removed from the U.S. to the infamous Salvadoran prison and those still detained on U.S. soil at risk of imminent removal. The plaintiffs are seeking broader and more lasting relief for two groups of individuals at risk of what they argue is \"grave and irreparable harm\" under the Alien Enemies Act. For U.S. detainees who could be removed under the law, plaintiffs asked for an order blocking their removal under the AEA and requiring the Trump administration to provide them at least 30 days notice before any planned removals, notice they said would be sufficient to allow them to challenge their removals in U.S. court. Migrants who were already deportedto CECOT could face a trickier path to relief.

This could include requiring the administration to request any contractors or agents in El Salvador to transfer the individuals from CECOT and into the \"physical custody\" of the U.S., they said. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will take any steps to comply with the order should Boasberg move to grant the injunctive relief plaintiffs are seeking. If their responses are any indication, compliance in the near term seems unlikely. 4 MORE DEMS TRAVEL TO EL SALVADOR TO PUSH FOR ABREGO GARCIA'S RETURN TO US Alleged gang members in El Salvador after being deported from the U.S. March 31, 2025.(El Salvador Press Presidency Office/Anadolu via Getty) The hearing comes as the Trump administration has grown increasingly defiant in the face of court orders to returnmigrants from CECOTback to the U.S., including two migrants erroneously deported to the maximum security prison in March and ordered back to the U.S. by two separate federal judges. The administration has refused to return them. So far, the Trump administration has not said whether it has returned any migrants deported from the U.S. to CECOT under the law. And the identities of these individuals can be difficult to track. To date, the Trump administration has not released a list of the names of individuals it has deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act‚ and the Salvadoran government has also shielded their identities from public disclosure. The administration's growing resistance on the issue has sparked fresh concern from Trump critics and some court observers who have cited fears the administration could be testing boundaries on executive branch authorities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The plaintiffs also cited fears of harm to the migrants. They said in their filing that, absent injunctive relief, the Trump administration \"will be free to send hundreds more individuals to the notorious Salvadoran prison, where they may be held incommunicado for the rest of their lives.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "article_text": "El Cajon, California Mayor Bill Wells joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss U.S. homelessness hitting record highs. More than 4 million youth and young-adult families facehomelessness,statistics show, prompting rare bipartisan action in Congress to expand federal support and address the growing crisis. Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., and Katie Britt, R-Ala., will introduce the Homeless Children & Youth Act on Wednesday, which is the former’s first piece of major bipartisan legislation in her short tenure since being sworn-in in January. Officials must ensure that children experiencing homelessness can get the support they need to exit that situation for good, Alsobrooks told Fox News Digital. \"This legislation will begin to close the barrier to services for many young families and is a true action to one of my guiding principles: 'love your neighbor as yourself.' No person deserves toexperience homelessness,and HCYA is an important step in ending homelessness in our communities and breaking generational cycles,\" she said. NEW LAW CLAMPS DOWN ON HOMELESS AS BLUE CITY ADVOCATE ADMITS THE 'FRUSTRATION' IS JUSTIFIED An Oakland, California, homeless encampment.(Getty Images) Britt added, \"No child should be prevented from receiving the critical assistance they need,\" and that the bill will \"streamline\" the definition of homelessness across all federal agencies. The bill seeks to betterdefine homelessnessin a federal context in order to provide fuller resources. In that current code, in some areas of government, it excludes counting youths who stay with people other than their parents or live in motel rooms as experiencing homelessness, while other federal programs consider them so. It would also \"improve visibility and understanding\" of the issue, as proponents said youth are often overlooked as a bloc of people that can face homelessness. By standardizing the definition of youth homelessness, and also opening up more federal resources to affected people, the bill will help communities break the cycle, proponents said. TRUMP SAYS DC MAYOR BOWSER MUST CLEAN UP HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IN THE CAPITAL Sen. Angela Alsobrooks.(WaPo via Getty) Youth homelessness has been an issue in the Washington, D.C., area, where Alsobrooks led a collar county for several years prior to defeating former Gov. Larry Hogan for her current seat. During her time as Prince George's County executive, the county established the Youth Action Board, which aims to directly address the crisis from a young person’s perspective. In 2024, Alsobrooks credited the Department of Housing and Urban Development for an additional $2 million grant to assist organizations in Prince George's that combatyouth homelessness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Katie Britt speaks at a podium.(Getty Images) In nearby Frederick County, north of the nation’s capital, one homeless assistance group praised the legislation. \"Programs like ours could serve these youth immediately upon experiencing homelessness,\" Melissa Muntz of Student Homelessness Initiative Partnership of Frederick told Fox News Digital. \"Shortening a young person's period of homelessness by providing immediate support increases the likelihood that the youth will remain connected to school,\" Muntz said. \"We know that youth who do not graduate from high school are significantly more likely to experience homelessness as adults, making this an early intervention to prevent adult homelessness.\" At least 15 other homelessness advocacy groups have also endorsed the act, according to its sponsors.

FIRST ON FOX:Undercover phone calls released today by pro-life activist group Live Action reveal thatPlanned Parenthoodclinics across several states offer cross-sex hormonal treatments to minors as young as 16 with very little parental or medical supervision. The group is now calling on Congress to defund Planned Parenthood of hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding. Live Action conducted an undercover investigation in which a woman posing as a 16-year-old minor called dozens of Planned Parenthood locations seeking\"gender-affirming care.\"At least seven facilities told her they would prescribe cross-sex hormones at the first appointment. In several instances, Planned Parenthood assured the caller that she could choose to meet with a provider virtually and have access tocross-sex hormonesas quickly as the same day, despite the person posing as a minor saying they had just begun considering changing her sex. Facilities in Minnesota and Oregon stated they could schedule the minor within days or on the same day. Five facilities stated that no prior therapy, mental health clearance or prior documentation was needed for her to obtain cross-sex hormones. ‘GENDER-AFFIRMING’ TREATMENTS DON’T BENEFIT YOUTH, SAYS PEDIATRICIANS GROUP: ‘IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES’ Undercover phone calls released today by anti-abortion group Live Action reveal that Planned Parenthood businesses across several states offer cross-sex hormonal treatments to minors as young as 16 with very little parental or medical supervision. Shown here is Live Action President Lila Rose.(Getty Images) In addition to being the country’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood is also one of the leading distributors of sex-change drugs. Cross-sex hormonal treatments, such as taking either testosterone or estrogen, are meant to alter the body to exhibit characteristics to conform with a person’s \"gender identity.\" Besides altering the natural makeup and functions of the body, cross-sex hormonal treatments can result in several harmful side effects, including permanent infertility. Live Action PresidentLila Rosetold Fox News Digital that the investigation exposes \"a chilling reality\" that \"Planned Parenthood is fast-tracking vulnerable children into irreversible hormone treatments with almost no medical oversight.\" \"These dangerous drugscan sterilize, stunt growth and leave lifelong scars. This is not healthcare. It is child abuse, and it must be stopped,\" she said.

That is a catastrophe, and it must end,\" said Rose. \"It’s time for Congress and the president to act and defund this abusive corporation of the $700 million they receive from taxpayers every year.\" This comes shortly after Fox News Digital reported that House Republicans arediscussing measuresthat could potentially end federal funding of groups like Planned Parenthood as cost savings in their multitrillion-dollar bill advancing PresidentDonald Trump's agenda.

Thom Tillis said he will not support the president's nominee to serve as U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., Ed Martin. \"It's disappointing because, you know, I know that he's very talented,\" Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon while taking questions from the media during a swearing-in ceremony for the U.S. ambassador to China, David Perdue. \"Crime is down in Washington, D.C.

Brad Knott, R-N.C., and House Republicans are introducing a bill to increase the penalties for crimes committed by illegal aliens to deter the ‘worst of the worst’ from entering the country. FIRST ON FOX:House Republicans introduced a bill Wednesday, the Punishing Illegal Immigrant Felons Act, which would dramatically increase penalties forcriminal activity by illegal immigrants, something the bill’s sponsors believe can help deliver a death blow to organized crime by illegals in the U.S. Rep. Brad Knott, R-N.C., said the bill already has robust support in the House and that key members of the Trump administration have been very \"supportive.\" This comes as the Trump administration has moved quickly to lock down the border and begin arresting the \"worst of the worst\" illegal aliens present in the country. The Trump administration has promised to be\"ruthlessly aggressive\"in cracking down on illegal criminal groups endangering Americans. However, Knott, who introduced the bill Wednesday, told Fox News Digital that, from his experience as a prosecutor, he believes Congress must act quickly to secure the permanent changes needed to deter many of the hardened criminals who have madeorganized crimein the U.S. \"big business.\" NOEM CALLS FOR THE DEATH PENALTY FOLLOWING MARITIME HUMAN SMUGGLING ATTEMPT THAT LEFT CHILD DEAD Rep.

Yet they come back exclusivelyto commit crime, whether that is human trafficking, whether it's drug trafficking, whether it's money laundering, you name it.\" Knott said, up until now, there has been an \"incentive\" for criminals, including members of migrant gangs like MS-13 andTren de Aragua, to come to the U.S. \"because they are able to enrich themselves with very low risk of extreme cost.\" \"Two years is no deterrent,\" he said. \"I prosecuted cartel members, and if they got a 24-month sentence, a two-year sentence, it would not interrupt their criminal operation at all.\" During his time as a federal prosecutor, Knott said, instances of illegal felons returning to commit more crimes after being deported were \"too many to remember.\" BLUE CITY MAYOR SAYS ICE ARRESTS OF DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ARE NOT ‘FOCUSED ON MAKING US SAFER’ Alleged MS-13 gang members(Reuters) \"I talked to someone who was deported more than ten times … and I asked him, ‘Why do you keep coming back to the United States?’ And he was very candid with me.

He could enrich himself while poisoning the children that he would sell drugs to. \"This bill in large part closes that gap in the law,\" he explained. \"It categorizes illegal aliens who commit crimes in a wholly different category.\" If passed and signed into law, Knott’s bill would increase the punishment for any crime committed by an illegal alien that is punishable by more than one year from a maximum of two years to a minimum of five years.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on ground delays at Newark Liberty International Airport due to air traffic controller staffing shortages as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy looks to combat the shortage. The chairman of the House's Aviation Safety Caucus is accusing the former Biden administration of helping fuel the currentair traffic control(ATC) crisis, by its choice to fund progressive diversity initiatives instead of modernizing the aging system. Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital that the former administration's marquee bill, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, was among several \"missed opportunities\" to fund a revamp of the ATC system. \"That was before I came to Congress, but, you know, you had just mistaken priorities in that, all this DEI policy, DEI staffing, that all got baked into the cake,\" Langworthy said. \"They could have taken that money and spent it on real modernization of what is critical infrastructure in this country.\" \"We had the longest period of incident-free aviation in this country's history, where we didn't have a commercial air crash from the time the crash happened in Buffalo, in my district, back in 2009, to just this year, and what happened at [Ronald Reagan Airport].

Langworthy clarified that he does not believe DEI policies \"necessarily\" directly hit ATC. \"It's what they spent the money [on].

It's transportation. It should have been spent then. Instead, they did all this social engineering with money and didn't focus on what has been a glaring problem for the federal government for many years — modernizing our aviation infrastructure.\" Part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill allocated $25 billion over five years to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), specifically for modernization. But lawmakers now believe that was not enough. Republicans' plans for PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill\" via the budget reconciliation process include $12 billion for air traffic control modernization, specifically. During visits withair traffic controllersin his own upstate New York district, Langworthy said the message was simple but critical: \"We need more bodies.\" \"We should be promoting this to young people that want to look at career service in the government. And it comes with a very competitive salary,\" Langworthy said. \"But it's a tough job with a lot of hours. And you know, there's always gonna be stress involved, but we have to prioritize it and not just take it for granted.\" Langworthy vowed to work with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, pictured, on getting funding for ATC modernization.(Getty Images) Langworthy said he would help push for as much funding as needed to meet the issue.

    "article_text": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy discusses a temporary radar outage at Newark Liberty International Airport and the U.S. Army pausing helicopter flights near Reagan National Airport on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Many of the same Democrats slamming the Trump administration for several ongoing transportation issues were silent as theBiden administrationoversaw an understaffed, outdated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that resulted in dangerous travel conditions across the country. Democrats like House Minority LeaderHakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have accused the Trump administration of \"breaking the federal government\" and having \"decimated the FAA.\" Jeffries blamed the Trump administration for a spate of cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport this week. However, a month-over-month comparison of air accidents under the Biden administration and the first few months of theTrump administrationshows a significantly lower number of accidents in March and April. Throughout former President Joe Biden’s four years in office, there were an average of 115 air accidents in April. Under Trump, there were just 67 air accidents in the month of April. A report issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in March shows that the Trump administration inherited an outdated system from Biden with \"severe shortcomings.\" DUFFY BLASTS BIDEN, BUTTIGIEG FOR IGNORING REPORT ABOUT FAILING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM: 'DID NOTHING!' Several significant issues at the FAA date back to the Biden administration.(Getty) After Trump’s return to theWhite House, GAO advised the administration that it had made nine recommendations to the FAA under the Biden administration that remain open, and that \"urgent attention\" is needed to remedy the safety issues left by Biden. GAO said that under the Biden administration the FAA \"did not prioritize or establish near-term plans to modernize unsustainable and critical systems.\" Other government reports revealed that the Biden FAA was further hindered by severe staffing issues. A June 2023 report by the Office of the Inspector General of theTransportation Departmentrevealed that the FAA \"made limited efforts to ensure adequate controller staffing at critical air traffic control facilities.\" AMERICANS DESERVE TO HAVE A 'STATE-OF-THE-ART' AIR TRAVEL SYSTEM: SEAN DUFFY Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy during an executive order signing in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 14.(Getty Images) The report said that \"as a result, FAA continues to face staffing challenges and lacks a plan to address them, which in turn poses a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations.\" The office said it had determined that 20 of 26 (77%) critical facilities were staffed below the FAA’s 85% threshold. Even major facilities like the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control and the Miami Tower were staffed well below the threshold at just 54% and 66%, respectively. Another report by the office released later that year said the FAA’s \"lengthy hiring process andCOVID-19restrictions\" slowed the agency’s onboarding and training activities, resulting in few new hires having completed their training and obtained certification. The issues had real-world consequences.Politico reportedthat during January and February 2023, \"commercial jets experienced close calls with other aircraft at a faster pace than they had during all of the previous five years combined.\" On Jan. 11, 2023, the FAA had to issue a nationwide ground stop due to a system outage of the aging air traffic control system. The pause was described as the first of its kind since 9/11. The GAO’s 2025 report said the 2023 national airspace prompted an operational risk assessment, which found that of the 138 air traffic control systems, \"51 (37%) were deemed unsustainable by FAA and 54 (39%) were potentially unsustainable.\" TRUMP TO REQUIRE TRUCK DRIVERS TO SPEAK ENGLISH, PASS LITERACY TESTS AS 'COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS' MOUNT Passengers walk past a flight status board at Orlando International Airport on Jan. 11, 2023, after the FAA grounded all U.S. flights earlier in the day.(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) In 2024, theGAO foundthat nearly 40% of FAA control systems were still severely antiquated, requiring \"urgent updates.\" \"This is not a new problem,\" Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"We’ve known this problem has existed. There have been multiple GAO reports over the last four years saying you have real problems with Air Traffic Control and you should do something with it before it actually fails. The last Administration spent $1.2 trillion. The largest infrastructure package known to man. Joe Biden signed this at this White House, and how much was spent to rebuild Air Traffic Control? $5 billion. And of the $5 billion that was given, only $1 billion was actually spent. \"The Biden Administration had made no investments in the system that we now see having issues in Newark. On top of that, they were focused on things like renaming racists roads and changing cockpit to flight deck. This Administration has come in and started looking at the Air Traffic Control system after the DCA crash. Very quickly I saw one piece of the pie where there were issues and then scratched further and there is another piece of the pie.

The letter said ActBlue delivered a \"lackluster response\" to queries on the matter. As recently as August 2024, however, the site had required CVV numbers for donations on pages observed by Fox News Digital, including former Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign.

    "title": "'Body clock' could determine biological age and longevity, researchers say",
    "article_text": "Dan Buettner, an American author, explorer and longevity researcher who first coined the term 'blue zone,' embarked on a mission to find out how people are living to 100 in certain parts of the world. Researchers have developed a new \"body clock\" tool that calculates people’sbiological age— and could even predict the risk of disability or death. The tool, which comes from the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine, uses eight different metrics from a patient’s physical exam and bloodwork to determine the results, according to a press release from UW. The tool’s method — officially named the Health Octo Tool — is detailed in the journal Nature Communication in a May 5 publication. SECRETS OF LONGEVITY FROM THE WORLD'S 'BLUE ZONES' The researchers see this method as more comprehensive than currenthealth assessments, which typically focus on individual diseases rather than overall wellness, according to the report’s first author, Dr. Shabnam Salimi, a physician-scientist and acting instructor in the Department of Anesthesiology & Pain Medicine at UW. Researchers have developed a new \"body clock\" tool that calculates people’s biological age — and could even predict the risk of disability or death.(iStock) Using data from large longevity studies, the Health Octo Tool was found to predict disability, geriatric syndrome (a group of common health conditions in older adults), Short Physical Performance Battery (a clinical tool that assesses lower extremity function in older adults) and mortality with 90% accuracy or greater, the study reported. \"An aging-based framework offers a new path to discover biomarkers and therapeutics that target organ-specific or whole-body aging, rather than individual diseases,\" Salimi said in the release. HEALTHY EATING IN MIDDLE AGE HAS THIS KEY LONGEVITY BENEFIT The tool focuses on \"health entropy,\" which encompasses the amount of molecular and cellular damage the body has sustained over time. That has a direct impact on the function of a person’s organs and overall body systems, which can be used to determine how fast they are aging, the researchers noted. \"Aging is a truly analog and non-digital process.\" The tool starts by assigning a \"body organ disease number,\" ranging from 1 to 14, based on whether the patient has experienced any diseases affecting the heart, lungs, brain or other specificorgan systems. \"Our findings demonstrated that organ systems age at different rates, prompting us to develop a Bodily System-Specific Age metric to reflect the aging rate of each organ system and the Bodily-Specific Clock to represent each organ system’s intrinsic biological age,\" Salimi said. LIFE EXPECTANCY IN HUMANS NOT LIKELY TO INCREASE MUCH MORE, STUDY SUGGESTS \"Extending this concept to the whole body, we define the Body Clock as a composite measure of overall intrinsic age and body age as the corresponding rate of aging.\" Two of the components of the tool, Speed-Body Clock and Speed-Body Age, measure how biological age affectswalking speed. \"An aging-based framework offers a new path to discover biomarkers and therapeutics that target organ-specific or whole-body aging, rather than individual diseases,\" said the lead researcher.(iStock) The Disability-Body Clock and Disability-Body Age components measure aging’s impact oncognitive functionand physical disability, the release stated. One takeaway from the research was that some seemingly minor conditions, such as untreated hypertension early in life, could have a significant impact on aging in later years, according to Salimi. This indicates that treating these conditions sooner could slow down biological aging. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Looking ahead, the researchers plan to develop a digital app that people can use to track their own biological age, track how fast they are aging, and measure the impact oflifestyle changes. \"Whether someone is adopting a new diet, exercise routine or taking longevity-targeting drugs, they will be able to visualize how their body — and each organ system — is responding,\" said Salimi. \"Aging is not a linear or wholly quantifiable process — it is influenced by myriad known and unknown genetic, molecular, environmental and psychosocial factors,\" one doctor said.(iStock) Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon who also runs a longevity practice, was not involved in the tool’s development, but commented on its potential benefits and limitations. \"This tool distinguishes itself by basing its model on readily accessible physical exam findings and standard lab tests, offering a potentially practical framework for clinical application,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"An app is also being developed to empower patients and potentially encourage the development ofhealth habitsthat will positively impact their healthspan — or how long they will remain functional and disease-free.\" RETIREMENT COULD BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH, SAYS WELLNESS EXPERT: 'POWERED BY PURPOSE' The doctor also praised the Octo Tool’s focus on system-based aging metrics rather than disease-specific assessments. Osborn noted, however, that there are limitations to these types of proposedbiological agingclocks — primarily that they can’t counter the \"inherent complexity of aging.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Aging is not a linear or wholly quantifiable process — it is influenced by myriad known and unknown genetic, molecular, environmental and psychosocial factors,\" the doctor said. \"It is a truly ‘analog’ and ‘non–digital’ process. Therefore, it should be no surprise that no model has captured its entire landscape.\" The most important thing, according to one expert, is to use comprehensive testing and tracking as a springboard to the formation of lifelong health habits.(iStock) UW’s tool doesn’t take into account certaingenetic and DNA processesthat influence biological aging, Osborn noted. \"Aging clocks have also often fallen short when applied across diverse populations or when predicting individual outcomes (lifespan),\" he added. \"If it saves one person’s life by bringing their ailing health to their attention, that’s a win.\" Rather than determining absolute biological age, Osborn suggests using these tools to track trends over time. \"For example, tools like the Health Octo can help evaluate an individual’s response to interventions — be it a newexercise regimen, medication or lifestyle change.\" The most important thing, according to Osborn, is to use comprehensive testing and tracking as a springboard to the formation of lifelong health habits. For more Health articles, visit foxnews.com/health \"If it saves one person’s life by bringing their ailing health (manifested as a downward trend) to their attention, that’s a win,\" he said.

At the one-week and one-month follow-ups, the patients reported \"clinically significant improvements\" not only in mood and cognition, but also motor function. \"Many people don’t realize this, but mood symptoms in Parkinson’s are linked to a faster physical decline.\" \"These results are really encouraging,\" Bradley told Fox News Digital. \"Depression and anxiety, which debilitate so many people with Parkinson's, improved significantly — and those improvements lasted for at least three months after patients took the drug.\" Amir Inamdar, a pharmaceutical physician in the U.K. and chief medical officer at Cybin, noted that the improvement in motor symptoms was somewhat surprising. \"As the authors note, this could be because of the modulation of dopamine via psilocybin’s effect on several serotonin receptor types.\" (Inamdar was not involved in the study.) The most common side effects of psilocybin were anxiety, nausea, headache andelevated blood pressure, but none were serious enough to require medical care, according to the researchers. People with the neurological movement disorder often suffer from \"debilitating mood dysfunction\" and don’t tend to respond well to traditional antidepressants.(iStock) \"Despite the reports of challenging experiences in a couple of participants, psilocybin seemed to be well-tolerated,\" Inamdar noted. \"The side effects were consistent with what has been seen in other studies, with no precipitation/ exacerbation ofpsychotic symptoms.\" The study, which was published in Neuropsychopharmacology, a Nature publication, was funded by an anonymous donor. This was the first study to measure the effects of a psychedelic substance on patients with a neurodegenerative disease, according to USCF. While this study was an \"important first step,\" Bradley noted that the researchers can't draw conclusions from it, as it was a small pilot without a control group. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We've now started a much larger trial designed to rigorously test if psilocybin is effective in Parkison’s,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"We're also collecting multimodal biological data to understand how psilocybin works. That's critical not just for optimizing psilocybin treatments, but also for guiding development of next-generation psychedelics that are in the pipeline now and could be promising for people with Parkinson’s.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Bradley still recommends that Parkinson’s patients approach psilocybin andother psychedelicswith \"a lot of caution.\" \"I wouldn't recommend to my patients with Parkinson’s that they start using psilocybin,\" she clarified. \"We're very, very early in this research, and we don't think these drugs will be safe for everyone with the illness.\" This was the first study to measure the effects of a psychedelic substance on patients with a neurodegenerative disease, according to USCF.(iStock) \"I hope that people continue toadvocate for researchso we can speed this process of identifying the right psychedelic treatment for the right patient at the right time.\" Inamadar agreed that while the results are encouraging, the study was based on a small and limited sample. For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health \"The study was also open-label, which lends itself to higher expectancy effects, though the improvements in mood andanxiety symptomswere still seen at three months,\" he added. \"Overall, [the] quite encouraging results warrant further investigation, certainly in trying to understand the mechanism behind improvement in motor symptoms.\" Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

    "title": "DeSantis signs bill banning fluoride additives in Florida public water: 'Hydrate, not medicate'",
    "article_text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday he is signing legislation into law to ban fluoride in the Sunshine State's drinking water. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissigned SB 700 into law Tuesday, eliminating the ability of local governments to add fluoride or other medical additives to the state’s public water supply, a move cheered by supporters of medical freedom and health transparency. \"Jamming fluoride in the water supply …  is essentially a forced medication,\" DeSantis said during a news conference in Tallahassee. \"At the end of the day, we should all agree that people deserve informed consent.\" The new law, part of the broaderFlorida Farm Bill, does not ban fluoride entirely. Floridians will still be able to purchase fluoridated water from private suppliers. But it draws a firm line against the government deciding what goes in your glass without your say. UTAH BANS FLUORIDE FROM PUBLIC DRINKING WATER, ALIGNING WITH MAHA MOVEMENT Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a news conference April 10, 2025, in Miami, Fla.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \"When it gets hot in the Sunshine State, no one clamors for a cold glass of fluoride,\" state Sen. Keith Truenow told Fox News Digital. \"We will protect our natural resources and give Floridians the ability to make the best choices without government forcing unnecessary additives.\" Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, who joined DeSantis at the signing, emphasized that this isn’t about denying people fluoride, but ensuring they aren’t medicated without consent. FLUORIDE EXPOSURE LINKED TO ‘DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS’ ON HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN, INFANTS \"Today, Florida took a bold step and declared that drinking water will hydrate, not medicate,\" Simpson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"No Floridian should be medicated without their consent, plain and simple. Through our Florida Farm Bill, we’re saying loud and clear: Florida’s water will be clean, it will be safe and it will be medication-free. That’s what freedom looks like in the Free State of Florida.\" The effort aligns with the national \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. His initiative emphasizes consumer choice, reduced reliance on centralized health mandates and a renewed skepticism of top-down medical policies. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a news conference April 10, 2025, in Miami, Fla.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \"Today’s efforts to prohibit local governments from unilaterally adding fluoride to public drinking water is the logical next iteration of our commitment to being the Free State of Florida,\" said Bryan Griffin, communications director for DeSantis. \"And Ron DeSantis has delivered yet again.\" DeSantis also tied the move to a growing public distrust of medical institutions, citing the fallout fromCOVID-era policies. \"People are just much more skeptical when these elites are trying to jam anything down our throats,\" he said. \"The burden is on them to prove why this should be forced on people. And it really shouldn’t be.\" The legislation also includes broad support for Florida’s agriculture sector, new consumer transparency laws and restrictions on environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices that target farmers and ranchers. DeSantis has also promised action on geoengineering. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"Florida is not a testing ground for geoengineering,\" DeSantis wrote on X Tuesday. \"The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics of SB 700 argue fluoridation has long been used to fight tooth decay, particularly in children. But DeSantis pointed to updated guidance from State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who raised concerns about fluoride’s effects on pregnant women and children. \"You don’t even have to agree with that analysis,\" the governor said, \"but people should still have the right to opt out.\" Kennedy did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Subcommittee onDelivering on Government Efficiency(DOGE) Chairwoman Marjorie Taylor Greene got into screaming matches and a gavel-smashing marathon at Wednesday's hearing on protecting women's sports. The hearingon \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports\" featured a signature rant by Rep. Nancy Mace, R-SC, and Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Cal, suggest that protecting women's sports will lead to bringing back racial segregation. Mace ensured the hearing ended with a boom when she got into a heated back-and-forth with witness Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Mace hit Goss Graves with one of the oldest tricks in the book when she bluntly asked the witness \"what is a woman?\" at the start of her rant. The question was met with incoherent rambling by Goss Graves about various categories of females based on how a person identifies. Mace kept cutting Goss Graves off while the witness was trying to respond, before Mace began dishing insults that included \"you sound like a lunatic,\" and repeated references of male genitalia. The two women then proceeded to loudly speak over each other for more than two straight minutes. Mace ended her first rant by calling Goss Graves and USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt, who was subpoenaed to the hearing after his organization punished a women for refusing to face a trans fencer, \"shameful.\" \"You all are shameful,\" Mace said. \"You're groomers.\" Mace was ultimately granted extra time, as Greene interjected to prevent Goss Graves from interrupting Mace. Mace used her time to ask Lehfeldt to apologize to the women's fencer his organization punished, Stephanie Turner, who was there to testify. Mace suggested Lehfeldt was \"not\" a man in response. \"Real men protect women, you're not one,\" Mace said. A similar shouting match played out earlier in the hearing between Greene and Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-NM., After Stansbury used her speaking time to emphasize a desire to protect the trans  community, Greene reminded Stansbury that her time was up. But Stansbury continued speaking anyway. WOMEN'S SWIMMERS SPEAK OUT AFTER UNKNOWINGLY FACING TRANS COMPETITOR, FILING COMPLAINT: 'I FEEL BETRAYED' U.S. Rep.

But Stansbury kept going on and on with an extension of her monologue on prioritizing trans rights. \"To the trans community, we stand with you!\" Stansbury said. Greene slammed her gavel down over and over, for nearly 40 consecutive seconds. \"This hearing will come order!\" Greene shouted over and over until Stansbury finally yielded, and let the next speaker go. Meanwhile, Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett made attempts to speak ahead of her turn during the first 55 minutes. When Crocket finally did go, she delivered a boisterous rant, rallying against the Trump administration for policies unrelated to women's sports. Then she made light of the topic by turning her monologue into a game with  Goss Graves. Crockett called the game \"Trump or Trans, and it was just her asking Goss Graves whether to blame President Trump or trans people in a series of unsubstantiated claims, that included \"increasing the price of everything\" and \"ignoring the constitution.\" Goss Graves responded \"Trump\" all 12 times. After a brief intermission, Simon took her time to speak and made the suggestion that women's athlete's protection laws would bring back \"racial segregation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP U.S. Rep.

But how he celebrated may result in a fine from the league – and he’s perfectly fine if it happens, too.

In the league’s eyes, though, fines have been dished out for those replicating it in the past.

Chicago, entering Tuesday night at 10-28, held a rare lead heading into the bottom of the ninth against theKansas City Royals. The Royals, a postseason team last year, got the leadoff man on, but Drew Waters hit a pop-up to second base to put the Sox at ease - until they were not.

Then, in the most obvious bunt situation, the White Sox could not even make a play at any base. Everybody was safe, and the bases were loaded with no outs, instead of a man on first with two outs. Kyle Isbel then popped out, which should have been the end of the inning. Instead, that was the first out. Then came Jonathan India, the leadoff batter, who hit a hard grounder to short. While it would have been tough to turn a double play, shortstop Jacob Amaya's toss to Meidroth at second was out of reach, bringing in a run, and again, everyone was safe (it was ruled an infield single).

While it fell onto the grass, it was more than enough to get the winning run in, even if Luis Robert Jr. made the catch on the run. The White Sox are now 10-29, which is a .256 winning percentage. They are now on pace to tie their own record from last year of 121 losses (against 41 wins). This is not their first head-scratching loss of the year.

Tom Brady talked about the advice he gaveShedeur Sandersas he slid in the NFL Draft to the fifth round before the Cleveland Browns finally selected him with the No. 144 pick. Brady was the No. 199 pick of the 2000 NFL Draft out of Michigan. TheNew England Patriotschose him. Drew Bledsoe was the team’s starting quarterback and Michael Bishop appeared in seven more games than Brady did in his rookie season. John Freisz also made an appearance in 2000. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the Cardinals game at State Farm Stadium on Dec. 25, 2022, in Glendale, Arizona.(Christian Petersen/Getty Images) When Brady received the chance to take the reins from an injured Bledsoe at the start of the 2001 season, he performed at an elite level. The rest was truly history. Brady appeared on the\"Impaulsive\" podcastwith Logan Paul and Mike Majlak. He was asked about Sanders’ draft slide. He said he wasn’t involved in Sanders’ evaluation process even as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. He critiqued the media’s narrative around the draft before he shared his words of wisdom to Sanders. \"So, nobody knows. I actually texted Shedeur because I know him very well,\" Brady said. \"And I said, ‘Dude, whatever happens, wherever you go, that’s your first day. Day 2 matters more than the draft. I was 199. So, who could speak on it better than me – what that really means. Use it as motivation. You’re gonna get your chances, go take advantage of it.’\" Sanders had an NIL deal with theBrady Brandwhen he was the quarterback at Jackson State. It helped start the relationship between the two athletes. Sanders then transferred to Colorado once his father, Deion Sanders, took over as head coach.

Rodgers was projected to be a No. 1 pick before the San Francisco 49ers took Alex Smith. \"I remember when they were talking about Aaron Rodgers sliding and Aaron slid to like 21 in the first round or whatever it was. I’m like, ‘Dude, you’re the 21st pick in the first round. I think they still think you’re pretty good. You’re still a great player. You’re still a first-round pick in the NFL. There’s only 32 of those guys every year.’ So, use it as motivation,\" he said. \"Wherever you end up going, it’s still about your performance. Like, what do you do when you get there, because you’re gonna get there.\" Brady mentioned that some of the greats he played with on the Patriots were not high draft picks or selected at all, including Rodney Harrison, Wes Welker, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola. He described the draft as \"some overhyped day, where a lot of people are selling stories and saying, all right, this is the big day, it’s the draft. And it’s an important day, it’s fun, and I love watching it and seeing it. But I’ve also been there on Day 2, where they actually gotta show up and learn a playbook, learn (to) be a part of a locker room.

Well, not advancing out of the group stage in theCopa Américalast year, a tournament that only includes countries in North and South America, on their own home soil will do that. \"It was a failure. You’re the only host country to not get out of the group stage in COPA America,\" Dempsey said bluntly. \"But they can get back on track.

(Source: LIVEATC.NET) Incredible air traffic control (ATC) audio captures the moment staff lost radar and radio signals while guiding planes toNewark Liberty International Airportin New Jersey last week. The April 28 outage lasted roughly 90 seconds. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association confirmed the incident to Fox News Digital, writing that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s operation in Philadelphia had \"temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them.\" The audio shows the initial moments of controllers learning of an outage at Philadelphia TRACON/ATCT. \"There is some equipment outages, so I don't know what exactly the equipment is, but they're having some frequency issues, and then the radar scopes are out, so they can't have anyone depart right now,\" one man is heard saying.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke with politicians on Capitol Hill about how their constituents are preparing for the REAL ID deadline on May 7. (Nicholas Ballasy) As of today, May 7, 2025, the long-awaited REAL ID requirement is officially in effect across the United States. After years of delays and mounting anticipation, travelers must now show aREAL ID-compliant driver's license, a valid passport or another federally approved form of identification to board domestic flights or enter certain federal facilities. The rush to comply has led to packed DMVs, long lines and plenty of confusion about what's actually required, especially among retired military members. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Fred from Oklahoma summed up the concerns many are feeling in a recent email to us. \"With the May 7th deadline for everyone to have a REAL ID approaching, it may be time to do a story on the possible impact onretired military. Back in April 2024, a story made many of us nervous or angry. Apparently there was some glitch in TSA software reading an 'indefinite' expiration date. Those of us over 65 have a retired ID that never expires. \"It was suggested that TSA's solution was to no longer accept our ID as an alternative form of REAL ID. It angers us because our ID allows access to military installations, but we're not allowed to fly? At any rate, there has been no follow-up article that either says the glitch was fixed or dismisses the TSA radical solution.... Maybe you can shed some light on this.\" Let's break down what's changed, answer Fred's question and walk you through exactly how to get a REAL ID if you still need one. REAL ID(DHS) The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 to strengthen security standards for state-issued IDs, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Starting today, anyone 18 or older must show aREAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID(look for a star in the upper corner), a valid passport or another TSA-approved form of identification to board domestic flights or access certain federal buildings. If you don't have one of these, you may be turned away at airport security, even if you've used your current ID for years. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? With all the new rules, it's easy to get confused about which ID is accepted at the airport. Here's what you need to know: If you have a New York Enhanced Driver's License (EDL), you may notice it does not have a star. Instead, it shows an American flag, and some newer EDLs may not say \"Enhanced\" on the front. New York EDLs are valid for domestic flights and border crossings. The flag is the official indicator of enhanced status in New York, even without a star or the word \"Enhanced.\" If you are concerned about TSA confusion, you can bring a passport as backup or show thisofficial NY DMV sample. With all the new rules, it's easy to get confused about which ID is accepted at the airport. Here's what you need to know: REAL ID(DHS) 5 GREAT TIPS FOR PLANNING YOUR NEXT TRAVEL GETAWAY Good news for Fred and other retired military members: Defense Department-issued IDs, including Common Access Cards, Uniformed Services ID cards and older retiree and family member cards, are still accepted by TSA for domesticairline travel. This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches. However, travelers have reported occasional issues at some airports, where TSA's system may misread the \"INDEF\" date as expired. In those cases, TSA officers may ask for another acceptable form of ID, such as a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or a passport. If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays. The bottom line is that military retiree and dependent ID cards remain valid for flying domestically as of today. If you have experienced problems in the past, it's wise to bring a backup form of ID if possible. HOW TO MINIMIZE YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT WHEN YOU TRAVEL If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport. However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID. This means you can use your Global Entry card at TSA checkpoints to verify your identity when flying within the United States. Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives. Important:Although the Global Entry card is officially accepted, some travelers have reported occasional confusion among TSA agents. To avoid delays, consider carrying an additional form of ID, such as a U.S. passport or passport card. By using your Global Entry card, you can bypass the need to visit the DMV for a REAL ID and still comply with TSA identification requirements for domestic air travel. REAL ID(DHS) 7 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT CARDS WHILE TRAVELING If you still need a REAL ID, here's how to get started. Even after the deadline, you can still apply and use your current license for driving and non-federal purposes. REAL ID details(DHS) GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Requirements vary by state, but you'll typically need: Pro tip:If your name has changed (due to marriage, divorce, etc.), bring legal proof (marriage certificate, divorce decree or court order). BEST PREPAID SIM & ESIM CARDS FOR TRAVELERS A valid U.S. passport or passport card is always accepted for domestic flights. If you have one, you do not need a REAL ID to fly, but you will need it for federal facilities that require a REAL ID for entry. If you're traveling soon, double-check your identification and give yourself plenty of time at the airport. For the latest updates and a full list of acceptable IDs, visit theTSA website. A man carrying his passport(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) TOP TRANSLATION APPS FOR TRAVELERS You can still get a REAL ID after May 7, but you won't be able to use your old license for air travel until you do. In the meantime, you'll need a valid passport or other approved ID to fly. HOW TO STAY CONNECTED NO MATTER WHERE YOU TRAVEL IN THE WORLD The REAL ID deadline has finally arrived, and it's understandable if you're feeling a little overwhelmed by all the changes. Whether you're a frequent flyer or just want to be ready for an unexpected trip, making sure you have the right ID is now more important than ever. If you're a retired military member, it's reassuring to know your military ID is still accepted, but bringing a backup is always a smart move just in case.

    "article_text": "Driverless semitrucks raise questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry. Aurora, a leader in autonomous vehicles, has officially deployed its driverless trucks onTexas roads, marking a key milestone in the evolution of transportation. This development raises important questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry. Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) Aurora's autonomous trucks now operate on routes between Dallas and Houston, hauling commercial loads. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! This isn't just a test program; it's a full deployment ofdriverless technology. Additional trucks will start operating on public roads in New Mexico and Arizona by the end of 2025, traveling at speeds ranging from 25 to 75 mph. Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Reportoutlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds. Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents. Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonlyused in aviationand nuclear industries. A third-party audit by TÜV SÜD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards. This audit also praised Aurora's safety culture and oversight practices. Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) THE FUTURE OF TRUCKING ROLLS FORWARD IN SHELL'S EXPERIMENTAL BIG RIG The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), representing over 150,000 truckers, strongly questions Aurora's safety claims. \"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states. \"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\" OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate. \"Exemptions from FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) safety rules weaken proven standards,\" OOIDA argues. The association wants mandatory crash and disengagement reporting and warns against removing trained drivers from the cab entirely. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union representing more than 1.2 million workers in North America, shares similar safety concerns. \"The Aurora Driver can't operate in severe weather like ice, unplowed snow or torrential rain,\" said Matt McQuaid, communications project manager for the Teamsters. He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued aSecond Amended Standing General Order 2021-01requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency. This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this. \"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said. That said, aDepartment of Transportation (DOT) studyfrom the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims bothhuman drivers and AVs are neededto meet demand. Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\" AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) John D. Esparza, president of the Texas Trucking Association, praised Aurora for its rigorous safety protocols, saying,\"Their attention to safety is evident. The pursuit of perfection is necessary.\" Jeff Farrah, CEO of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, emphasized the broader significance: \"Autonomous trucks are a triumph of American ingenuity and will ease supply chain issues.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Driverless big rig robotruck(Aurora) Aurora's deployment of autonomous trucks in Texas offers a glimpse into the future of transportation. The benefits of increased efficiency and the potential for safer roads are compelling. However, it's crucial to keep a close eye on how this technology develops.

Wearing a keffiyeh, he pressed a flier into my hand to attend a \"vigil\" in Cambridge advocating Palestinian resistance. I quietly turned around, put the flier in my office and headed off to class, where I spotted the same intifada-enthusiast seated among my students. I politely asked him to leave so I could start teaching about international security as I had at Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins and Northeastern for the last decade. The class only met once a week, and I was eager to commence my lesson plan. But the intruder refused to leave, cutting into class time. He told me that he’s a student at the university and needed to ensure that my course, in which he was not enrolled, aligned with his anti-Israel views. After about 15 minutes of unsuccessfully negotiating with him to leave, he started pacing around the classroom, giving a diatribe against Israel while encouraging the shocked students enrolled in the course to walk out of my class to attend the anti-Israel rally across town in Cambridge. THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS OF HAMAS' TERRORIST MASSACRE ON OCTOBER 7TH Anti-Israel protesters at Northeastern University.(Photo by Anibal Martel/Anadolu via Getty Images) I was not the only Jewish faculty member whom the anti-Israel activist targeted to restrict academic freedom at my school. Significantly, neither of us was teaching about anything related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; my module that day happened to be on the topic of right-wing extremism. No, my colleague and I weretargeted for being Jewish faculty. Both of us submitted separate formal complaints to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR). But OSCCR refused to appraise me about the outcome of my complaint. Later in the term, I discovered that my university clearly did not discipline the student enough because my phone blew up with alerts from friends that the activist was getting escorted out of the graduation ceremony by police for making a huge scene with fake blood to the horror of all the graduating students and their families. When I drive to school, I often give my mother a call. And she often asks me whether there’s any more madness on campus. What she means to ask is whether there are any more disruptions from extremist students on campus. But this is a common misperception about the hierarchy of problems Jewish faculty have faced in American higher education, which precedethe October 7 terrorist massacreand resultant \"global intifada\" on college campuses nationwide. SIGN UP FOR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTER Anti-Israel protesters in downtown Boston gather in support of the camp in Harvard Yard for the Israeli attack on Gaza, on April 25, 2024 at Northeastern University in Boston.(Photo by Anibal Martel/Anadolu via Getty Images) Such incidents are understandably highly salient in the news. The bigger problem for me, though, was not the intifada-supporting student's theatrics, but that the university administration did not get my back. The administration never checked in with me or my students after the class was taken hostage by an extremist; the university refused to supply any security to my classes even after being targeted; and the university failed to sufficiently address the known student extremist, leading to embarrassment when the spoiled graduation ceremony became a national news story. This is how universities across the country have dealt with the campus intifadas against Jewish students and faculty — by doing next to nothing.

Ever since, there’s been a palpable sense that antisemitism and associated extremism will be punished if not from the universities, then by the government. Since his re-election, there have been no intifada-intruders in my classroom. And I know that if there are, they will be handled more seriously by the administration. And for the first time in my decade at Northeastern as a professor, my substantial service to Jewish students as the faculty advisor to Chabad and Hillel have been properly counted in the annual merit reviews for salary and promotion. These positive changes, I believe, are due to the Trump effect.

    "title": "California's green new scam could cost you $20,000",
    "article_text": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins 'America's Newsroom’ to discuss oil giant BP’s decision to lower their spending on green energy initiatives. California has long fancied itself a beacon of environmental progress, a state willing to lead the charge incombating global warming. But the reality is that this pursuit of a \"green\" future is coming at astaggering costto California consumers and businesses, a cost that's becoming increasingly unsustainable. A recent study by the Pacific Research Institute reveals the truly alarming scale of this financial burden, estimating that the green transition will cost Californians between $17,398 and $20,182 per family to fund the state's switch to alternative energy sources. BIDEN GREEN ENERGY PROJECT HALTED BY TRUMP ADMIN RELIGED ON RUSHED, BAD SCIENCE, STUDY FINDS Altogether, California'sgreen transitionis projected to cost as much as $246.7 billion to build out solar panels, construct wind turbines and battery infrastructure while also shutting down nuclear plants and oil fields – a bill that will be paid by us all. These shocking figures should give every policymaker and resident pause. The state's aggressive mandates, such as the push for 100%zero-emission vehicles(ZEVs) by 2035, are a prime example of this misguided approach. While the goal of reducing emissions is commendable, Sacramento's top-down, one-size-fits-all approach ignores basic economic realities. These mandates artificially inflate the cost of transportation, placing a disproportionate burden on low- and middle-income families. And these mandates deny the reality that electric vehicles are often more expensive to purchase than their gasoline-powered counterparts. While proponents tout potential long-term savings on fuel, those savings are quickly eroded by rising electricity costs in California. Aside from higher costs, these mandates will also soon bring major energy shortfalls – the state will be 21.2% short of thepowerneeded to fuel the grid each day – when the state's 100% renewable energy and electric vehicle mandates are in effect. And this doesn't include huge looming power demands for artificial intelligence, or for green appliances and HVAC mandates on homes and businesses that will take effect in the coming years. But you don't need to be an economist to see the pain. California drivers are routinely paying some of the highest gasoline prices in the nation. These prices aren't solely driven by global market fluctuations; they're also a direct result of California's unique blend of environmental regulations, taxes, and fees. Gov. Newsom can point fingers at oil companies all he wants, but his policies play a significant role. And it's not just gasoline. Electricity rates in California are skyrocketing. A recent report from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office confirms what many Californians already know: we pay nearly double the national average for electricity. These costs are driven by a combination of factors, including wildfire mitigation expenses and the state's very \"ambitious\" greenhouse gas reduction programs. Businesses are also feeling the squeeze. The high cost of energy in California makes it more difficult for them to compete, discouraging investment and driving jobs out of the state. How can California businesses compete with those in states with far lower energy costs? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Despite these real consequences, Gov. Newsom and other policymakers seem intent on forging ahead on the same course. They tout the long-term benefits of a green economy, but they ignore the very real and immediate pain that their policies are inflicting on ordinary Californians. Families are struggling to pay their bills, small businesses are closing their doors, and the dream of homeownership is slipping further out of reach for many. It's time for a reality check. California needs a more balanced and pragmatic approach to energy policy. We need to acknowledge the limitations of current renewable energy technologies, address the skyrocketing costs of electricity, and stop pretending that we can simply wish our way to a carbon-free future by legislative fiat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Much as they wish, Sacramento politicians can't legislate innovation – but it should incentivize it and also embrace sensible reforms like expanding the use of low-emission and more affordable nuclear power and establishing a pro-emission reduction innovation environment. The state's current path is unsustainable. Unless we change course, California's green dream will become an economic nightmare for millions.

    "article_text": "'Fox News @ Night' panelists Aaron Cohen, Dr. Sheila Nazarian, Rabbi Chaim Mentz and Elizabeth Pipko discuss Israel's threat to Hamas and an antisemitic sign at a Barstool bar. Israeli and Turkish warplanes skirmished over Syria this past weekend. Israel, in northern Syria, has been bombing militias affiliated with the government of Turkey. According to Turkish media sources, Ankara’s F-16s sent \"warning messages\" to the Israeli planes. Israel denied the reports of the aerial confrontation. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, said that the \"Israeli attacks compromise the balance in the region since the fall of the Syrian regime.\" Bashar al-Assad fled Syria to Russia as his totalitarian government fell in early December. He has since been granted asylum there. IN WARNING TO TURKEY, ISRAEL HITS STRATEGIC TARGETS IN SYRIA AMID RISING TENSIONS The recent aerial confrontation could spark a wider war and put an end to attempts by the former militant andSyria’s current president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to reestablish stability and move his country closer to the United States. Disruptive actors want to take over Damascus. Erdogan, for instance, helped bring down Assad and now hopes to pull Syria into his orbit.China, which supported the horrific Assad regime until the end, is now trying to influence the new government in Damascus so it can eventually dominate that country. Security forces loyal to the interim Syrian government ride in the back of a vehicle in Syria's western city of Latakia on March 9, 2025.(Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Images) Sharaa is resisting Beijing’s attempts. \"Syria is now led by a true reformer,\" Jonathan Bass, who had extensive discussions with Sharaa in Damascus last week about religious freedom and other topics, told me. \"This is a critical moment in Syria’s transition,\" Dr. Sharvan Ibesh of the Bahar Organization, a humanitarian NGO active in Syria, told me last week. CHINA AND EGYPT WRAP FIRST JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE AS BEIJING LOOKS TO COZY UP TO AMERICAN ALLIES Ibesh’s assessment is certainly correct. Before Sharaa can achieve anything, he will need to end the conflict in his skies. There is only one person who can separate Israel, America’s long-term partner in the region, and Turkey, anincreasingly troublesome NATO ally. That person, of course, is PresidentDonald Trump. Why would Trump get involved? There are two principal reasons. First, Sharaa wants trade and investment. This is an historic opportunity for American business, which has been shut out of that portion of the region. Syria is devastated after decades of misrule and war, and Americans can build, sell, and provide just about everything. The second reason involvesChina. \"Syria is up for grabs,\" Mouaz Moustafa of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a humanitarian group active in that country, said to me. \"The Chinese continue to push hard to fill a vacuum, knowing that the longer the U.S. takes to come along the higher the chances are that China will economically occupy Syria.\" \"We do not want to be stuck with China being the only choice for Syria when it comes to rebuilding our liberated country,\" says the Bahar Organization’s Ibesh. CHINESE FIRM AIDING HOUTHI ATTACKS ON US VESSELS Dr. Haytham Albizem of Global Justice, a U.S.-based NGO, told me that President Sharaa has not accepted Beijing’s persistent offers but \"eventually he will shake the hand that wants to help him rebuild the country he leads if he does not have any alternative.\" Bass, CEO of Argent LNG, confirms that Beijing has pressured Syrian officials to take its money but the Syrians have held out because of concerns about the long-term effects of Chinese presence. Sharaa in fact told Bass he wants to build a \"pluralistic society,\" in other words, a nation not like China but like America. Washington’s sanctions, put in place during the Assad years, prevent American involvement. Trump can lift them. Trump will be inSaudi Arabianext week. He will visit Riyadh on May 13. Syrian officials are trying to schedule a meeting between the American president and Sharaa in the Saudi capital to discuss U.S. companies entering Syria. \"I want to make a deal withDonald Trump,\" Sharaa told Bass. \"He’s the only man I trust.\" \"He is the only man capable of fixing this region, bringing us together, one brick at a time,\" Sharaa added. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION \"This is a moment when the United States can, for the first time in decades, establish vibrant commercial and investment ties with Syria and thereby bring peace to theMiddle Eastas a whole,\" Bass says. If, however, China takes over Syria, which borders Israel in the Golan Heights, there will be no peace. Beijing fully backedIran’s October 7 assaulton the Jewish state with economic, diplomatic, propaganda, and weapons support. China will similarly disrupt the region from Syria if it gains control of Damascus. \"If China is entrenched in Syria, it means Iran will be entrenched there too,\" Bass says. \"The stakes are high for America because Israel would be pressured by a China-Iran proxy directly on one of its borders.\" That’s true, but America’s continued role in the region raises a broader issue. \"Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?\"Trump tweeted in December 2018.

    "title": "DEI is dead. Here's what should come next",
    "article_text": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trump's administration will bring an end to DEI \"strangulation.\" When President Lyndon Johnson’s later-Vice President Hubert Humphrey championed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he exclaimed, \"I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas.\" Following the meteoric rise of DEI over the past few years,Humphrey would need a new hat. Now, the DEI fad is rightly fading. The Supreme Court overturned affirmative action.Corporations jettisoned DEIupon realizing it improved neither workplace culture nor the bottom line. President Donald Trump eliminated DEI in government and is rooting out remaining discriminatory DEI practices in the private sector. But what’s truly remarkable isn’t DEI’s demise, butthe extraordinary uniformity of its adoption —uniformity that, once dismantled, will allow for a plurality of policies for hiring, promoting and retaining the right workforce, tailored to each companies’ individual goals. TRUMP'S CRACKDOWN ON HARVARD, 'WOKE' COLLEGES WILL TAKE MORE THAN 100 DAYS TO LEAVE LASTING REFORM: PROFESSOR Make no mistake, the DEI orthodoxy demanded faithful allegiance to a narrow set of rules. When 2,500 CEOs signed the identical \"CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion\" pledge, they committed their companies to identical practices like holding unconscious bias trainings and making \"progress\" on demographic metrics — regardless of how these policies might affect their specific businesses. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are dead. The big issue is what comes next.(Adobe Stock) LGBTQ+ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign established scoring systems that effectively required companies to offer employees identical transgender medical benefits packages to earn a coveted \"100% rating\" — practices that in any other context might raise antitrust concerns. This conformity defied business logic. No company would adopt identical marketing strategies or pricing models as their competitors — yet somehow, they embraced identical approaches to what’s arguably their most crucial asset: their employees. Chief Talent Officers and HR departments responsible for implementing, and now dismantling, DEI efforts should be leaders in what follows — a flourishing of new ideas and methods to identify and retain the best and brightest employees based on their skills and cultural fit. This ability to innovate should be welcome. The DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture. Corporate executives know engaged employees are the difference between top and bottom quartile performing companies. Yet 73% of publicly traded U.S. companies adopted increasingly rigid DEI commitments. Companies as diverse as SalesForce, Target, Coca-Cola and Bank of America implemented hiring quotas, exclusive race-based access programs, and/or implicit bias training under the DEI banner. No other department saw the mass adoption of the same ideology. There are thousands of methods for sales teams to increase revenue. ABC — Always Be Closing. SPIN Selling — Situation, Problem, Implication and Need-payoff. PLG - Product Led Growth, etc. Marketing departments also have endless ways to reach new customers. Three C’s – Company, Customer, Competitor. Four P’s – Product, Price, Place, Promotion. Five M’s – Mission, Money, Message, Media and Measurement. Financiers are always dreaming up new and exotic ways to value companies (remember WeWork’s \"Community Adjusted EBITDA\" metric?); in their eyes, GAAP is not a standard to be met, but a challenge to be overcome. Yet HR departments across the nation got stuck with the same-old DEI. Salesforce.com embraced hiring quotas only to drop them later. FILE: Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce.com Inc., speaks during a keynote at the 2023 Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, California, on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023.(Marlena Sloss/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Now market observers are asking what comes next. But the question isn't \"what single approach replaces DEI?\" but rather \"why should there be a singular approach?\" There’s good reason to be skeptical of replacing one universal mandate with another. Consider what happens when central planning ends in any sector: innovation flourishes. When the government broke up AT&T’s monopoly in the 1980s, telecommunications transformed from a stagnant utility to the dynamic foundation of the digital economy. When the government deregulated the airlines in the 1970s, air travel became within reach of middle-class Americans. The end of DEI's monopoly on talent strategy promises a similar renaissance, so long as companies are willing to experiment to find the right approach to meet their unique needs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Forward-thinking companies are already taking the plunge. Some tech companies are adopting MEI – Merit, Excellence, Intelligence. Maybe police and fire departments want to adopt BRAVE – Bold, Reliable, Accountable, Vigilant, Empathetic. Healthcare workers could adopt CARE – Compassionate, Adaptable, Respectful, Empowered. Construction companies could recruit for STEEL – Skilled, Trustworthy, Efficient, Enduring, Leaders. There are endless opportunities for companies to clearly articulate who is a good fit for their organization. This isn’t abandoning workplace diversity — it’s enabling its most meaningful form. Research has consistently shown that cognitive diversity — that is, differences in how people think, rather than how they look — increases innovation, creativity and problem-solving. Companies that cultivate this deeper form of diversity will be positioned to outperform. There will also be greater diversity in hiring approaches more broadly. Some companies may focus on recruiting overlooked talent from Appalachia or first-generation college students. Others might emphasize retention and internal development. Some may adopt high-churn models that rapidly test talent on the job. A few might maintain their grip on their race- and gender-focused DEI policies — albeit with increased legal risk. Companies will experiment, and the free market will decide who wins. The DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture. This approach mirrors America's greatest economic success stories. When soldiers returned from World War II, President Harry Truman didn't send them all to dig ditches. They became entrepreneurs, factory workers, artists and inventors — and unleashed the greatest economic boom in American history. Similarly, as companies are freed from DEI's rigid orthodoxy, they can develop individual approaches to building workforces that they believe will maximize their chances for future success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Companies will of course have to apply metrics to their chosen strategies to evaluate performance, but individuals should be recruited and promoted based on whatever race- and gender-neutral criteria their company has set. This will lead to better employee fit, lower turnover and improved corporate performance. It will also make good on the Civil Rights Act’s promise to eliminate discrimination, while rendering race and gender quotas a relic of the past. Even Hubert Humphrey would take off his hat to that.

    "title": "LEE CARTER: The secret sauce of Trump's success that continues to mystify his most ardent critics",
    "article_text": "People in Tennessee, Texas, Michigan and Washington D.C. judge President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. In the world of PresidentDonald Trump, the constant refrain that he \"needs to do this\" or \"must pass that\" in the next 200 days misses the point entirely. Trump doesn’t operate within the usual political playbook, and trying to fit him into conventional expectations is a mistake. Advisers often treat him like a typical politician:pass policies, build alliances, show a unified front. Tone it down.  Stop being so…. Well, Trumpian.But that’s not who he is. And it certainly isn’t what he should do. Trump’s power lies in owning the story, controlling the narrative’s chaos, and shaking things up in ways no one else can—or would dare to. His actions may seem reckless or absurd to some, but they’re often strategic—designed to grab attention, set the agenda, and keep everyone reacting to him. WHERE DONALD TRUMP STANDS WITH AMERICANS 15 WEEKS INTO HIS 2ND PRESIDENCY Let’s think about the events over just the last several days. Trump once again seized the digital spotlight, postingAI-generated imagesof himself asthe popeand a \"Star Wars\" character, musing about reopening Alcatraz, vacillating on tariffs, and even questioning his adherence to the Constitution. President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself as the pope on Truth Social on Friday, May 2, 2025.(@realDonaldTrump/Truth Social) As expected, the world reacted: some with admiration, others with indignation. His supporters lauded him as a bold disruptor of the status quo, while critics labeled him dangerous, blasphemous, even absurd. If you take every Donald Trump moment at face value, you’re missing the point. But here’s the crux: if you take every Trump moment at face value, you’re missing the point. To truly grasp Donald Trump, you need to step back—not just from the headlines, but from the impulse to interpret every word, post, or proposal literally. His approach isn’t straightforward. It’s theatrical, rhetorical, and deeply strategic. Parsing his statements is akin to interpreting religious texts. Some see every word as gospel truth. Others find symbolism, guidance, or metaphor. The same spectrum of interpretation applies to Trump. BROADCAST BIAS: NETWORKS' TAKE ON TRUMP’S 100 DAYS WAS 100% SHOCKING, 0% SURPRISING If you treat Trump’s words as fixed policy declarations, you’ll find yourself in chaos. But if you view them as part of a broader strategy—to capture attention, steer the conversation, and frame negotiations—you begin to discern the method in the madness. Considertariffs. Are they economic policy? Or a pressure tactic? I’d argue they’re the latter—a means to move markets, project toughness, and reset expectations. Or take his musings about running in 2028. Is that a literal campaign launch? Or is he shaping the narrative around leadership, succession, and legacy? This is Trump’s true power: not in the precision of his plans, but in his ability to control the agenda. He creates noise not to distract, but to dominate. He doesn’t wait to join the conversation—heisthe conversation. And in doing so, he forces everyone else to react on his terms. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION So, what should Trump do in the next 200 days? The answer is simple: keep doing what he’s doing. The more he challenges conventions, the more he reaffirms his brand as the disruptor who fights for \"the everyman.\" Policy details don’t necessarily matter as much as the message that he is shaking up the establishment and battling an unfair system. Success for him isn’t aboutpassing specific bills; it’s about owning the conversation and proving he’s the only one willing to blow things up to get results. If Trump can continue this strategy—owning the narrative, showing he's fighting for the \"little guy,\" and not over-complicating it—he remains relevant. The reality? His core support won’t shift because of policy; it’ll shift if he stops being Trump. So, the next 200 days should be about staying true to his persona, deciding what noise to generate, and letting others scramble to chase his lead. Ultimately, how you interpretTrump’s actionsreveals more about you than about him. If you see him as a menace, every statement becomes a threat. If you see him as a visionary, every statement signals bold change. If you see him as a negotiator, the unpredictability makes perfect sense. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP You don’t have to like Trump to understand him. But ignoring the mechanics of how he shapes public discourse is missing the most crucial part of the story. He’s not just running for office. He’s running the conversation. And in essence, Trump needs to keep doing what he does best—disrupt, distract, and dominate. The rest is just noise.

    "title": "How Canada’s new prime minister plans to take down America and impose the Great Reset",
    "article_text": "Canada's Mark Carney reacted to winning election as prime minister Monday. (Reuters) Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carneyis not your average political leader. He didn’t rise through the ranks of parliament or build his political clout through years of constituency work. He is an unelected central banker turned international power broker with deep ties to the World Economic Forum, the Great Reset movement and the ESG (Environmental, social and governance) agenda. Some might say that his lack of political experience is a problem for Carney, but I disagree. While many of his country’s leaders were playing politics, Carney was working to transform the world through influential organizations and financial institutions. He was one of the Great Reset’s masterminds, and now, he’s more powerful than ever. Carney’s sudden political ascent in Canada has the potential to ripple far beyond his own borders. In fact, it may be a warning shot aimed directly at President Donald Trump and the rising populist movement in America. CANADA ELECTIONS: PRIME MINISTER CARNEY'S LIBERAL PARTY TO LEAD FOURTH CONSECUTIVE GOVERNMENT Before entering politics, Carney served as the governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, making him the first person to everhead the central banksof two G7 nations. During his tenure at the Bank of England, Carney became a global cheerleader for climate finance, openly pushing for financial institutions to embrace ESG standards and integrate climate risk into their decision-making. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney smiles on stage at his campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa, Ontario, Tuesday, April 29, 2025. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) Carney was instrumental in founding the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a coalition of major banks, asset managers and insurers committed to aligning trillions of dollars with the United Nations’ climate targets. GFANZ quickly became one of the most powerful vehicles for advancing the ESG agenda through private finance. Carney’s idea was the leverage the massive influence of global finance to destroy the fossil-fuel industry and impose ESG social credit scores throughout western economies, including the United States. In the process, Carney believed he could transform the world. But Carney’s ambitions extend even further. He served on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum, the group behind the controversial Great Reset initiative, which proposes reimagining capitalism andreshaping global economiesaround equity, sustainability and stakeholder governance. Carney has echoed these themes for years, calling for a shift away from shareholder capitalism and toward a new economic model in which governments and corporations work hand-in-glove to manage society and the economy — a modern kind of soft fascism. Perhaps most disturbing of all for Americans, Carney has openly called for the replacement of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. While serving as governor of the Bank of England, he proposed a new global digital currency — what he termed a \"Synthetic Hegemonic Currency\" — to reduce the dollar’s dominance. If Carney’s vision for global finance were to become a reality, the U.S. economy could enter a massive recession. The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency means the dollar is used globally for trade and finance. If the dollar were to lose that status, not only would faith in the U.S. economy collapse, much of the $2.25 trillion circulating overseas would likely flood back into America, causing another inflation crisis. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In today’s political climate, where China and other authoritarian regimes are increasingly working to undermine U.S. financial leadership, Carney’s proposal reads like a gift to America’s greatest adversaries. And now, as prime minister of one of our closest allies, a country that has an outsized influence in global economic policy, Carney is in a position to put his vision into action. Carney has also voiced support for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), a form of government-controlled digital money that many fear could be used to track and control citizens’ financial behavior. But Carney’s ambitions extend even further. He has served on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum, the group behind the controversial Great Reset initiative, which proposes reimagining capitalism and reshaping global economies around equity, sustainability and stakeholder governance. Imagine a future where your ability to purchase goods or services depends in part on your compliance with government-approved narratives, and in this disturbing future, the government would be able to know about and stop any economic transaction. That’s not a dystopian novel — it’s the long-term goal of many progressives calling for a Great Reset, and Carney is among the movement’s most influential champions. Make no mistake: Carney might not have any power in America, but his rise to authority in that country matters. His victory in Canada should alarm every American who values liberty, sovereignty and economic freedom. If Carney has his way, Canada will serve as a prototype for the kind of top-down, centrally planned society that the World Economic Forum envisions for the entire Western world. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And with Donald Trump now serving his second non-consecutive term as president of the United States, it’s no coincidence that Carney has taken power in Canada. The globalist class is preparing for a renewed confrontation with the populist surge that threatens their influence. Mark Carney isn’t just Canada’s new prime minister — he’s the Great Reset’s man in Ottawa, and he has his sights set on more than just the Canadian economy.

ButFastinois taking a different approach. The Palo Alto-based startup says it has invented a new kind of AI model architecture that’s intentionally small and task-specific. The models are so small they’re trained with low-end gaming GPUs worth less than $100,000 in total, Fastino says. The method is attracting attention. Fastino has secured $17.5 million in seed funding led by Khosla Ventures, famously OpenAI’s first venture investor, Fastino exclusively tells TechCrunch. This brings the startup’s total funding to nearly $25 million. It raised $7 million last November in a pre-seed round led by Microsoft’s VC arm M12 and Insight Partners. “Our models are faster, more accurate, and cost a fraction to train while outperforming flagship models on specific tasks,” says Ash Lewis, Fastino’s CEO and co-founder. Fastino has built a suite of small models that it sells to enterprise customers. Each model focuses on a specific task a company might need, like redacting sensitive data or summarizing corporate documents. Fastino isn’t disclosing early metrics or users yet, but says its performance is wowing early users. For example, because they’re so small, its models can deliver an entire response in a single token, Lewis told TechCrunch, showing off the tech giving a detailed answer at once in milliseconds. It’s still a bit early to tell if Fastino’s approach will catch on. The enterprise AI space is crowded, with companies like Cohere and Databricks also touting AI that excels at certain tasks. And the enterprise-focused SATA model makers, including Anthropic and Mistral, also offer small models. It’s also no secret that the future of generative AI for enterprise islikely in smaller, more focused language models. Time may tell, but an early vote of confidence from Khosla certainly doesn’t hurt. For now, Fastino says it’s focused on building a cutting-edge AI team. It’s targeting researchers at top AI labs who aren’t obsessed with building the biggest model or beating the benchmarks. “Our hiring strategy is very much focused on researchers that maybe have a contrarian thought process to how language models are being built right now,” Lewis says.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Fintech giantStripeannounced Wednesday a slew of new product launches at its annualStripe Sessionsuser event. The highlights include a new AI foundation model for payments; stablecoin-powered accounts; a new Orchestration offering, and a recent migration with chip behemoth Nvidia. Stripe’s payments foundation model has been trained on tens of billions of transactions, Emily Glassberg Sands, Stripe’s head of information, said. So it “captures hundreds of subtle signals about each payment” that other models would miss, she said. One use case is improved fraud detection. Stripe’s previous models “gradually” reduced card-testing attacks by 80% over two years. Card-testing attacks are a type of fraudulent activity in which someone tries to determine whether stolen card information is valid so that they can use it to make purchases. The company claims that its new foundation model increased its detection rate for such attacks on large businesses “by 64% practically overnight.” She added, “Previously, we couldn’t take advantage of our vast data. Now we can.” Stripe, of course, isn’t the only fintech to have built a model using AI for fraud detection. Just one example is Sardine, which describes itself as an AI risk platform for fraud, compliance, and credit underwriting, in Februaryraised a $70 million Series C funding roundled by Activant Capital. In an interview, Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of product and business, told TechCrunch that Stripe’s generalized model is via self-supervised learning, and thus discovers its own features. “We have found over and over and over again in machine learning, generalized models outperform,” he said. “A big part of that is agility. It just performs better and adapts better to changes in fraud patterns. Stripe also announced on Wednesday its intent to bring stablecoin-backed, multicurrency cards to businesses by partnering with other startups like Ramp, Squads, and Airtm. With such cards, businesses across multiple countries will be able to “operate in the same currency for the first time,” the companies claim. The move comes just three months after Stripe completed itsacquisitionof stablecoin platform Bridge. With Orchestration, Stripe said it can better help businesses set up, manage, and optimize performance across multiple payment providers from its dashboard — whether or not they use Stripe as a payment processor. Stripe also used the event to name numerous AI companies that use its billing product, including Windsurf, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs. More recently, according to Vivek Sharma, Stripe’s head of revenue automation, Nvidia migrated its “entire subscriber base” to Stripe Billing in six weeks — a process that the fintech claims typically takes many months for a business to complete and marked the “fastest-ever migration to Stripe Billing.” (Nvidia was already a customer of Stripe Payments.)

Another application by Tesla to trademark the term “Robotaxi” for its upcoming ride-hailing service isstill under examinationby the office. In addition,applicationsfromTesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks. That includesone companythat has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories. The USPTOissuedTuesday what’s known as a “nonfinal office action” on the “Robotaxi” trademark application, which means Tesla has three months to file a response or the office will abandon the application. A trademark lawyer representing Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Teslaappliedfor the trademarks in October 2024 on the same day that itrevealed the Cybercab, the purpose-built electric car that it hopes to one day use in its planned autonomous ride-hailing service. Tesla also submitted two similar trademark applications October 10 for the term “Robobus,” which are still under examination. The trademark that was refused was assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14. Tesla said it would use the word in reference to “[l]and vehicles; electric vehicles, namely automobiles; automobiles; and structural parts therefor,” according to the original application. While the USPTO examiner found there were no conflicting trademarks in existence, it refused the application because it was “merely descriptive.” The examiner wrote that the term “Robotaxi” is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.” “[S]uch wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods and/or services,” the examiner wrote. Tesla will be allowed to submit evidence and arguments to support its argument in favor of the trademark. If it does, the USPTO wants Tesla to provide “[f]act sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent screenshots of applicant’s website as it relates to the goods and/or services in the application, including any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark.”In other words, Tesla needs to give the agency specific plans for how and why it deserves the “Robotaxi” trademark. The examiner also wrote that Tesla will need to tell the USPTO if “competitors” use the terms “ROBO, ROBOT, or ROBOTIC to advertise similar goods and/or services.” Tesla’s other application for the “Robotaxi” trademark would cover the use of the word when offering transportation services, including “coordinating travel arrangements for individuals and for groups,” “arranging time-based ridesharing services,” and offering vehicle sharing or rentals. That application was also assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14, but no decision has been filed. This story has been updated to include information about the “Cybercab” trademark applications.

Occasionally, a seagull will swoop in and perch atop the roof for a few minutes. But for the most part, nothing happens. On Wednesday, the College of Cardinals started the process of picking the next pope, who will succeed the late Pope Francis. This is a closed-door, sacred ritual, dating back long before mass media made it possible to quickly transmit news with so much public interest. So instead of issuing statements to the press, the conclave signals its progress to the public via smoke — black if they have not agreed on a new pope, and white if they have come to a decision. While the smoke signal used to be for the benefit of local onlookers, there are now dozens of global broadcasters streaming 24/7 coverage of the Sistine Chapel’s exterior online. There is no narration from a television host — only the ambient noise of the packed city square, and perhaps a smattering of seagull calls. In a time when YouTubers strive to optimize every last frame of their videos to boost their chances of viral fame, the mundanity of “conclave cam” is oddly awe-inspiring. It feels like an extension of the Nordic “slow TV” trend, where public networks broadcast commercial-free footage of dull, yet calming scenes. For hours or days at a time, viewers can watch salmon swimming upstream, trains journeying across the countryside, ormoose migratingto their summer habitat. Within the context of YouTube, the surrounding user interface of these “conclave cams” is familiar — the unmoderated live chats move quickly, like a popular creator’s livestream. But unlike a Fortnite Battle Royale, there’s not really much to talk about in the chat. The chimney might emit black smoke, or it might emit white smoke. For the vast bulk of the broadcast, the most exciting moments occur when a bird flies through the frame. But because it’s the internet, people end up arguing about politics, soccer, and Elon Musk. There’s some nasty language thrown in there. In some cases, viewers will buy superchats — bold blocks of text that are more noticeable in a busy chat — to declare their vision for the future of the Catholic Church. The point of watching a conclave livestream isn’t to find out when the next Pope is selected — that’s what breaking news push notifications are for. Instead, what’s alluring is the quiet. Office workers may pull up a stream in a tiny window in the corner of their laptop screen, looking over when they see a slight movement of a seagull out of the corner of their eye. When sunset hits, we watch as the sky gets darker and darker, until suddenly it’s night. There’s something spiritual about this gathering of strangers on a common web page, but it has nothing to do with the actual religiosity on display. It’s the desire for people to experience something together — even if that something includes an unmoderated live chat.

The update, approved Wednesday for release on the U.S. App Store, allows Delta users to join the Delta team’s Patreon directly from the mobile app, without giving Apple a cut of its subscriptions. The move follows last week’scourt rulingthat forced Apple to fully open its U.S. App Store to external purchases, after a years-long fight with Fortnite maker Epic Games. ThoughApple largely wonthat antitrust lawsuit, a judge ruled that the tech gianthad not properly followed the court’s ordersin one key area: in-app purchases. Apple previously vetted which apps could link out to their websites and added screens to scare users away from making purchases through external payment mechanisms. All the while, it was still charging a commission on those web sales of 27%, down from its usual 30%. After Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple had failed to comply with her original injunction, Applechanged its App Store rules for the U.S.Since then, businesses likeSpotify,Amazon Kindle, andPatreonhave updated their iOS apps to add links to their websites where consumers can pay directly, without using Apple’s in-app purchases. While this is a win for larger companies that now get to keep more of their profits by skirting Apple’s commission, Delta’s update is an example of how the ruling makes way for new business models for monetizing mobile apps. That change could give the App Store the boost it needs at a time when indie app developmenthasbeendecliningandevery iOS release “sherlocks” (copies) more third-party apps.Smaller developers often struggle to make a living after paying a 30% commission to Apple, but now have the option to keep more of their profits thanks to the expanded support for web payments. In the updated version of Delta’s game emulator app, users are prompted to “Join our Patreon” from the app’s Settings screen. Here, they can then click a button to subscribe to Delta’s $3 per month Patreon membership, which provides access to exclusive features and other perks. The web page opens inside the app, allowing users to link their Patreon accounts and choose a membership tier, like monthly or annual. (Before, users could only link a Patreon account in the app, but they couldn’t subscribe directly.) “We can now freely mention our Patreon without giving Apple 27% of donations,” noted Delta creator Riley Testut in a poston social media,adding, “Goodbye scare screens” — a reference to the previously required warnings that nudged users away from external purchase links. Delta still includes a way to pay through Apple’s in-app purchases, as is still required. However, it’s tucked away under an “Alternative Payment Methods” menu in the Settings screen — an option many users will likely never seek out. Hiding pro-consumer options deep within layers of menus is a trick that Apple itself has used to its advantage over the years. For instance, if you want to turn off Apple’s personalized ads (essentially the Apple version of its required “Do Not Track” pop-up authorization for apps), you have to delve into your iOS Settings, go to Privacy & Security, scroll down to the very bottom of the page, tap Apple Advertising, then toggle off Personalized Ads. Or, if you want to clear the app usage data that personalizes your App Store experience, you have to go to Settings > Apps > App Store > scroll to the bottom of that page, tap Personalized Recommendations, then tap Clear App Usage Data on the screen that appears. Apple surely can’t be mad at developers for adopting its own tactics? Given that Delta’s app has now received approval from Apple’s App Review, it seems to follow that we’ll soon see other Patreon-supported apps emerging in the near future.

    "title": "Rove, founded by a 22-year-old, is helping Gen Z earn airline miles without credit cards",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us During his junior year study abroad, Max Morganroth, traveled to 30 countries, primarily flying in business and first class. His jet-setting was funded almost entirely by airline points he collected through strategic credit card applications and miles redemptions. Morganroth told TechCrunch that just about everyone he knew was “begging” him to teach them how to get free flights through airline miles programs, a term he calls “travel hacking.” However, most people in his circle, including fellow Wharton students, either didn’t qualify for the best airline rewards credit cards or lacked the time to maximize their mile conversions for optimal flights. By marketing credit cards and sharing fees with banks, frequent flyer programs have becomesignificant revenue generatorsfor airlines. But according to Morganroth, about 70 million Americans don’t have sufficient credit history to access these reward schemes. During his travels, Morganroth discovered that in Hong Kong people don’t need to open credit cards to earn miles on Cathay Pacific’s Asia Miles program. “Miles there are treated like a second currency,” he said. “You go to 7-Eleven to buy a water bottle; you earn Asia Miles. You can open a bank account and earn cash interest, plus miles on your savings. You can even sell a property for part cash, part miles.” Morganroth saw an opportunity to create a program similar to Asia Miles, where consumers could earn miles on various airlines when they shop in certain stores. His proposition to airlines was that they could tap into a larger consumer demographic, particularly Gen Z, a generation eager to travel but still lacking established credit. After graduating, Morganroth, now 22 years old, teamed up with Arhan Chhabra, a Harvard dropout, and the duo set out to buildRove, a startup that claims to be the first universal mile loyalty program. Of course, it’s not exactly the first and only. American Express’ rewards program, for instance, lets usersredeem points with multiple airlines, and sites like Expedia offer points that can be used for various airline flights. But multi-airline programs are still a rarity. Rove entered the Y Combinator’s winter 2024 batch and proceeded to fly around the world, where they struck partnership deals with the mile programs of 11 airlines, including Air France-KLM, Aeromexico, Finnair, and Qatar Airways. These partnerships, which were previously only available primarily to credit card issuers of the major banks, helped Rove raise $2 million from investors, including YC, General Catalyst, and Soma Capital. Rove’s loyalty program allows airlines to expand the lucrative business of miles to millions more consumers, Morganroth said. But instead of allowing airlines to share fees with credit cards, Rove gives them a way to make money through affiliate marketing with over 7,000 merchants through the Rove shopping extension for Google Chrome. That’s a business model that’s similar toHoneyand Rakuten. Morganroth explained that the points earned from shopping can be converted into airline miles, which hold more value than their equivalent in cash. In addition to the affiliate marketing scheme, Rove also offers its users miles for hotel bookings. In fact, Morganroth said that the points from a $1,000 hotel stay could be worth a round-trip ticket to Europe from the United States, a flight that could then be used for the same trip, if the hotel booking is nonrefundable. Hotel bookings are so valuable because some hotels share as much as 40% of their sales as commission. Instead of pocketing that profit, Rove gives all of its share of those earnings to the user in the form of miles. Users can combine Rove miles earned on hotel bookings with miles from the shopping extension and even credit card miles if they have a card that earns airline points. The startup’s elaborate scheme may seem complicated, but Morganroth says that earning miles through Rove is straightforward, as long as users book hotels on its platform or shop using the Rove shopping extension. When users are ready to book flights with their miles, Rove’s travel portal helps them find the best award flight deals. And while Rove partnered with only 11 airlines, the startup’s users can book award travel on about 140 carriers because it is often possible to transfer miles of one airline company to its affiliates in another region. Rove is available to anyone, but Morganroth believes its offering is the most attractive to young adults. “Gen Z wants to travel more than any other demographic, yet they have the least access to the tools like this that actually make it cheaper,” he said. “They no longer have to wait until they’re 28, have five years of credit history, and $700 fee to get one of these cards; they can just download a Chrome extension, book any of their existing travel through us, and they’ll immediately be in the game.” Topics Reporter, Venture Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

Developers using it can build Claude-powered apps that deliver up-to-date info, the company said in a press release published Wednesday. The rollout of the API comes as AI companies look to augment their models in various ways that might attract new customers to their platforms. For its part, Anthropiclast weekdebuted a tool to connect applications to Claude as well as an expanded “deep research” capability that lets Claude search enterprise accounts, websites, and more. “Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to [our] API,” Anthropic wrote in its release. “With web search, developers can now build AI solutions that tap into current information without needing to manage their own web search infrastructure.” Web search is now available on our API.Developers can augment Claude's comprehensive knowledge with up-to-date data.pic.twitter.com/pRQf0ZKXUZ When the web search API is enabled, Claude will use “reasoning” capabilities to determine whether a given request would benefit from up-to-date information or specialized knowledge. If Claude decides to search the web, it’ll generate a search query, retrieve results, analyze them, and provide an answer with citations. Claude can also refine its queries and conduct multiple searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries. Developers can customize this behavior as well as specify domains from which Claude is allowed and not allowed to search. Devs can also allow or prohibit web search use at the organization level, Anthropic says. Pricing starts at $10 per 1,000 searches. Search works with Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, newer Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku models. In related news, Anthropic is bringing web search toClaude Code, its tool that allows devs to tap Claude to complete various coding tasks.

Launched in 2017, Snap Map was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. Over time, the feature has evolved and now offers ways for users todiscover local hotspotsand find things to do. Snap Map’s success is important for Snapchat, as it’s a crucial part of the social network and gives it a competitive edge over rivals like Instagram and TikTok, both of which don’t offer real-time social discovery in the way that Snap Map does. Instagram is aware of this, as the Meta-owned social network has been spotted working on a“Friend Map”that would allow users to see their friends’ locations in real time. “Snap Map is one of the most used mobile maps in the world, and we’re thrilled to see our community continue to grow,” said Ceci Mourkogiannis, VP of Product at Snap, in a statement to TechCrunch. “The Snap Map is helping hundreds of millions connect with friends and their favorite places and discover what’s happening around them, making the world feel more connected every day.” The news comes as Snapchat has been updating Snap Map with additional functionality over the years. Last year, the company launched a“Footsteps” featurethat lets you see how much of the world you’ve explored and track where you’ve traveled. Plus, Snapchat rolled out“Promoted Places”on Snap Map as a way for users to discover new places.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Lucid Motors has been working through some quality “hiccups” in the early stages of delivering its long-awaited electric SUV, according to interim CEO Marc Winterhoff. “It is true that we had some technical issues that we had to overcome around software” and the Gravity’s heads-up display, Winterhoff said on a conference call Tuesday. “There have been some hiccups. To be quite frank, I think this is absolutely normal in the beginning of launching a vehicle.” In particular, Winterhoff cited supply chain issues with Gravity’s heads-up display as a source of trouble. The company haspulled that option backfor now while it works with the supplier to increase production of the part. Winterhoff said these early quality snags are the reason why Lucid has been slow to bring the Gravity to its showroom locations, including SUVs that are supposed to be used for test drives. But he said the company is “knocking those [issues] out.” “We’d rather push it out a few days or weeks, rather than putting a half-baked product in front of the customer,” he said. Lucid’s first SUV arrives at a critical juncture for the company. It has so far failed to sell its Air sedan atanywhere near the levels it once promised to Wall Street. Its total losses to date are now over $13 billion, according toa new regulatory filing. And in February, its long-running CEOabruptly stepped down, which led to the installation of Winterhoff. The Gravity was originally supposed to hit the market in 2023. The launch was pushedback a yearthanks to the disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic. Lucid did technically start delivering Gravity SUVs in late 2024, although only to employees and people close to the company. The SUV, which currently starts at $94,000 and gets 450 miles of range, started shipping to regular customers in thelast few weeks. But progress has been slow thanks to some of these early production challenges. Lucid has said it doesn’t expect to grow the volume of deliveries until the back half of this year. And it is not alone in dealing with early-run quality problems. Automakers of all sizes tend to deal with issues big or small as they start building new vehicles. Elon Musk once said in a 2021 interview that hetells friends to waituntil Tesla is making new cars at scale before they buy one. Selling cars makes up the overwhelming majority of Lucid’s business. The company has often said it wants to be a supplier of EV tech to other automakers. To date, it has only inked a deal with Aston Martin, but Winterhoff teased other possible partnerships on Tuesday’s call. The interim CEO said “several players” have reached out to explore “joint manufacturing” in the U.S., potentially at the former Nikola factory in Coolidge, Arizona,that Lucid is now leasing. “The president and the administration want to have a strong manufacturing sector in the U.S., and we are looking at potential ways we can leverage our assets,” he said. Winterhoff also said Tuesday that Lucid is in “advanced discussions with partners who have told us the Lucid Gravity is the best-positioned AV-capable platform on the market.” He said aspects like the Gravity’s advanced sensor suite, redundant electrical and control architectures, and fast-charging capability is what makes the SUV attractive in this context. Winterhoff claimed “multiple L4-focused software and mobility companies have engaged Lucid about potential collaboration.” These potential supplemental lines of business could theoretically provide another stream of revenue for Lucid and shore up its finances as it works toward rolling out vehicles built on a more affordable mid-sized platform in late 2026. The company has said it has enough liquidity make it to the middle of 2026. The global economy has become volatile during the early months of President Donald Trump’s second administration, and that could present a risk to companies like Lucid. To wit, Winterhoff said on Tuesday’s call that Lucid is evaluating “vehicle price changes, tariff risk mitigation, and bifurcating [its] supply chain” in order to protect against the volatility. This story previously stated that Lucid Motors has enough cash to get to the launch of its mid-sized EV platform in late 2026. The company has only said it has enough liquidity to get to mid-2026. The story has been corrected to reflect this.

    "title": "New court filing shows that Meta execs agreed that Facebook was losing to TikTok",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Instagram head Adam Mosseri, and other Meta execs thought that TikTok was beating Meta at its own game. That’s according to a new filing in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’santitrust lawsuitagainst the tech giant, published on Monday. The document, dated February 2022, includes conversations among a number of Meta execs discussing Facebook and Instagram’s strategy and market position. In one message, Zuckerberg called Facebook a “challenger” that has “lost the mindshare and momentum,” while adding that TikTok creates a “feeling of shared context” where friends see the same memes, he said. Mosseri also agreed that Facebook should be thought of as a challenger now, noting it’s no longer the default discovery engine. He proposed that the preferred discovery engine today could be YouTube, but he expected TikTok to surpass the Google-owned video platform in time, given the data Meta had on hand. “The most natural differentiated … strategy for Facebook is to be the default discovery surface. But it’s interesting that [TikTok] is 100% video and beating us badly,” Mosseri wrote. “My guess is they’re growing the social mobile market and eating into TV, long-form video, Netflix as well.” Mosseri was right. TikTok overtook YouTube foraverage watch time in the U.S. in 2021, one study found. Another study by the parental control software maker Qustodio discovered that kids ages four through 18 hadspent 60% more time on TikTok than YouTube in 2023. Last year, TikTokbegan allowing 60-minute uploadsto challenge YouTube. And just this week,Netflix introduced its own TikTok-like experiencein its mobile app, offering a new vertical video feed of recommended videos, personalized to the individual user. In the trial, however, the U.S. government is attempting to prove that Meta violated competition laws by acquiring companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to create a social networking monopoly. A document like this could damage the case, given that, internally, Meta execs were discussing how badly Facebook was being beaten by TikTok. For instance, Zuckerberg noted that even if Facebook remained the biggest app in terms of the number of people who engage with it on a daily or weekly basis, it was no longer the biggest app by time spent. He also pointed out that TikTok has a way to provide people with a sense of shared context. That is, if you and your friends are interested in the same things, you’ll likely come across the same things in TikTok’s feed, he said. “That makes it inherently social because instead of having to send some content to a friend, you can just assume they’ve seen it,” the CEO explained. “If we could get to a level like this with topics and unconnected content on FB, that would be great. “ Other execs also chimed in. Head of WhatsApp Will Cathcart pointed out that TikTok users could comment on a video in a particular niche, which would lead the algorithm to bring them and other commenters to the same videos over time. Stan Chudnovsky, then a VP and GM at Meta, added that Meta had now begun to compete in a space that had become very fragmented with a “bunch of companies eating into our growth.” “Just adding a new format (like we did with Stories) is not enough anymore. There are just so many other places for people to be,” he added, citing other social apps popular in the U.S., like TikTok, Twitter, iMessage, Snap, YouTube, Reddit, and Discord. John Hegeman, then the VP of ads (now chief revenue officer), agreed that TikTok was “clearly in the lead” in areas like short-form video content, ranking capabilities, and creation tools, but said he thought Meta could close the gap by getting creators to also post on Reels. However, he said he was less certain about how far behind Meta was on the machine learning and technical side of things, and in terms of creation tools. The document paints a picture that in Meta’s view, Facebook is the underdog in the social media market. It’s also not the only document that has surfaced during the trial to demonstrate Meta’s fear of competition.Zuckerberg himself testified last monththat TikTok’s success was both a risk to Meta’s business and had slowed its growth.

    "title": "BluSmart investors propose $30M in new funding to revive the Uber rival",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A group of investors are considering a plan to inject another $30 million into BluSmart in a bid to revive the Indian cab-hailing startup, whichabruptly halted operationslast month, TechCrunch has learned. The proposal from these existing investors has a catch: It’s contingent on BluSmart co-founder Anmol Singh Jaggi agreeing to resign.The proposed investment will be treated in the form of unsecured debt and will be aimed at fixing the startup’s operational liabilities, including pending dues and employee salaries, two sources told TechCrunch. BluSmart’s investors with pro rata rights, including BP Ventures and Switzerland-based ResponsAbility, started discussing the resolution last week. BP Ventures and ResponsAbility declined to comment when reached out on Monday. While Jaggi has not signed the resignation from BluSmart, sources told TechCrunch he has verbally agreed to resign from its board, subject to assurance he will not face any future legal action from BluSmart’s investors. Jaggi and BluSmart’s other co-founder, Punit K. Goyal, did not respond to messages sent earlier this week. BluSmart halted operations last month after aprobe was launched into Gensol Engineering, its primary EV lessor and the company that shares Jaggi as its co-founder. The move affected riders looking for EVs, its investors, and its 600 employees, who did not receive their salaries at least until March. The Gurugram-based startup had around 2.5 billion Indian rupees (~$30 million) in pending dues, which include 500 to 600 million Indian rupees of overdue payments to employees, TechCrunch has learned. About 8,700 EVs on BluSmart’s fleet have also been abandoned due to the suspension of its service. This could affect the health of batteries and other components on the vehicles if the startup does not restart its service soon. The suspension has also impacted BluSmart’s drivers, some of whom have gone onstrike in New Delhito protest the move. Some of those out-of-work drivers may see some relief as Delhi-based EV cab-hailing service Evera Cabs recently announced the addition of500 cabs leased to it by BluSmart lenders. The startup is also looking to add 1,000 EV cabs currently associated with BluSmart and some of its drivers. Existing BluSmart investors do not want the startup to lose its branding by letting other cab-hailing companies, including Evera and even Uber, use its fleet on their services. Sources told TechCrunch the investors are keen to restart the service in the next three weeks. Still, BluSmart’s comeback has some challenges. One of them is the purported corporate governance issues, in addition to those in Gensol impacting the startup indirectly. The Indian corporate affairs ministry recentlylaunched a probe into Gensol and BluSmartfor that. Jaggi’s resignation from BluSmart is also not as certain as it appears. The Indian stock exchange regulator ordered Jaggi and his brother to resign from the publicly listed Gensol while launching the probe. However, the regulator’s direction does not apply to BluSmart, which is a private entity. Climate investment fund Eversource Capital, which is backed by Britain’s BP, shared an interest in buying BluSmart in a slump sale last month, asfirst reportedby Indian outlet Inc42. The fund proposed to merge the startup with its B2B fleet operator, Lithium Urban. However, the BluSmart board has not agreed to the offer, as it priced the startup at a 60% cut from its earlier $300 million valuation. Lithium Urban is struggling as a company with mounting losses, and most of its vehicles are reaching their end of life, TechCrunch learned last month. Lithium Urban’s original founder, Sanjay Krishnan, also abandoned the business, a person familiar with the matter said. Eversource Capital and Lithium Urban did not respond to requests for comment at the time. Indian conglomerate Adani Group also showed interest in buying the EV cab-hailing startup to use its fleet at its airports, TechCrunch learned last month. The company had early talks with the BluSmart board. It already has Uber as a fleet partner. Adani Group did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, BluSmart investors hope the startup could be better positioned to attract investments from strategics like Eversource Capital, Uber, or Adani after restarting its operations.

As a part of the new program, OpenAI will partner with governments to assist with efforts like building out data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, for specific languages and local needs. Funding for the program will come from OpenAI as well as from governments in each country, according to the startup. The goal is to pursue 10 international projects to start, but OpenAI hasn’t said where they’ll be located yet. OpenAI said that it hopes to “spread democratic AI.” That essentially means it wants to convince other countries to use Western AI models — OpenAI in particular — instead of Chinese competitors. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI for Countries is meant to complement the company’s AI data center push,Project Stargate, which is reportedly set toexpand beyond the U.S.OpenAI for Countries may lean on Stargate infrastructure, for example, or perhaps even funding from Stargate investors.

ServiceNowsaid that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquireData.World, a cloud-native data catalog and data governance platform. Austin, Texas-based Data.World was founded in 2015 and previously raised more than $130 million in venture financing from firms such as Alumni Ventures, Prologis Ventures, and Shasta Ventures,according to Crunchbase. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Data.World was most recently valued at $350 million in the company’s$50 million Series C roundin 2022,per PitchBook. Gaurav Rewari, an SVP and GM of data analytics at ServiceNow, told TechCrunch that ServiceNow was looking for companies they could partner with that would help customers deploy AI at scale. Specifically, ServiceNow was looking to give businesses better resources to make their data “AI-ready.” “As I like to say, this path to agentic ‘AI heaven’ goes through some form of data hell, and that’s the grim reality,” Rewari said. He added that Data.World was the right choice to help ServiceNow customers with this problem because Data.World helps enterprises organize and easily search through their data. The addition of Data.World’s data governance tools will help customers get the most out of their AI agents and other forms of AI automation, Rewari said. “We looked at a bunch of companies and came away so impressed with what they had built,” he added. “We felt that the whole journey that they were on, with respect to metadata management [and] knowledge-based infrastructure, to provide cataloging of data across the vast enterprise and the governance of that data itself — that could be an extremely important addition to our product portfolio.” Rewari said that once the deal closes, Data.World will begin integrating into ServiceNow, with Data.World’s platform being offered as a product to ServiceNow customers in the near future. It’s ServiceNow’s second acquisition in recent months. ServiceNow announced in March that it agreed toacquire Moveworks, which develops enterprise-focused automation and AI tools, for $2.85 billion. These acquisitions all fit nicely into ServiceNow’s plan to embrace agentic AI and the tools required to build it. In March 2024, ServiceNow SVP of corporate business development, Philip Kirk, told TechCrunch that ServiceNow was going to approach the transition to agentic AIthrough a mix of building and buying capabilities. “It is kind of three-dimensional chess right now to figure out whether to build, buy, or partner,” Kirk said at the time. “I think the biggest thing that we try to prioritize is how we can make decisions that are in the long-term best interest of our customers, and that differentiate us from what we know we’re world-class at, which is enterprise automation in our platform.” Updated 10:09 a.m. PT: An earlier version of this article referred to Data.World as “Declan.” ServiceNow provided TechCrunch with a blog post that used this name, which a spokesperson later said is internal product nomenclature and shouldn’t have been published.

Cue’s disclosure was part of his testimony regarding Apple and Google’s estimated $20 billion-a-year deal that makes Google the default search engine on Safari. He noted that searches on Safari declined for the first time last month, a change that he attributes to the increased use of AI. Cue also stated that he believes AI search providers will end up replacing traditional search engines like Google, which is why Apple is actively looking to add these services to its browser.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Design companyFigmatoday announced multiple features, including AI-powered site and web app creation, a way for marketers to create assets in bulk, and a new drawing tool. With this launch, the company is taking on other creative solutions such as Canva and Adobe, along with AI-powered website and prototype creators such as WordPress, Wix, Hostinger, and Replit. The company’s website-creation tool is called Figma Sites. The startup said that often designers build prototypes of what a site should look like within Figma. With the new AI-powered tool, they can easily create websites and even publish them. Once the site is generated, collaborators can easily change elements of the site through an editor without prompting. Users can also add transitions, animations, and scroll effects while making the site responsive. Figma is adding the ability to directly generate blog posts from its site. That means the Sites will have a content management system (CMS), which is an upcoming feature, baked in that lets users edit posts within the design of a blog and also manage other assets such as thumbnails and slugs. For interactive elements like stock tickers, you can add custom code or use AI to generate code for you. Figma Make, on the other hand, is a similar AI-powered tool, which is geared more toward ideation and prototyping. Users can input a prompt to create a web application. The prototype app is collaborative, and users can prompt the assistant to change or add certain elements. Plus, if there is a developer on the team, they can directly modify the code to make necessary changes. Users can also generate small interactive elements, such as a clock, and embed them in the pages published through Figma Sites later. Yuhki Yamashita, chief product officer at Figma, said that both products share a lot of features and underlying technology. “We want to enable high-fidelity prototyping with Figma, especially with Figma Make. You can add more data to it and try to see how viable an idea is in terms of final implementation. Whereas Figma Site is useful for a marketing and design team when they exactly know how a site should look and take full control of that,” Yamashita told TechCrunch while describing the differentiation between these products. Multiple companies in different sectors are looking for a way to create interactive experiences using AI. Website hosting providers such asSquarespace,Wix,WordPress, andHostingerhave released tools to let users easily create websites through AI. On the other hand, tools like Replit andLovableare pushing users to create apps or prototypes without coding knowledge. Last month, even Canva released a way to create interactive experienceswithin its designs with Canva Code. This isn’t Figma’s first foray into prototyping, though. Last year, it released a Make Design feature, which had to be pulled after users accusedthe company of heavily training the tool on existing apps. What’s more, Figma is releasing a new tool for marketers called Figma Buzz. With these tools, marketers can easily use templates created by designers with brand-specific designs to make new creatives. They can also use a tool to insert AI-generated images or change the background of certain assets. Marketers can also create assets in bulk using data from sources like spreadsheets. The startup is also launching a tool called Figma Draw for vector editing and illustrations. Yamashita said that designers often had to export their vector designs outside Figma to make edits. The company is now adding features like text on a path, pattern fill, brushes, multi-vector edit, adding noise and texture, and a lasso selection to its Draw product. Figma launched itsSlides tool for creating presentations last year. With the new asset creation and drawing tool, the company is directly competing with creative suites such as Adobe and Canva. Yamashita denied that the company is directly competing with these creative tools. He said that Figma is in the business of building digital products, and a third of the company’s users are developers, thanks totools like Dev Mode. The company is announcing a new plan called a content seat starting at $8 per month, which will give users access to Figma Buzz, Slides, FigJam, and Sites CMS.

By December, the company had decided to “retire” that offering, according toa blog post. And now,SimpleClosure, a startup that has described itself as “the Turbo Tax of shutting down,” has announced that Carta is a new investor in its $15 million Series A round. Carta’s decision to shift gears was driven by the realization that it “made more sense to invest and partner with a team laser-focused on solving this problem rather than building in-house,” said Carta spokesperson Amanda Taggart. (It’s alsooffering its customersa free consultation and a 10% discount on SimpleClosure’s services.) Dori Yona came up with the idea for SimpleClosure when building his last company after being tasked by a board member to create a “shutdown analysis.” The process was so complex, Yona felt compelled to build a software technology platform  to help automate and streamline the shutdown process. Demand initially was so great that the young startup had already crossed seven figures in annualized revenue by February of 2024, according to Yona. At that time, SimpleClosure announced that it had raised $4 million less than six months after itraised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding. In total, it has raised $20.5 million. TTV Capital led SimpleClosure’s $15 million Series A, which also included participation from existing investors Infinity Ventures, Anthemis, and Vera Equity. Besides Carta, new backers included The LegalTech Fund and a group of unnamed angel investors. “The reality is that 90% of startups don’t make it, and shutting down remains the unspoken but necessary part of entrepreneurship,” Yona said. “We hope companies never need us, but if they do, we’re here to help them do it the right way.” In 2024, SimpleClosure saw its revenue grow by 12x compared to the year prior, according to Yona.

    "title": "What happens next between India and Pakistan? Four key questions",
    "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions. Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. This sharp escalation comes after last month'sdeadly militant attackon tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim. In 2016, after19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC. In 2019, thePulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, promptedairstrikes deep into Balakot- the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight. Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously. India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs ofLashkar-e- Taiba(LeT),Jaish-e-Mohammed, andHizbul Mujahideen. Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps. \"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC. \"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says. The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu. Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\". \"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says. Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\". \"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan. \"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play. \"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\" Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\". Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely. \"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC. But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\". Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate. \"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC. \"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said. Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation. \"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary. However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since2002- and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds. Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift. \"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly. \"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\" Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment. \"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says. \"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down. \"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\" India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures. This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture. \"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week. \"Not even in my wildest imagination did I think this would happen,\" Cardinal David tells the BBC. India launched strikes in the early hours of Wednesday - two weeks after a deadly militant attack.

    "title": "Interest rates expected to be cut by Bank of England",
    "article_text": "Interest rates are widely expected to be cut on Thursday, with further falls predicted for later in the year. Analysts say a cut to 4.25% from 4.5% by the Bank of England is highly likely, although no change or a bigger reduction remain possibilities. Such a move would make borrowing money by businesses and individuals less expensive, but there are likely to be lower returns for savers. The announcement will come at 12:02 BST, following a two-minute silence to mark VE Day. If a cut is confirmed, it would be the fourth rate reduction from last year's peak of 5.25%, and the second this year. Members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be paying close attention to the rate of price rises in the UK, as measured by inflation. Interest rates are the Bank's primary tool in ensuring the annual rate of inflation remains at, or close to, the target of 2%. The latest data shows an inflation rate of 2.6% in the 12 months to March, although a series of bill increases at the start of April - including domestic energy prices - mean the rate is expected to climb, perhaps only temporarily. The committee will also be alert to wider global economic uncertainty. President Trump's tariff policy in the US was unveiled after the MPC's last meeting in March. Many analysts say inconsistency and uncertainty regarding the policy may push down growth and inflation, leading to expectations of the MPC responding with more interest rate cuts this year. The likelihood of an immediate cut, with more to come, has been reflected in the markets and, in turn, on mortgage pricing. Eight in 10 homeowners with a mortgage have a fixed-rate deal and will pay close attention to the interest on new deals when they first buy or when they shop around ahead of a current deal expiring. Lenders have beencutting the mortgage rateson these new fixed deals in recent weeks, although not down to the levels seen during most of the 2010s. Given that lenders have already \"priced in\" a cut in interest rates, further falls in mortgage rates are not guaranteed. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.15%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.08%. Samren Reddy, a medical student at the University of Liverpool who got in touch withYour Voice, Your BBC News, is saving to buy a first home. \"I don't think a small decrease will be a game changer. We're saving for the initial upfront deposit,\" the 21-year-old said. \"If I'm trying to save for a home, alongside my day-to-day living, even if I may be paying less on a loan and could get a cheaper mortgage, it's swallowed up by the pressures of living.\" A fall in interest rates are also likely have an impact on the returns people like Samren receive on their savings. Base rate cuts generally lead to reductions in the interest provided by savings providers, particularly on instant-access accounts. Anna Bowes, savings expert at financial advice firm The Private Office, said it was \"encouraging\" that fixed savings rates were still competitive, with relatively high interest paid. However, she said that required people being willing to lock their savings into an account and to leave them untouched for the term of the deal, generally between one and five years. A rate cut would guarantee some mortgage-holders lower monthly repayments. Nearly 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that \"tracks\" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact. A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about £29 knocked off their monthly repayments if the Bank rate is reduced by 0.25 percentage points, according to calculations by banking trade body UK Finance. Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC: \"I had a really good rate, then all of a sudden it changed and I got caught out. \"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though.\" Those on standard variable rate mortgages will need to wait for the lender to decide on any changes to the home loan rate if the Bank's base rate changes. Opposition parties claim the new trade agreement means Indian workers will be cheaper for employers to hire. The deal will improve access for UK whisky and cars to the Indian market, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The UK has secured its biggest post-Brexit deal at a tense time for global trade. People who heat their homes with oil have been advised to buy now despite the upcoming summer months.

    "title": "WeightWatchers files for bankruptcy as fat-loss jabs boom",
    "article_text": "WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US as it struggles with debt and fierce competition from fat-loss jabs like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The legal process will see $1.15bn (£860mn) of the 60-year-old diet brand's debt written off while it agrees new terms for paying back its lenders. WeightWatchers said it will remain \"fully operational\" during the process with \"no impact to members\". It follows the meteoric rise in popularity of weight loss injections in what the firm said was a \"rapidly changing weight management landscape\". \"For more than 62 years, WeightWatchers has empowered millions of members to make informed, healthy choices, staying resilient as trends have come and gone,\" said chief executive Tara Comonte. The plans have \"the overwhelming support of our lenders\", she said. In a statement, the brand said its weight-loss programme, \"telehealth\" scheme, and weight-loss workshops will continue. The company vowed that it was \"here to stay\" and that it was not going out of business. It said it had a \"significant amount of debt on its balance sheet, some of it dating back decades\" and that filing for bankruptcy would allow it to restructure its balance sheet. Some customers would get court notifications as part of the process, but they shouldn't need to take any action, the firm added. WeightWatchers began as weekly weight-loss support group meeting with 400 attendees, and eventually gained millions of members across the globe. But demand for its programmes has dropped while the popularity of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound has risen - although the brand does sell  weight medications as part of its programmes. In February Ms Comonte said WeightWatchers could help people looking for \"sustainable\" weight loss after coming off medication. \"At the same time, WeightWatchers is in a period of significant transition as we navigate industry shifts and reposition our business for long-term growth,\" she said at the time. The brand reported a net loss of $346m (£260m) last year, while its subscription revenues fell 5.6% compared with the year before. On Tuesday, it reported that subscription revenues in the first three months of 2025 were down 9.3% - although its clinical business, which includes weight-loss medication, saw revenues up more than 57%. The brand's total liabilities of $1.88bn are greater than the value of its assets. It said it \"expects [the] reorganisation plan to be confirmed in approximately 40 days and to emerge as a publicly traded company.\" WeightWatchers renamed itself \"WW\" in 2018 as it shifted to focus on promoting health beyond weight-loss.

    "title": "Soviet-era spacecraft likely to crash back to Earth",
    "article_text": "Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century. Kosmos 482 was launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus but it never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into four pieces, according to Nasa. One of those pieces, believed to be the lander probe, is expected to re-enter our atmosphere around 10 May and at least part of it could survive the journey without burning up, according to Nasa. There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but even if any of it does survive, 70% of the planet is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage. \"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency. The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne. It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space. The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7° north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world. This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America. Uncontrolled space debris incidents have occurred before. Mr Lemmens explained that the \"re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently,\" happening weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. China's Long March 5B boosterre-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and theTiangong-1 space stationmostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft \"should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries\". This allows for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas, thereby protecting people and property while \"managing the environmental impact of space debris.\"",

    "title": "Ex-police officers acquitted of murder charges in Tyre Nichols beating death",
    "article_text": "Three former officers charged with murder in the fatal beating of a black man that  triggered nationwide protests  against police brutality have been acquitted by a state jury in Memphis, Tennessee. Tyre Nichols, who was beaten during a traffic stop in 2023, died three days after sustaining numerous blows to the head, according to a post-mortem report. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, Jr were found not guilty on all charges on Wednesday, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. All three have been convicted of separate federal charges, and still face long prison sentences. Two other officers involved in the death, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills, have pleaded guilty to federal charges, avoiding trial. Federal charges are ones that violate federal laws enacted by Congress. They are brought by the Department of Justice and usually carry stiff sentences. The five officers, who are all black, were members of the Memphis police department's Scorpion Task Force, a since-disbanded street unit that was tasked with bringing down crime levels in the city. Video footage of the incident shows Mr Nichols being pulled over by police for alleged reckless driving. A scuffle develops and officers use pepper spray and a Taser on Mr Nichols as he breaks free. The five policemen caught up with him about a block away and began to assault him as he cried out for his mother. He died three days later, with a post-mortem examination ruling it a homicide from blunt-force trauma. On Wednesday,  the state jury took over eight hours to reach their verdict, following an emotional nine-day trial. The proceedings took place in Hamilton County, over 300 miles (480km) away from Memphis after the judge ruled that the trial should take place outside of Memphis. Defence lawyers had argued that it would be difficult to find an impartial jury in the city. Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy told reporters that he and the Nichols family were \"disappointed\" and \"devastated\" by the verdict. \"I think we can understand why they'd be outraged by this result given the evidence,\" he said on Wednesday. \"We respect the jury's decision but we obviously very strongly disagree with it.\" Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, issued a statement calling the verdicts \"a devastating miscarriage of justice\". \"The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.\" During the trial, prosecutors said that the officers had become \"overcome by the moment\". \"Nobody is going to call them monsters,\" said prosecutor Paul Hagerman. \"It doesn't take monsters to kill a man.\" Defence lawyers blamed Mr Nichols for running from the officers, and for resisting as they attempted to place him in handcuffs. The verdict in the state trial comes in sharp contrast to the defendants' federal trial in 2024, when the officers were found guilty of witness tampering charges in the case. Haley was also found guilty of deprivation of civil rights and deliberate indifference resulting in serious bodily injury. Bean and Smith each face up to 20 years in jail, while Haley faces a life sentence in the federal trial. Federal sentencing hearings had been delayed until the conclusion of the state trial. The US Justice Department in December 2024 found that the Memphis Police Department regularly used excessive force against black residents. The findings were released after a 17-month investigation. The university asked for police help after protesters occupied part of the main library on Wednesday. The BBC's journalists in Washington DC and Singapore analyse US and China's moves ahead of the negotiation. The order comes after lawyers expressed alarm that the US was planning to deport migrants to the North African country \"immediately\". With the help of artificial intelligence, a man was 'brought back to life' at his killer's sentencing to deliver a victim's statement himself. The prime minister reiterated that Canada \"is not for sale\" during Tuesday's meeting at the White House.",

    "title": "'It felt like the sky turned red', says witness to India strike in Pakistan",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday morning, dozens of people gathered on the perimeter of a sprawling complex in the Pakistani city of Muridke to see the damage for themselves. Overnight, Indian missiles had pounded buildings at this site, which lies not far from the border with India in Pakistan's Punjab region, and just a short drive from the major city of Lahore. No one was being allowed into the complex - but even from a distance as BBC reporters peered through the barbed wire fence surrounding it, the damage was unmistakable. The BBC spoke to people on the ground who witnessed the bombardment first-hand. \"It was the main mosque that got targeted,\" one man said. \"The sky lit up and it felt like the sky turned red.\" Another said: \"A sudden missile appeared and there was a blast. I immediately got out the house. \"I had only reached the mosque near my house when there were three more consecutive blasts. I heard all three, they were really loud.\" When a BBC team arrived in Muridke, security service personnel were closely controlling access to the site. From a road surrounded by dense housing, the BBC's team could see a partially collapsed building and rubble spread over a huge area. Emergency workers were still searching the wreckage for any injured or dead. This complex houses a hospital, school and mosque, while India said it had hit sites linked to what it calls terror organisations - so why was it targeted? The answer appears to lie in its past. Until a few years ago, it was originally used by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based militant group which is designated as a terror organisation by the United Nations. It was later used by Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which observers have described as a front group for LeT. Both groups have been banned by the Pakistani government, which has since taken over the facilities in Muridke. But on Tuesday night, this complex was in the crosshairs of an Indian military which has vowed to respond to the killing of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. India's government says its strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir targeted what it described as terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan's government has denied any links to the Pahalgam attack. One man told us the Muridke complex usually houses children from miles around who come to study at the madrasa, though it was largely evacuated a week ago. Later in the day, camera crews were allowed to access the site and see the damage up close. The roof of one building had crumpled under the force of an explosion. Holes had been torn through the walls of another and a large amount of debris was scattered across the ground. Across this region, people are hoping there is not more debris before long. The Pakistan-based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his relatives have been killed in a missile strike by India. India captain Rohit Sharma announces his retirement from Test cricket at the age of 38. BBC journalists on the ground explain how a day of conflict unfolded.

    "title": "Villagers tell BBC they survived shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir",
    "article_text": "In the village of Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday morning, ruined homes were still smouldering. This small settlement lies close to the Line of Control which separates Indian-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the scene of rapidly escalating tensions in recent weeks that led to strikes from India on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Tuesday night. The streets of Salamabad were almost completely empty the next morning. Locals said the village was struck by Pakistani shelling. Most of the residents had fled the bombardment, leaving chickens pecking in their cages in gardens. Bashir Ahmad, a local shopkeeper who witnessed the destruction, told the BBC that around 02:00 local time (20:30 GMT), \"while we were fast asleep, a loud explosion jolted us awake. Mortar shells had landed near a water dam, and by 03:00 more shells struck several houses, setting them ablaze. The government issued no warning or advisory about the cross-border shelling, and we have no safety bunkers to take shelter in.\" Salamabad is no stranger to this kind of shelling: until 2021, incidents of cross-border fire were reported regularly. However, a ceasefire agreement signed between the militaries of both countries saw the number of attacks sharply decrease. Life returned to normal for most, free of fear - that was, until Wednesday morning. Uncertainty now hangs over the villages scattered along the Line of Control once more. Mr Ahmad estimated that only a handful of Salamabad's 100 or so residents had remained, the rest having left in search of safety from what he described as the most intense shelling in years. In the village, two homes had been torn apart by mortars. Through a hole in the wall of one house, some crockery had remained impossibly upright on a shelf - while everything else around lay shattered or burned. The small homes were no match for the scale of the firepower they encountered overnight. They had been entirely hollowed out by explosions and fire, their tin roofs buckled above them. At a hospital 40km away, Badrudin said he was injured in the shelling, along with this eight-year-old son and sister-in-law. He identified one of the destroyed houses in a picture as his. He said: \"We were all in deep sleep when... a mortar shell landed near our homes. The children were also asleep. The shelling was intense, we somehow managed to flee.\" Badrudin said he had taken out a loan of ₹3 lakh ($3,540 ; £2,653) to build his home in Salamabad. \"Everything is gone now,\" he said. \"We're too afraid to return.\" He continued: \"Rebuilding the house will be incredibly difficult—we need the government to step in and help. We want peace, not war.\" The Pakistan-based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his relatives have been killed in a missile strike by India.

    "title": "Misleading posts obtaining millions of views on X",
    "article_text": "India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir have unleashed a wave of misinformation online, with unrelated videos purporting to be from the strikes gaining millions of views. Dramatic clips debunked by BBC Verify have claimed to show attacks on an Indian army base and an Indian fighter jet shot down in Pakistan. One video, which had more than 400,000 views on X at the time of writing, claiming to show an explosion caused by a Pakistani response was actually from the 2020 Beirut Port explosion in Lebanon. An expert told BBC Verify that in moments of heightened tension or dramatic events, misinformation is more likely to spread and fuel distrust and hostility. \"It's very common to see recycled footage during any significant event, not just conflict,\" Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigations website, said. \"Algorithmic engagement rewards people who post engaging content, not truthful content, and footage of conflict and disasters is particularly engaging, no matter the truth behind it.\" One of the most viral clips, which gained over 3 million views on X in a matter of hours, claimed to show blasts caused by the Indian strikes on Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023. While much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was. One video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the \"Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters\". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month. Elsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting \"Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025\". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3. The Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views. But two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported. Prof Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images \"are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan\". One clip circulated by the Pakistani military itself was later withdrawn by news agencies after it turned out to be from an unrelated event. \"We have jingoists on both sides of the border, and they have a huge platform on Twitter (X). You can see how fake news, as well as some real news, gets amplified, distorted and presented in ways designed to generate hostility, animosity and hatred for the other side.\" The conflict in Kashmir has long attracted a high degree of misinformation online. In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack. Vedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp \"uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict\". \"Lots of this misinformation begins on X,\" she said. \"Eventually this trickles down over time from X to WhatsApp which is the communication tool which is most used in South Asian communities.\" What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? India launched strikes in the early hours of Wednesday - two weeks after a deadly militant attack. The Pakistan-based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his relatives have been killed in a missile strike by India.

    "title": "Militant group chief says relatives killed in India strike",
    "article_text": "The Pakistan-based leader of a militant group has said 10 of his relatives have been killed in a missile strike by India. Masood Azhar, chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), said his older sister and her husband, his nephew and his nephew's wife, his niece and five children from his family were killed in a strike on a mosque in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Tuesday night. Islamabad called the strikes a \"heinous act of aggression\". India said it acted in response to a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago that killed 25 Indians and one Nepali. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack. Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. India said it targeted sites on Tuesday night \"from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed\". Pakistan said six locations have been hit, but denies India's allegations of these being terrorist infrastructure. India saidJeM's headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan, was hit. Video footage of the mosque, assessed by BBC Verify, showed one of its domes had collapsed and extensive damage occurred inside, including two holes in the roof and one in the ground. In Bahawalpur on Wednesday, crowds were mourning those killed in the strikes overnight in funeral processions through the streets. Local residents told the BBC they were angry about the attack, but also worried about Pakistan's potential response. Azhar founded JeM in 1999 upon his release from prison in India. JeM has been linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, the UN Security Council has said. The UNdesignated Azhar as a terroristin 2019. India blamed an attack on Indian parliament in 2001 on JeM - a claim JeM denies. Pakistan banned the group soon after that. JeMsaid it carried out abomb attack in February 2019 that killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistani authorities said India's strikes on Tuesday night killed 31 people.

    "title": "Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir",
    "article_text": "Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for decades Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start? Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains. Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested. Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan. The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. Kashmir profile - Timeline A war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held. In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided. Kashmir is known by some as India's Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapes A second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces. By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it. Within Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, preferring either independence or union with Pakistan instead. Religion is one factor: Jammu and Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority. An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives. India accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies. In 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown. For several years after, the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared. What happened after previous Kashmir militant attacks? In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases. In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight. Tensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades. India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint. Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003. In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks. Pakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014 Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017. Since then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours. Kashmir profile",

    "title": "Pope Francis backed him when he took on a president. Now he's voting in the conclave",
    "article_text": "\"Not even in my wildest imagination did I think this would happen,\" said Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, describing the day he found out that he had been appointed a cardinal. He was speaking to the BBC at his cathedral in Caloocan, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital Manila. He was leaving the next day for Rome to join the conclave, one of three cardinals from the country who will take part in choosing the next pope. \"Normally you would expect archbishops to become cardinals, but I am only a humble bishop of a little diocese where the majority of the people are slum dwellers, urban poor, you know. \"But I thought just maybe, for Pope Francis, it mattered that we had more cardinals who are really grounded there.\" Cardinal David has only been in the job for five months, after his surprise elevation last December. But in some ways he personifies the late pontiff's legacy in his country. Pope Francis had set himself the goal of bringing a Catholic church he believed had lost its common touch, back closer to the people. \"Apu Ambo\", as Cardinal David is affectionately called by his congregation, fits that mission well, having spent his life campaigning for the poor and marginalised. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia, nearly 80% of its 100 million people, and the third-largest in the world. It's one reason why Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is believed to be a papabile, or frontrunner to replace Pope Francis – Tagle was also talked of as a contender in the last papal conclave 12 years ago. The country is considered a bright spot for the Roman Catholic church, where faith is strong, its rituals woven into the fabric of society. Yet the church is facing headwinds there. Its doctrines on divorce and family planning are being challenged by politicians, and newer charismatic churches are winning converts. Pope Francis helped restore morale in the Philippines church, though he did not offer answers to these challenges beyond being more welcoming of diversity and urging the clergy to be more responsive to the needs of the poor. But those on the activist wing of the church did feel encouraged by his support. For Cardinal David that support was critical when he faced his greatest test, during the war on drugs declared by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. He took me to see a plaque he had erected in front of his cathedral in memory of Kian Delos Santos, a 17 year-old boy from his diocese who was gunned down by police in August 2017. Kian was just one of many thousands who died in Duterte's campaign – estimates range from 6,300 to 30,000. What made his case different from most was that the usual police justification, that he was armed and had resisted arrest, was contradicted by eyewitnesses and security camera videos. The police officers had murdered him as he pleaded for his life. Three officers were eventually convicted of the murder, a rare instance of accountability in the drug war. The cardinal is still visibly affected by the hundreds of killings that happened in his diocese – a cluster of low-income neighbourhoods typical of the areas targeted by the police in their notorious tokhang, or \"knock and plead\" raids, against alleged drug dealers and users. \"It was just too much seeing dead bodies left and right,\" Cardinal David says. \"And you know, when I would ask people what they thought, you know, why these people were targeted. They said they're drug users. I said, so what? So what? Who told you that just because people use drugs, they deserve to die?\" He began offering sanctuary to those who feared they were on police hit lists, and then drug-rehabilitation programmes, in the hope this might protect them. He also did something the church as a whole did not do for several months: he openly criticised the drug war as illegal and immoral. As a result, he received many death threats. President Duterte accused him of taking drugs, and talked about decapitating him. The government also filed sedition charges against him, though these were eventually dropped. In those difficult years Cardinal David found he had a powerful backer, in Rome. On a visit to the city in 2019 Pope Francis had taken him aside to give him a special blessing, saying he knew what was happening in his diocese and urging him to stay safe. When they met again in 2023, and he reminded the Pope that he was still alive, he says the pontiff laughed and told him: \"You have not been called to martyrdom yet!\" The role of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines has changed over its 500-year history in the archipelago. It was closely associated with the Spanish conquest, Spanish friars acting as de facto colonial administrators and the church becoming a big landowner. When the US replaced Spain as the colonial ruler in 1898, enforcing a separation of church and state, the political influence of the Catholic clergy waned. But the church retained the allegiance of most of the population; even today, after inroads made by charismatic protestant churches, nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic. Since independence in 1946 the church has had an uneasy relationship with power. Its deep roots and establishment status have made it an influential player, wooed by political factions but also needing their support to protect its interests. Attitudes began changing in the 1970s and 80s, the time when a young Pablo David and many other senior church figures today were studying to enter the priesthood. This was the era of \"liberation theology\", which came out of Latin America and argued that it was the duty of the clergy to fight against the pervasive poverty and injustice all around them. When then-President Marcos, father of the current president of the Philippines, declared martial law in 1972 and began jailing and killing his critics, some priests even went underground to join the armed resistance. But the church hierarchy continued what it called \"critical collaboration\" with the Marcos dictatorship. That changed dramatically in February 1986, when the then-Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime Sin, called on people to come out on the streets and oppose Marcos, sparking the famous \"people power\" uprising which deposed the president. Cardinal Sin would reprise that role in 2001 when he helped overthrow another beleaguered president, Joseph Estrada. After that, though, church leaders were accused of cosying up to Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, partly to gain her support in opposing growing political and social pressure to expand access to family planning and legalise divorce. And they were reluctant to condemn President Duterte's drug war because, despite the appalling human cost, it remained popular with the Filipino public, at least away from the poorer areas where the killings took place. Nearly 40 years after its pivotal role in overthrowing the Marcos regime, the church's influence once again seems to be waning, as it did a century ago. For instance, the Church's fervent opposition could not prevent the Philippines Congress from passing the Reproductive Health Law of 2012 that made family planning easily accessible. This is despite the fact that many Filipino Catholics remain conservative on issues like gender and divorce, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who has written extensively on Catholicism in the Philippines. The church's defeat over family planning, he says, is indicative of its diminished sway over national politics. \"The Catholic church was practically sidelined during the Duterte presidency. When Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos ran for president in 2022, many Catholic leaders and institutions expressed their dissent and even endorsed the opposition. But Marcos still won.\" Many Filipinos welcome this, including, it seems, Cardinal David. \"It is not the business of the church to govern, neither is it the business of government to run a church\", he said. \"But we can complement one another - I cannot say we will be apolitical. So long as we stick to our role as a moral and spiritual leader, we can give guidance, even about political and economic matters.\" Even that more limited view of the church's proper role, though, has run into opposition. Thirteen years after overcoming ecclesiastical objections to the Reproductive Health Bill, the Philippines Congress is now trying to get a bill passed which would legalise divorce, something else the church disagrees with. \"I do not expect them to change their official doctrine, but in my job as a lawmaker, I try to address the problems that Filipinos face, and I don't want them to meddle in my work. It is against our constitution to legislate in favour of any religion,\" says Geraldine Roman, the first transgender member of Congress in the Philippines. A practicing Catholic, she credits Pope Francis with creating a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people with his \"who am I to judge\" statement. \"Nobody misgenders me in my church now,\" she says. But she objects to the Catholic church lobbying against the divorce bill, which she argues will free thousands of Filipino women trapped in abusive marriages. \"The church is free to try to indoctrinate Catholics into sticking it out in their marriages. But in the end, it is the decision of the couple, and not even the church can meddle in that decision.\" Other challenges include a congregation which is increasingly disengaged. While the number of Roman Catholics has fallen only slightly in the past three decades, the number attending mass at least once a week has dropped by half, to just over one third of those surveyed recently. Then there are the various scandals associated with the Catholic church, especially the sexual abuse of minors, which critics say Pope Francis, while he did tackle the issue, did not do enough to address. Cardinal David recalled how President Duterte \"loved to wave\" a book called \"Altar of Secrets\", an expose of alleged scandals in the Filipino church, and how he would say, \"oh, those hypocrites. Don't listen to them. They don't practice what they what they preach. They are abusers. I must say some people swallowed it hook, line and sinker. So I am not surprised that our moral credibility has been challenged.\" But, he adds, defensiveness is not the way the Church can win back its credibility. \"It should be humility. As Pope Francis advised, dare to be vulnerable. Dare to be criticised. Try not to remain on that pedestal where people cannot reach you, show your humanity.\" Experts from India and Pakistan weigh in on what’s next -  and how this clash differs from past conflicts. The BBC spoke to eyewitnesses in both Indian and Pakistan administered Kashmir. The building, which is located in a densely-populated area, remains cordoned off by security forces. The secretive process will get underway at the Vatican to find a new leader of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",

    "title": "Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
    "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision will be made by 133 cardinals who begin meeting in conclave from 16:30 (14:30GMT) in the 15th Century Sistine Chapel. The cardinals, all under 80, will debate and then vote for their preferred candidate until a single name secures the support of two-thirds of them. Their choice could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics, and it is harder than ever to predict who it will be. With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, most are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective. For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\". Could the cardinals elect an African, an Asian or even an American pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration? Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis' potential successor. Nationality: Italian Age: 70 Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration. Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner. He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength. But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\". Catholic watchdog organisation Bishop Accountability has accused Cardinal Parolin of \"suppression of abuse information\" being passed to secular authorities in his role as secretary of state. The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\" Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now. Nationality: Filipino Age: 67 Could the next pope come from Asia? Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law. The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle. He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope. He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia. But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect. The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected. Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\" Although he did raise concerns about President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war deaths, critics suggest he could have been far more vocal on the issue. Some, including Philippines-based whistleblower priest, Father Shay Cullen, have criticised Tagle's handling of abuse perpetrators. Nationality: American Age: 69 Could the papacy go to an American for the first time? Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role. Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops. He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese. Nationality: Ghanaian Age: 76 If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years. He has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013. Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\". He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II. Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting. A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence. Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana. In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence. In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised. Nationality: Congolese Age: 65 It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis. He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\". Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church. But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\" Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world. Nationality: Hungarian Age: 72 A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016. He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church. The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate. Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis' two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict. His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking. Nationality: Maltese Age: 68 If cardinals are looking for a candidate who will advance one of Pope Francis' key goals – to place more power in the hands of rank-and-file Catholics – they may look to Cardinal Grech. Pope Francis made him secretary general of the Synod of Bishops in 2019. In that role Cardinal Grech became instrumental in helping set in motion the Pope's vision of feeding the opinions of individual believers around the world into the Church's governance. Like the Pope he worked closely with, Grech is known to have been on a journey in regards to the way he views social issues. He has changed his tone on homosexuality over the past decade, declaring that Francis' endorsement of same-sex civil unions was a \"storm in a teacup\". Nationality: Italian Age: 69 The Archbishop of Bologna grew up in Rome and soon became part of the Sant'Egidio Community, a charity that focuses on the poor and the marginalised. He helped mediate the end of Mozambique's 15-year civil war in 1990, and took part in further mediation efforts in Guatemala and Burundi. Made a cardinal in 2019, he was chosen by Pope Francis - ahead of his secretary of state Pietro Parolin - to act as envoy after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He travelled to Kyiv and Moscow and sought the release of 19,000 Ukrainian children taken to Russia. He wrote the introduction to a 2018 book that called on the Church to improve its relationship with LGBT Catholics. His closeness to Francis may ultimately count against him in the conclave. Nationality: American Age: 73 Born in Detroit as the eldest of 13 children, the Archbishop of Newark is well known and popular among cardinals. Although he is considered a staunch supporter of Francis' views on offering a more open and welcoming Church, he is seen as a unifying figure. He has in the past deplored political polarisation in the US, warning against divisions in the Church too. In recent years he has said the Church should welcome same-sex couples and said he does not see a \"compelling theological reason why the Pope couldn't name a woman cardinal\". Appointed by Pope Benedict as deputy head of the Vatican office that works with religious orders and their congregations, Tobin also led a religious congregation called the Redemptorists. He was named as archbishop in Indianapolis, before Francis made him cardinal. Nationality: Italian Age: 83 Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected. The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal. His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\". Francis' words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope. Nationality: German Age: 71 Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too. The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican. He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching. But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis. Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church. Nationality: Italian Age: 60 Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since. Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\". Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction. Nationality: Canadian Age: 80 Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013. For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy. As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances. Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests. He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\". Nationality: Guinean Age: 79 Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis' reformist leanings. The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea. He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites. While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals. Nationality: French Age: 66 Not since Gregory XI died in 1378 has there been a French pope. Although born under French colonial rule in Algeria, Aveline grew up in France's second city Marseille, where he later became archbishop. He has been outspoken on avoiding \"criminalisation of immigrants as the cause of all evil\", chiming very much with Francis' focus on migrants. Aveline also set up an Institute of Science and Theology of Religions in Marseille and promoted dialogue with Islam and Judaism. He has spoken out against one of Marseille's biggest problems, drug trafficking networks. Considered close to Francis, two years ago he brought the Pope to Marseille for a brief visit. Although he speaks Arabic, one potential drawback is that he does not speak fluent Italian. Nationality: Myanmar Age: 76 Another Asian cardinal with strong credentials for the papacy, Bo was brought up in a large family by his mother in a country where only 1.3% of the population are Catholics. Born in the northern Sagaing region, Cardinal Bo has seen for himself the conflict that has ravaged Myanmar. He led Asia's bishops for two terms and was considered close to Francis, who named him as Myanmar's first cardinal and became the first pope to visit the country in 2017. He spoke out over the plight of the Rohingya Muslims who were forced to flee the military in Rakhine state, and said Myanmar should celebrate its diversity. Nationality: Filipino Age: 66 Among the last cardinals appointed by Pope Francis in December 2024, David is widely known for his integrity and for speaking out against abuses during former President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs in the Philippines. His actions led to death threats. Widely known as Cardinal Ambo, he was ordained as a priest aged 24 and became known for focusing on the poor, insisting on the Church's involvement in social issues. Francis made him bishop of Kalookan in 2015, and he was appointed by Asian bishops to head a commission for \"synodality\", which he said was Francis' biggest contribution, so that the Church would become \"more inclusive\" and less inward-looking. He attended the same Jesuit-led school as Luis Antonio Tagle in the late 1970s. Nationality: Canadian Age: 78 Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world. Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two. He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya. Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development. During the pre-conclave period he has warned against calls for \"unity\" from traditionalist cardinals, suggesting what they really mean is a \"reversal\" of reforms  introduced by Pope Francis. Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession. After a lengthy wait, black smoke emerged from the Sistine Chapel's chimney at around 9pm local time. The signal means more voting will take place tomorrow as a new pope has not yet been chosen. BBC News archive footage tells the extraordinary story of the smoke signal confusion of the 1958 Conclave. The secretive process will get underway at the Vatican to find a new leader of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis's efforts to shake up the workings of the Church should be built on by the next pope, according to some - but his critics are less convinced",

    "title": "'This will be the work of years': The medics identifying remains from Syria's mass graves",
    "article_text": "\"These,\" says Dr Anas al-Hourani, \"are from a mixed mass grave.\" The head of the newly-opened Syrian Identification Centre is standing next to two tables, covered in femurs. There are 32 of the human thigh bones on each laminated white tablecloth. They have been neatly aligned and numbered. Sorting is the first task for this new link in the long chain from crime to justice in Syria. A \"mixed mass grave\" means that corpses were thrown one on top of another. The chances are, these bones belong to some of the hundreds of thousands believed to have been killed by the regimes of the ousted president Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, who together ruled Syria for more than five decades. If so, says Dr al-Hourani, they were among the more recent victims: they died no more than a year ago. Dr al-Hourani is a forensic odontologist: teeth can tell you so much more about a body, he says, at least when it comes to identifying who the person was. But with a femur the lab workers in the basement of this squat grey office building in Damascus can begin the task: they can learn the height, the sex, the age, what sort of job they had; they might also be able to see whether the victim was tortured. The gold standard in identification is of course DNA analysis. But, he says, there is just one DNA testing centre in Syria. Many were destroyed during the country's civil war. And \"because of sanctions, a lot of the precursor chemicals that we need for the tests are currently not available\". They've also been informed that \"parts of the instruments could be used for aviation and so for military purposes\". In other words, they could be deemed \"dual use\", and so proscribed by many Western countries from export to Syria. Add to that, the cost: $250 (£187) for a single test. And, says Dr al-Hourani, \"in a mixed mass grave, you have to do about 20 tests to gather all the parts of one body\". The lab relies entirely on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The new government of Islamist rebels-turned-rulers says that what they call \"transitional justice\" is one of their priorities. Many Syrians who have lost relatives, and lost all trace of them, have told the BBC that they remain unimpressed and frustrated: they want to see more effort from the people who finallychased Bashar al-Assad from powerlast December after 13 years of war. During those long years of conflict, hundreds of thousands were killed, and millions displaced. And, by one estimate, more than 130,000 people were forcibly disappeared. At the current rate, it can take months to identify just one victim from a mixed mass grave. \"This,\" says Dr al-Hourani, \"will be the work of many, many years.\" Eleven of those \"mixed mass graves\" are slung around a beautiful, barren hilltop outside Damascus. The BBC are the first international media to see this site. The graves are quite visible now. In the years since they were dug, their surface has sunk into the dry, stony earth. Accompanying us is Hussein Alawi al-Manfi, or Abu Ali, as he also calls himself. He was a driver in the Syrian military. \"My cargo,\" says Abu Ali, \"was human bodies.\" This compact man with a salt and pepper beard was tracked down thanks to the tireless investigative work of Mouaz Mustafa, the Syrian-American executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based advocacy group. He had persuaded Abu Ali to join us, to bear witness to what Mouaz calls \"the worst crimes of the 21st Century\". Abu Ali transported lorry loads of corpses to multiple sites for more than 10 years. At this location, he came, on average, twice a week for roughly two years at the start of the demonstrations and then the war, between 2011 and 2013. The routine was always the same. He'd head to a military or security installation. \"I had a 16m (52ft) trailer. It wasn't always filled to the brim. But I'd have, I guess, an average of 150 to 200 bodies in each load.\" Of his cargo, he says he is convinced they were civilians. Their bodies were \"mangled and tortured\". The only identification he could see were numbers written on the cadaver or stuck to the chest or forehead. The numbers identified where they had died. There were a lot, he said, from \"215\" - a notorious military intelligence detention centre in Damascus known as \"Branch 215\". It is a place we will re-visit in this story. Abu Ali's trailer did not have a hydraulic lift to tip and dump his load. When he backed up to a trench, soldiers would pull the bodies into the hole one after another. Then a front-loader tractor would \"flatten them out, compress them in, fill in the grave.\" Three men with weathered faces from a neighbouring village have arrived. They corroborate the story of the regular visits by military lorries to this remote spot. And as for the man behind the wheel: how could he do this for week after week, year after year? What was he telling himself each time he climbed into his cab? Abu Ali says he learned to be a mute servant of the state. \"You can't say anything good or bad.\" As the soldiers dumped the corpses into the freshly excavated pits, \"I would just walk away and look at the stars. Or look down towards Damascus.\" Damascus is where Malak Aoude has recently returned, after years as a refugee in Turkey. Syria may have been freed of the chokehold of the Assads' dynastic dictatorship. Malak is still serving a life sentence. For the past 13 years, she has been locked into a daily routine of pain and longing. It was 2012, a year after some of the people of Syria had dared to raise a protest against their president, that her two boys were disappeared. Mohammed was still a teenager when he was conscripted into Assad's army, as the demonstrations spread and the regime's deadly crackdown sparked a full-blown war. He hated what he was seeing, his mother says. Mohammed started absconding, and even went on the demos himself. But he was tracked down. \"They broke his arms and beat his back,\" says his mother. \"He spent three days unconscious in hospital.\" Mohammed went AWOL again. \"I reported him missing,\" says Malak. \"But I was hiding him.\" In May 2012, 19-year-old's Mohammed luck ran out. He was caught along with a group of friends. They were shot. Malak says there was no formal notification. But she has always assumed he was killed. Six months later, Mohammed's younger brother Maher was dragged from school by officers. It was Maher's second arrest. He'd gone to the protests in 2011, aged 14. That had led to his first arrest. When he was let out of detention, a month later, he was in his underwear, covered, says his mother, in cigarette burns, wounds and lice. \"He was terrified.\" Malak thinks Maher was disappeared from school in 2012 because the authorities had found that she had been hiding his older brother. Now, for the first time in 13 years, Malak returns to that school, desperate to get any clue about what happened to Maher. The new headteacher produces a couple of battered red ledgers. Malak traces the rows of names with her finger, and then finds her son's name. December 2012, the record flatly states: Maher has been excluded from school because he has failed to turn up for lessons for two weeks. There is no explanation that it is the state which has disappeared him. There is something else, though: a folder with Maher's school records has been found. Its cover is adorned with a photograph of a wise Bashar al-Assad, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. Malak picks up a pen from the headteacher's desk and scribbles over the photo. Six months ago, that gesture could have been lethal. For years, the only scraps Malak had to cling to were two men who say they saw Maher in \"Branch 215\" - that same military detention centre which produced so many corpses for Abu Ali to transport. One of the witnesses told Malak that her boy had told him something about his parents that, his mother says, only he could have known. It was definitely him. \"He asked this man to tell me he was doing fine.\" Malak heaves and leaks tears, stuffs a tattered tissue into the corners of her eyes. For Malak, like so many Syrians, the fall of Assad was not just a day of joy, but of hope. \"I thought there was a 90% chance Maher would walk out of prison. I was waiting for him.\" But she has not even been able to find her son's name on the prison lists. And so the throb of pain continues to course through her. \"I feel lost and confused,\" she says. Her own younger brother, Mahmoud, had been killed by a tank firing on civilians in 2013. \"At least he had a funeral.\" Israel's PM says it will \"not allow any threat\" to the minority in Syria after sectarian clashes in which dozens were killed. The sectarian violence involving Islamist factions, security forces and Druze gunmen is another sign of the fragile security situation. The strikes were south of Damascus, where Syrian security forces say they are battling gunmen from the religious minority. Ghayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election. Restrictions are also being eased on the financial services and energy sectors to help investment.",

    "title": "'Why would we play Putin's game?': Ukrainians on Russia's proposed three-day ceasefire",
    "article_text": "Russia is expected to begin a self-declared three-day pause in fighting against Ukraine on Wednesday night, in a move derided by many Ukrainians and described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as little more than a \"theatrical show\". Russia's Vladimir Putin proposed the three-day ceasefire to coincide with the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe – a public holiday in Russia on Friday known as Victory Day. But in doing so Putin has rejected a much more substantial proposal from the Trump administration for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations – a proposal that was accepted by Ukraine. Zelensky has in turn rejected Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire and said that Ukraine will not guarantee the safety of a celebratory military parade in Moscow's Red Square on 9 May. Rosenberg:Russians remember WW2 with victory on their minds The Russian proposal has been met with widespread cynicism in Ukraine, where polls consistently suggest that about 95% of the population distrusts Russia. \"I don't believe there will be any ceasefire,\" said Tetyana Kondratenko, 42, a shopkeeper in Khotin Village in Sumy, a heavily bombarded region about six miles (10km) from the Russian border. \"Lately the shelling has only intensified, for half the day today we have heard boom after boom,\" Ms Kondratenko said in a phone interview. Zelensky was right to reject the proposal \"because you know how they operate, like what happened at Easter\", she added, referring to the Russians. \"They announced a ceasefire, then used it to bring in more equipment and started attacking again. What kind of ceasefire is that?\" Last month, around Easter, Russia proposed a similar 30-hour cessation in hostilities but was later accused by Ukraine of violating its own suggested truce nearly 3,000 times. On that occasion, rather than rejecting the proposal outright, Ukraine said it would mirror Russia's actions. A senior Ukrainian military officer told the BBC at the time that frontline units received an order to stop firing at Russian positions, but to record evidence of Russian violations and return fire if needed. By Wednesday Ukrainian officials had not said categorically whether they would adjust their military action over the three-day period. Asked if Ukrainian forces planned to continue military operations, a source in the presidential office told the BBC: \"We'll see.\" From Novosofiivka village, in the very badly hit region of Zaporizhzhia, Antonina Sienina, 35, said that any ceasefire worth agreeing to should come with \"solid guarantees\" for Ukraine's safety and sovereignty – not something included in Putin's plan for the next three days. But Ms Sienina had mixed feelings. Her parents were killed in a Russian strike, her brother has been wounded, and her village has been pounded, so \"maybe it wasn't right to refuse\" the three-day proposal, she added. \"Because honestly, we would be happy even for just one day without explosions. Just to take the kids somewhere, to a shopping mall, to a playground, to some attractions,\" she said. \"We dream of the war being over, or at least a temporary ceasefire, because my children are exhausted. The nerves, the medications, the sleepless nights. It's too much.\" Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv were kept awake in the early hours of Wednesday morning by Russian drone and missile strikes on the city. A ballistic missile was successfully shot down by air defence systems but a drone hit a block of flats, killing a mother and her son and injuring at least six more, including a child. The mayor of Moscow said on Wednesday that Russian air defences had downed 14 Ukrainian drones overnight. The Kremlin said that the drone attacks had no bearing on its plans to pause fighting for three days. The pause is not being taken seriously in Ukraine, for the most part. It has been greeted instead as more of a propaganda exercise. Pavlo Klimkin, the former foreign minister of Ukraine, told the BBC it was simply another Russian show of force. \"This is all about Russia framing the agenda on its own terms,\" Klimkin said. \"It has nothing to do with a real ceasefire. It is all about messaging – messaging internally, messaging to the US, messaging to Europe to say that we, Russia, are in control.\" Talks directed at a substantial ceasefire process began back in February, with US President Donald Trump sending officials to negotiate separately with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine has since agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, Russia has not. The months since have been a deadly period in the war. Russia has intensively targeted Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles, killing 19 people including nine children last month in a strike on a playground in Kryvyi Rih and 35 people a week later in an Easter strike on the city of Sumy. According to the UN, at least 848 civilians were killed between 1 and 24 April - a 46% increase on the same period last year. The level of civilian deaths meant that any ceasefire should be accepted, even on Russian terms, said Oleksii Kamchatnyi, 38, a scientist living in Kyiv. \"It is about saving lives,\" Mr Kamchatnyi said. \"I'm originally from Donbas, from Pokrovsk. I managed to evacuate my mother but my father stayed there. I haven't had any contact with him since 9 March.\" Still, Mr Kamchatnyi supported the temporary ceasefire, he said, \"even if it means giving up territory.\" Ukrainian polling suggests that a majority of the public would accept the idea of ceding some control of territory seized by the Russians during the full-scale invasion, though not surrendering formal sovereignty over the land, according to Anton Grushetsky, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. \"There is for certainly a lot of fatigue and there is a lot of desire to have a stable peace in Ukraine,\" Mr Grushetsky said. But based on previous polling, the majority of Ukrainians would likely view the proposed three-day ceasefire as \"either a trap or simply a ploy to avoid attacks on Moscow during the holiday\", he added. There is also suspicion among many in Ukraine that the ceasefire proposal is simply a ploy by Russia to move its forces to strategic places on the battlefield, make reinforcements where needed, and prepare for offensives. Ukraine had already made clear that it was ready for a full, unconditional ceasefire, and had no obligation to take part in Russia's agenda, said Mykhailo Samus, a Ukrainian military analyst and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network. \"Why would we play Putin's game? We are ready for a real ceasefire,\" Mr Samus said. \"If he wants to organise a parade to show that he is a great leader, that is his business.\" Daria Mitiuk contributed to this report. In his first interview since leaving office, the 82-year-old criticises his successor's handling of the war and is challenged on his own record. 'World Cup can be incentive for Russia to end war', says Trump Russia is gearing up to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe. The European Union vowed to end energy relations with Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Moscow's annual Victory Day commemorations coincide this year with a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine, ordered by Putin.",

    "title": "'Unforgettable day': The wedding with almost 100 bridesmaids",
    "article_text": "There are traditional weddings and then there are people who like to add their own twist to their big day. Jack McGowan, originally from Aberdeen in Scotland, and his wife Kathryn from Hillsborough, Northern Ireland, decided two or three bridesmaids would not meet the mark for the special occasion. The newly-wed couple who tied the knot last week with 95 bridesmaids said it was \"an absolutely unforgettable day\". The average number of bridesmaids for a wedding in the UK is about three to five. Ms McGowan said as soon as the couple got engaged they were debating how many bridesmaids was too many. \"I was thinking and thinking about how it was going to work and I thought in my head, what's the biggest number of bridesmaids I could have?\" She said the couple discussed having seven or eight, which then raised to nine or 10, but they eventually landed on 95. The wedding took place in Larchfield estate near Annahilt, County Down, in Northern Ireland. They had about 250 guests altogether, meaning 38% of the guests donned a bridesmaid dress. The women and girls shared more than a colour scheme - with many being pupils of Kathryn's dance school. \"All my dancers and my friends that have been in my life for a long time, they're still very much a massive part of my life. \"It was just a very, very easy decision in the end,\" she said. Their ages ranged from six to 40 years of age. Jack McGowan said he was \"weirdly not shocked\" by the numbers. He said he helps out with the organisation of some dance events and was familiar with all the girls. \"I'm used to these big events with lots and lots of our dancers, so I strangely expected, nothing less,\" he said. Women dominated the day as Jack had only eight groomsmen. Traditionally, the groomsmen will share a dance with the bridesmaids. Speaking onBBC Radio Ulster's, The Nolan Showprogramme, Jack said, \"the best man is still dancing today.\" The couple said the day ran smoothly despite the large numbers. \"The girls all know how to get in formation and organise themselves very quickly,\" Kathryn said. She said the girls separated into two lines along the aisle. \"They had it all organised before I got there, so I didn't have to do very much. \"I definitely made the right decision,\" she said. \"It was really good when we were getting the photos, the older girls organised the younger ones and they were all standing perfectly arranged ready for me to bounce into the middle.\" Kathryn said the bridesmaids chose their own dresses once she planned a colour scheme. \"It was really interesting to see all their different styles and personalities showing through.\" The pair said they were very happy with how the day went. \"It was absolutely brilliant,\" Jack added. \"It was better than we ever imagined, there was dancing and piping all day long.\" Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletterhighlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.

    "title": "What is the infected blood scandal?",
    "article_text": "Government officials have been called to give evidence to a special session of the infected blood inquiry amid \"grave concerns\" about the speed of compensation payments. The inquiry's chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, made the unusual decision to take fresh evidence nearly a year after his final report into the scandal. More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. As many as 140,000 bereaved parents, children and siblings of victims may also be able to claim compensation in their own right. Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders -who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly.,external People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents. But entire batches were contaminated with deadly viruses. After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders went on to develop both HIV and hepatitis C,including 380 children. This video can not be played Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products. About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners. Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991. The inquiry estimates that between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C. In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died. The victims, families and what happened I lost mum, dad and sister to HIV in blood scandal The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Announcing its findings in May 2024,the inquiry said victims had been failed \"not once, but repeatedly\",and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of \"downright deception\", including the destruction of documents. He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected. \"This disaster was not an accident,\" said Sir Brian. \"The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first.\" The Inquiry report,externalsaid: too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986 blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982 there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards In October 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government had set aside Â£11.8bn to pay compensation to victims. It set up an independent arms-length body calledthe Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA),externalto administer payments. Both those infected by contaminated blood products andthose affected by the scandal - such as partners, parents, children and siblings -can claim compensation for the impact on their lives. Payments are exempt from tax, and do not affect benefits. The final amounts for individuals are assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss. Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024,the then-Conservative government suggested how much people might receive,external: a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.6m those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between Â£665,000 and Â£810,000 the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about Â£110,000, while a child could get Â£55,000 Compensation payments will go to the estateof infected people who have died. But if a partner or relative who might be entitled to a payment has died, their estate will not receive any money. In late 2022, following advice from the inquiry, the Conservative government made interim payments of Â£100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. A second interim payment of Â£210,000 was paid to those infected in June 2024. In October 2024, the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for Â£100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed. The IBCA said, as of 6 May: 677 people have been invited to claim final compensation 160 compensation payments totalling Â£150.2m have been offered 106 compensation payments totalling Â£96.6m have been made An IBCA spokesman said its priority remained \"paying as many people as soon as possible\". It plans to ask an extra 100 individuals to start their claims every week from May 2025. It has also announced thatit would start to prioritise payments to those who had less than 12 months left to live,externaldue to any medical condition. Victims and their relatives have criticised the time taken to make payments, and what they say is a lack of transparency about the claims process. On 9 AprilSir Brian said he would re-open the inquiry on 7 and 8 May to take evidence about the speed of compensation payments. Government officials, including the cabinet office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, will give evidence under oath and the sessions will be filmed and streamed online. Sir Brian said: \"The decision to hold hearings has not been taken lightly. It reflects the gravity of concerns expressed consistently and repeatedly to the inquiry. \"People infected and affected do not have time on their side.\" In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors. If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated. UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified. Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983 By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidencechildren were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments- often, without their family's consent. As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a linerobustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarkewhen he appeared before the inquiry. This video can not be played Carolyn Challis: \"I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness\" Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII,which minimised HIV infections.,external Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available. He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK. In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there maybe grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter,externalin the UK. Infected Blood inquiry",

    "title": "Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are'",
    "article_text": "In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the \"leader of the free world\" little over 100 days ago. Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power – the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor. Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were \"Trump's stock market\" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on \"Biden's stock market\". Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their successors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too. In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \"I found it beneath America, the way that took place,\" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. \"And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here? \"What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation.\" After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from. But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades. Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died \"knew – beyond any doubt – that there are things worth fighting and dying for\". I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a \"grave concern\" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying. \"I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,\" he argues. \"We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up.\" Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being \"ripped off\" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that  America is \"bailing out\" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is \"free-loading\". Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make \"to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power\" a \"sacred obligation\". \"I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,\" Biden says. Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger.  \"We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all. \"I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence.\" I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president. He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an \"at times addled old man\" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that \"We finally beat Medicare!\". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after. Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90. I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign. \"I don't think it would have mattered,\" he says. \"We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded. \"What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,\" he continues. \"And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision.\" One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance? \"No, I think it was the right decision.\" He pauses. \"I think that… Well, it was just a difficult decision.\" Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: \"We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two.\" Today, he expands on this: \"Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?\" \"Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it.\" Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that \"nobody's king\" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president. He chooses his reply carefully. \"He's not behaving like a Republican president,\" he says. Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, \"because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about\". President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine. Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end. \"It is modern day appeasement,\" Biden says of Trump's approach. Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as \"part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that […] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish.\" He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia. Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered. When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would \"not be necessary,\" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his \"logical conclusion\". I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win. \"We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,\" Biden argues. \"And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again.\" He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of \"World War Three, with nuclear powers,\" adding: \"And we did avoid it. \"What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?\" he continues. \"Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette.\" Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance - as the last living President born during World War Two - is clearly undiminished. When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First. The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted. \"Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,\" Biden says. \"Every one's going to be challenged. \"We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that.\" This interview broadcasts onBBC Radio 4's Todayon 7 May. You can hear it later on BBC Sounds.

    "title": "Final five designs revealed for Queen Elizabeth memorial",
    "article_text": "A final shortlist of five proposed designs for the national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II has been revealed by the government. The memorial, commemorating the life of Britain's longest-reigning monarch who died in September 2022, will be built in St James's Park in central London. Illustrations of the design concepts are being put online by the Cabinet Office and the public will be invited tohave their say about the ideasfor the major new monument. Three of the five proposed designs feature the late Queen riding a horse, reflecting her lifelong enthusiasm for equestrianism. There are other features proposed by the competing teams of artists and architects, such as incorporating recordings of the late Queen's voice into a memorial, and large sculptures of lilies around a figure of the late Queen. One of the proposed designs uses an oak tree to represent Queen Elizabeth's strength and resilience. Another suggests building symbolic pathways and a pair of bridges over the lake in the park. The winning entry will be chosen later this year, but there is no date yet set for when the finished memorial will be unveiled. The construction budget will be between £23m and £46m, depending on the selected design, says the Cabinet Office. The public will get a chance to say whether they want a more traditional representation of the late Queen, or something more experimental, in what will become an important London landmark. The new memorial will be placed not too far from statues of the late Queen's parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Also nearby is the memorial to Queen Victoria outside Buckingham Palace. The location for the monument will be a section of St James's Park close to the Mall and across to a bridge over a lake in the park. The entries include plans to landscape and redesign this area and the construction process is expected to mean replacing the current bridge. The memorial scheme will also provide community projects and facilities around the country. This will follow in the tradition of legacy schemes such as the King George V Playing Fields, which saw almost 500 sports grounds opened in memory of the monarch who died in 1936. Many of those playing fields are still in use, dotted around the country. The public is being encouraged to contribute ideas about the memorial and to give feedback on the shortlisted designs. \"We want public engagement, we want the public to comment on these proposals, because we want them to feel part of it,\" said Baroness Amos, a member of the committee which will select the design to be built. \"So much of what the late Queen was about was meeting people and engaging with them,\" she said. Baroness Amos, a former leader of the House of Lords, said the memorial should be a fitting tribute to the late Queen, who died at the age of 96 after seven decades on the throne. \"This is about an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary reign, about her commitment to public service, her duty, her commitment to the community, to the nation and the Commonwealth,\" she said.

    "title": "Denmark summons US ambassador over Greenland spying report",
    "article_text": "Denmark's foreign minister says he will summon the US ambassador to address a report that Washington's spy agencies have been told to focus on Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to take over the island. \"It worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,\" Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, responding to the report inThe Wall Street Journal. According to the newspaper, US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on the semi-autonomous country's independence movement, and American goals to extract mineral resources there. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of attempts to \"undermine\" President Trump \"by politicizing and leaking classified information\". While not denying the report, she accused the newspaper of \"breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy\". Rasmussen, who was attending an EU ministers meeting in Warsaw, said the report was \"somewhat disturbing\". \"We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information,\" Rasmussen said. \"It doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. That worries me.\" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had \"naturally\" taken note of US interest in Greenland. Based on international interest in Greenland in general, the agency said, there was an increased espionage threat against it and Denmark. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to take control of Greenland, most recently telling NBC News on Sunday that he had not ruled out using military force to seize the arctic island. \"I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,\" he said. \"We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.\" During a speech to Congress in March, Trump told US lawmakers that \"one way or the other, we're going to get it.\" Danish officials also condemned a visit to Greenland by Vice-President JD Vance in March. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said the visit to a remote US military base \"completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population\". Former President Joe Biden,speaking to BBC News in his first interview since leaving officein January, condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal, to acquire Greenland and to make Canada the 51st state. \"What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,\" Biden told the BBC's Nick Robinson. \"We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.\" Greenland, the world's largest island, has been controlled by Denmark for about 300 years. The island governs its own domestic affairs, but foreign and defence policy decisions are made in Copenhagen. The US has long had a security interest in the island. It has had a military base there since World War Two, and Trump may also have an interest in the rare earth minerals that could be mined. Polls show that thevast majority of Greenlanders want to become independentfrom Denmark but do not wish to become part of the US. The university asked for police help after protesters occupied part of the main library on Wednesday. The BBC's journalists in Washington DC and Singapore analyse US and China's moves ahead of the negotiation. The order comes after lawyers expressed alarm that the US was planning to deport migrants to the North African country \"immediately\". With the help of artificial intelligence, a man was 'brought back to life' at his killer's sentencing to deliver a victim's statement himself.

    "title": "More blood victims will die without compensation, minister says",
    "article_text": "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said. The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s. Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published. \"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said. \"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\" Afinal report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time. The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up. Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed. The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside £11.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members,but the latest figures showless than 1% of that total, some £97m, has been paid out to date. Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years. Eleven victims and their representatives gave evidence in an emotional panel session in front of an audience of around 300 people in Westminster. Andrew Evans, chair of the campaign group Tainted Blood, told the hearing many victims and their families had been left feeling \"betrayed and disappointed\". \"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said. \"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\" Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\". Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\" \"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added. Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate. But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal – a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example – for the separate impact on their lives. And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on. In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\". The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029. Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards. \"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said. \"I've never been anything but clear they are absolute backstops and I expect these payments to speed up [in the future].\" Casey Means, an ally of Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, gained prominence on conservative podcasts. It is hoped trial results will give doctors more confidence in facilitating natural births. The University of Worcester has been awarded £2.2m in funding to look at the provision in rural areas. A HealthWatch Cornwall report says the county is experiencing staff shortages and long wait times. Sir Rob Behrens says it was a \"disgrace\" how mental health services failed two vulnerable men.",

    "title": "Labour MPs signal rebellion over welfare cuts",
    "article_text": "A number of Labour MPs have said they will vote against the government's proposed cuts to disability benefits. Nine Labour MPs voiced concern over the government's plans to make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments during a debate on Wednesday. Calls to rethink the benefits cuts, as well as other policies, have been growing after Labour lost 187 council seats during the local election last week. Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms told the MPs the goal of the reforms was to make sure the welfare system was \"financially sustainable in the long term\". In March,the government announceda major welfare shake-up aimed at saving money and supporting people who can work to find jobs. Ministers said changes to a key disability benefit called personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC) would save around £5bn a year by the end of 2030 and get more people into work. Overall, the government spends £65bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to £100bn by 2029. The government estimated that 3.2 million families could be worse off as a result of the reforms, while 3.8 million families will be better off by 2030. The government is expected to pass a new law to make the welfare changes, giving MPs a chance to vote on the plans. Speaking during the debate in Westminster Hall, Diane Abbott, the Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said the government was \"making a conscious choice to balance its books on the backs of people on welfare\". Ian Byrne, who represents Liverpool West Derby, said he would \"swim through vomit to vote against\" proposed welfare changes. Labour MPs Richard Burgon, Rachael Maskell, Andy McDonald, Cat Eccles, Nadia Whittome, Imran Hussain, Steve Witherden and Ian Lavery also said they would vote against the government's proposals. They were joined by John McDonnell, an independent MP for Hayes and Harlington who had the whip removed by Labour for rebelling against the government over the two-child benefit cap. A number of other Labour MPs have also indicated they are minded to oppose the benefits cuts in comments at events, in articles for local papers, as well as on social media. Disability minister Sir Stephen Timms defended the proposals, saying it was not sustainable for welfare spending to rise at the current rate. \"The current system produces poor employment outcomes, high economic inactivity, low living standards, high costs to the taxpayer. It needs to change,\" he said. \"We want a more proactive, pro-work system that supports people better and supports the economy as well.\" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has come under increasing pressure to change course on some policy decisions. At Prime Minister Questions on Wednesday,Sir Keir defended the decisionto axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. It came after a group of about 45 Labour MPs representing seats in northern England and the Midlands joined those urging the government to rethink the move. The planned changes to disability benefits could become the next big political flashpoint, with legislation likely to be brought to the House of Commons in June. The BBC has been toldsome potential rebels are being assured they won't lose the party whip if they abstain – or make themselves scarce – when the vote comes. The government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party. Senior minister Pat McFadden said \"we have to win the fight for Britain's future\" while speaking at the Parliamentary Labour Party's first gathering since the local elections, party sources said. The Cabinet Office minister criticised Reform UK, including the new mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who said her party would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\" in her victory speech. McFadden said: \"Labour is always at its best when we look to the future. This is the fight of our lives, this is the generational fight in this new political era. \"I want to tell you we have to take on this new fight for the future - and we have to win.\"",

    "article_text": "Liam Payne left behind money, property and possessions worth more than £24m when he died last year, official records show. The One Direction singer died aged 31 in Argentina in October without making a will. If someone dies without making a will, the rules say any children will normally inherit their estate if there is no living husband, wife or civil partner. Payne never married but he and former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl had a son, Bear, who is now aged eight. Cheryl, who was Payne's partner for more than two years, and music industry lawyer Richard Bray have been named administrators of his estate. They will manage the money, but they currently have limited authority and cannot distribute it. Payne died at the age of 31 after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. A court in Argentina dropped charges in February of criminal negligenceagainst three out of the five peoplewho had been charged in connection with Payne's death. His death shocked the music world and millions of fans of One Direction, one of the most successful pop groups of the 2010s. Probate documents show that the total gross value of his estate was £28.6m, but was reduced to £24.3m when any debts and expenses were deducted. Cheryl and Bray have been given a limited grant of representation, described as being \"to allow the administrator power to preserve the deceased's estate until a general grant is made\". It is the first time the prestigious music industry event will be held outside London. The Motown legend is being sued for $50m by four women who accuse him of sexual assault and rape.

    "article_text": "An NHS worker has been awarded almost £30,000 in compensation after being compared to Stars Wars villain Darth Vader at work. Lorna Rooke's colleague took a Star Wars-themed personality type test on her behalf, with it concluding that Ms Rooke fell into the Darth Vader category. An employment tribunal in Croydon, south London, found that the incident was a \"detriment\", meaning it caused harm or a negative impact to Ms Rooke, who worked in a blood donation department. The claimant was made to feel \"unpopular\" and suffered from low mood and anxiety in relation to her work environment. The team were taking a Myers-Briggs questionnaire with a Star Wars theme, with the result characterising each of them as a Star Wars character, the judgement explained. While Ms Rooke was out of the room, another colleague did the test for her. The Darth Vader category was described as a \"very focused individual who brings the team together\", however the judge was not convinced that the categorisation had any positive attributes. \"Darth Vader is a legendary villain of the Star Wars series, and being aligned with his personality is insulting,\" Judge Kathryn Ramsden said. She said on the basis that the test was done on the perception of another colleague and then shared with the group, it was \"little wonder\" that Ms Rooke was upset by it. TheMyers-Briggs Type Indicatorsorts people into 16 categories based on how introverted they are, their level of intuition, if they are led by thoughts or feelings and how they judge or perceive the world around them. The tribunal heard that in 2003 Ms Rooke began working for the NHS Blood and Transplant service as a training and practice supervisor and the incident was one of the reasons for her resignation in 2021. Ms Rooke won her case for detriment after a protected disclosure but lost claims for unfair dismissal, disability discrimination, and failure to make reasonable adjustments.

    "article_text": "Nine people have been arrested and weapons and Nazi memorabilia seized after a group \"celebrated Adolf Hitler's birthday\" in an Oldham pub. Members of the far-right group British Movement North West posted pictures online of themselves eating a cake with swastika icing and appeared to hold up Nazi flags at the Duke of Edinburgh in Market Street, Royton, last month. The pub's owners said its staff had been tricked by the group, who had allegedly concealed their Nazi paraphernalia. Greater Manchester Police said it had conducted morning raids across Rochdale, Bolton, Trafford, Stockport and Southport seizing swords, a crossbow, imitation firearms and a suspected grenade. The force said the nine had been arrested on suspicion of Section 18 Public Order Act offences, including displaying written material intended to stir up racial hatred. GMP said \"as a matter of course\" it had been in contact with Counter Terrorism Policing North West who had \"offered advice\" on some of the materials seized. Following the recovery of a suspected grenade at a property in Bolton, Army bomb disposal experts were deployed and the item was declared safe. The force said officers remained at some of the properties while searches continued, and extra patrols had been deployed to reassure residents. Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker said: \"This group clearly has a deep fascination with ideas that we know are unsettling for communities across Greater Manchester. \"We must take action when concerns are raised, and where weapons are suspected, to ensure people are free to live without fear of intimidation or harm.\" She said that while the investigation was at an early stage the force did not believe there was a wider threat to the public. A website run by the Neo-Nazi group described the event as a celebration of the \"136th birthday of Uncle A\". The write-up described \"laughter and lively conversation\" with members reminiscing \"about the good times while planning their future BM escapades\".

    "article_text": "This video can not be played No better team in competition than Arsenal - Arteta Mikel Arteta boldly announced Arsenal were in Paris to make history â but it was a recent history of falling short that haunted them as their Champions League campaign ended in failure. Arsenal delivered a fine performance, but were ultimately unable to overcome Paris St-Germain, who have taken a wrecking ball to the Premier League's elite in this tournament and now face Inter Milan in Munich in the final. Arteta and his players were devastated as Parc des Princes exploded in pyrotechnics and deafening celebrations at the conclusion of PSG's 2-1 win in this semi-final second leg. Arsenal had gone the same way as Manchester City, Arsenal and Aston Villa when they faced Luis Enrique's exciting, emerging PSG side earlier in the tournament. And, beneath the surface, lies a very uncomfortable truth for Arteta and Arsenal. Arsenal are now five years without a trophy, when Arteta led them to the FA Cup in 2020. For all the talk of process and progress, this is the only currency that matters for elite clubs, so time is ticking on Arteta to make his team winners again. He is, for now, in charge of a nearly team. For all Arsenal's excellence in the City Of Light, this darkness was the brutal reality. No-one would seriously suggest for one moment Arteta's job is under threat, but he is definitely under pressure to produce tangible success, which will ratchet up next season. Eventually there can be no excuses, or messages about moving forward. Arsenal need to win. There is the basis for a top-class side with outstanding players such as Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, along with the youthful brilliance of Myles Lewis-Skelly â but top-class sides win trophies and, in that context, Arsenal have fallen short for five years. Arsenal and Arteta's hopes of history are now reduced to making sure they finish in the Premier League's top five to ensure they are back in the Champions League next season. It was a night of missed opportunities in a two-legged tie shaped by the first 20 minutes both at Emirates Stadium and here in Paris. PSG went for Arsenal away from home and scored a decisive goal from Ousmane Dembele. The Gunners gave Luis Enrique's side a taste of their own medicine in Paris but could not score. The giant figure of PSG's Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was Arsenal's nemesis again, just as he was at Emirates Stadium, producing two outstanding saves early on, first from Gabriel Martinelli's close-range shot, then a world-class stop low to his left from Odegaard. 'Arsenal 100% the best team in competition' - Arteta 'This is their time' - PSG in 'special moment' This video can not be played PSG beat Arsenal to go through to final PSG were chasing history of their own, as indicated by the giant tifo unfurled during the spectacular light and sound show before kick-off along the Virage Auteuil, where their Ultras gather,. It read: \"55 years of memory behind you to write history.\" Goals from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi either side of half-time set the platform for victory, punishing Arsenal for the blunt instrument that is their attack. Saka eventually beat Donnarumma but it was all very little very late. PSG can now chase that history in the shape of their first Champions League triumph, while Arsenal are left to ponder a fourth successive failure in a semi-final and a season that will be looked back on as an anti-climax. For Arsenal, it is a case of what might have been and another season when Arteta's team have been unable to bridge the elusive gap between also-rans and winners. This was their 201st match in the Champions League, the most of any side who have failed to lift the trophy. And it was another semi-final defeat to set alongside those in the 2020-21 Europa League, 2021-22 EFL Cup, 2024-25 EFL Cup, and this exit here. It is their longest-ever run of exits at this stage. Close but not close enough. Again. Arsenal and England midfield man Declan Rice said: \"We're all desperate for it. That's why we play football. We want to win trophies. We want to be at the pinnacle, winning stuff. \"For whatever reason, it hasn't been meant to be. We've been really close and it's not good enough. \"Arsenal deserve to be pushing for trophies and winning things but there's not a lot more we can be doing. A lot of superstars have suffered defeats to come out on top. It hurts, you see the boys, the manager. We wanted to be in Munich but this doesn't define us and we'll be back.\" The task for Arteta now is to also prove he is a winner after a Premier League title pursuit that never got off the ground and the promise of the Champions League, including a superb win over holder Real Madrid in the quarter-final, coming to nothing. In his pre-match news conference, Arteta bizarrely said: \"Winning trophies is about being in the right moment in the right place. Liverpool have won the title with less points than we have in the last two seasons. With the points of the past two seasons, we have two Premier Leagues.\" It was a flawed argument that conveniently ignored the fact Arsenal have been in the same place at the same time as Arne Slot's newly crowned champions this season and did not deliver. Arteta's maths also failed to take into account Liverpool could yet surpass the 89 points Arsenal achieved last season, and tally of 84 in 2022-23. This may seem a harsh assessment given the quality of Arsenal's performance in Paris, but no amount of \"what ifs\" can disguise the fact that they are once again empty-handed. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta consoled Jurien Timber after their Champions League semi-final loss against Paris St-Germain Arteta talked of \"fine margins\" and will curse Donnarumma's brilliance over two legs, but this is what matters at this rarified level. Arsenal were also architects of their own downfall, with Thomas Partey's poor headed clearance only finding an unmarked Ruiz for PSG's first, then the same player losing possession for Hakimi's second, which effectively finished them off. Arsenal's serious strategic failure in not signing a striker last summer was also a factor in their elimination. And this is not post-event wisdom â it was a thorny subject then. Mikel Merino, pressed into service away from his usual midfield role, was tireless. But he only offered a focal point, not a serious threat. How Arsenal cried out for a reliable marksman who might have made more capital of their early domination, when they gave Luis Enrique's side a taste of their own medicine by pinning them back with fierce salvo of attacks. As former Arsenal and England defender Matthew Upson put it on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When PSG break away, you always feel they are going to put the ball in the back of the net. Arsenal don't have that level.\" Arteta and Arsenal must find that striker after the negligence of last summer otherwise they will wait longer for the history they crave to make.

    "title": "Itoje set to be named British and Irish Lions captain",
    "article_text": "Itoje has been a part of two previous tours with the Lions Maro Itoje is set to be confirmed on Thursday as the British and Irish Lions captain for the tour of Australia. The 30-year-old will become the first Englishman since Martin Johnson in 2001 to be named Lions captain, and will lead a party of around 40 players. Itoje, who will tour with the Lions for the third time, took over the England captaincy before the 2025 Six Nations, leading them to second after four straight wins. With Ireland skipper Caelan Doris having shoulder surgery this week, Itoje has emerged as the outstanding candidate for the role. He will be confirmed formally in front of a live audience at the O2 Arena on Thursday afternoon, along with the rest of the Lions squad. Itoje's credentials have been endorsed by a string of former Lions, including three-times tourist Matt Dawson. \"Maro has blossomed beautifully this season for England,\" Dawson told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He has gone from being a player who was a certainty to be in the team, but was a bit short of the form of his early 20s and a little bit too ill-disciplined, to being right in the groove. \"The captaincy has given him a new lease of life and he is ready to step into the role for the Lions.\" Itoje will be the only member of Andy Farrell's touring party present at the announcement, with the rest of the squad finding out at the time. Farrell's team face Argentina in Dublin on Friday, 20 June, before their first game on Australian soil against Western Force on Saturday, 28 June. The three-Test series against the Wallabies starts on 19 July in Brisbane. Given Itoje's outstanding performances for his country for the best part of a decade, it was a surprise he had to wait until the age of 30 to assume the England captaincy. But despite concerns from former boss Eddie Jones about his leadership credentials, Itoje excelled in the recent Six Nations, combining a cool and authoritative captaincy style with his usual high standard of play. England's strong finish to the Championship catapulted Itoje into the Lions captaincy conversation, especially with Ireland tailing away under Doris - the other exceptional candidate. And with Doris unfortunately injured for Leinster last weekend - throwing into doubt his involvement in the tour - Itoje is the natural choice for Farrell. Crucially, Itoje has been there and done it. This will be his third Lions tour, which will help massively when it comes to leading a group shorn of Lions heavyweights. Assuming he keeps his form, Itoje walks into the Test team and has the respect of team-mates, opposition, and officials alike. It is his time. 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls When is the British and Irish Lions squad named?

    "article_text": "Postecoglou's side have a 3-1 lead going into Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Bodo/Glimt Ange Postecoglou says \"Spurs does crazy things to people\" in response to Arsene Wenger's suggestion that the winners of the Europa League should not qualify for the Champions League. Former Arsenal manager Wenger, now Fifa's chief of global football development, hasquestioned why the winners of the Europa League qualify for next year's Champions League. Postecoglou's Tottenham have a 3-1 lead going into Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt's Aspmyra Stadion. But they are 16th in the Premier League table, while Manchester United - who have a 3-0 lead over Athletic Club in the other last-four tie - are a point ahead in 15th. The winners will face each other in Bilbao on 21 May. The pair will not qualify for Europe through the league but Postecoglou does not understand Wenger's argument. \"It's a debate that's been raging for years, at least the last eight daysâ¦I've never heard it before,\" said the Australian in Norway. \"Spurs does crazy things to people. \"You put that club into any sentence or any issue and invariably they all come out and try to diminish it as much as they can. \"It's Spurs mate, they love it. \"It's competition rules. Why wasn't it an issue before and is it an issue now? What's the difference? Last year fifth [in the Premier League] didn't get you into the Champions League, this year it does. What does that mean?\" Uefa amended its rules in 2014 to allow the Europa League winners to qualify for the following season's Champions League tournament, but Wenger disagreed with the policy. Asked if this was \"right\", he told BeIN Sports: \"No, they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League - especially when you're in the Premier League where already five teams qualify. I think it's something [for Uefa] to think about and to review. \"On the other hand, people will tell you that to keep the Europa League focused, interesting and motivated you need to give them that prize [of qualifying for the Champions League].\" Tottenham face Bodo in Norway without James Maddison, with Postecoglou confirming the England midfielder isout for the season with the knee injury he suffered in the first leg. Striker Dominic Solanke has travelled and should be fit after being forced off in the 3-1 success with a quad problem.",

    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu will face Ekaterina Alexandrova in the second round in Rome, while Cameron Norrie will take on Daniil Medvedev Britain's Emma Raducanu and Cameron Norrie won their first-round matches at the Italian Open as Katie Boulter failed to progress in Rome. Raducanu, making her first appearance at the tournament after a three-year absence, had to dig deep to win 7-5 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 against Australian Maya Joint. The British number two felt the level of the match was \"really high\" and said: \"I'm really proud of myself as well because that was a great performance, I think, on all fronts.\" Norrie booked his second-round place with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 win over Christopher O'Connell. Meanwhile, 28-year-old Boulter lost 3-6 3-6 to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia. Raducanu will face Russian second seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the next round, while Norrie will be in action on Friday, 9 May against world number 11 Daniil Medvedev - a player the Brit has faced three times but never beaten. Raducanu set-up 'working well' but jigsaw not complete Short turnarounds 'becoming normal' for Draper Playersâ union partially successful in legal challenge v ATP After taking a tight first set, Raducanu was serving for the match at 5-4 in the second when a resurgent Joint fought back and was able to take the former US Open champion to a tie-break, which the 19-year-old breezed through 7-1. Raducanu then had to regroup for the deciding set and raced into a 5-0 lead, only to be pegged back again by Joint who won the next three games. She finally closed out the set on serve after two hours and 44 minutes. During a bathroom break after the second set, Raducanu used the thought of losing the match to fuel her motivation going into the decider. \"That was pretty powerful and strong,\" added the 22-year-old. Raducanu returned to action in April after taking a month-long break from competitive tennis. She made it through to the second round at the Madrid Open two weeks ago but fell to a straight-set defeat by Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk. In the men's competition, British number three Norrie was defeated by Serbian Dusan Lajovic in the qualifying round on Tuesday, but he received a spot in the main draw as a lucky loser. The 29-year-old dropped just five games against O'Connell in a 76-minute match and told Sky Sports he channelled his anger into overcoming the Australian following his disappointing performance against Lajovic. \"I was sharp, I didn't give him much and I played some physical tennis,\" said Norrie. \"I was just really happy I turned that energy around.\" For Boulter, after earning thefirst WTA clay-court win of her careerlast month in Madrid, she struggled to repeat the same form in Rome against Pavlyuchenkova, despite the former French Open finalist being on a four-match losing streak.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played PSG beat Arsenal go through to finals Mikel Arteta says Arsenal were the best team in the Champions League this season, despitelosing their semi-finalto Paris St-Germain. The Gunners came into the Parc des Princes needing to overturn a 1-0 loss from the home first leg to book a place in the final against Inter Milan. But while Arsenal created a number of good opportunities, they could not find a way past PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma until Bukayo Saka's late strike. By then, goals from Fabian Ruiz and Achraf Hakimi had put the French champions on their way to a 2-1 second-leg success, and 3-1 on aggregate. \"We were very close, much closer than the result showed, but unfortunately we are out,\" said Arteta. \"I am very proud of the players, 100% I don't think there's been a better team [than Arsenal] in the competition from what I have seen, but we are out. \"This competition is about the boxes and in both boxes are the strikers and the goalkeepers and theirs was the best in both games.\" 'Clock ticking on Arteta to prove he can be a winner' PSG beat Arsenal to set up Champions League final with Inter This video can not be played No better team in competition than Arsenal - Arteta Having failed to reach a first Champions League final since 2006, the Arsenal boss revealed his players were in tears in the dressing room following the loss - and he was \"upset and so annoyed\" they not find a way to turn around the tie. Asked whether he agreed with Arteta, PSG boss Luis Enrique said his own side deserved to reach the final. \"Mikel Arteta is a great friend, but I don't agree at all,\" he added. \"They played in a clever way and they got the match to the right moment for them because they played in the way they wanted, and the way they love. But in the two legs we scored more than them and that is the most important thing in football. \"Arsenal played a great match, and we suffered, but we deserved to get to the final. They are a great team, but I repeat, we scored more goals, we played in a great way in the first leg, and the second half of the second leg was a different match, and we could have scored even more goals.\" Arsenal were looking to reach their first Champions League final in 19 years The Gunners started superbly and, after Declan Rice headed wide from close range, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard forced Donnarumma into fine saves. Saka also forced the PSG keeper into another excellent stop in the second half as Arsenal finished the match with an expected goal ratio of 3.14. \"When you analyse both games, who has been the best player? The MVP has been the same player, the goalkeeper.\" added Arteta. \"And the Champions League is decided in the boxes and it's won the game for them because obviously after 20 minutes, and what happened in London as well, the result should have been very different. \"So I can take a lot of positives and I'm very proud of the team. We have to arrive in the competition at this stage with the full squad, full available, in the best condition. We haven't got that, so let's put that aside. \"Still, the team that I've seen today is probably one of the best, if not the best team in Europe. \"It gives me so much pride, but at the same time I'm so upset, so annoyed that we didn't manage to do it. I see how much they wanted it, because they were in tears. It hurts, but you have to deal with that.\" The defeat meant Arsenal will end the season without winning a trophy for the fourth season in a row, after Arteta led them to an FA Cup triumph in 2020 during his first season in charge. They have also finished second in the Premier League for the last two seasons and the Spaniard was asked whether his players will struggle to get motivated to try again after another disappointment. \"With fear you cannot play football at the highest level. We had the best example in the [PSG] dressing room - Marquinhos, 11 times he's tried in this club to be a winner, 11 times he's the captain,\" said Arteta. \"So that's the truth and let's see if they win it. So 11 times they have to go down and up. \"So look in the mirror at somebody like this with that trajectory and you want to be in the sport and you want to be competing and be very close to all the trophies. You better be able to deal with that.\" This video can not be played 'You have to lose a few in order to win'- Rice on 'gutting' loss to PSG Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views Get Arsenal news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "McIlroy has 'nothing but positive vibes' before major return",
    "article_text": "Next week's US PGA Championship will be held at Quail Hollow, where Rory McIlroy has won four times Rory McIlroy says he is approaching next week's US PGA Championship with \"nothing but positive vibes\" after ending his long wait for a fifth major. The world number two completed the career Grand Slam with athrilling play-off victoryover Justin Rose in last month's Masters. In addition to joining Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods as the men's game's only Grand Slam winners, McIlroy's Augusta triumph marked his first major success since the 2014 US PGA Championship. With the Slam achieved, McIlroy returns to major action at next week's US PGA at Quail Hollow, where he has won four times on the PGA Tour. \"I'm obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure [at the US PGA],\" McIlroy said on the eve of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia, a tournament he won last year when it was staged at Quail Hollow. \"I'm also going back to a venue that I love, so there's nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and with my history there and how well I've played at Quail,\" he said. \"It probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won't be quite as on edge as I have been for the past few years when I've been at major championships. \"I'll probably be a bit better to be around for my family and I'll be a little more relaxed. Overall it'll be a good thing.\" 'Scheffler and DeChambeau wins further raise US PGA excitement levels' 'You start to think if it's going to be your time' McIlroy to play Scottish Open before Portrush bid McIlroy, who turned 36 on Sunday, skipped the RBC Heritage tournament following the Masters while he returned home to Northern Ireland to visit his parents. Since then, McIlroy has returned to action alongside Shane Lowry for the defence of their Zurich Classic of New Orleans title, where they finished tied 12th. Having opted against playing the CJ Cup Byron Nelson in Texas, where world number one Scottie Scheffler cantered to an eight-shot victory, McIlroy fulfilled more media obligations last week, appearing in the US on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and The Today Show. \"It's not even the celebrating, it's the obligations you have afterwards,\" McIlroy said. \"I wanted to go home and see my folks after [the Masters] but having to play in New Orleans, it's a different week and a fun week so I didn't feel like I had to prepare all that much, I could lean on Shane when I needed to. \"But last week, I had Michael Bannon [his swing coach] in town, we practised for three days but then I was up in New York for three days doing a few bits and pieces. \"When I got back home and back into my real routine on Sunday/Monday and coming up here, it feels like that period is behind me and I'm looking forward to the next few months.\" Spieth (left) is hoping to complete the Slam next week Jordan Spieth will attempt to follow in McIlroy's footsteps next week by completing the career Grand Slam at the US PGA. It will be the 31-year-old American's ninth attempt at completing the set after winning the Masters and US Open in 2015 and the 2017 Open Championship. However, while McIlroy repeatedly attempted to complete the Slam at Augusta, where the Masters is held every year, the US PGA Championship changes venue annually. \"It's a bit of a different proposition for him rather than me having to go back to the same venue every year and trying to do that as well,\" said McIlroy. \"As much as you just try to put yourself in the right frame of mind to try and win the golf tournament and then let everything else happen, it's in there. Consciously or subconsciously, you feel that. \"The worst I felt on Sunday  at Augusta was when I made birdie on 10 to go four ahead because I was like 'I really can't mess this up now'. \"There's that pressure. You know you're not just trying to win another tournament. You're trying to become part of history and that has a certain weight to it. I've certainly felt that at Augusta over the years and I'm sure Jordan's felt that going into PGAs when he's had the chance to do the same thing.\" McIlroy is out at 17:26 BST in Thursday's Truist Championship opening round alongside American Justin Thomas and England's Tommy Fleetwood.",

    "title": "US reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya despite ‘clear’ violation of court order",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationis reportedly planning to deport a group of immigrants to Libya, despite a judge’s efforts on Wednesday to block any such flights and the state department’s previous condemnation of the “life-threatening” prison conditions in the country. Reuterscited three unnamed US officials as saying the deportations could happen this week. Two of the officials said the immigrants, whose nationalities are not known, could be flown to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but they added the plans could still change. The New York Timesalso cited a US official confirmingthe deportation plans. The reported moves come as a federal judge ruled in favor of immigrant rights advocates, who asked him to block any deportation of immigrants toLibya. District court judge Brian Murphy agreed with advocates that a previous injunction he had issued already barred such flights. “If there is any doubt – the Court sees none – the allegedly imminent removals,” Murphy clarified, “would clearly violate this Court’s Order.” It was not clear what Libya would be getting in return for taking any deportees. In a rare show of unity, Libya’s rival governments have responded to news reports by saying that they would refuse to accept any deportees from the United States. Human rights groups condemned the reported plans, noting the country’s poor record on human rights practices and harsh treatment of detainees. “Migrants have long been trafficked, tortured and ransomed in Libya. The country is in a civil war. It is not a safe place to send anyone,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn),wrote on X. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council,wrote on the platformalongside a picture of a Libyan detention facility: “Don’t look away. This is what Libya’s migrant detention facilities look like. This is what Trump is doing.” Reichlin-Melnick added: “Amnesty International called these places a ‘hellscape’ where beatings are common and sexual violence are rampant. There are reports of human trafficking and even slavery.” Claudia Lodesani, head of programs for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said the group was “very concerned” about the possible consequences of such a plan, saying reports by media outlets and human rights organisations showed that “Libya is not a safe country for migrants” Lodesani pointed to a 2023 United Nations report which documented “widespread practices of arbitrary detention, torture, rape and slavery and concluding there were grounds to believe a wide array of crimes against humanity have been committed against migrants in Libya”. Government agencies, including the defense department, the White House, state department and department of homeland security did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. The defense department later directed inquiries to the White House. Reports of planned deportations to Libya come as the Trump administration is expanding its efforts to negotiate the deportations of US migrants to third-party countries, including Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda. This is alongside the at least 238 Venezuelan immigrants already deported to a prison in El Salvador. Libya is a major transit point for Europe-bound asylum seekers. For years, human rights organisations have documented how migrants trapped in the country are at the mercy of militias and smugglers. Tens of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa are kept indefinitely in overcrowded refugee detention centres where they aresubjected to abusesand torture. In its annual human rights report released last year, the US state department criticised Libya’s “harsh and life-threatening prison conditions” and “arbitrary arrest or detention”, citing how migrants , including children, had “no access to immigration courts or due process”. The news has prompted condemnation from aid agencies and NGOs that operate in the central Mediterranean, which have long warned about theharsh conditionsfaced by asylum seekers in Libya. They have also accused European governments of being complicit in such treatment by working with Libya to intercept migrants. ‘‘For 10 years now since our foundation, as a search and rescue organisation, we have continuously highlighted that Libya is not a safe place for migrants and refugees,” said Mirka Schäfer, a political expert for the German search-and-rescue organisation SOS Humanity. “Evidence from survivors onboard our vessel Humanity 1, includes refugees with traces of torture on their bodies, gunshot wounds, pain caused by beatings, physical and psychological wounds while in transit, in detention camps in Libya, or fleeing Libya across the Mediterranean.” One person onboard the Humanity 1 ship said criminal groups operating in Libya “sell people like they would sell bread”. Luca Casarini, the Italian founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, said the reported move by Trump was “an endorsement of the horror that has characterised his administration’s policies since the very beginning”. ‘‘Libya is one of the most hellish places on Earth, where mafias and smugglers operate with the complicity of the European Union. But Trump goes a step further. The American president claims ownership of this horror by deporting people to a hell that is Libya, flaunting his power. It is a move that drags our civilisation toward the abyss.’’ Libya’s government of national unity said on Wednesday it rejected the use of its territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent. The government added there was no coordination with the US regarding the reception of migrants. Trump, who made immigration a major issue during his election campaign, has launched aggressive enforcement action since taking office, increasing troops to the southern border and pledging to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US. As of Monday, the Trump administration had deported 152,000 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump’s administration has tried to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and sending migrants to notorious prisons in Guantánamo Bay and El Salvador. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, last week said the US was not satisfied with sending migrants only to El Salvador, and hinted that Washington was looking to expand the number of countries to which it could deport people. “We are working with other countries to say: we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings; will you do this as a favour to us?” Rubio said at a cabinet meeting at the White House last Wednesday. “And the further away from America, the better.” A fourth US official said the administration had for several weeks been looking at a number of countries where it might be able to send migrants, including Libya. On 19 April the supreme courttemporarily barred the Trump administrationfrom deporting a group of Venezuelans it accused of being gang members. Trump’s administration, which has invoked a rarely used wartime law, has urged the justices to lift or narrow their order. Reuters contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "The Brazilian government has rejected a request by the US state department to designate two major criminal gangs as terrorist organizations, according to Mario Sarrubo, Brazil’s national secretary of public security. Sarrubo said the request was made on Tuesday during a meeting between US and Brazilian officials in Brasília. The US officials were concerned about the gangsPrimeiro Comando da Capital, known as PCC, and Comando Vermelho, known as CV, which control territories in several Brazilian cities and are believed to have members in the US. Trump has been trying to tie his aggressive crackdown on immigration to the presence of members of Latin American criminal gangs in US cities. Earlier this year, the US government designated several crime factions as terrorist organizations,including Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua and El Salvador’s MS-13, as well as Mexican cartelsand Haitian gangs. “We don’t have terrorist organizations here, we have criminal organizations that have infiltrated society,” said Sarrubo. But Brazilian law, he added, only considers organizations that violently clash with the government for religious or racial reasons to be terrorists. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Latin American immigrants, alleging they were gang members, though it presented little evidence of their criminal ties. At the meeting in Brasília, US officials informed their Brazilian counterparts that their request was part of an effort to address immigration and criminal gangs with a transnational presence, saying they were priorities for the Trump administration, said one source who was present. US officials said a terrorist designation could help the government apply sanctions, raise resources and target criminal supply chains, the same source added. According to this source, US officials said the FBI had reported that the PCC and the Comando Vermelho had cells in 12 US states, mainly Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Tennessee. Those reports, the source added, alleged that the gangs trafficked guns and laundered money through Brazilians who traveled to the US, adding that 113 people were denied visas to enter the country because of connections to organized crime in 2024 alone. On Monday, the office of Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, son of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, said he met with Trump Organization officials to deliver a dossier that he said included intelligence information that tied the PCC and the CV to terrorist acts. The US embassy in Brasília did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Canadian police scale back search for two children missing in woods for six days",
    "article_text": "Nearly a week after two young children went missing in rural Nova Scotia,Canadianpolice say they are beginning to scale back search efforts given the “low” odds the children are still alive – and that they are not ruling out the possibility of foul play. Since Friday, more than 160 searchers with drones and canine units have scoured the thickly forested region of Pictou county in search of Lily Sullivan, six, and Jack Sullivan, four. The siblings were reported missing on 2 May, when police received a frantic phone call from the family. Their mother, Malehya Brooks-Murray, and stepfather, Daniel Martell, have told local media they were sleeping with their 16-month-old baby on Friday morning as the older children played in the house. But when they awoke later in the morning, the two children were gone. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) proceeded under the belief the children, members of the Mi’kmaq First Nation community of Sipekne’katik, wandered off from their home and probably entered a heavily forested area. Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Staff Sgt Curtis MacKinnon said that dozens of searchers were being ordered to stand down and confirmed that the RCMP’s major crime unit had been involved in the investigation since 3 May. MacKinnon said all missing persons files “are treated as suspicious until our investigation leads us to determine otherwise”. He said teams were left with fewer areas to search after after combing through kilometres of unforgiving terrain. “We’re not packing up and we’re not giving up.” The disappearance of the children has shaken both the province and the country. And despite a boot print that pushed search teams in one direction, police said there is very little evidence suggesting the children are in the forest. “I want to assure you that our missing persons investigation continues,” MacKinnon said. “Many of us have children of our own and want nothing more than to reunite Lily and Jack with their loved ones.” Sgt Robert McCamon said that hopes have dimmed, given the poor weather and length of time the children have been missing. “The likelihood they’re alive right now is very low,” he said. The Globe and Mail reported that Martell was interviewed by police for four hours, as they requested he walk them through both the day of the children’s disappearance and the days leading up to the incident. He also told police the children had not been in school in the days prior to their disappearance. “My story has been consistent. When you tell the truth it’s always consistent,” he told the Globe. He told CTV Atlantic that he had been conducting his own search since the children went missing. “Hardly any evidence at all since the first day. It’s mind-boggling that nothing else was found,” he said.",

    "title": "Real-world geoengineering experiments revealed by UK agency",
    "article_text": "Real-world geoengineering experiments spanning the globe from the Arctic to the Great Barrier Reef are being funded by the UK government. They will test sun-reflecting particles in the stratosphere, brightening reflective clouds using sprays of seawater and pumping water on to sea ice to thicken it. Getting this “critical missing scientific data” is vital with the Earth nearingseveral catastrophic climate tipping points, said the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), the governmentagency backing the plan. If demonstrated to be safe, geoengineering could temporarily cool the planet and give more time to tackle the root cause of the climate crisis: the burning of fossil fuels. The experiments will be small-scale and rigorously assessed before going ahead, Aria said. Other projects in the £56.8m programme will model the impacts of geoengineering on the climate and research how it could be governed internationally. Geoengineering is controversial, with some scientists calling it a“dangerous distraction” from cutting emissionsand concerned about unintended climate impacts. Some previously plannedoutdoor experiments have been cancelledafterstrong opposition. However, given the failure of the world tostop emissions risingto date, and the recent run ofrecord hot years, backers of solar geoengineering say researching the technology is vital in case an emergency brake is needed. The Aria programme, along withanother £10m project, makes the UK one of the biggest funders of geoengineering research in the world. “Decarbonisation is the first and best chance of avoiding these tipping points,” said Prof Mark Symes, the programme director at Aria. “But the current trajectory puts us in danger of triggering some tipping points, regardless of what happens with net zero, so we do need to think about what we might do in that eventuality. “The point of the programme is to explore and research as transparently as possible whether any of the proposed cooling approaches could ever be used safely,” he said. “Life in the UK could become very difficult if any of these tipping points were triggered.” Ilan Gur, Aria’s CEO, said: “If science can show us that an elegantly designed spray of seawater can protect and preserve the incredible biodiversity of the Great Barrier Reef, isn’t that something we want to understand?” The announcement was criticised by Prof Raymond Pierrehumbert at the University of Oxford: “Solar geoengineering has enormous and troubling implications for global society. The UK funding sets a dangerous precedent for other governments to jump on the bandwagon [and] it is the height of folly to open the door to field experiments in the absence of any national or international governance.” Mary Church, at the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “Solar geoengineering is inherently unpredictable and risks breaking further an already broken climate system. Conducting small-scale experiments risks normalising highly controversial theories and accelerating technological development, creating a slippery slope toward full-scale deployment.” Most geoengineering proposals aim to block sunlight reaching and heating the Earth’s surface. However, solar radiation management (SRM) has the potential for serious unintended consequences, such as shifting rains vital to food production. Someprivate companiesare already working on geoengineering; that makes building the scientific evidence base even more important, Gur said. The Aria-funded experiments include sending a weather balloon into the stratosphere above the US or UK. Milligram samples of non-toxic mineral dust will be exposed to the high-altitude conditions and then recovered to assess how the particles’ properties change with time. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Another three experiments will test how seawater sprays or electrical charges delivered by drones can seed tiny water droplets, making clouds over the oceans reflect more sunlight. One will expand current work over the Great Barrier Reef, which is in crisis because of global heating, and may reach 100sq km in scale, while another will take place on the UK coast. A fifth experiment will involve pumping water on to sea ice inCanadain winter, reaching up to one 1 sq km in scale. The water will freeze and preserve the ice sheet for longer in summer. Bright white ice reflects far more sunlight than the dark ocean revealed when sea ice is lost to warming waters. There will be an environmental impact assessment made public before any outdoor experiments take place and local communities will have been consulted. There is also an independent oversight committee as part of the approval process, Aria said, chaired by the leading climate scientist Prof Piers Forster and including members from India and Ghana. The Aria programme will also assess space reflectors, which are sunshades placed into orbit, using modelling to determine their feasibility. “This is the most speculative of all the approaches we’re funding,” said Symes. Volcanic eruptions naturally inject particles into the atmosphere and another project will fly drones through the plumes to measure the particles’ effects. Seven modelling teams will investigate the impacts of geoengineering on climate and ecosystems, especially in developing countries, where about 85% of the world’s population lives. There will be a further five teams working on ethics and governance to explore the wider societal implications of geoengineering, such as how any future deployment should be agreed and managed.",

    "article_text": "Five members of Venezuela’s political opposition have left the Argentinian diplomatic compound in their country’s capital, Caracas, where they had sheltered for more than a year to avoid arrest, and were in the United States on Tuesday, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said. Rubio did not provide details of the group’s movements to reach the US, but he described the event as a rescue operation. The government of the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, did not immediately comment on the situation. “The US welcomes the successful rescue of all hostages held by the Maduro regime at the Argentinian embassy in Caracas,” Rubio said on X. “Following a precise operation, all hostages are now safely on US soil.” The government of Argentina’s president,Javier Milei, allowed the five people into the ambassador’s residence in March 2024, when authorities loyal to Venezuela’s ruling party issued warrants for their arrest, accusing them of promoting acts of violence to destabilize the country. The group included the campaign manager and communications director of opposition leader María Corina Machado. Machado, also on X, thanked people involved in what she called an “impeccable and epic operation for the freedom of five heroes of Venezuela”. Since late November, the group had denounced the constant presence of intelligence service agents and police outside the residence. It had also accused the government of cutting electricity and water services to the compound. The government had denied the allegations. A sixth person, Fernando Martinez, a cabinet minister in the 1990s, sheltered with the group for nine months. Martinez abandoned the compound in mid-December and, according to Venezuelan authorities, appeared before prosecutors. He died in February. Maduro’s government routinely targeted its real or perceived opponents ahead of last year’s presidential election, and its crackdown on dissent only increased after the country’s national electoral council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the winner despite credible evidence to the contrary. The election results announced by the electoral council sparked protests across the country to which the government responded with force and ended with more than 20 people dead. They also prompted an end to diplomatic relations between Venezuela and various foreign countries, includingArgentina. In August,Brazilaccepted Argentina’s request to guard the diplomatic compound in Caracas after Maduro’s government expelled its diplomats when Milei said that he would not recognize “another fraud”. But a month later, Venezuela revoked Brazil’s authorization to guard the facility, alleging it had evidence of the use of the premises “for the planning of terrorist activities and assassination attempts”. Brazil and Argentina have rejected those accusations. Milei said in a statement on Tuesday that the operation “represents an important step in defending freedom in the region”.",

    "article_text": "Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for the start of a four-day visit during which he will attend Russia’s military parade commemorating the anniversary of the end of the second world war, known in Russia as Victory Day. The Chinese leader’s trip has coincided withmass Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian capital. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said Russia’s air defence units destroyed at least 19 Ukrainian drones overnight. Xi was greeted on arrival in Moscow with a military band. The attacks forced most of Moscow’s airports to close and Russia’s national carrier, Aeroflot, said it was reordering timetables to cope with the disruption. The wave of drones launched by Kyiv to disrupt the Kremlin’s preparations for Victory Day forced at least one world leader to divert his Moscow flight on Wednesday, with the Serbian president’s plane rerouted to Baku, Azerbaijan before the jet eventually landed in the Russian capital. Aleksandar Vučić’s visit to Moscow, for which he has been heavily criticised by several European countries, had already run into complications when Latvia and Lithuania reportedly barred his plane from their airspace, forcing a detour. Russia’s defence ministry said its military had shot down more than 500 drones in the previous 24 hours, while airport closures affected at least 60,000 passengers. Xi’s visit, which comes as China is engaged in atrade warwith the US and soon after Ukraine accused China of directly aiding Russia’s invasion, underscores his close relationship with Vladimir Putin. It is Xi’s 11th visit to Russia since becoming president. He has paid more visits there than to any other country. The Russian foreign ministry described the trip as “one of the central events in Russian-Chinese relations this year”. Xi is expected to sign numerous cooperation agreements, deepening the “no limits” relationship betweenChinaand Russia. There will also be discussion of the planned Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which could carry 50bn cubic metres of gas a year from Russia to China. Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin on Thursday and to attend the Victory Day parade on Friday. China’s People’s Liberation Army will send an honour guard to participate in the ceremony in Moscow for the first time since 2015, and for the first time ever will send an honour guard to join in parallel celebrations in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. In an article published on Wednesday, Xi wrote: “China and Russia are both major countries with significant influence and are constructive forces in maintaining global strategic stability and improving global governance … Together we must foil all schemes to disrupt or undermine our bonds of amity and trust.” Bilateral trade between China and Russia has reached record levels since Russia’s invasion ofUkrainein 2022, providing Moscow with an economic lifeline at a time when western countries have imposed sanctions on it. Trade reached $245bn (£183bn) in 2024, 66% more than in 2021. China maintains it is a neutral party in the war and that it supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict. But in recent months Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aid for Moscow’s war efforts. Two Chinese mercenaries, out of hundreds who have travelled to fight with the Russian army,were caughtin the eastern Donetsk region last month. They did not have a direct link to the Chinese state butrecruitment videosare easily found on China’s tightly controlled social media. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused China ofclosing its eyesto the participation of its nationals in the war. Zelenskyy has criticised foreign leaders for travelling to Moscow, saying that Ukraine “cannot bear responsibility for what happens” to any heads of state attending the Victory Day parade. Moscow has said 29 world leaders are expected to attend the Victory Day commemorations, marking the largest foreign delegation at the Red Square parade since Putin launched his full-scale invasion more than three years ago. Apart from Xi, other notable guests include the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the pro-Russian prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico.",

    "article_text": "China will cut interest rates and inject some much-needed liquidity into the domestic economy, as the country steels itself for abruising trade warwith the US. The People’s Bank ofChinasaid on Wednesday it would make a half-point cut to the banks’ reserve requirement ratio, its benchmark interest rate, and release 1tn yuan (£103.6bn) into the banking system. Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, said China would also cut a key interest rate by 0.1 percentage point. Pan said the “moderately loose” measures were a response to a global economy “full of uncertainties, with intensified economic fragmentation and trade tensions”. China’s economy is under enormous pressure as it faces tariffs of 145% on its exports to the US. China’s dependence on exports, particularly to the world’s largest consumer market, has fallen in recent years but they still account for 15% of the country’s GDP. Beijing and Washington are at loggerheads over who will blink first in a trade war that has roiled global markets and threatens to severely weaken the Chinese and the US economies. SinceDonald Trumptook office in January, the US has announced sweeping tariffs, particularly aimed at China, while China has responded with counter-tariffs of 125% on US goods. Senior Chinese and US officialswill meetin the coming days to discuss how to de-escalate the trade war, the first time the two sides have spoken at a senior level since Trump’s“liberation day” announcementon 2 April. China’s vice-premier He Lifeng will meet the US Treasury secretary,Scott Bessent, on the sidelines of meetings in Switzerland over the weekend. However, while a trade deal remains a distant prospect, China is trying other measures to boost its sluggish economy. It is particularly focused on boosting consumer spending.

    "article_text": "South Koreahas recorded the highest number of measles cases in six years, adding to concerns thatlow vaccination ratescombined with international travel are contributing tofurther outbreakselsewhere in the region. The country has confirmed 52 cases so far this year, exceeding the 49 recorded for the whole of 2024, the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said this week. It is the highest figure since 2019, when 194 cases were recorded. TheWorld Health Organization(WHO) recognised South Korea as “measles free” in 2014, but overseas travel and an ageing population are thought to have contributed to the rise in cases. South Korea is not alone in having outbreaks of measles, which experts consider the most infectious communicable disease. Alarm is growing over outbreaks in the US – centred onTexas– and in Thailand and Vietnam. The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in aquarter of a century, with one leading immunologist warning: “We’re living in a post-herd immunity world.” The Vietnamese health ministry said officials had identified about40,000 suspected measles casesand five deaths already this year, prompting calls to speed upvaccinationof children. Vietnam confirmed 6,725 cases and 13 deaths in 2024 – with most deaths occurring among children and older people with underlying health conditions, according to media reports. According to figures reported to the WHO by member states, Thailand had 7,507 cases in 2024, compared with just 38 in 2023. The outbreak inSouth Koreahas been attributed to unvaccinated travellers from overseas. Of the 52 cases reported by the KDCA this week, 34 involved people from overseas – mostly from Vietnam – the Yonhap news agency said. “The global increase in measles is likely to result in more imported cases,” a KDCA official told Yonhap. “The risk of rapid outbreaks remains low because of our stable vaccination rates and monitoring system.” A two-dose measles vaccination in childhood is about 99% effective in stopping someone from getting measles, according to infectious diseases experts. The WHO said in apress releasein March: “The latest data indicates that the measles outbreak in Vietnam is still very much ongoing, and we are seeing continued surges in cases in central and northern Vietnam – including new outbreaks in parts of the country that have not reported cases or clusters of cases before. It added: “Due to the highly contagious nature of measles and the significant immunity gaps, many un- or under-vaccinated children are exposed to infection.” The outbreaks in the US and south-east Asia have sparked concern that Australia too could become “fertile ground” for the disease. Measles can cause severe complications in vulnerable children and adults including pneumonia, encephalitis and death, according to a factsheet on thewebsiteof the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

    "article_text": "JD Vance has said thatRussiais asking for “too much” in its negotiations withUkrainein the latest sign ofgrowing frustration from Washingtonwith ceasefire talks to end the war between the two countries. Speaking at a security conference of senior military and diplomatic leaders in Washington, the US vice-president said that the White House is focused on getting the two sides to hold direct talks and is ready to walk away if certain benchmarks are not reached. “I wouldn’t say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution,” Vance said during an onstage interview with the Munich security council president, Wolfgang Ischinger. “What I would say is, right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much. OK?” Asked about those comments later on Wednesday,Donald Trumpsaid: “It’s possible that’s right.” “We are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made,” said the US president. “I’m not happy about it … I’m not happy about it.” Senior administration officials, including Vance and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, are said to be growing more frustrated over Russia’s inflexibility in discussions to end the war. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy, has held four rounds ofdirect talks with Putin, but those have not yielded concrete concessions from the Russian side. During his remarks, Vance reiterated the threat that the White House would “walk away if [Trump] thinks he’s not making progress”. “In particular, the step that we would like to make right now is we would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,” he said. “Obviously, the United States is happy to participate in those conversations, but it’s very important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another. We think that is the next big step that we would like to take.” Aftermeeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican last month, Trump threatened Russia with secondary sanctions over the continued bombardments of Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities despite talks to reach a permanent ceasefire. “There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote then. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently.” Senior Russian officials have maintained a hardline position, demanding both a rollback of Nato as well as limits on Ukraine’s security and a degree of control over its internal politics. “Marco Rubio expressed yesterday, I think, also the assessment that they had the American team now is getting a better understanding of the Russian position and of the root causes of this situation,” said Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, during an interview on Meet the Press last week. “One of this root causes, apart from Nato and creation of direct military threats to Russia just on our borders, another one is the rights of the national minorities in Ukraine.” Joe Biden in his first interview since leaving officeaccused Trump of “modern-day appeasement”, saying the expectations that Ukraine ceding territory to Russia would end the war was “foolish”.",

Plumes of black smoke have emergedfrom the chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel,signalling that the 133 cardinals sealed off inside have failed to elect a new popeon the first day of conclave. After the formal procession to the Sistine Chapel and each of the cardinalsswearing the oath to secrecy,the first voting round only got under way at about 5.45pm local time. Then all eyes were on the famous chimney, which wasdiligently guarded by a seagullfor some of the time the cardinals were voting. After a tense wait,black smoke finally appeared at 9:05pm– to loud applause from the crowd of more than 45,000 below. The conclave will continue on Thursday, and end only when a successor to Pope Francis, whodied last month aged 88, is found. Up to four rounds of voting tomorrow(and in the following days). The first one is expected 9.30am local time (8.30am BST), and the second one closer to midday (11am local time). They then will take a lunch break until 4pm, with another two rounds expected around 5.30pm and 7pm local time (4.30pm and 6pm). For now, the electors will go back to Santa Marta guesthouse for their dinner – but will be back in the Sistine Chapel tomorrow. Well, that wasexpected– even if tooklonger than we anticipated. We have133 cardinal electors,many of whom are new– appointed by Pope Francis – and so they don’t know each other that well. They will understandablyneed more time to decide on the right personto be confirmed as the pope. The delay is interesting, but there are so many potential reasons for it and it wouldn’t be wise to speculate. Thecardinals will be back for more votes tomorrow: up to four rounds, if needed. Two in the morning, two in the afternoon. No decision in the first round of the vote. We are nowwell into the fourth hour since the doors to the Sistine Chapel were closed. It’s getting darker and darker in theVaticanas thousands of faithful in St Peter’s Square and millions around the world await the result of the first vote. A reader mails in to ask a perfectly legitimate question about the history of the Roman seagulls and how they ended up in-land. Personally, I have no idea, but absolutely love the question. Having said that, turns out our Rome correspondentAngela Giuffirdaoffers a hint of what could be the answer here in one of her recent reports from the Italian capital: [A Rome zoologist Andrea] Lunerti said: “Rome really needs to get a grip on its waste management, otherwise we will be seeing even more snakes and hornets,not to mention the rats and seagulls – there are more seagulls in Rome than there are in Fregene [a nearby coastal town].” He said thatat least the seagulls helped reduce the numbers of rats and snakes.“A snake was captured by a seagull and dropped on to a terrace,” he said. “The city has become a proper jungle.” Last year Venice also had to briefly close its airport because of seagulls, but then that makes more sense given its location… In any case, if anyone knows the full story of the Roman seagulls, please email me atjakub.krupa@theguardian.com. As we wait… A lot of peoplefollowing the real-life conclaveprobably watchedthe hit Oscar-winning movie starring Ralph Fiennesto see what to expect to happen in the next few days. (I certainly did and,if Politico is to be believed, even some of the actual cardinals taking part in it did, too.) And my colleagueAdrian Hortonasked the right question: As a deft and highly entertaining thriller on the furtive process of electing a new pope, well, you can expect people to considerConclaveas close to documentary as laypeople can get to the action.But how accurate is it? Well, according to experts,more spot-on than not,and at the very least meticulously researched. Here are their answers in full: An X user even produceda helpful side-by-sideclip now, if you want to compare the fiction and the reality. The wait continues. I think I recognise most seagulls on this roof by now. If youwonder about the chemistry behind theVaticansmoke, here’s our explainer from the last conclave in 2013. Historically,some of the conclaves werereallydrawn out:in 13th century, they needed three years, over 1,000 days, to choose Gregory X. There was also one that ended on the same day, although it started earlier in the morning:Julius IIin 1503 was elected after just 10 hours. But in the last 150 years, it wasusually a much shorter process: the longest, forPius XIin 1922, took 5 days. Franciswas elected on the second day in 2013, after five rounds of voting; similarly,Benedict XVIneeded just four rounds to be confirmed as the new pope in 2005, as didJohn Paul Iin 1978. A bit more time was needed to confirmJohn Paul II– three days, eight rounds – in 1978, andJohn XXIIIin 1958, with 11 votes over four days. But then his immediate predecessor,Pius XIIwas elected after just three rounds. So, the recent history seems to suggestwe could very well have a new pope before the weekend. But since the process is so secretive and there are so many moving elements with a record-high number of cardinals involved in the process this year, there’s no way to predict what happens behind the closed doors. Let’s see. As we wait for black or white smoke after the first vote,some Catholic women campaigners released pink smokefrom flares, anddemanded that women be allowed to seek ordination, AFP reported. “We are saying to the cardinals, you cannot keep ignoring 50% of the Catholic population, you cannot go into a locked room and discuss the future of the Church without half of the Church,” saidMiriam Duignan. “Whoever they elect needs to be brave enough to properly tackle the question of women’s inclusion, because so far it has not been, even by Pope Francis,” said Duignan, of theWijngaards Institutein Cambridge. In the global church as a whole, women have begun to take some senior lay roles, a process that accelerated a little underPope Francis’spapacy.But even those who have studied theology and church ministry are excluded from the priesthood, and only priests hold the most senior leadership roles, AFP noted. If you want to make sure youdon’t miss the result of the first votewhen it comes, here’sour live stream showing the chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel: This conclave is billedas the largest and possibly the most unpredictable conclaveto ever take place. So let’s take a look atthe Vatican’s own statistics. There are133 cardinals electors(well, technically there are 135, but two were too ill to attend)from70 countries,up from 115 from 48 nations in the last conclave in 2013. The youngest one isMykola Bychok, 45, from Ukraine; the oldest isCarlos Osoro Sierra, who turns 80 in less than two weeks. Those over 80 are not involved in the process. 107 of them were appointed by PopeFrancis, 21 by PopeBenedict XVI, and five by PopeJohn Paul II. Thesuccessful candidate needs a two-third majority, 89 votes, to get elected. So, where do they come from? The highest national representation comes fromItaly(17) ahead ofthe US(10),Brazil(7),SpainandFrance(5 each). Here ishow it looks on the map:",

    "title": "Black smoke signals Vatican conclave has failed to elect new pope on first day",
    "article_text": "Plumes of black smoke have emerged from the chimney on top of the Sistine Chapel, signalling that the 133 cardinals sealed off inside have failed to elect a new pope on the first day of conclave. After the formal procession to the Sistine Chapel and each of the cardinalsswearing the oath to secrecy, the first voting round only got under way at about 5.45pm local time. Then all eyes were on the famous chimney, which was diligently guarded by a seagull for some of the time the cardinals were voting. After a tense wait, black smoke finally appeared at 9:05pm – to loud applause from the crowd of more than 45,000 below. The conclave will continue on Thursday, and end only when a successor to Pope Francis, whodied last month aged 88, is found. St Peter’s Square was packed even though the pope was not expected to be elected on the first day. Cinzia Caporali and her husband, from Tuscany, had come to Rome to visit Pope Francis’s tomb at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in the Esquilino neighbourhood. Caporali recalled being in the Italian capital the moment Francis’s predecessor Benedict XVI was elected in April 2005. The conclave that chose Joseph Ratzinger was over in less than 36 hours, one of the fastest papal elections in a century. “I was in a cafe not far away and people were shouting: ‘Fatto, fatto, fatto!’ [It’s done]. Then I went outside and saw the white smoke,” said Caporali. Now she was eagerly waiting to hear who the new pope would be. “I hope it will be a continuation of Francis,” she said. “He was for the marginalised people, and we need to make sure this continues. We don’t want to see the flashy richness of the church, this is no longer in fashion.” In his homily during the cardinals’ pre-conclave mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday morning, Giovanni Battista Re, the Italian cardinal who also led the funeral mass of Pope Francis, appeared to call for the same. Re implored the voters to cast aside all “personal considerations”, adding that choosing a new pope was “an act of maximum responsibility”. “We are here to invoke the help of the holy spirit, to implore his light and strength so that the pope elected may be he whom the church and humanity need at this difficult and complex turning point in history,” he said. He also urged them to be guided by love, because “love is the only force capable of changing the world”. Finding a suitable successor to Francis is a tough task, partly because he left behind a diverse but divided college of cardinals. Many cardinals had not met each other before travelling to Rome for his funeral. Some are in harmony with the progressive church Francis promoted during his 12-year papacy, while others want to overthrow his changes and turn back the clock. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Still, the feeling before the conclave was that no cardinal wanted the election to last for more than two or three days, in part because they do not want to give the impression that the Catholic church is divided. During twice-daily pre-conclave meetings in the run-up to the vote, the cardinals shared their visions on the future of the Catholic church and discussed issues including evangelisation, the Vatican’s finances, clerical sexual abuse, war and service to the poor and migrants. But one topic missing from the agenda was the role of women in the church, something thatFrancis was keen to promote, even if he repeatedly said women could never become priests. Catholic women’s groups, which for years have fought for women’s ordination, have converged in Rome in recent days. Bursts of pink smoke filled the air on Gianicolo hill, which overlooks St Peter’s, before the conclave began. The smoke was part of a peaceful protest organised by advocates from the UK-based group Catholic Women’s Ordination (CWO). “The cardinal-electors – 133 men – will use smoke signals to communicate to the world they have elected a new pope,” said Miriam Duignan, who led the CWO advocates. “As they refuse to listen to women and have rendered one half of the population of the global church silent and subservient, we communicated with them, also via smoke signals, in the hope they might open their eyes to the injustice they are upholding.”",

    "article_text": "A Norwegian bartered five kilos of semi-dried fish for a ticket to Thursday’s semi-final clash betweenBodø/Glimtand Tottenham in the Arctic Circle, as the hosts aim to become the first Norwegian club to reach a European final. Some 50,000 fans were vying for just 480 remaining tickets to the second leg ofBodø/Glimt’s Europa League semi-final. After missing out, Torbjorn Eide, a production manager at a fish farm in Senja, offered five kilos of boknafisk, a Norwegian delicacy worth nearly 2,500 Norwegian crowns (£182), in exchange for a ticket. “We produce Norway’s best boknafisk, and you probably can’t get it in Bodø city. So I thought maybe someone would want it,” Eide told Norway’s state-run broadcaster NRK on Tuesday. Oystein Aanes, who had a spare ticket because his brother couldn’t make the game, took the bait. “It was just a fun thing,” Aanes told NRK. Inspired by the deal, Nils Erik Oskal decided to try his luck with five kilos of reindeer meat. “Someone took the bait. It didn’t take long,” he said. Oskal’s trade could be worth about 1,000 Norwegian crowns. “But that doesn’t matter, I get to experience something huge,” Oskal said. Spurs lead the Norwegian side3-1 after the first leg of their semi-finallast Thursday. A late goal by midfielder Ulrik Saltnes gave Bodø/Glimt a lifeline befure the home leg. “It was more of a relief that we were able to lift ourselves a little and get into the game,” Saltnes said. “We are still huge underdogs, but at least now it will be a battle!” Bodø/Glimt are used to battling inEuropeand have taken some notable scalps this season and Saltnes says his team will play with no fear. “I think [Spurs] will play very similarly to the last game. We have absolutely nothing to lose, and we just have to attack as best we can.” Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion “We have to keep a cool head – it’s no use thinking we’re going to win the game in 10 minutes. A lot can happen, and we just have to focus on ourselves, even though we know it’s going to be an incredibly big challenge. “Making the final would be great, but I don’t think it would change much,” Saltnes added. “The experiences you have along the way are much more important than where you end up.”",

    "title": "Trump plans to announce US will refer to Arabian Gulf rather than Persian Gulf",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpplans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the US will now refer to the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf. The move has prompted outrage from Iranian leaders, and last-minute efforts are being made to persuade Trump to pull back from offendingIranin the midst of vital talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. “If Trump went ahead with the proposal he would manage to unite every Iranian, pro- or anti-regime, against him, and that is a near impossible achievement,” one diplomat said. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he hoped the absurd rumour about a name change was disinformation, adding that names of Middle East waterways did “not imply ownership by any particular nation, but rather reflects a shared respect for the collective heritage of humanity”. “The name Persian Gulf, like many geographical designations, is deeply rooted in human history. Iran has never objected to the use of names such as the Sea of Oman, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea or Red Sea. In contrast, politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned. Such biased actions are an affront to all Iranians, regardless of their background or place of residence. “Any shortsighted step in this connection will have no validity or legal or geographical effect, it will only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life and political persuasion in Iran, the US and across the world.” Arab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the Gulf. The term Persian Gulf has been used since Roman times and the Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, with Iranians tracing their history back to the Persian empire. The use of “Gulf of Arabia” and “Arabian Gulf” is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran – formerly Persia – threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company’s decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. But Trump regards the US decision to change how the US administration describes the Gulf as a gift to Arab leaders that will lead them to offer concessions regarding their relations with Israel. The move comes several months after Trump said the US would refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the“Gulf of America”. European diplomats trying to broker a deal between the US and Iran over the nuclear programme are urging the Iranian leadership not to “lose it” over Trump’s actions, but there are fears that hardliners in Iran opposed to the principle of talks with the US will use Trump’s gesture as a lever with which to argue the US cannot be trusted. But JD Vance, the vice-president, speaking at a Munich Security Conference event in Washington, gave a very upbeat account of the talks, saying: “So far so good ... Our proposition is simple: we don’t care if people want nuclear power. They can have civil nuclear power. We don’t mind that. But you can’t have the kind of enrichment programme that allows you to get to a nuclear weapon and that’s where we draw the line.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion He said the two sides might be on the verge of a deal that “reintegrates” Iran into the global economy. His reference to a “kind of enrichment programme” suggests the Americans may be prepared to allow Iranians to enrich uranium to some degree under the supervision of the UN’s nuclear inspectors, the IAEA. There has beencontroversy in the pastabout how US officials refer to the Gulf.",

    "title": "Court orders detained Tufts student Rümeysa Öztürk returned to Vermont",
    "article_text": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday granted a judge’s order to bring a Turkish Tufts University student from aLouisianaimmigration detention center back to New England for hearings to determine whether her rights were violated. A judicial panel of the New York-based US second circuit court of appeals ruled in the case of Rümeysa Öztürk after lawyers representing her and the US justice department presented arguments at a hearing on Tuesday. Öztürk has been detained in Louisiana for six weeks following an op-ed she cowrote last year that criticized the school’s response toIsrael’s war on Gaza. The court ordered Öztürk to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody inVermontno later than 14 May. A district court judge in Vermont had earlier ordered that the 30-year-old doctoral student be brought to the state for hearings to determine whether she was illegally detained. Öztürk’s lawyers say her detention violates her constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. The justice department, which appealed that ruling, said that an immigration court in Louisiana has jurisdiction over her case. Immigration officials surrounded Öztürk as she walked along a street in a Boston suburb on 25 March and drove her to New Hampshire and Vermont before putting her on a plane to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana. Öztürk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, the Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide”, disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties toIsrael. Öztürk’s lawyers say she has suffered from asthma attacks and received poor medical care while being detained. “Rümeysa has suffered six weeks in crowded confinement without adequate access to medical care and in conditions that doctors say risk exacerbating her asthma attacks. Her detention – over an op-ed she co-authored in her student newspaper – is as cruel as it is unconstitutional,” Jessie Rossman, the legal director, ACLU ofMassachusetts, said in a statement. “Today, we moved one step closer to returning Rümeysa to her community and studies in Massachusetts.” The Associated Press contributedreporting",

    "title": "UN experts demand action to avert ‘annihilation’ of Palestinians in Gaza – Middle East crisis live",
    "article_text": "More than 20 experts call on countries to act or ‘witness the slaughter of innocents’ United Nationsexperts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict inGaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”. This live blog will be closing shortly. You can find all the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the latest key developments: United Nations experts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict in Gaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory.“The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the humanitarian situation inGazahad reached “critical” levels unseen in the past and that it was urgent to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.Macron also said that whileIsraelwas entitled to fight a terrorist organisation, it was “unacceptable” it acted without respecting any rules. The UN’s human rights chief told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday that Israel’s plan for an expanded offensive in the Gaza Strip represented “a very dangerous moment” for civilians there.“What we see is only more destruction, more hatred, more dehumanisation,” said Volker Türk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, during a visit to Copenhagen for a UN meeting. “It’s a very dangerous moment for civilians,” he added, criticising the Israeli plan for an expanded offensive in theGazaStrip. The blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip “needs to be lifted immediately”, Türk told AFP.“Humanitarian assistance needs to come in. That’s an obligation, that’s an obligation under international law,” he added. The Dutch government, seen as one of Israel’s most loyal allies in the European Union, is calling for an urgent review of the EUIsraelassociation agreement, the basis for the EU-Israeli free trade agreement, the Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp told the Guardian.Veldkamp described the Israeli ban on the supply of aid into Gaza as “catastrophic, truly dismal” and in clear breach of international humanitarian law. Spain will present a draft resolution at the UN general assembly aimed at “proposing urgent measures to stop the killing of innocent civilians and ensure humanitarian aid” in Gaza, prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Wednesday.Sánchez told the Spanish parliament that “the international community cannot remain indifferent to what is happening” in the Palestinian territory. Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 59 people, including women and children, hospital officials said on Wednesday. The strikes included one attack on Tuesday night on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians, which killed 27 people, officials from the al-Aqsa hospital said, including nine women and three children. An early morning strike on another school turned shelter in Gaza City killed 16 people, according to officials at al-Ahli hospital, while strikes on targets in other areas killed at least 16 others. Aid agencies have criticised Israeli plans to take over distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza and use private companies to get food to Palestiniansafter two months in which the military has prevented supplies from entering the territory. It comes asGazahas been hit by a wave of looting and theft as increasingly desperate Palestinians struggle to get food while criminal gangs exploit a breakdown in law and order. Medical officials in Gaza report rising cases of acute malnutrition, and community kitchens that served 1m meals a day are shutting down for lack of basic essentials.Aid agencies say they have distributed all remaining stocks of food. “By the time a famine is declared, it will be too late. The crime wave is because you have 2 million or more desperate, traumatised people packed together with virtually no policing,” said one humanitarian official in Gaza. Israel’s hostages coordinator on Wednesday said the number of living captives held in Gaza since Hamas’s October 2023 attack remained unchanged, contradicting US presidentDonald Trump’s announcement that three more had died. “The terrorist organisation Hamas is currently holding 59 hostages. 24 of them are on the list of living hostages. 35 of them are on the list of hostages whose deaths have been officially confirmed,” Hostages and Missing Persons coordinator Gal Hirsch wrote on X. Donald Trumpplans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the “Arabian Gulf” or the “Gulf of Arabia”, according to two US officials.The move has prompted a push back from Iranian leaders. Iran has welcomed the end of US attacks on Yemen, its foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesdayafter president Donald Trump announced Washington would stop bombing the Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthi militia. Trump said Yemen’s Houthis had agreed to stop disrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East. Yemen’s Houthi rebels said on Wednesday that they would continue targeting Israeli ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden despite aceasefire deal with the United States.“The waterways are safe for all international ships except Israeli ones,” Abdulmalik Alejri, a member of the Houthi political bureau, told AFP. US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday described US talks with Iran as “so far, so good”and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon. Syrian interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on a visit to France on Wednesday met a whistleblower, previously known only as ‘Caesar’, who smuggled out tens of thousands of pictures depicting the tortured corpses of detainees under ousted ruler Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa and foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani “met with Farid al-Madhan, known as ’Caesar’, on the sidelines of their visit” to Paris, the Syrian presidency said in a statement, posting images of the meeting. Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa is to meet French leader Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, marking his first visit to Europe since overthrowing longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.In Paris, al-Sharaa will discuss postwar reconstruction and economic cooperation during his meeting with Macron, a Syrian government official has said. The Israeli government “must immediately abandon its plans for expanded military operations … in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip”, said Amnesty International.The organisation said the plans, including annexing territory and forcibly displacing Palestinians in the occupied and besiegedGazaStrip, would “gravely violate international law”. An Israeli drone strike on a car in southern Lebanon killed a Hamas official early on Wednesday, authorities said. Hamas said in a statement that Khaled Ahmad al-Ahmad, who was a member of its military wing, was killed while he was on his way to a mosque to attend dawn prayers. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted al-Ahmad, saying he was a commander with Hamas in south Lebanon and was behind several attacks againstIsrael. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has set up a backchannel for talks between Israel and Syria, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as Syria’s new rulers seek regional help to manage an increasingly hostile relationship with their southern neighbour. The indirect contacts, which have not been previously reported, are focused on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building between two states with no official relations, a person with direct knowledge of the matter, a Syrian security source and a regional intelligence official told Reuters. Greece backs an Arab plan for the reconstruction ofGazaonce a ceasefire is achieved, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday.“The first priority is for hostilities to stop and restore the flow of humanitarian aid to civilians,” Mitsotakis said after meeting Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Athens. UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions to Israel despite the governmentsuspending key arms export licences to the country in September, new analysis of trade data shows.The research also raises questions over whether the UK continued to sell F-35 parts directly to Israel in breach of an undertaking only to sell them to the US manufacturers Lockheed Martin as a way of ensuring the fighter jet’s global supply chain was not disrupted, something the government said was essential for national security and Nato. More than a dozen senior Conservative MPs and peers have written to the prime minister calling for the UK to immediately recognise Palestine as a state, breaking ranks with their own party to do so.Seven MPs and six members of the House of Lords have signed the letter toKeir Starmerurging him to defy the Israeli government and give formal recognition to Palestine in advance of key UN talks next month. Protesters interrupted the opening minutes of Barclays’ annual general meeting (AGM) in London on Wednesday. One protester said that Barclays “provides loans worth billions to armed companies”, while people outside gathered to shout “free Palestine” and “stop arming Israel”. Barclays’ chair, Nigel Higgins, responded that the bank would be “more than willing to answer questions on the topic during the Q&A” session. Some global airlines have again halted their flights to and from Tel Aviv after a missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels towardsIsraelon Sunday landed near the country’s main international airport.KLM, Ryanair, Wizz Air, United Airlines, Air India and the Lufthansa group are among the airlines that cancelled flights after Sunday’s attack. Israel’s attack on the airport in Yemen’s Houthi-controlled capital Sana’a destroyed terminal buildings and caused $500m in damage, its director told Houthi media on Wednesday. He said earlier in a statement on X that the airport was suspending all flights until further notice after sustaining “severe damage” in the Israeli strikes. Israelistrikes acrossGazakilled at least 59 people, including women and children, hospital officials said on Wednesday, reports the Associated Press (AP) The strikes included one attack on Tuesday night on a school sheltering hundreds of displacedPalestinians, which killed 27 people, officials from theal-Aqsa hospitalsaid, including nine women and three children. It was the fifth time since the war began that the school in centralGazahas been struck.An early morning strike on another school turned shelter inGaza Citykilled 16 people, according to officials atal-Ahli hospital, while strikes on targets in other areas killed at least 16 others.A large column of smoke rose and fires pierced the dark skies above the school shelter inBureij, a built-up urban refugee camp. Paramedics and rescuers rushed to pull people out from the blaze, reports the AP.The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes, according to the AP. Spainwill present a draft resolution at theUN general assemblyaimed at “proposing urgent measures to stop the killing of innocent civilians and ensure humanitarian aid” inGaza, prime ministerPedro Sánchezsaid on Wednesday. Sánchez told the Spanish parliament that “the international community cannot remain indifferent to what is happening” in the Palestinian territory, whereIsraelresumed its offensive againstHamasin March after a two-month ceasefire, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The socialist premier has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, which has caused shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Spain also broke with someEuropeanallies and infuriated Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu’s government last year by recognising aPalestinianstate. USvice-presidentJD Vanceon Wednesday described US talks withIranas “so far, so good” and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon, reports Reuters. Vance said presidentDonald Trumploathed nuclear proliferation and would be open to sitting down withRussiaandChinain the coming years to discuss reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world. United Nationsexperts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict inGaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”.

Syrianinterim presidentAhmed al-Sharaaon a visit toFranceon Wednesday met a whistleblower, previously known only as‘Caesar’, who smuggled out tens of thousands of pictures depicting the tortured corpses of detainees under ousted rulerBashar al-Assad, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Al-Sharaa and foreign ministerAsaad al-Shaibani“met with Farid al-Madhan, known as ’Caesar’, on the sidelines of their visit” toParis, the Syrian presidency said in a statement, posting images of the meeting. Syrian state media earlier reported that al-Sharaa had arrived in Paris, where he was due to meetFrenchleaderEmmanuel Macron, on his first visit toEuropesince overthrowing Assad in December. Madhan revealed his identity in February during an interview withQataribroadcaster Al Jazeera after being known for years only as a Syrian military photographer under the pseudonym ‘Caesar’. He fled Syria in 2013 with 55,000 graphic images taken after Syria’s war erupted two years earlier with the brutal repression of anti-government protests, smuggled in a flash drive. The photos, authenticated by experts, show corpses tortured and starved to death in Syrian prisons. He testified to aUS Congresscommittee and his photographs inspired a 2020USlaw which imposed economic sanctions on Syria and judicial proceedings in Europe against Assad’s entourage. Germany, theNetherlandsand France have since 2022 convicted several top officials from the Syrian intelligence service and militias. After war erupted, Madhan told Al Jazeera he was tasked with “taking pictures of victims of detention”. He had said that these included “old men, women and children, who were detained at security checkpoints in Damascus, and from protest squares that called for freedom and dignity”. He said he postponed his defection from the government forces and fleeing the country in order to be able to “collect the largest number of pictures documenting and incriminating the Syrian regime apparatuses of committing crimes against humanity”. In March, al-Sharaa signed into force a constitutional declaration for a five-year transitional period during which a “transitional justice commission” would be formed to “determine the means for accountability, establish the facts, and provide justice to victims and survivors” of the former government’s misdeeds. In Paris, al-Sharaa will discuss postwar reconstruction and economic cooperation during his meeting with Macron, a Syrian government official has said. Syria’s new authorities are seeking the full lifting of Assad-era sanctions but are under increasing pressure from Europe to show their commitment to protecting minority rights. Donald Trumpplans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the “Arabian Gulf” or the “Gulf of Arabia”, according to two US officials. The move has prompted a push back from Iranian leaders. On Wednesday,Iran’scurrent foreign minister weighed in, saying that names of Mideast waterways do “not imply ownership by any particular nation, but rather reflects a shared respect for the collective heritage of humanity”. “Politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on the social platform X. “Any short-sighted step in this connection will have no validity or legal or geographical effect, it will only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life and political persuasion in Iran, the US and across the world.” Arab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the gulf. The two US officials spoke with the Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The White House and national security council did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The Israeli government “must immediately abandon its plans for expanded military operations … in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip”, said Amnesty International. The organisation said the plans, including annexing territory and forcibly displacing Palestinians in the occupied and besiegedGazaStrip, would “gravely violate international law”. Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns, said: Israel’s declared intentions to expand its already devastating military offensive, further entrench its unlawful occupation of the Gaza Strip, and forcibly displace Palestinians could inflict a final blow leading to the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, who for months on end have been struggling to survive amid Israel’s ongoing genocide. Any attempts to weaponise humanitarian aid, use it to coerce forced displacement, or establish discriminatory aid distribution zones would violate international law and must be rejected. The international community must reject these dangerous plans and pressure Israel to comply with its obligations under international law and ensure unhindered humanitarian aid access throughout Gaza. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the humanitarian situation inGazahad reached “critical” levels unseen in the past and that it was urgent to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Macron also said that whileIsraelwas entitled to fight a terrorist organisation, it was “unacceptable” it acted without respecting any rules. Israel announced plans on Monday to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza as part of an expanded operation it says could include seizing the entire Gaza Strip. Greece backs an Arab plan for the reconstruction ofGazaonce a ceasefire is achieved, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday. “The first priority is for hostilities to stop and restore the flow of humanitarian aid to civilians,” Mitsotakis said after meeting Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Athens. He added that the plan was a realistic basis of discussion for the day after the war.",

    "title": "‘Desperate, traumatised people’: Gaza faces wave of looting, theft and violence",
    "article_text": "Gaza has been hit by a wave of looting and theft as increasingly desperate Palestinians struggle to get food while criminal gangs exploit a breakdown in law and order. Aid officials and witnesses in the devastated territory describe armed men attacking humanitarian warehouses, firefights over remaining food stores and a spate of stealing of supplies vital for survival, such as solar chargers, batteries, phones and cooking pots. Gaza ison the brink of catastropheafter two months of a total blockade by Israel, aid workers say, with many families down to one meal a day. Spoiled flour is being sold for 30 or 40 times its usual price and no fuel is available other than wood or discarded plastic. Medical officials report rising cases of acute malnutrition, and community kitchens that served 1m meals a day are shutting down for lack of basic essentials. Aid agencies say they have distributed all remaining stocks of food. Dozens of bakeries that supplied vital free bread closed last month. “By the time a famine is declared, it will be too late. The crime wave is because you have 2 million or more desperate, traumatised people packed together with virtually no policing,” said one humanitarian official in Gaza. Gaza City has been worst hit by the crime wave, though some incidents have been reported elsewhere in the territory. One group of armed men broke into two or three bakeries in Gaza City last week, hoping to find flour, then targeted a soup kitchen when they found nothing. In another incident, thieves took a community kitchen’s last stocks as well as all its pots and pans. In a third theft, staff at a distribution site run by an NGO were held at knifepoint as it was looted, while the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) said it had to evacuate staff on Wednesday after thousands of Palestinians breached its Gaza City field office and took medications. Louise Wateridge, a senior emergency officer at Unrwa, called the looting “the direct result of unbearable and prolonged deprivation”. Witnesses described clashes between armed thieves and security guards in recent days. Anas Raafat, a 25-year-old lawyer in Gaza City, said he and his family had been woken when armed gangs attacked a warehouse of a humanitarian aid organisation nearby. “By a miracle, none of my family members were injured. We lay flat on the ground for over two hours during the gunfire,” he said. Ghadir Rajab, 27, said she saw another NGO’s warehouse under attack by thieves. “When we heard the sound of gunfire, I looked out the window and saw people rushing from all directions to storm the place, searching for food and water. Others were fleeing in fear of being hurt. “There was a woman looking for her son, only to find out that he had been shot in the shoulder. She was running in the street … screaming “my son, my son!” She was begging for help, but no one paid attention, people were focused on stealing.Hungerhad blinded them.” There have been widespread reports of violent arguments between neighbours and an increase in domestic violence. Petty theft has soared. “There is no safety. We do not sleep at night at all. We take turns sleeping, leaving one person awake to guard against the rampant theft and looting,” said Mari Al Radea, 46, who recently fled the northern town of Beit Lahiya for Gaza City, where she and her nine children live in a tent. “Most of the tents in our area have been robbed. We didn’t even attempt to find out who the thief was because there is no police or security presence.” Al Radea described frequent clashes between hungry people or between shop security and looters. “Many confrontations also break out when there are attacks on food storage centres. Bullets often fall near us while we live in a nylon tent that offers no protection from gunfire,” she said. During the ceasefire from mid-January to mid-March, the militant group Hamas deployed police to the streets of Gaza, but these have been withdrawn after being targeted by Israeli airstrikes. Gaza’s interior ministry, which is run by Hamas, said on Saturday its security forces had executed six suspects and punished 13 others with gunshots to the legs in the past two days over looting activities. The ministry also enforced a curfew starting on Friday in some of Gaza City’s main streets. Looting in Gaza hit a peak late last year when convoys of aidwere systematically strippedas they moved into the territory after crossing entry points from Israel. In one incident, more than 100 trucks were taken and looted. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing and reselling aid to finance its military operations. The militant Islamist organisation denies the charge, and aid officials say little humanitarian assistance went astray during the short-lived ceasefire that came into effect in January. On Monday, Israeli officials said they would lift the blockade in order to implement a scheme to deliver aid as part of an“intensified” offensivein coming weeks. The plan involves a series of distribution hubs in the south of Gaza, which would be run by private contractors and guarded by the Israeli military. UN and other humanitarian officials have dismissed the scheme as unworkable, dangerous and potentially illegal under international law.",

    "title": "Trump says three Israeli hostages held in Gaza have died",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump said on Tuesday that three more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, bringing the number still alive to 21. At a White House swearing-in ceremony for his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump revealed that three more Israeli hostages have died in Gaza, meaning that just 21 of the hostages taken fromIsraelduring the 7 October attacks remain alive. “Well, we’ve gone very slowly,” Trump said of efforts to end the conflict, “because we want to try and get as many hostages saved as possible, and we’ve done a good job in that regard.” “Two weeks ago, I had 10 hostages come in, and they thanked me profusely,” Trump continued. TheOval Office meetingwas in fact two months ago, with eight former hostages. The president then appeared to recount a conversation with the freed hostages about how many captives remained inGaza. “I said, ‘How many people are left?’” Trump said. “They said 59. I said, ‘Oh, wow, that’s more than I thought’. They said, ‘Well, only 24 are living.’” “But now it’s 21,” Trump added, without revealing the source of his information. “That was a week ago. Now it’s 21 are living.” “I say 21, because, as of today, it’s 21. Three have died,” the president said. He did not provide any further details. “This is a terrible situation,” Trump said. The Israeli military, in its most recent update, said of the 251 people abducted 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 believed to be dead. Israel’s military resumed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March, ending a two-month truce that saw a surge in aid into the war-ravaged territory and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas’s attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 2,507 people had been killed since Israel resumed its campaign in mid-March, bringing the overall death toll from the war to 52,615.",

    "title": "Has UK-India trade deal ‘sold out British workers’ as Farage and Badenoch claim?",
    "article_text": "A multibillion-pound free trade agreement withIndiahas long been touted as a big Brexit boon. Cheaper clothes and shoes for British shoppers, a huge market forscotch whisky producersand luxury carmakers, and billions of pounds worth of extra trade are among the benefits of the agreement,which was finalised this week. But all these have been overshadowed by arow over national insurance contributions (NICs). The government gave in to a demand that when Indian workers are seconded to the UK on short-term visas, both they and their employers should be exempted from NICs for up to three years. They will make social security payments in India instead – and the reverse applies to British workers in India. The concession has been seized on by senior Tories, withKemi Badenochcalling it “two-tier taxes”.Nigel Faragesaid Keir Starmer had “sold out British workers to the highest degree”. Critics have also raised questions about the deal’s implications for immigration and farming. But do their claims stack up? The NICs concession is expected to cost the exchequer about £100m in lost revenue, a government source told the Guardian. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told broadcasters on Wednesday that this was “less than a tenth” of the £1bn in additional tax revenue the deal is expected to bring, and that it would affect about 20,000 Indian workers currently in the UK. Farage has claimed that half a million Indians arrived in the UK over the past two years and that “this deal will throw the doors open even wider” and make it cheaper to hire Indian workers over British ones – but all this is misleading, as most Indians applying for jobs based in the UK will not benefit at all. In the grand scheme of government spending, £100m is small change, but ministers have so far refused to publish their assessment of the costs or impact the concession could have on the number of Indians who come to the UK temporarily on company transfers. This has fuelled speculation. Ministers have, however, pointed out that reciprocal tax agreements of this kind – which are called double contribution conventions and are intended to stop workers temporarily seconded abroad from being taxed twice – are not uncommon. The UK already has them with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada and Japan. India has existing social security agreements with several European countries, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands. The issue was alsoon the table during the talks under the Conservativeswhile Badenoch was trade secretary. A senior Indian official told the Financial Times that the Tory leader was talking “rubbish” as she had agreed with the principle of exempting temporary Indian employees from NICs. Nonetheless,India’s boastful press release– calling the concession an “unprecedented achievement” that would “make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK” – has made the politics of this awkward for the government. And the fact that Rachel Reevesraised national insurance contributions for employersin her budget, a tax rise that only kicked in last month, means the wider context for it is particularly damaging. Finally, the NICs issue was one of the longest-running sticking points in the trade talks andemerged as the final hurdle last weekbefore negotiators agreed the deal. This demonstrates that it is a significant concession and one the government dug its heels in over. The fact that the deal does not include substantial numbers of extra visas for Indian workers – a key ask by Delhi in its trade negotiations – is a win. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Labour has claimed that the Conservatives put visas on the table during their talks and that the current government secured a deal without changing its immigration policy. One existing visa route for yoga instructors, musicians and chefs to come to the UK will be opened to Indian applicants, but they will need to meet the usual salary and skills requirements. The route is capped at 1,800 visas a year. This is a long way from India’s initial demands, but that has not stopped Farage and some senior Tories from claiming the deal will lead to an influx of Indian immigrants. Major service industries including the financial and legal sectors are not included in the deal, which has drawn criticism. In parallel with the trade deal, negotiators have been trying to strike a bilateral investment treaty with India, which would benefit the City of London. Rishi Sunakcame close to finalising an agreementwhile he was prime minister last spring but wanted more for the services sector, which accounts for 80% of the economy. Given the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs, however, Labour ministers decided it was worth getting the tariff-busting deal over the line by separating it from the investment treaty. It offers some benefits to the services sector, most significantly by opening up some Indian government procurement for British firms for the first time, but by and large, the deal cuts tariffs on goods. The deal will reduce UK import taxes on some Indian agricultural products, including frozen prawns. This has raised alarm about theimplications for British farming. Officials have said the deal will benefit farmers by lifting India’s tariffs on British food exports, including lamb. Meanwhile, the UK is keeping tariffs in place on some agricultural products such as milled rice, where Indian exports could be damaging to British producers.",

    "title": "India’s Pakistan strikes show how warfare has been normalised again",
    "article_text": "India’s string ofattacks on Pakistanovernight – a response, Delhi says, to the killing of 26 in a terror attackin Kashmir last month– comes at a time when warfare has become increasingly normalised internationally and the restraints of the global diplomatic system weakened. Though flare-ups between the two south Asian powers are nothing new, India’s Operation Sindoor is already notably more aggressive than recent military actions launched by Delhi against its neighbour in 2016 and 2019, raising the stakes for Pakistan’s promised response to what it says was “an act of war”. Nine locations were targeted in the operation,Indiasaid, and its military released video of what it said were “terrorist camps” being bombed in Pakistan. Four of the targets were in Pakistan’s populous Punjab region, which had not been attacked by India since the two countries fought a full-scale war in 1971. Pakistan said that at least 26 civilians were killed. Although India’s aim was, according its foreign minister, Vikram Misri, to “deter and prevent” further terror attacks, Islamabad vowed to respond, raising the question of how long a tit-for-tat between the countries could last. It is an uncomfortable moment, not least because India and Pakistan possess considerable stocks of nuclear weapons,each with about 170 warheads. Their armies and air forces are sizeable: India has 1.23 million troops and more than 500 combat jets, against 560,000 for Pakistan and more than 400 combat jets. Though nobody seriously expects all-out fighting, changes to the global context suggest that violence between the two nuclear powers could escalate. Shelling has already been taking place across both sides of the line of control inKashmir, with Pakistan reporting five dead on its side and India counting seven. “Over the past three years, the idea that countries do not go to war has disappeared. It’s a daily reality and one that has expanded the realms of the imagination for hawkish planners in hotspots around the world,” said Samir Puri, from the Chatham House thinktank. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022 and continues with daily missile and drone attacks amid unconvincingUS mediation efforts. Israel is nowplanning to seize Gazain its renewed offensive against Hamas, asDonald Trump appears to have lost interestin trying to end a war in which more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed. Countries thousands of miles apart have attacked each other. Iran twice launched complex long-range attacks on Israel in 2024 – “we are in a world where rivals and enemies are increasingly willing to lob missiles at each other,” said Puri. North Korea has sent troops to fight along side Russia inUkraine, though western powers will not send troops to help Kyiv. Military responses are less carefully calibrated. A rocket fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels that injured four when it landed near Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Sunday morning led to an Israeli counterattack that caused $500m (£375m) in damage to Sana’a airport, levelled terminal buildings and destroyed six planes. The Houthis vowed to carry on attacking Israel. Concepts of proportionality, designed to limit civilian casualties,have been strained to the point of obsolescence– giving cover to other countries on the attack. Overnight, Israeli strikes in Gaza killed 59 people, including an attack on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians that hospital officials say killed 27, including nine women and three children. Where there is better news, such as the truce agreed on Tuesday between the US and the Houthis, it came aftera seven-week bombing campaignin which the Trump administration said it had struck “over 1,000 targets” in Yemen. That includeda strikeon a detention centre for African migrants in Saada that killed 68 anda raidon Ras Isa port that killed 80, according to reports and conflict monitors. As the conflicts have flared up, the US, the world’s dominant power, appears unwilling or unable to effectively restrain them. Trump appeared to view military exchanges between India and Pakistan as to some extent inevitable when the news broke overnight, saying: “They’ve been fighting for a long time.” Pakistan, once considered a US ally in the “war on terror”, has largely been dropped by Washington after its withdrawal from Afghanistan. India, Puri says, may believe that “criticism of its actions from the US president isn’t coming, or if it is coming, it’s not particularly heartfelt”, giving it licence to be more aggressive than it otherwise would be. On Thursday celebrations will take place to mark the anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe. Eighty years later, however, such is the breakdown in norms in state behaviour that not only is war no longer considered taboo, it could be argued that a new age of global conflict has begun.",

    "title": "Pakistan PM promises to ‘avenge each drop of blood’ after Indian airstrikes kill 31",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has warned that it will “avenge” the death of 31 people killed in overnight missile attacks by the Indian air force, raising fears of an escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries. In a late night address to the nation late on Wednesday, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said: “We make this pledge, that we will avenge each drop of the blood of these martyrs.” His comments came after Pakistan’s government accused India of “igniting an inferno” with strikes on nine sites in Pakistan-administeredKashmirand the Pakistani province of Punjab and authorised its military to take “corresponding” retaliatory action against India. India said the strikes were a direct retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed25 Hindu tourists and their guide. India had accused Pakistan of direct involvement in the attacks, through Islamist militant organisations it has long been accused of backing. In an interview with the Guardian in Islamabad, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar – who is also the foreign minister – said the country would go to “any extent” to defend its dignity. “We reserve the right to authorise the armed forces to take any proper actions in response – and those will be measured, proportionate and responsible,” said Dar. He refused to be drawn into a timeline on any reprisal attacks but said the plans would be led by the country’s army chief Gen Asim Munir, who would consult with the coalition government. “What measures we can take when and where – I think it’s too premature to be discussed at this stage,” said Dar. “There is no minimum or maximum response time.” Dar was adamant that until now, Pakistan had exercised “patience and maximum restraint” in the face of India’s accusations and attacks. “Yes, there is a huge economic loss attached to any full-fledged war. But when the question [is] of sovereignty, integrity of the country, territorial integrity, dignity of the nation, then there is no price,” he said. Dar also expressed his frustration at the international community, which has so far been reluctant to get involved in the latest dispute between India and Pakistan, beyond urging restraint. Calls by Pakistan for assistance in carrying out an independent investigation into the Kashmir attacks had gone unanswered, he said. Under previous presidents, the US was highly proactive in helping to de-escalate conflicts between India and Pakistan, often averting all-out war. However, Dar noted that the Trump administration had been reluctant to take on the same mediation role. “Yes, in the past US presidents have played an active role. But each administration has its own style of working,” he said. He added: “It is also the responsibility of the global community because any consequences and negative economic impacts of any such war will not be limited to India-Pakistan. It will cross international boundaries eventually.” After India’s airstrikes on Wednesday, which killed 31 people, including several children, and injured dozens more, it jubilantly claimed victory over Pakistan. The Indian army said the strikes had targeted terrorists and terrorist training camps for two Islamist militant groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which have long been accused of freely operating out of Pakistan and have been implicated in some of India’s deadliest terror attacks. “We killed only those who killed our innocents,” said India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, while the home affairs minister, Amit Shah, said the government was “resolved to give a befitting response to any attack on India and its people”. The Indian army described the missile strikes as “not escalatory, proportionate and responsible”. Pakistan said that the “unprovoked and unjustified attacks martyred innocent men, women and children”, and denied the existence of any terrorist camps or infrastructure in the areas struck by India. This was reiterated by Dar, who said there were “no terrorist outfits” in the areas struck by India. For the first time since the India-Pakistan war in 1971, Indian missiles struck inside Punjab, Pakistan’s most politically and militarily important province, killing at least 16 people there. At a meeting of the national security council on Wednesday, Sharif’s government gave Pakistan’s military authorisation to take action to defend the country’s sovereignty “at a time, place, and manner of its choosing”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion At a session of parliament on Wednesday, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, co-chair of the Pakistan People’s party, which rules as part of the coalition government, reaffirmed the country’s right to defend itself and said that Pakistan’s answer to India’s attacks “has yet to come”. “Pakistan has the right to respond to this attack however it wants,” he said. Kashmir, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has beendisputed since the partition of Indiaand the formation of Pakistan in 1947. Both India and Pakistan claim it in full, but each administers a section of the territory, separated by one of the world’s most heavily militarised borders: the “line of control” based on a ceasefire border established after the 1947-48 war. China administers another part in the east. India and Pakistan have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. There were indicators that India had also suffered losses in Wednesday’s attacks, which were carried out by military aircraft and drones from within India’s own airspace. Pakistan claimed that about 80 Indian jets had taken part in the strikes, and said it had “exercised restraint” by shooting down just five. The Indian government remained tight-lipped about all aircraft reportedly shot down, but debris of at least three planes was reported in areas across Indian-administered Kashmir and India’s Punjab state. In the Indian-Kashmir village of Wuyan, Adnan Ahmad, 25, reported hearing a loud crash at about 1.40am. “When I rushed to window I saw an aircraft in flames falling down,” he said. “There was another aircraft moving above the falling aircraft. The aircraft landed near a school building, hitting trees. There were multiple explosions from the fallen wreckage for around an hour.” From the early hours of the morning, there was heavy firing between Indian and Pakistani forces across the line of control. According to officials in Indian-administered Kashmir, at least 12 civilians on the Indian side had been killed since Wednesday morning. Pakistan reported that at least five people had been killed from shelling on their side of the line. Parvez Khan, the chief medical officer of Poonch, one of the border areas that suffered the worst damage in the cross-border shelling, said 42 people were being treated for injuries. “Two of my relatives were seriously wounded when a mortar shell hit their home this morning,” said Safeer Abdullah, a Poonch resident who expressed anger over rising India-Pakistan tensions. “We’ve endured this violence for generations; our ancestors suffered, and now we do too. Every hour here feels like it could be our last. The shelling has been so intense that no one within 150km of the border can sleep or eat properly.” As the firing continued throughout the day, thousands of residents living near the line of control on the Indian side of the border were forced to evacuate to safer areas. They described living in terror amid what they called a “rain of artillery fire” that damaged homes, a Sikh temple, agricultural fields and vehicles. Another resident, Abdullah Khan, said he had been confined to a basement with six of his family members since the overnight attack. “Mortar shells have been landing around us since last night. While many have managed to flee to safer areas, we haven’t found an opportunity to escape,” he said. On Wednesday, the US, UK, China, Iran and UAE all called for a swift de-escalation of the conflict. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the UK was “engaging urgently with both countries … encouraging dialogue, de-escalation and the protection of civilians”. Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to halt their fighting, saying: “I want to see them stop. We get along with both countries very well, good relationships with both, and I want to see it stop.”",

    "title": "Kashmir crisis: what is Lashkar-e-Taiba and is it supported by Pakistan?",
    "article_text": "As India launches missile strikes on what it says are camps associated with militant groups inside Pakistanin retaliationfor last month’s massacre in Kashmir, attention has once again focused on India’s claimed relationship between Islamabad and armed groups involved in attacks in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, most prominently Lashkar-e-Taiba. Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is a long-established Islamic salafist militant group founded in 1986 inPakistanand designated as a terrorist group by many countries. Its 2008 attack on Mumbai killed 166 people, including a number of foreign nationals. Founded as the armed wing of the Markaz Dawat-ul Irshad, the centre for proselytisation and preaching, LeT emerged during the period of the then Pakistani leader Zia-ul-Haq’s policy of “Islamisation”, which aimed to turn Pakistan into a global centre for political Islam. Ideologically, LeT expounds a vision of a global Islamic caliphate including the reclamation of “lost” Islamic lands through the twin efforts of preaching and armed struggle. The UN security council says LeT has conducted “numerous terrorist operations” against military and civilian targets since 1993, including attacks on Mumbai commuter trains in July 2006 and aDecember 2001 attackon India’s parliament. While the group has focused much of its militant activity in the disputed Himalayan territory ofKashmir, largely because of its proximity to India, LeT has a broader hostility to India. LeT’s emir, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who was arrested in 2019 and imprisoned in Pakistan for 31 years for financing terrorism, has long insisted the group’s international struggle goes far beyond Kashmir and is aimed at the breakup ofIndia, including a strong element of violent antisemitism as shown in its attack on a Jewish centre during the Mumbai attack. Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) was founded by Masood Azhar on his release from prison in India in 1999. Pakistan banned the group in 2002 after it, along with LeT, was blamed for the 2001 attack on India’s parliament. The group had links with al-Qaida, founded by Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban, the UN security council has said. The relationship between LeT and other Islamist groups and Pakistani institutions, not least the army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency [ISI], is complicated and murky. While Islamabad has backed armed Islamic groups as proxies in Kashmir and Afghanistan in the past, the present links are more opaque. Historically, Pakistan saw support for armed groups in the 1980s and 1990s as a successful strategy, not least over the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. In a 2012 essay for theCarnegie Endowment for Peace,Ashley Tellis, an international security expert, wrote: “From the very beginning, LeT became a favoured ward of the Pakistani state because its local interests – fighting in Afghanistan and warring against India – dovetailed with the Pakistan army’s own ambitions: controlling Afghanistan in the west while keeping India off balance in the east. “For over two decades … the ISI maintained strong institutional, albeit subterranean, links with LeT and has supported its operations through generous financing and, as required, combat training.” While LeT’s emir denied being behind the Mumbai attack, the jailed US-Pakistani citizen and LeT operativeDavid Headley, who conducted reconnaissance for the 2008 attack, has said he coordinated with Pakistani intelligence officers over the Mumbai attack. What is less clear is the extent of Pakistani official involvement: whether LeT has been given a long rope to operate without sharing precise details. While Pakistan strongly denies India’s claims, Pakistan’s tolerance for groups associated with LeT, despite the jailing of Saeed, undermines its assurances including LeT’s “rebranding” as a charity, Jamaat ud-Dawa (JuD), which theAustralian governmentamong others described as indistinguishable from LeT. “Lashkar-e-Taiba has also operated under the alias Jamaat ud-Dawa (JuD), which was ostensibly created as a charitable organisation by the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba founder Hafiz Muhammad Saeed immediately prior to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba being banned by the Pakistani government in 2002,” it wrote. In 2018, on the 10th anniversary of the Mumbai attacks,Stephen Tankelof the Center for a New American Security, said: “Pakistan makes a cosmetic distinction between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, but the United States and the United Nations consider them to be the same organization and have designated it as a terrorist group.” Experts are less clear about the level of formal Pakistani support for groups such as LeT and Jaish e-Mohammed. Some have suggested the recent political turmoil in Pakistan may have led some members of the army and ISI into a more active role with militant groups, as has previously occurred during times of political instability when state security institutions have felt under threat. Tankel, however, noted a more complex, long-term dynamic. “Close observers of Pakistan have recognised for years now there is another reason: Lashkar-e-Taiba not only abjures launching attacks in Pakistan, but also helps combat groups that do. “It has not only gathered intelligence about anti-state militants – jihadists, as well as separatists in Balochistan – but also helped to neutralise them at times. Lashkar-e-Taiba has also promoted an ideological and theological counter-narrative condemning militant groups that attack the Pakistani state.”",

    "title": "India and Pakistan can ill afford war, but who will talk them down? | Hannah Ellis-Petersen",
    "article_text": "The uneasy calm that had settled over India andPakistanin the past two weeks was swiftly shattered in the early hours of Wednesday morning. In the days that followed thedeadly attackthat killed 25 Indian tourists and a guide in Kashmir in late March, the Indian government made it clear it held Pakistan responsible – and it intended to avenge the deaths. Meanwhile, the Indian public – horrified by accounts that tourists had been targeted and shot for being Hindu – was baying for blood. Newspaper columns and nightly discussions on TV news channels rang with calls for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to take decisive action against Pakistan and “teach them a lesson” once and for all. But a fortnight after the attack, with no clear impending action or military mobilisation in sight, some had wondered whether India really intended to retaliate. “What is going on?” asked one senior military analyst on Tuesday. By 1am on Wednesday, that question was answered. In highly coordinated air and drone strikes,Indian missiles hit nine targets, both in the part of the Kashmir region administered by Pakistan and in Pakistan’s Punjab province. It was the first time since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war that India had fired missiles into Punjab. India said it had struck at “terrorist infrastructure”: camps and madrasas that were connected to the two main Islamist militant groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in India over the past three decades. It emphasised it had not taken aim at any Pakistani military bases or weaponry. The strikes also took place entirely from Indian airspace, an apparent lesson from its last confrontation with Pakistan in 2019, when an Indian military aircraft was shot down over Pakistan and its pilot taken captive. To some, it seemed as if India was giving Pakistan an “off ramp” with these strikes, to prevent them escalating. As was widely agreed by analysts, both countries and their allies can ill afford events spiralling out of their control into an all-out hot war, not seen between the two countries since 1999. Pakistan is already in the midst of the worst security crisis in decades, as it battles a surge in Islamist militants on its Afghan border and separatists in its south-western province of Balochistan. The country is also in the grip of an economic crisis, with the Sharif coalition government widely seen as weak and unpopular. Yet in the buildup to the strikes, Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen Asim Munir, had already vowed that Pakistan would more than match any aggression by India. After India’s strike, Pakistan was unequivocal in its response: it was nothing short of an “act of war” by India. It furthermore claimed to have shot down five of the Indian military aircraft that carried out the attacks – which the Indian government has not so far commented on – and made it clear that it intended to go further. A statement by Pakistan’s national security council accused India of “igniting an inferno” and said the Pakistan army had been authorised to respond to defend Pakistan’s sovereignty. Pakistan’s military has long been the most powerful institution in the country. With the Sharif government weakened, the decision of how to respond is widely acknowledged to be in the hands of Munir. For those hoping for a swift de-escalation of tensions, this is a cause of concern. Munir is known to be an ideological hardliner on India and his comments onKashmirhave already been seen as highly inflammatory in Delhi. He is also known as favouring aggressive action and projections of military strength over attempts at diplomacy. “The worry here is that General Munir is not a thinking general; he’s rash, he’s reckless and he’s highly nationalistic,,” said Ayesha Siddiqua, a Pakistan political scientist. “We’ve already seen his gung-ho approach.” Pakistan’s military may also see India’s decision to strike at least three locations, including a mosque, inside Punjab as a direct provocation that could warrant a powerful retaliation. Punjab is not only the political base of the Sharif family but also the military heartland of the country, home to the majority of soldiers and the army leadership. Indian missiles have not landed there for more than 50 years. It remains unclear what targets Pakistan might aim for. While Pakistan accuses India of funding cross-border terrorism, there are no equivalent militant camps it could strike over the border. And to strike directly against Indian army targets could be seen as a direct escalation of the conflict. What analysts did agree on was that Pakistan was likely to strike sooner than later – and the longer the wait, the greater the chance of escalation. To some, the greatest worry of all is that India and Pakistan may have lost the US as a third-party mediator. In their 75 years as neighbours and enemies, Pakistan and India have been brought back from the brink of conflict on multiple occasions by crucial intervention by the US, a country that commands unmatched power and influence on both sides of the border and has always been willing to get its hands dirty in their disputes. Yet with Donald Trump in charge of the White House, the mood is very different and he has shown little interest in getting involved. “They’ve been fighting for a long time. I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said dismissively, after news of India’s strikes broke. Siddiqua said that without the US as a powerful, neutral mediator, altercations between the two countries – who are both looking to claim victory – could easily spiral out of control. “My worry is that, for the first time, India and Pakistan might be on their own here,” she said.",

    "title": "Iranians arrested in counter-terrorism raids allegedly targeted Israeli embassy",
    "article_text": "Israel’s embassy in London was the target of an alleged terror plot involving a group of Iranian nationals who were detained by police after a series of dramatic raids across England on Saturday, sources have told the Guardian. Four men remain in custody and are being questioned by police on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act targeting what police and politicians have so far only been willing to describe publicly as “specific premises”. Multiple sources told the Guardian that Israel’s embassy in Kensington, west London, was the building in question, though a spokesperson for the embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Sunday Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, described the arrests as part of a counter-terrorism operation that reflected some of the biggest threats “we have seen in recent years”. Police and the Security Service, MI5, believe the plot was at an advanced but not imminent stage when the decision was made to detain the suspects at the weekend. Arrests were made in Swindon, west London, Stockport and Rochdale. Believing that the attack was ready to be put into action soon, they made the decision to go in with armed officers and special forces to arrest the four men, aged between 29 and 46. On Tuesday Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said that police officers have been in contact with the affected site’s representatives “to make them aware and provide relevant security advice and support”. Investigators are trying to establish whether the plot was directed by Tehran, and in particular if one of its security agencies, the ministry of intelligence and security or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was involved. Any attempt to target the Israeli embassy at any level would represent a brazen, risky act against a site that is already highly protected, and would likely lead to serious political repercussions. At the time of the arrests, investigators believed the suspects were trying to obtain – or had already obtained – weapons to carry out an attack on the embassy. The decision to arrest was made at a joint executive liaison group involving police and MI5. Searches by police at two sites were still ongoing on Wednesday, four days after the arrests at gunpoint. Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in October thatIranhad been behind “plot after plot” in the UK and that the Security Service had uncovered five new planned attacks last year, taking the total since January 2022 to 20. In 1992, Israel’s embassy in Argentina was targeted by a suicide bomber, killing 29. A group linked to Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy from Lebanon, claimed responsibility for the attack at the time. Detectives can hold the suspects involved in the alleged terror plot until Saturday. Then they have to decide whether to charge or release the suspects or apply to a court for further warrants of detention for seven more days. A fifth Iranian man, 24, who was arrested in the Manchester area, was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. He has now been released on bail, with conditions, until a date in May. Ministers and detectives have declined to comment on the immigration status of the arrested men, or whether they entered the country legally or illegally. Police are already in discussions with the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which authorises criminal charges in England and Wales. A CPS spokesperson said: “We are working with counter-terrorism policing as they continue their investigations.” Three other Iranian men were also arrested in London by counter-terror police over the weekend on espionage offences in a separate investigation. The men – aged 39, 44 and 55 – were arrested and detained under section 27 of the National Security Act 2023.",

    "title": "British Steel to hire more staff weeks after government rescue",
    "article_text": "British Steel has said it will hire more than 180 new employees, as it prepares to ramp up iron and steel production for the first time since its government rescue. The company has started recruiting for 165 roles in Scunthorpe and a further 17 at its operations in Teesside and Skinningrove, to support production at its two blast furnaces. It comes less than a month after ministers recalled parliament toapprove emergency legislationto take control of the site and continue production, amid concerns that British Steel’s Chinese owner, Jingye, planned to let its furnaces run cold. There had been the prospect of imminent closure of the blast furnaces and the end of production of primary steel in the UK, with up to 2,700 steelworkers at Scunthorpeat risk of redundancy. British Steel removed the threat of job losses a fortnight ago after the government’s intervention. Increasing production could be one way of stemming losses of more than £700,000 a day at Scunthorpe, according to Jingye. Jingye remains the legal owner but the government has power to direct the company. Allan Bell, the interim chief executive of British Steel, said: “With the backing of the UK government, we are focused on cementing British Steel as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of steel. These are exciting opportunities across our business, offering rewarding careers, which will play important roles in building stronger futures for our business and the UK economy.” The government takeover prompted a rush in Whitehall to secure new shipments of raw materials to feed the two furnaces at the Scunthorpe plant, named Queen Anne and Queen Bess. Last month a shipment of more than 55,000 tonnes of coking coalarrived in the UKfrom Bluescope Steel’s plant in Australia. Alun Davies, national secretary for steel at Community, a union representing steelworkers, said Scunthorpe has been short of staff. “We regularly highlighted that there was a need to recruit to keep up with workload and reduce reliance on overtime,” he said. “This went unheeded for far too long. It’s good to see that the UK government and UK management team are taking swift action to address this by recruiting new staff across the business.” Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The new coal means steelmaking at Scunthorpe is expected to continue for months and there will not be a need for a“salamander tap”, a process in which a hole is drilled in the bottom of a blast furnace to let out, or tap, molten metal and other leftovers known as slag. The new open roles at the company include electrical and mechanical engineers, commercial, legal and occupational jobs, as well as entry-level shift manufacturing operators. British Steel said it also had opportunities in areas such as welding, nursing and customer services. The company will host a recruitment open day on Saturday 17 May at its Scunthorpe conference centre. The government and the company will have to work on long-term plans for the future of the site. While the blast furnaces will continue operating in the coming months, they are not expected to last more than a few years, with a shift tomuch cleaner electric arc furnacesexpected to be pursued.",

    "title": "UK officials land in Washington as talks over trade agreement continue",
    "article_text": "A team of senior British trade negotiators has landed in Washington as talks over a deal between the two countries gather pace. Officials from the business and trade department are in the US for much of this week, attempting to get an agreement signed before the planned UK-EU summit on 19 May. Downing Street did not deny reports the deal could be signed as early as this week, although government sources said therecent announcementby the US president, Donald Trump, of film industry tariffs had proved a significant setback. One person briefed on the talks said: “We have a senior team on the ground now, and it may be that they are able to agree something this week. But the reality is theTrump administrationkeeps shifting the goalposts, as you saw with this week’s announcement on film tariffs.” Another said Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs on films “produced in foreign lands”, which could have a major impact on Britain’s film industry, had “gone down very badly in Downing Street”. UK officials say they are targeting tariff relief on a narrow range of sectors in order to get a deal agreed before they begin formal negotiations with the EU over a separate European agreement. A draft deal handed to the US a week ago would have reduced tariffs on British exports of steel, aluminium and cars, in return for a lower rate of the digital services tax, which is paid by a handful of large US technology companies. The Guardianrevealed last weekthe Trump administration had made negotiating a trade deal with the UK a lower-order priority, behind a series of Asian countries. UK officials said they have been able to continue talks with their US counterparts despite that, describing the Trump administration’s approach as “chaotic”. Officials from the trade department arrived in Washington this week hoping to reach an agreement on two outstanding issues, pharmaceuticals and films. Trump has said he will impose tariffs on both industries, mainstays of the British economy, but has not yet given details. This week, the US president said the US film industry was dying a “very fast death” because of the incentives other countries were offering to draw American film-makers, and promised to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films. Britain offers producers generous reliefs on corporation tax to locate their projects there, which help support an industrynow worth about £2bn, with major US films such as Barbie having recently been shot in Britain. Trump also said thathe planned to unveil tariffson imports of pharmaceutical products “in the next two weeks”. The UK exported £6.5bn worth of such goods to the US last year. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has ruled out reducing food production standards to enable more trade of US agricultural products, as officials prioritise signing a separate agreement with the EU, which is likely to align British standards with European ones. Officials are racing to sign the US agreement before the planned UK-EU summit, at which both sides will set out their formal negotiating positions. Leaked documentsrevealed on Wednesdaythe two remain far apart on their demands for a youth mobility scheme, with Britain demanding that visas issued under the scheme should be limited in number and duration, and should exclude dependents. EU ambassadors met in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the progress of the deal. One diplomat said: “Negotiations are going well, the mood is still good but it is a bit early to see bold moves from one side or another.” This week Starmer alsosigned an agreement with Indiaafter giving way on a demand from Delhi for workers transferring to the UK within their companies to avoid paying national insurance while in the country. The concession has caused some unease in the Home Office, with Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, not having been told about it in advance. It was also criticised by Kemi Badenoch, who accused the prime minister of bringing in a “two-tier” tax system. The Tory leader deniedreports, however, that she had agreed to the same concession when she was business secretary. The prime minister defended the deal on Wednesday, telling MPs at PMQs it was a “huge win” for the UK. Other senior Torieshave also praisedthe deal, including Steve Baker, Oliver Dowden and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the latter of whom said it was “exactly what Brexit promised”. British officials say they have been surprised at the willingness of the Labour government to sign agreements which have been on the table for years but previously rejected by the Conservative government. With economists having recently downgraded the UK’s growth outlook, Starmer is understood to have decided to sign deals such as that with India, even though they do not include a number of British demands, such as increased access for services. One source said the approach was to clinch a less ambitious agreement and use that to build a fuller economic partnership in the coming years.",

    "title": "Bedfordshire residents say they have been left out of Universal theme park consultation",
    "article_text": "When it was announced thatUniversal Pictures, one of the largest movie studios in the world, was opening its first theme park in Bedfordshire, fans were ecstatic. Social media was filled with questions: Which film franchises will appear? How many rides would there be? Will there be a section dedicated to the Minions? For the people down the road however, the only real question was whether their new neighbour was going to push them out of their homes. Residents and businesses in Kempston Hardwick, a small hamlet on the edge of the town of Kempston, have said that they have heard “absolutely nothing” from the council as confusion builds about how the new Universal theme park will affect their day-to-day lives. Manor Road, which stretches only a mile long and contains a small hamlet of houses and a handful of businesses, separates the two patches of land which Universal have bought to build their park upon. Amol, the owner of wedding venue The Marquee Bedford, says that while he is excited by the project and the benefits it will have for the area, he feels that the people of Kempston Hardwick have been left out of the process. “We haven’t had any consultations, if we want to know something we all consult with each other,” Amol said. “We’ve had no contact with the council, absolutely nothing. Maybe they think it doesn’t affect us enough but they’re talking to the village 10 minutes down the road, so why not the people on the road?” Amol also feels that the roads through and around the proposed site are nowhere near large enough to deal with the congestion that the construction, forecast to last until 2031, will bring. Some of the houses in the hamlet are already boarded up, with residents saying some of their neighbours have sold their homes to Universal. They say that they themselves have not received any offers from the studio yet or communications from the council. Rahaul and Colbie are residents of the nearby Kempston and work on Manor Road. The couple, both 28, have had to accelerate their plans to purchase their first home together in the area. “We’ve been together for a few years now,” says Rahaul, “and this announcement has meant that we’ve had to ramp up our plans because very quickly it’s going to be far too expensive.” Residents said they were worried landlords would buy up property to use as Airbnbs for the thousands of people expected to visit the theme park, pushing up prices. Rahaul also says that while there was a meeting between a spokesperson from Universal and some local representatives, nothing that was said from the meeting has been passed on to the people of Kempston Hardwick, who rely on news from nearby towns and social media. Blake Stephenson, the Conservative MP whose Mid Bedfordshire constituency will host the Universal Studios Great Britain, has said that the park will be a “gamechanger” for Bedfordshire and that the feelings of residents were being considered. “My focus has already turned to infrastructure, including road, rail and accommodation, and ensuring that local communities are engaged … so that the disruption to local people is minimal. “I’ve been engaging with Universal throughout this process and met them in parliament again this week and I know they’re committed to being a good neighbour to our local communities.” A spokesperson from Stewartby and Kempston Hardwick parish council said: “As a parish council we have been actively engaged with the executives of Universal to ensure local interests were listened to and represented, to the gain of some infrastructure amendments to the original plans. We have provided regular updates to the parish via our newsletters and Facebook pages.” “The residents living in Kempston Hardwick, particularly those of Manor Road have a unique set of circumstances with the proposals and have had direct communications with Universal and it would be inappropriate at this stage for the parish council to intervene.”",

    "title": "Keeping Farage from No 10 is ‘a battle for UK’s future, heart and soul’, Labour MPs told",
    "article_text": "Labour MPs have ramped up pressure on the Treasury, calling for an economic reset after theReform UKsurge in the local elections and saying that the economy is stuck in a “doom loop”. The warning comes from the influential Labour Growth Group (LGG), a large caucus of loyalist new MPs who have lobbied the government to go further on planning and energy reforms. Its chair said that, without drastic action, the Reform UK leaderNigel Faragewas on course to become prime minister. On Tuesday evening, the cabinet office minister Pat McFadden toldLabourMPs they were in “the fight of our lives” to take on Farage and said it would be “a battle for the very future and the heart and soul of our country”. “This is the fight of our lives, this is the generational fight in this new political era,” he told a private meeting of MPs and peers. He said Labour would take on populist nationalism head on. “A new fight is taking shape,” he said. “It’s a fight between our values and a nationalist politics of the right.” The intervention from the Labour Growth Group comes a day after criticism of the government from another faction, the Red Wall group of Northern and Midlands MPs, who called for a “break away from Treasury orthodoxy” and a rethink of unpopular cuts such as the winter fuel allowance. Another group, Blue Labour, has also called for a stronger drive to reduce immigration, as well as economic reform. Chris Curtis, the Milton Keynes North MP who chairs the Labour Growth Group, said that the past nine months in power had seen cabinet ministers sometimes acting like “caretakers of decline” and called for an acceleration of the government’s ambition. “Britain is stuck in a complete economic doom loop. We’ve had low growth. That’s led to pretty awful cuts. It’s led to public services that are broken. And it’s led to disillusionment and division among the country,” he said. “Until we get out of that economic doom loop, Nigel Farage is going to become prime minister. I think the stakes are that high.” He said that Whitehall was “hooked on business as usual and will need shock therapy to get off it … No 10 talks about governing as insurgents, but we’re often behaving like caretakers of decline. They have to be more forceful in driving that culture through the system. “We should be treating the economy as an emergency on the scale of war or the pandemic. The heart of government meeting in the cabinet room every week to smash any obstacle.” His concerns were echoed by the Livingston MP, Gregor Poynton, also a member of LGG, who said that voters needed to see change was “still possible”. He said: “We cannot afford to let stale institutions, cautious regulators, pressure groups or vested interests stand in the way of that.” Joe Powell, the MP for Kenshington and Bayswater, said the government now needed to step up another gear. “It’s no surprise after years of flatlining wages and living standards people are impatient for change,” he said. “If we lose the insurgent mindset of opposition the country will continue to decline, so we need to be brave and accelerate making tough but fair decisions, including massively speeding up housebuilding and agreeing new forms of financing, so people don’t wait decades for new hospitals.” Curtis said low wage growth, cost of living pressures and huge funding gaps for schools, hospitals and police meant that people were seeing no real improvements in their towns or living standards. “Unless we start to get the economy growing again, we are not going to get out of this crisis. Farage will rise if wages fall. It’s as simple as that,” he said. Curtis said departments need to better stand up to “vested interests” and to stand up to lobby groups. “We are now going to have to make often very politically difficult decisions in order to break out of this cycle.” He said it was now clear that Labour had underestimated the scale of the challenge. “I think that’s probably a fair criticism. But that means that we’ve got no time to lose in ensuring we break out of this cycle.” Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion But Curtis also said that while the government should tackle high immigration, it would not be the means to beat Farage. “Anybody that thinks that bringing down net migration alone is a route to re-election is completely kidding themselves,” he said. “We could get migration down to zero by the time of the next election, but if people still can’t get a GP appointment and they’re feeling poorer, we’re not going to win the next election.” Jake Richards, the Rother Valley MP who is a member of LGG and the Red Wall group, added: “The only way we’re going to beat Nigel Farage is by getting out of the doom loop we inherited of dire public finances leading to unpopular cuts and low wages. That means reversing over a decade of stagnant growth with ambitious reforms. “We’ve had polling recently showing that Reform voters are by far the most financially insecure of all the major parties. Putting money in those people’s pockets is just as essential as robust immigration policy in showing them Labour can deliver.” Key figures in the different Labour groups plan to increase their coordination in the coming weeks to find consensus on how to apply pressure on the government, with talks expected between the groups over the next few weeks. Top of the list is a renewed drive to pressure reforms to Treasury principles – known as the green book – to force investment outside the south-east of England. Maurice Glasman, the Labour peer and Blue Labour founder, told an event at Policy Exchange that the Conservative party had been destroyed and “the same fate will befall this government unless it moves into the space the Conservatives vacated”. “Reform is a working-class insurrection against the progressive ruling class, and the only way to counter it is for the Labour government to lead the insurrection, to celebrate the collapse of the era of globalisation, to embrace the space of Brexit, the renewal of the Commonwealth, the restoration of vocation, the primacy of parliament, the integrity of our peace, the effectiveness of our armed forces, the protection of our borders.”",

    "article_text": "Elk could return to the UK after 3,000 years under plans by theWildlifeTrusts to reintroduce the “keystone” species into Britain’s landscapes. The Derbyshire Wildlife Trust wants to introduce elk into two existing beaver enclosures in Derbyshire andNottinghamshire, with the hope of demonstrating that the large semiaquatic deer should be released to roam free in the wild. Joanne Carnell, fromDerbyshireWildlife Trust, said they hoped to demonstrate that the “crucial ecosystem engineer can thrive in floodplain landscapes, shaping diverse habitats that benefit communities and support biodiversity recovery. It may also serve as a catalyst for engaging people in the long-term benefits of returning elk to the wild.” The same process was followed with beavers in England, which were first released into enclosures in wildlife areas around the country, before beinglegally released into the wildthis year for the first time. The charityRewildingBritain is awarding up to £15,000 to multiple rewilding initiatives, including the elk project and some that aim to restore bison and beavers to the landscape. Rebecca Wrigley, the chief executive of Rewilding Britain, said: “Keystone species like elk, bison and beaver play a vital role in bringing nature back to life. They help repair ecosystems and shape wild places in ways that benefit wildlife, people and the climate. “Successfully reintroducing missing species like these is absolutely crucial. It’s a complex process involving multiple stages of research and development, feasibility studies, impact assessments and community consultations. By taking the time and effort to get it right, we can create a more hopeful future for everyone.” European elk are closely related to the North American moose and can weigh up to 700kg (110 stone). They thrive in wetlands, where their grazing helps promote the natural regeneration of woodland, while their trampling helps maintain open clearings. At present, the UK has no wetland habitats containing both beaver and elk. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories.

    "article_text": "Donald Trump has tapped Dr Casey Means, a wellness influencer with close ties toRobert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, as nominee for surgeon general after withdrawing his initial pick for the influential health post. The US president said in a social media post on Wednesday that Means has “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials” – referring to the “make America healthy again” slogan – and that she will work to eradicate chronic disease and improve the health and wellbeing of Americans. “Her academic achievements, together with her life’s work, are absolutely outstanding,” Trump said. “Dr Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.” The news signals Trump’s withdrawal of his original pick for the post:Janette Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor. It marks at least the second health-related pick from Trump to be pulled from Senate consideration. Nesheiwat had been scheduled to appear before the Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee on Thursday for her confirmation hearing. Means and her brother, former lobbyist Calley Means, served as key advisers to Kennedy’s longshot 2024 presidential bid and helped broker his endorsement of Trump last summer. The pair made appearances with some of Trump’s biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative punditTucker Carlsonand podcaster Joe Rogan. Calley Means is currently a White House adviser who appears frequently on television to promote restrictions on Snap benefits,removing fluoridefrom drinking water and other Maha agenda items. Casey Means has no government experience and dropped out of her surgical residency program, saying she became disillusioned with traditional medicine. She founded a health tech company, Levels, that helps users track blood sugar and other metrics. She also makes money from dietary supplements, creams, teas and other products sponsored on her social media accounts. In interviews and articles, Means and her brother describe a dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation’s health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets, leaving them reliant on daily medications from the pharmaceutical industry to manage obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions. Few health experts would dispute that the US diet – full of processed foods – is a contributor to obesity and related problems. But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction. “Almost every chronic health symptom that Western medicine addresses is the result of our cells being beleaguered by how we’ve come to live,” Means said in a 2024 book co-written with her brother. Food experts say it’s overly simplistic to declare that all processed foods are harmful, since the designation covers an estimated 60% of US foods, including products as diverse as granola, peanut butter and potato chips. “They are not all created equal,” said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University’s school of public health. “It is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultra-processed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.” Means has mostly steered clear of Kennedy’sdebunkedviews on vaccines. But on her website, she has called for more investigation into their safety and recommends making it easier for patients to sue drugmakers in the event of vaccine injuries. Since the late 1980s, federal law has shielded those companies from legal liability to encourage development of vaccines without the threat of costly personal injury lawsuits. She trained as a surgeon at Stanford University but has built an online following by criticizing the medical establishment and promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes to reverse obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases. If confirmed as surgeon general, Means would be tasked with helping promote Kennedy’s sprawling Maha agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives and chemicals from US foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at federal agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs. Nesheiwat, Trump’s first pick, is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York and has appeared regularly on Fox News to offer medical expertise and insights. She is a vocal supporter of Trump and shares photos of them together on social media. Nesheiwat is also the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has been nominated to be Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. Nesheiwat also recently came under criticism from Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump who was instrumental in ousting several members of Trump’s national security council. Loomer posted on Twitter/X earlier this week that “we can’t have a pro-COVID vaccine nepo appointee who is currently embroiled in a medical malpractice case and who didn’t go to medical school in the US” as the surgeon general. Independent freelance journalist Anthony Clark reported last month that Nesheiwat earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in St Maarten, despite saying that she has a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine. The surgeon general, considered the nation’s doctor, oversees 6,000 US PublicHealthService Corps members and can issue advisories that warn of public health threats. In March, the White House pulled from consideration the nomination of former Florida Republican Dave Weldon to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His skepticism on vaccines had raised concerns from key Republican senators, and he withdrew after being told by the White House that he did not have enough support to be confirmed. The withdrawal was first reported by Bloomberg News.",

    "title": "Trump reportedly eyes $26m in funding cuts for US national parks",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is reportedly eyeing dozens of grants across the National Park Service for termination, according toreporting from the New York Times, one of several moves destabilizing the US’s investment in public lands. According to the newspaper, staff members at Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” have created a spreadsheet of federal grants earmarked for cuts, with total funding cuts amounting to some $26m. The proposed eliminations follow a familiar pattern for the Trump administration, with reasons given for program cuts including “climate change/sustainability”, “DEI” and “LGBQ”. Programs listed for potential elimination include “Scientists in Parks”, which places undergraduate and graduate students as well as early-career scientists across the country in natural resource management-focused positions. The focus on DEI, LGBTQ+ issues and climate change matches cuts “Doge” has made across the federal government, and specifically at the Department of the Interior, which houses the National Park Service. The interior department and the NPS were heavily hit byDoge’s early rounds of layoffs, along with the US Forestry Service, which managesnearly 200m acres (81m hectares) of public land. Since then, the administration has continued to slash at the NPS’s workings. Earlier this spring, the department closed theNational Park Service Academy, which was a partnership designed to bring Americans from underrepresented backgrounds into the park service and make a more diverse set of Americans feel comfortable working in and exploring the outdoors. Earlier this week,the Washington Postreported that the administration had suspended air quality monitoring programs at national parks across the country, issuing stop work orders to two companies providing the monitoring. Some park service staffers have requested that the stop work orders be rescinded. More cuts appear to be on the horizon. According to theNational Parks Conservation Association, the full cost of proposed cuts could bring a 75% reduction to NPS services in order to meet the goal of more than $1bn in reductions. Critics have said that cuts to the NPS, Department of the Interior and US Forestry Service not only risk the preservation of America’s national parks, but could putland management and fire reductionin jeopardy as well. They also have the potential tohit rural, and often conservative, parts of the country economically the hardest. National parks in particular can be an economic engine, generating more than$55.6bn in economic input, according to the National Park Service. Resistance within the National Park Service to the Trump administration’s plans has been spirited, withmore than 300 billboardserected across the country protesting cuts, andprotesters rallying in support of parksacross the countryin recent months.",

    "title": "Jon Voight defends Trump’s film tariff plan: ‘Something has to be done’",
    "article_text": "Jon Voight, the actor whoinspiredDonald Trump’ssurprise statementabout placing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, has given his first interview on the supposed plan to “give people back their dignity and their jobs”. “Something has to be done, and it’s way past time,” the 86-year-old actor toldVarietywhile he was, according to the magazine, “driving through what sounded like a car wash”. Voight, aformer leading man turned ardent Trump supporterwho was given the made-up designation of “ambassador to Hollywood” by the president, along with Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson, declined to provide specifics or logistics for the plan that has raised many eyebrows – and blood pressures – in the industry. He did describe the impetus for his plan, and his surprise at the negative reaction from across the industry. “How about enthusiasm and gratitude?” he said, insisting that the headlines did not square with feedback he received from unspecified others. “We’ve gotten a lot of good response from people,” he told the magazine. “We’re really rolling up our sleeves and working. I think we have a good plan, and we’re just beginning. This little team of mine has worked very hard to try to figure out things. The union people and producers give their expertise and understanding to this problem, and we’re working together. A lot of people had a lot of input and we’re listening to everybody.” On Sunday, Trump posted to official White House social media channels that he would institute a 100% tariff “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands”, a day after meeting with Voight at Mar-a-Lago. The president has since clarified that he is “exploring all options” for revitalizing the US film industry. Los Angeles has experienced a 40% reduction in film production over the last decade, according to FilmLA. Some of that business has gone overseas – to places like Canada, Australia, the UK, New Zealand, Hungary, Italy and Spain – in order to take advantage of local tax incentives, talent and landscapes that look similar enough to stand in for more expensive US locations. Other business has moved to states such as Georgia or New York, which offer generous tax incentives. According to Voight, incentivizing a shift back to Hollywood would offer more jobs for the rank-and-file in the film business: makeup artists, costume designers and camera people left out of work when local crews are hired abroad. “Every studio has a lot of smart people, and they have maneuvered the write-offs and the gifts that are being given out throughout the world to lure people to different countries. They take advantage of them,” Voight said of incentives provided by other countries that can save millions on a film’s budget. “Now we’re saying: ‘Hey, we have to have that here.’ Let’s have the level playing field. But really, we need more than that. We need to be competitive.” Voight also noted that he thought Trump was treated “unfairly” by Hollywood. “There’s been a battle, but now it’s time to put that aside,” he said. “And I must say, in all of the interactions we’ve had [on addressing runaway production], politics has never come up. Never.” The star of Midnight Cowboy, Catch-22 and Coming Home framed the current state of so-called runaway production as an existential threat to the US movie industry. “It’s come to a point where we really do need help, and thank God the president cares about Hollywood and movies,” he said. “He has a great love for Hollywood in that way. We’ve got to roll up our sleeves here. We can’t let it go down the drain like Detroit. “This shouldn’t be political,” he added. “I don’t know the political identities of the people we’ve talked to. We’ve talked to a lot of people here. I don’t distinguish them on their party affiliation. And if we can come up with [a plan], he’ll back us. He wants us to be the Hollywood of old … If we all come together, I believe we have a bright future.” Following outcry and confusion over the president’s tariff post, the White House walked back on Trump’s announcement, saying that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made”. Voight’s official proposal to Trump only suggests that tariffs would be used in “certain limited circumstances”. And it’s still unclear how tariffs would be applied to the highly collaborative business of film-making; Marvel’s new film, Thunderbolts*, for example, was mostly made in the US, but included location shots in Malaysia and a score composed in London. Not all of the response from Hollywood has been negative. The US performers’ union Sag-Aftra said in a statement that it “supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the US” and that it would “advocate for policies that strengthen our competitive position, accelerate economic growth and create good middle-class jobs for American workers”.",

    "title": "US jury acquits three Memphis police officers in Tyre Nichols beating death",
    "article_text": "A jury in the United States has acquitted three former police officers in the controversial beating death ofTyre Nichols, a 29-year-old father who was killed after a traffic stop in Memphis, Tennessee. On Wednesday, former officers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith were found not guilty in a state-level case that included charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. This was their second criminal trial, after facingfederal chargesfor Nichols’s death as well. In that case, the three officers were also acquitted of the most serious charges they faced, though they were found guilty ofwitness tamperingfor allegedly attempting to cover up the beating. There were five police officers in total involved in the Nichols killing, which took place on January 7, 2023. As video of the beating spread online, Nichols’s death reignitedthe debate over law enforcement violenceand the over-policing of Black communities. In the wake of the verdict, Memphis District Attorney Steve Mulroy told reporters that Nichols’s family was “devastated” and “outraged”. “We can understand why they would be outraged, given the evidence,” Mulroy said. “Was I surprised that there wasn’t a single guilty verdict on any of the counts or any of the lesser-included offences, given the overwhelming evidence that we presented? Yes, I was surprised,” he added. “Do I have an explanation for it? No.” All five police officers involved in the beating were members of the Memphis Police Department’sSCORPION unit, a now-defunct squad that focused on alleged crime hotspots in the city. The outcry after Nichols’s death led to it being disbanded. On the day of his killing, Nichols was pulled over for allegedly driving recklessly, though prosecutors have cast doubt on that motive, pointing out that police body cameras show no evidence of wrongdoing. Officers pulled Nichols from his car and tased him while he was on the ground. Nichols then attempted to flee. He ran into a residential neighbourhood not far from where his mother lived, where the five police officers wrestled him to the ground and proceeded to kick, punch and beat him with a baton. Cameras captured Nichols crying out to his mother for help. He died three days later in hospital. An autopsy identified his cause of death asblunt force trauma to the head. Two of the police officers involved – Desmond Mills Jr and Emmitt Martin – had avoided trial bystriking dealswith federal prosecutors in exchange for guilty pleas. The two reportedly took plea deals related to the state charges as well. Wednesday’s verdict was the culmination of a nine-day-long trial for the other three officers. The defence team for the three sought to shift the blame to the other officers for the bulk of the violence. It also accused Nichols of resisting arrest and not complying with police orders, leaving the officers fearful for their safety. “This is Emmitt Martin’s and Tyre Nichols’s doing,” said Martin Zummach, a defence lawyer for Smith, one of the three officers. Zummach also alleged that credit and debit cards not belonging to Nichols were found in his car after his beating. That, he told the jury, could explain Nichols’s decision to flee the scene. But prosecutors in the case argued that Nichols fled out of fear for his life. They also said the officers had a responsibility to stop the beating, which caused tears and bleeding in Nichols’s brain. Video of the beating was also shown to the jury from different angles, as the prosecutors tried to convey the violence of Nichols’s final moments. The trial, which saw seven days of hearings and two days of jury deliberations, took place in Hamilton County, a majority white area in Tennessee. A judge had previously ordered the court proceedings be moved away from Shelby County, where Memphis is located, for fear of that the public scrutiny could bias the jury pool. Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represented the Nichols family, released a statement after Wednesday’s decision denouncing the outcome. “Today’s verdicts are a devastating miscarriage of justice,” the statement reads. “The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.”",

But Means goes further, linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a host of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer’s, depression and erectile dysfunction. Members of the administration, such asRFK Jr, have attacked measures such as mandatory vaccinations and the use of fluoride in drinking water, both practices that scientists and health officials say have been highly successful public health measures. Attacks on such measures and traditional sources of scientific authority showed limited, but energising, appeal among a group of core supporters during the 2024 campaign, tapping into mistrust of medical expertise as well as common disillusionment with the US healthcare and food production industries. Critics say that appeals from figures like Trump and his allies tap into legitimate sources of concern while leaving their root causes largely unaddressed and simultaneously rolling back environmental and health protections. The announcement comes after Trump withdrew his initial pick for the key health post, a medical contributor on Fox News named Janette Nesheiwat, who had been scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Thursday. Nesheiwat had come under fire from far-right allies of the administration over her support for the COVID-19 vaccine and allegations that she may have misrepresented her academic and medical school history.",

    "title": "Pakistan vows retaliation after India launches air strikes",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has promised to retaliate after India launchedmilitary strikeson Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, fuelling fears of a broader confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan’s government on Wednesday pledged to respond “at a time, place and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty”. Pakistan’s military said at least 31 civilians were killed and 46 others injured in the Indian attacks and ensuing cross-border shelling, describing the strikes as having “ignited an inferno in the region”. In New Delhi, Indian officials briefed more than a dozen foreign envoys, telling them: “If Pakistan responds, India will respond”. It comes amid spiralling tensions following a deadly attack last month on Hindu tourists in Indian-administeredKashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-based fighters. Islamabad has denied any involvement. India’s government said its forces targeted nine sites it described as “terrorist infrastructure”, including facilities allegedly linked to the fighters who killed 25 tourists and one local in last month’s Kashmir attack. However, in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, residents said Indian missiles struck a mosque-seminary in the city centre. The building, which included residential quarters, was left in ruins, with five missiles reportedly killing three people inside the two-storey structure. Meanwhile, heavy cross-border shelling and gunfire continued along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing Kashmir. Officials said 13 civilians were killed and 43 wounded on the Indian side, while at least six civilians were killed on the Pakistani side. Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s Office claimed that five Indian fighter jets and drones were shot down during the escalation. The Indian embassy in Beijing dismissed reports of downed aircraft as “disinformation”. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar told TRT World that there had been communication between the national security advisers of the two countries, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif pledged that Pakistan would respond decisively. “For the blatant mistake that India made last night, it will now have to pay the price,” Sharif said on state broadcaster PTV. “Perhaps they thought that we would retreat, but they forgot that … this is a nation of brave people.” Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Islamabad, said that retaliation from Pakistan was widely anticipated. “Pakistan is expected to retaliate within the next 24 to 48 hours, and that’s something we’ve been hearing from politicians across the board,” he said. “They’re citing Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which says that a country has the right to respond to an unprovoked act of aggression.” India defended its actions, with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claiming its “targets we had set were destroyed with exactness according to a well-planned strategy”. “We have shown sensitivity by ensuring that no civilian population was affected in the slightest,” he added. Islamabad claims six sites targeted by India were not linked to armed groups. The Pakistani military said 57 commercial aircraft from multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Thailand, South Korea and China, were in Pakistan’s airspace at the time of India’s attack, putting thousands of passengers at risk. India has since ordered the closure of at least 21 civilian airports in the northern and western parts of the country for passenger flights until May 10, The Hindu reported. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Prime Minister Sharif and expressed Ankara’s support. According to the Turkish presidency, Erdogan praised Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies” during the crisis. In Washington, United States President Donald Trump said he hoped to help de-escalate the situation. “I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will be there,” he told reporters at the White House. “We want to see them work it out.” Uday Chandra, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, said while retaliation from Pakistan was expected, it appeared that neither country was seeking “an all-out war”.",

    "article_text": "Thick black smoke has emerged from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney, signalling that the cardinals sealed off inside have failed to elect a new pope in their first conclave vote. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Vatican City’s St Peter’s Square to await the smoke, which came about three hours and 15 minutes after the 133 cardinals were sequestered. Cardinals from about 70 countries were called back to Rome followingPope Francis’s death on April 21after 12 years as head of the Catholic Church. As they were shut off from the outside world on Wednesday, their mobile phones were surrendered, and airwaves around the Vatican were jammed to prevent communications until a new pope is elected. The cardinals will return to the Sistine Chapel on Thursday to vote again, and will continue to do so until one of them secures a two-thirds majority – 89 votes – to be elected pope. The start of the conclave, with a solemn procession of cardinals and other clergy into the Sistine Chapel, was streamed live on large screens in front of St Peter’s Basilica. Huge crowds waited in St Peter’s Square, watching screens that showed the chimney and the occasional seagull. While some left in frustration, those who stayed cheered when the smoke finally billowed out. “It would be perfect, lovely to be here for a new pope,” said Irish tourist Catriona Hawe, 60. “Francis was brilliant, progressive, a man of the people, though he didn’t move things forward as quickly as I would have liked,” she said. “The Church won’t be doing itself any favours if it elects someone conservative.” Black smoke emerged from the chimney over the Sistine Chapel at 21:00 on Wednesday evening, signalling that a first ballot has been held at the conclave and has concluded without the election of a Pope.https://t.co/hlmAJdskTOpic.twitter.com/AKxuUbDK2g — Vatican News (@VaticanNews)May 7, 2025 Reporting from Vatican City, Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid said the black smoke, signifying that a new pope had not been elected, was expected. “In no living memory has there been a pope that was elected on the first day of the conclave,” she said. “Usually this first vote is a way for the cardinals to understand how things are going and in which direction their fellow electors are thinking,” before they return to the guesthouse where they are staying for the election, said Abdel-Hamid. Francis named 108 of the 133 “princes of the church,” choosing many pastors from countries including Mongolia, Sweden and Tonga that had never had a cardinal before. His decision to surpass the usual limit of 120 cardinal electors has injected an extra degree of uncertainty in a process that is always full of suspense. Many cardinals had not met until last week and lamented they needed more time to get to know one another, raising questions about how long it might take for one man to secure the votes necessary to become the 267th pope. Both Francis and his predecessor, Benedict XVI, were elected within two days, but the longest papal election lasted 1,006 days, from 1268 to 1271. There is no clear frontrunner to succeed Francis, with the cardinals representing a range of progressive and conservative traditions within the Church. More than a dozen names are circulating, from Italian Pierbattista Pizzaballa to Hungary’s Peter Erdo and Sri Lanka’s Malcolm Ranjith. But there are numerous challenges facing the 2,000-year-old institution: falling priest numbers, the role of women, the Vatican’s troubled balance sheets, adapting the Church to the modern world, the continued fallout from the clerical child abuse scandal and – in the West – increasingly empty pews. The new pope will also have to face diplomatic balancing acts at a time of geopolitical uncertainty, as well as deep splits within the Church.",

    "title": "PSG defeat Arsenal to set up Champions League final with Inter Milan",
    "article_text": "Paris Saint-Germain weathered one attack after another and showed remarkable adaptability to hold off and defeat an inspired Arsenal 2-1 to reach the Champions League final. Deprived of the ball possession they so often enjoy, PSG looked in trouble early on but found the right answers to hurt the Gunners in the match on Wednesday. They relied on counter-attacking football and an excellent Gianluigi Donnarumma to prevail, advancing 3-1 on aggregate. “The feedback straightaway from their bench is that we were much better than them,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told TNT Sports after the game. “When you look at the two games, the best player on the pitch has been their goalkeeper. He has made a difference for them in the tie. “We were much closer than the results showed. I am very proud of the players, the way we handled the pressure, and after 20 minutes, it should have been 3-0. “We are not there, and that has to hurt.” PSG reached the final of Europe’s elite tournament for the second time in five years. They will take on Inter Milan on May 31 after the three-time champion defeated Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in one of the greatest semifinals in the competition’s history. PSG had lost to Borussia Dortmund at this stage last year and was beaten by Bayern Munich in the 2020 final. PSG broke the deadlock in the 27th minute from a set piece after the Arsenal defence cleared a free kick towards the edge of the area. The ball bounced back into the path of Fabian Ruiz, who smashed a stunning half-volley into the back of the net. Achraf Hakimi curled in a precise finish in the 72nd minute to make it 2-0 on the night, before Bukayo Saka pulled one back for the Gunners. The England forward then spurned an open goal minutes later and, with it, the last real chance for a comeback to truly be mounted. PSG had earlier missed the chance to double their lead from the penalty spot when Ferreira Vitinha had his kick saved by David Raya. The kick itself was somewhat controversial in that VAR (video assistant referee) called back play when Myles Lewis-Skelly’s hand was innocuously clipped by Hakimi’s shot. “Over the two legs, we could have scored three or four more goals,” Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice told TNT Sports. “Sometimes, you have to lose a few to win, you have to overcome some of these setbacks to grow as a player and a team. “We are growing as a team, but we need to keep pushing and believing. This is why we play. There will be setbacks on the way. “PSG have gone through, but this isn’t going to define us. We’ll be back and we’ll get our players back and will be a much stronger outfit.”",

    "title": "US court says student activist Rumeysa Ozturk must be sent to Vermont",
    "article_text": "The administration of President Donald Trump has continued to face setbacks in its attempts to deport pro-Palestinian student protesters, as courts probe whether the students’ rights have been violated. On Wednesday, separate courts issued orders related to two of the most high-profile cases: that of Mahmoud Khalil andRumeysa Ozturk. In New York, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish student from Tufts University, be moved to Vermont no later than May 14. That ruling marked a rejection of a Trump administration appeal to delay the transfer and keep Ozturk in Louisiana, where she has been held in an immigration detention centre since late March. “We’re grateful the court refused the government’s attempt to keep her isolated from her community and her legal counsel as she pursues her case for release,” said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Ozturk. Separately, in Newark, New Jersey, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to deliver specifics about its rationale for describing Khalil, a leader in Columbia University’s student protests, as a threat to US foreign policy. The latest ruling inOzturk’s casehighlighted a practice that has become common under the Trump administration: Many foreign students involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement have been transferred to detention centres far from their homes. Ozturk’s ordeal began on March 25, when six plain-clothed police officers arrested her outside her home in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, where she went to school. Supporters believe Ozturk, a PhD student and Fulbright scholar from Turkiye, was targeted for having co-written an opinion article in her student newspaper, calling on Tufts University to acknowledge Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide. The US is a longtime ally of Israel and has supported its military campaign in Gaza. The Trump administration has accused Ozturk of having “engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans”, though it has not offered evidence. After she was detained outside her home, Ozturk was reportedly whisked across state borders, first to Vermont and later to Louisiana, all within a 24-hour period, according to her lawyers. Critics have described those rapid transfers as a means of subverting due process, separating foreign students from family, friends and legal resources they can otherwise draw upon. In Ozturk’s case, the confusion led her lawyers to file a petition for her release in Massachusetts, as they did not know where she was when they submitted the paperwork. On April 18, a lower court ruled that Ozturk must be returned to Vermont no later than May 1, as it weighed her habeas petition: a type of complaint that challenges the legality of one’s detention. “No one should be arrested and locked up for their political views. Every day that Rumeysa Ozturk remains in detention is a day too long,” Bhandari, her lawyer, said in a statement. But the Trump administration appealed, seeking an emergency stay of Ozturk’s transfer to Vermont. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected (PDF) that request, however. It said the government had failed to show any “irreparable harm” that Ozturk’s transfer would cause. “Faced with such a conflict between the government’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, and the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Ozturk on the other, we have little difficulty concluding ‘that the balance of hardships tips decidedly’ in her favor,” the court wrote. Though Ozturk is expected to be transferred to Vermont, where her habeas petition will be heard, the Trump administration is slated to continue with deportation proceedings in Louisiana. The appeals court, however, explained that this should be no challenge for the Trump administration, given that Ozturk can appear through video conference for those hearings. “The government asserts that it would face difficulties in arranging for Ozturk to appear for her immigration proceedings in Louisiana remotely,” the court wrote. “But the government has not disputed that it is legally and practically possible for Ozturk to attend removal proceedings remotely.” The Trump administration has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court. Likewise, Khalil faces deportation proceedings in Louisiana while his habeas petition is heard in New Jersey, closer to his home in New York City. On March 8, he became the first high-profile case of a student protester being arrested for deportation. Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrived at his student housing building at Columbia University, where his wife, a US citizen, filmed him being handcuffed and led away. Khalil himself was a US permanent resident who recently graduated from Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. He is of Palestinian descent. On Tuesday, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey rejected a bid by the Trump administration to transfer Khalil’s habeas petition to Louisiana. And on Wednesday, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered the Trump administration to provide a specific assessment of the risks Khalil poses by being in the US. Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s detention and deportation. A rarely used provision of the law allows secretaries of state to remove noncitizens who could cause “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”. But Rubio has so far been vague about what those consequences might be in Khalil’s case. The student protest leader has been charged with no crime. Judge Farbiarz also required the Trump team to supply a catalogue of every case in which US officials have employed that law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal that judge’s order as well.",

    "title": "Syria’s al-Sharaa confirms indirect talks with Israel amid soaring tensions",
    "article_text": "Syrian’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaasays his government has engaged in indirect talks with Israel in an attempt to ease escalating tensions between the two nations. The announcement comes after an escalation in Israeli attacks on Syria last week, including a strike that landed just 500 metres (1,640 feet) from the presidential palace in Damascus on Friday. Israel claimed its most recent air strikes were a response to what it described as threats to the country’s minority Druze community. “There are indirect talks with Israel through mediators to calm and attempt to absorb the situation so that it does not reach a level that both sides lose control over,” al-Sharaa said, reiterating blame on Israel over what he described as its “random interventions” in Syria. He also said Damascus was talking to states that communicate with Israel to “pressure them to stop intervening in Syrian affairs and bomb some of its infrastructure.” There was no immediate comment from Israeli authorities. Al-Sharaa’s remarks come during a landmark visit to Paris, his first trip to a European country since assuming office after he led opposition fighters in a lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December. The visit required a special exemption from the United Nations, asal-Sharaa remains under international sanctionsdue to his previous role as leader of the armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate. Speaking in Paris after meeting President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, al-Sharaa called for the lifting of economic restrictions on Syria, stating: “Nothing justifies maintaining sanctions imposed on the previous regimes.” President Macron said France would consider gradually lifting European Union sanctions if Syria continued along its current path. “I told the president that if he continues on his path, we would do the same, namely by first progressively lifting European sanctions, and then we would also lobby our American partners to follow suit on this matter,” Macron said. The European Union has already lifted some restrictions, while other measures targeting individuals and entities are set to expire on 1 June. Sanctions relief in sectors such as oil, gas, electricity and transport remain crucial for Syria, where the World Bank estimates reconstruction of the country could cost more than $250bn. Despite some easing of sanctions by European countries, the Trump administration has been more reserved in its approach to the new Syrian administration. Macron revealed that he is urging the United States to delay its planned military withdrawal from Syria, arguing that lifting sanctions should be prioritised as a step towards ensuring long-term stability. Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said, “In return, Macron expects Syria’s new government to protect minorities, ensure stability and crack down on what he called terrorist organisations, including ISIS.” “Sharaa is here to project a reassuring image to France’s Western allies, who have been a little bit wary and are looking to see what direction the new leadership takes,” Butler added.",

    "title": "US Federal Reserve holds rates steady, warns of higher unemployment",
    "article_text": "The US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged, brushing off President Donald Trump’s demands to lower borrowing costs, and said that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. The Central Bank kept its benchmark rate at 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, where it has been since December, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year. Its vote to hold rates steady was unanimous. In a statement, the Fed said that “uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further”, as it justified keeping rates consistent despite pressure from the White House. Many economists and Wall Street investors still expect the Fed will reduce rates two or three times this year, but the sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump have injected a tremendous amount of uncertainty into the US economy and the Fed’s policies. It is unusual for the Fed to say that the risk of both prices and unemployment have increased. But economists say that is the threat created by Trump’s sweeping tariffs. The import taxes could both lift inflation by making imported parts and finished goods more expensive, while also raising unemployment by causing companies to cut jobs as their costs rise. The economy overall has “continued to expand at a solid pace”, the Fed said in a policy statement, attributing a drop in first-quarter output to record imports as businesses and households rushed to front-run new import taxes. The Fed said that it was also “strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.” The Fed said that one of the driving factors behind its decision is the state of the labour market, as well as “inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” The US Labor Department in thejobs report published last weekshowed 177,000 jobs were added to the US economy consistent with growth levels over the last 12 months. The report, however, was on employment before “liberation day”, when Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy, which has since driven global economic uncertainty. The ADP jobs report, which is a more immediate metric, showed job growth at 62,000. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after the interest rate decision that leaving rates unchanged keeps the central bank in a good position to respond. “For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” Powell told reporters. “It’s still a healthy economy, albeit one that is shrouded in some very downbeat sentiment on the part of people and businesses,” he added. “The Fed statement was a statement of the obvious. They gave roughly equal airtime to the threats to growth and inflation, so that tells us we need to wait and see how the data shake out between now and the June meeting before deciding whether they’re going to prioritise keeping inflation expectations contained or to address any hit to growth,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. The unchanged rates come despite increased pressure from Trump to lower rates. Powell has long stressed the importance of an independent central bank. He said the pressure from the president has not changed their decision-making process. When asked why he has not sought a discussion with the president amid Trump’s public rebukes, Powell said, “I’ve never asked for a meeting with any president and I never will.”",

    "title": "Ford to raise prices on three cars produced in Mexico: Report",
    "article_text": "Ford Motor Company has raised prices for three of its vehicles produced in Mexico, becoming one of the first major carmakers to adjust sticker prices followingUS President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The new prices took effect on vehicles produced on May 2 or later, according to the news agency Reuters, which first reported the story on Wednesday. Prices on the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up — one of its most affordable and popular vehicles— and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000 on some models, according to a notice sent to dealers, which was reviewed by Reuters.  A Ford spokesperson said the cars with the raised price tag would arrive at dealer lots in late June. Ford said the trade war would add about $2.5bn in costs for 2025, but it expects to reduce that exposure by about $1bn. General Motors said last week that tariffs were projected to cost it between $4bn and $5bn following the imposition of hefty levies on foreign imports of automobiles, but it expected to offset that by at least 30 percent. Trump’s tariffs have unleashed weeks of uncertainty across the auto sector, as major carmakers in the United States and Europehave pulled forecasts,shifted production and caused companies to idle plants. Following weeks of pushback from the auto industry, Trump softened his tariffs on foreign auto parts imports to give carmakers credits for what is produced in the US and to avoid double-tariffs on raw materials used in production. However, the White House has not rescinded a 25-percent tariff on the 8 million vehicles the US imports annually. Ford is in a better position to weather tariffs than some of its competitors because of its strong US manufacturing base. The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker assembles 79 percent of its US-sold vehicles domestically, compared with GM’s 53 percent, according to an analyst note from Barclays. Ford and GM also face significant levies on imports from China and South Korea, respectively. GM estimated that the costs on its Korean imports totalled about $2bn, while Ford declined to specify the expenses around importing vehicles from China. Automakers that rely on exports to the USare facing increased pricing pressure. A dozen major carmakers, including Toyota and GM, import at least 40 percent of the vehicles they sell in the US, with some, such as Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor, importing more than 60 percent, according to 2024 data from S&P Global Mobility. Before Ford’s move, most carmakers had not taken the step of boosting prices, but had warned that it was on the way. Porsche said it would have to boost its selling cost if tariffs remained in place, while US Volkswagen’s Audi brand also suggested potential price increases, without providing any details. By contrast, BMW expects US car tariffs to decline from July, based on its contacts with US officials – a more upbeat assessment of the trade climate than many rivals. GM’s finance chief, Paul Jacobson, told analysts last week that the automaker was not expecting imminent price increases, saying they “feel good about where the pricing environment is today”.",

    "title": "Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls for renewed Franco-German cooperation",
    "article_text": "German ChancellorFriedrich Merzhas called for a renewed partnership with France to help Europe confront its “enormous” security and economic challenges. At a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Wednesday, Merz outlined a joint vision for deeper European integration, calling for a “new push for Europe” grounded in closer Franco-German cooperation. “We will only be able to meet these challenges if France and Germany stand even more closely together than in the past,” Merz said. “That is why Emmanuel Macron and I have agreed on a new Franco-German push for Europe.” Among the initiatives discussed was the strengthening of the Franco-German Defence and Security Council, Merz said. “We want to better coordinate our support for Ukraine within this framework, align our national defence planning and procurement projects even more closely, and also find new answers to strategic questions of security and defence policy,” Merz added. The meeting comes at a time of mounting concern across Europe about the reliability of US security guarantees amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. In a joint op-ed published in Le Figaro, Merz and Macron affirmed their shared commitment to “contribute to a just and lasting peace [in Ukraine], with the support of the United States on security, and strong security guarantees”. Macron said the two countries would fast-track new defence capabilities. The visit to Paris follows a rocky start to Merz’s chancellorship after he needed an unprecedented two rounds of voting in the Bundestag to be elected Chancellor, suggesting underlying divisions within the new governing coalition between his centre-right CDU/CSU alliance and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). But in a potential shift towards a more unified German foreign policy, Merz now presides over a government in which both the chancellery and foreign ministry are held by the same party for the first time in years. He has also pledged to establish a national security council within the chancellery, aimed at improving coordination across foreign, development, and defence policy. Later on Wednesday, Merz is due to travel to Poland. Speaking to German state broadcaster ZDF, Merz added that he intended to work with Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to shape a tougher EU-wide migration framework.",

    "title": "Two-thirds of global warming caused by world’s richest 10%, study finds",
    "article_text": "The wealthiest 10 percent of the world’s people are responsible for two-thirds of the global warming since 1990, according to researchers. The way in which the rich consume and invest has substantially increased the risk of heatwaves and droughts, wrote the researchers ofa studypublished on Wednesday in the monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Climate Change. This is the first study to quantify the impact of concentrated private wealth on extreme climate events. “We link the carbon footprints of the wealthiest individuals directly to real-world climate impacts,” lead author Sarah Schoengart, a scientist at the public university of ETH Zurich, told the AFP news agency. “It’s a shift from carbon accounting toward climate accountability.” Compared with the global average, for example, the richest 1 percent contributed 26 times more to once-a-century heatwaves and 17 times more to droughts in the Amazon, according to the study. Emissions from the wealthiest 10 percent in China and the United States – which together account for nearly half of global carbon pollution – each led to a two- to threefold rise in heat extremes. “If everyone had emitted like the bottom 50 percent of the global population, the world would have seen minimal additional warming since 1990,” co-author Carl-Friedrich Schleussner said. “Addressing this imbalance is crucial for fair and effective climate action.” Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have heated Earth’s average surface by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), mostly during the past 30 years. Schoengart and her colleagues combined economic data and climate simulations to trace emissions from different global income groups and assess their impact on specific types of climate-enhanced extreme weather. The researchers also emphasised the role of emissions embedded in financial investment rather than just lifestyle and personal consumption. The impact of this consumption and investment is particularly severe in tropical regions such as the Amazon, Southeast Asia and Southern Africa – all areas of the world that have historically contributed the least to global emissions but have been disproportionately impacted by extreme weather. “Our study shows that extreme climate impacts are not just the result of abstract global emissions. Instead we can directly link them to our lifestyle and investment choices, which in turn are linked to wealth,” Schoengart said. “We found that wealthy emitters play a major role in driving climate extremes, which provides strong support for climate policies that target the reduction of their emissions.” The authors argued that targeting the financial activities and investment portfolios of high-income individuals could lead to significant climate gains. “Climate action that doesn’t address the outsized responsibilities of the wealthiest members of society risk missing one of the most powerful levers we have to reduce future harm,” Schleussner said. Owners of capital, he noted, could be held accountable for climate impacts through progressive taxes on wealth and carbon-intensive investments, thus providing much needed support for adaptation and damage in vulnerable countries. Earlier research has shown that taxing asset-related emissions is more equitable than broad carbon taxes, which tend to burden those with lower incomes. Recent initiatives to increase taxes on the superrich and multinationals have mostly stalled, especially since US President Donald Trump’s return to power in January. In 2021, nearly 140 countries agreed to work towards a global corporate tax for multinational companies with nearly half endorsing a minimum rate of 15 percent, but those talks have stalled as well. According to the antipoverty NGO Oxfam, the richest 1 percent have accumulated $42 trillion in new wealth over the past decade. It says the richest 1 percent have more wealth than the lowest 95 percent combined.",

    "title": "‘It’s not Europe bad, America good’: JD Vance returns to Munich meeting",
    "article_text": "It was part of JD Vance’s first international trip as United States vice president: The former senator from Ohio was taking a tour of Europe, representing the second administration of President Donald Trump on the world stage. A major point on his itinerary wasa speech he would giveto the 61st annual Munich Security Conference on February 14, in front of leaders representing some of the US’s closest allies. But rather than celebrate those historic ties, Vance took a more aggressive approach. Perched at the podium in Munich, he shocked onlookers by criticising Europe, warning against laws and restrictions he said could “destroy democracy”. It has been nearly three months since Vance delivered that speech, and on Wednesday, the vice president returned to the Munich forum, this time for its leaders’ meeting in Washington, DC. In a question-and-answer segment with German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, Vance revisited his February speech, which sparked backlash within Europe and at home. He also gave a preview of US negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here are three key takeaways from his remarks. Wednesday’s public appearance marked the third time Vance spoke to an event hosted by the Munich Security Conference. But his last speech — with its accusations of democratic backsliding — loomed heavily over the proceedings. Vance tried to reframe his remarks on Wednesday as respectful criticism between allies, emphasising the warm relations the US and Europe have traditionally shared. “ I think — I mean this from the heart and as a friend — that there is a trade-off between policing the bounds of democratic speech and debate and losing the trust of our people. And we’re all going to draw the lines a little bit differently,” Vance said. “I’m fine if one country is going to draw those lines a little bit differently than the United States.” He added that questions of free speech and democratic principles are issues the US is grappling with, too. “I think all of us, including especially the United States, we have to be careful that we don’t draw the lines in such a way that we actually undermine the very democratic legitimacy upon which all of our civilization rests,” the vice president explained. “ I think that is fundamentally the point here. It’s not Europe bad, America good.” Ultimately, he said, Europe and the US are “on the same civilizational team”, and he underscored his belief that no wedge could come between them, even if the two parties exchanged criticism. Vance also struck an upbeat tone in his assessment of the US’s efforts to scale back Iran’s nuclear programme, saying the two countries are on “the right pathway”. “ Without prejudging the negotiations, I will say: So far, so good. We’ve been very happy by how the Iranians have responded to some of the points that we’ve made,” Vance said. Vance’s optimism offered a counterpoint to concerns that the negotiations could be derailed by continuing tensions between the US and Iran. Last week, a fourth round of talks expected in Romewere postponedfor “logistical reasons”, though experts pointed out that the delay coincided with a fresh slate of US sanctions against Iran’s petroleum industry. Those talks are slated to resume this weekend in Oman’s capital Muscat. On Wednesday, Vance stressed the US position that Washington will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, though he expressed ambivalence about nuclear energy for civilian purposes. “We don’t care if people want nuclear power. We’re fine with that. But you can’t have the kind of enrichment programme that allows you to get to a nuclear weapon. And that’s where we draw the line,” Vance said. Still, the question of nuclear enrichment — even for civilian purposes — has been a point of contention in recent weeks. Certain US officials have signalled they would like to see Iraneliminate its enrichment programmealtogether. For his part, Vance questioned whether it was likely Iran would use uranium enrichment solely for nuclear power, not weaponry. “Let me ask this basic question: Which regime in the world has civil nuclear power and enrichment without having a nuclear weapon?” Vance asked. “The answer is no one.” Iran has long denied any ambition of seeking a nuclear weapon, and it has signalled it is willing to scale back its enrichment programme. Previously, it had signed onto a 2015 deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), that imposed limits to its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. During his first term, however, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement, causing the pact to fall apart. The US president has since sought to rekindle nuclear negotiations with Iran during his second term. “We really think that, if the Iran domino falls, you’re gonna see nuclear proliferation all over the Middle East,” Vance said. The vice president also shared his insight into another area of tense international negotiation: the war between Russia and Ukraine. Since February 2022, Russia has led a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after capturing regions including Crimea in 2014. In his campaign for re-election last year, Trump pledged to end the slow-grinding war, which has cost thousands of lives. He even claimed he would stop the war on his first day back in office, though he has since backtracked, telling Time Magazine he meant those remarks “figuratively”. But Trump has nevertheless sought to act as a mediator between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. His administration, however, has been criticised for negotiating with Russia in isolation and seeming to acquiesce to Putin’s demands. Trump, for instance, has echoed Russian talking points blaming Ukraine for the war and saying that Zelenskyy can “forget about” membership in the NATO military alliance. His officials have also suggested Ukraine was “unlikely” to regain the territory it had lost to Russia’s invasion. Vance took a slightly tougher stance against Russia on Wednesday, underscoring that he and the Trump administration did not see eye to eye with Putin. “ You don’t have to agree with the Russian justification for the war, and certainly both the president and I have criticised the full-scale invasion,” Vance said. “But you have to try to understand where the other side is coming from to end the conflict.” The vice president sought to justify Trump’s approach as an effort to bring both sides to the negotiating table, in the spirit of what he called “strategic realism”. “Our view is: It’s absurd that you’ve had this war go on for so long. And the two sides aren’t even talking constructively about what would be necessary for them to end the conflict,” Vance explained. “ A frustration that we’ve had frankly with both sides is that they hate each other so much — that, if you have an hour conversation with either side, the first 30 minutes is just them complaining about some historical grievance from four years ago or five years ago or 10 years ago.” Vance laid out his position that Russia is “asking for too much” in terms of concessions from Ukraine. But he also criticised Ukraine for sticking to a30-day ceasefire proposalthat initially emerged from talks with the US in Saudi Arabia. “ What the Russians have said is a 30-day ceasefire is not in our strategic interest,” Vance said. “So we’ve tried to move beyond the obsession with the 30-day ceasefire and more on: What would the long-term settlement look like?” He added that he was “not yet that pessimistic” on the prospect of a negotiated peace, despite rumblings from the White House that Trump may withdraw from the negotiations altogether.",

    "title": "Samsung finally has a launch date for the Galaxy S25 Edge",
    "article_text": "It’s slim phone season. It’s slim phone season. byAllison Johnson Samsung will formally unveil the Galaxy S25 Edge during a virtual Unpacked event on Monday, May 12th at 8PM ET. This answers at leastoneof our many questions about Samsung’s upcoming slim phone whichthe company teased back in January. A blog post published with today’s announcement reveals another tidbit or two, but for the rest of the answers we’ll have to tune in on Monday. Samsung isn’t being coy about what it’s announcing: it’s definitely the Galaxy S25 Edge. The blog post comes right out and names the device, saying it “…not only sets a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone, but it also unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.” That would be great news for an industry that has seenslumping salesover the past few years. Also noted in the blog post: despite its slim profile, the S25 Edge will come with a 200-megapixel main camera, like the top-of-the-line Galaxy S25 Ultra does. That suggests the S25 Edge will clock in as more of a premium device than Apple’s rumored slim phone might be. The iPhone 17 Air could come with a single rear camera anda mix of high and low-end features. The S25 Edge, according to Samsung, will merge “flagship-level performance with superior portability.” So what does a flagship-level slim phone that’s supposedly going to set the ailing mobile industry on fire cost? And where will it be sold? Recent rumorspointed to a delayed US launch. It wouldn’t be too surprising to see the phone launch first in South Korea, though the fact thatSamsung US is offering a $50 creditto those who reserve the phone now bodes well for us. At least one thing looks certain: we won’t have to keep guessing for much longer. The virtual event will stream in plenty of places, includingSamsung’s YouTube channel.

    "title": "Eddy Cue is fighting to save Apple’s $20 billion paycheck from Google",
    "article_text": "﻿AI will disrupt Google’s search monopoly even without a breakup, the Apple exec says. ﻿AI will disrupt Google’s search monopoly even without a breakup, the Apple exec says. byLauren Feiner Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo probably won’t disrupt Google’s dominance in search, said Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue — but AI services easily could. Cue was returning to a courtroom in Washington, DC where helast testified in the Justice Department’s trial against Google’s search monopolyin September 2023. During the current remedies trial on Wednesday, Cue said that in the time since, well-funded generative AI upstarts have made such significant advancements that they could ultimately disrupt that monopoly — perhaps more effectively than the court could. Cue was also, however, there to defend a significant source of Apple’s revenue: the payments Google offers for default search engine placement on Apple’s Safari browser. After the 2023 trial, Judge Amit Mehtafound that Google illegally monopolized the online search market, in part through agreements like the Safari deal. For the last two and a half weeks, Google and the DOJ have pitched Mehta on what he should (or shouldn’t) do to fix the problem. The DOJ says Google should be forced toshare valuable search data with competitorsand spin off its Chrome browser, while Google (which plans to appeal the earlier ruling) wants only restrictions on the deals Mehta deemed unfairly exclusionary. And rather than barring its Apple deal altogether, it would make Googlegive Apple more flexibilityto sign additional default search agreements across its various devices or in private browsing mode. Cue argued Wednesday that rapid AI advancements mean the antitrust threat Mehta identified is shrinking. For the first time in 22 years, Cue said, Apple sawsearch volume decline in its Safari browserlast month — a side effect of users seeking more information from AI chatbots. The DOJ, unsurprisingly, disagrees. It’s not uncommon for technological development to outpace the slow trudge of the court system, but the government says that pace isn’t fast enough to fix a persistent market issue. Apple has a lot of skin in the game here — the DOJ previously revealed it rakes in$20 billion in paymentsfrom Google annually. Google’s proposed remedies could reduce it, but they would also open up Apple’s options and preserve much of its revenue flow. The DOJ’s, meanwhile, could wipe out that cash flow altogether. Cue seemed bewildered that Apple could get the short end of the stick for a punishment supposedly inflicted on Google. The idea that the court could decide Google did something wrong and then let it save money at Apple’s expense, he said, “just seems crazy to me.” Google could even keep its prime Safari placement without a deal in the short term, Cue said. “We don’t really have a choice today,” he testified. Even if Apple could cut a new default deal with another company, Google is still the best service available for customers, so they’d probably seek it out — and Apple wouldn’t get a cut. Cue said he’s “lost a lot of sleep” over the prospect of losing the Google deal, and warned it would impact Apple’s ability to make new products. Cue also told Mehta he “can’t say I disagree” with his analysis that Apple was disincentivized from building its own search engine because of its deal with Google. But, he added, “we can’t do everything,” and since Google is really good at what it does, Apple prefers to focus on areas where it can offer unique value. There’s “much greater potential because there are new entrants that are attacking the problem in a different way” AI could eventually change all of this, Cue testified. Apple isalready exploring adding AI search options, though it recognizes they can’t yet replace traditional search engines. “To date, they’re just not good enough,” he said. Cue said “good enough” could come sooner than he anticipated. He said there’s “much greater potential because there are new entrants that are attacking the problem in a different way.” Large language model (LLM) AI companies haven’t built a robust enough search index to substitute for Google yet, he said, but combining an LLM with search could let them use a smaller index effectively soon. Even though he is backing Google’s fight to keep its search deals, he seemed to acknowledge that the DOJ’s proposal to syndicate Google’s search index could get AI rivals up to speed even faster. Cue cautioned the judge that tech is not like other industries, and giants often fall even without court intervention. “When I got to Silicon Valley, all of the best companies, or the most successful companies, either don’t exist today or are significantly smaller and less impactful,” Cue said, pointing to companies like HP, Sun Microsystems, and Intel. In the technology field, being an incumbent might not offer the same benefits it does in other markets. “We’re not an oil company, we’re not toothpaste. These are things that are going to last forever,” he said. “You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.” After nearly four decades at Apple, Cue now sees AI as “a huge technological shift.” Putting himself in the judge’s shoes, Cue told Mehta, “we’re lucky, because honestly, if AI had not come about, I don’t know what you could do.” That’s because, he explained, “until there are truly competitive products, people will keep using the best one.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The long-running program, which among other things shows how much money an appliance will cost you to run, could be on its way out. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy The Trump administration is moving to shut down the Energy Star program, which saves homeownersan average of $450 a year. “If you wanted to raise families’ energy bills, getting rid of the Energy Star label would be a pretty good way,” saysSteven Nadel of the American Council for Energy Efficiency. The program, which started in 1992, provides basic information about how much energy an appliance uses. Without it, your next large appliance purchase could end up costing you more money than you bargained for. Buying Energy Star-rated products can also qualify you forrebates on appliancesas well astax creditsof up to $3,200 annually. Sources in the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees Energy Star, say that Trump administration officials told them the program will be shuttered, according to reports fromCNNandThe Washington Post. Molly Vaseliou, EPA Associate Administrator for Public Affairs, confirmed toThe Vergevia email that the agency is going through the “next phase of organizational improvements” to “better provide clean air, water, and land for all Americans.” Vaseliou shared a PDF showing a future organizational chart with the Office of Transportation & Air Quality and the Office of Radiation & Indoor Air Quality eliminated. Vaseliou did not respond to questions about Energy Star specifically, but the program falls under these departments. Energy Star is a private-public partnership set up by the first Bush administration in 1992 to help consumers and businesses save money by reducing their energy use, while conserving natural resources. Over that time, it’s saved more than$500 billion in energy costs. “For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy,told CNN. “That’s a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

Here’s some of the announcement, which Google spokesperson Elijah Lawal emailed toThe Verge: With the new app, you can use the split view on the iPad to put Gemini side by side with other apps for multitasking. You can also effortlessly use powerful features like: • Gemini Live: Have natural, free-flowing conversations in over 45 languages. • Deep Research: Quickly generate reports and gather information, saving significant time. • Audio Overview: Easily process and understand audio files. • Canvas: Co-create and edit documents and code in an innovative space built for collaboration with AI. • Image and video generation: Bring your ideas to life by generating stunning, varied images and videos directly on your iPad. The dedicated iPad app is available today in all countries where Gemini is currently offered. You can download it directly from the App Store. Speaking of updated features, we’ve significantly expanded the availability of Audio Overview. Following great initial feedback, this feature, which initially launched in English for Gemini and Gemini Advanced subscribers, is now available in over 45 languages globally. According to the listing, Gemini can also now be added as a homescreen widget, and supports connecting to your Google Photos library. Googlelaunched Gemini for iOS in November. And while it would’ve been nice for it to debut an iPad-native app at the time, the next best time, as they say, is now. And anyway, it’s not like Google is theworst offender there.

    "article_text": "Sounds like old Reddit is going to stick around. Sounds like old Reddit is going to stick around. byJay Peters The old Reddit layout sometimes looks a bit outdated, but it’s belovedby many Reddit users, including me. I’ve worried for some time that Reddit would eventually pull the plug on it in favor of the newer and more modern interface, but based on a recent post from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, it doesn’t sound like that’s going to happen anytime soon. As part of alarger postpublished Monday about “Reddit’s next chapter,” which we sawviaTechCrunch, Huffman, who goes by the username spez, snuck in what looked like heart-stopping news for us oldheads right at the end. “Sunsetting old.reddit: old.reddit is the version of Reddit that we built back in the mid-2000s,“ Huffman said. ”It doesn’t scale, it’s impossible to develop on, and it’s ugly af. We will be shutting it down at the end of the month.” But, apparently, that was just a joke. (A bold move, given outcry toother Reddit-related shutdowns.) “Just kidding,” he said. “I don’t know why I say stuff like this. We’ll figure out how to work around it and keep it online as long as people are using it.” The post covers many other actual planned changes to the platform, including that “core product improvements” like making it easier to make subreddits and “evolving r/popular” are in the works. Reddit also wants to shift the primary role of moderators from “policing to community cultivation,” in part with “better tools – especially more AI-driven automation,” he said. Huffman acknowledged that “unwelcome AI in communities is a serious concern” and that it’s the worry he hears most from users and mods. But he believes that “Reddit works because it’s human” and said that “our focus is, and always will be, on keeping Reddit a trusted place for human conversation.” Reddit is going to ask for a bit more identifying information from its users, too. Here’s Huffman’s description of what will happen: To keep Reddit human and to meet evolving regulatory requirements, we are going to need a little more information. Specifically, we will need to know whether you are a human, and in some locations, if you are an adult. But we never want to know your name or who you are. The way we will do this is by working with various third-party services that can provide us with the essential information and nothing else. No solution is perfect — including the status quo — but we will do our best to preserve both the humanness and anonymity of Reddit. On Wednesday, Reddit also shared details aboutimprovements it’s makingto Reddit Chat, including the ability to add users to an allowlist. The company announcedin Marchthat it would be replacing user PMs with Chat.

Details of the new headphones model, called the WH-1000XM6, come from a now pulled Amazon Spain listing for the product that wasfirst spotted by a Reddit user. The XM6 will feature an upgraded noise-canceling processor called the QN3 HD, which according to Dealabs, will be seven times faster than the QN1 chip present in Sony’s XM5. The upgrade should result in better noise cancelling and perhaps sound quality. It also looks like it has an AI-powered six-microphone beamforming system for calls, and still comes with a headphone jack. Unfortunately the Trump administration’s tariffs seem to be affecting the price of the new XM6.Dealabssays it will launch for $449.99 in the US — $50 more expensive than the $399.99 XM5s, which our senior reviewer Chris Welch has calledthe best wireless headphones for most people. The XM5, however, is only slightly better at noise canceling than the XM4 that launched in 2020, so the XM6 will need a truly generational improvement to justify the higher price.

The deal went through in 2023 after a court denied the FTC’s request for an injunction. An appeals court today upheld that denial. byJay Peters The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has lost its appeal of a ruling in its case against Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In 2023, theFTC requesteda preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from finalizing the deal while its legal challenge to the acquisitionfrom 2022was in progress. “With control of Activision’s content, Microsoft would have the ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activision’s content in ways that substantially lessen competition – including competition on product quality, price, and innovation,” the FTC saidin its complaint. A district court judgedenied the FTC’s request, and a day after that ruling,the FTC appealed. The deal was completedin October 2023, nearly two years after the acquisition wasfirst announced. Today, an appeals court panel affirmed that denial,as reported byReuters. Inits opinion, the panel says that “given the FTC’s failure to make an adequate showing as to its likelihood of success on the merits as to any of its theories, the district court properly denied the FTC’s motion for a preliminary injunction on that basis.” The deal is still “the subject of an administrative proceeding that remains pending before the FTC,” according to today’s opinion.

However,developer Rockstar Games saysthat isn’t actually the case, and that the trailer was “comprised of equal parts gameplay and cutscenes.” The fact that it’s hard to discern between the two in the trailer is an impressive achievement for the game, though obviously we’ll have to reserve judgement until we are able to actually play it.

    "article_text": "Google’s designers want to capture the youth demo with a vibrant new OS treatment, but there’s only so much they can do. Google’s designers want to capture the youth demo with a vibrant new OS treatment, but there’s only so much they can do. byAllison Johnson Android’s new design language looks extremely… Gen Z. That much is obvious from the concept images inthe leaked blog postthat surfaced today (published by Google, as it tends to do). While the theme is customizable, Google highlighted pink, purple, and coral throughout the interface. It’s a decidedly younger, bubblier, and more fun design that screams “look at all this fresh paint!” and less “choose from one of these six popular shades of blue.” Google’s blog also confirms the push toward youth appeal. Fine; freshening up the interface every once in a while is a good and necessary pursuit. Aside from the inherent cringe factor when a group of designers tries to quantify youth appeal in bar graphs labeled “Coolness attributes,” I can’t shake the feeling that none of this matters much against Android’s biggest hurdle in addressing the younger demographic: the iPhone. Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world. But here in the US, Apple ownsa solid majorityof all phones sold. The numbers skew even more heavily toward iOS when you look at younger demographics.A 2025 survey from investment bank Piper Sandlerreports that 88 percent of teenagers polled own an iPhone.A 2023 article inThe Wall Street Journalfound that kids who dared to bring an Android phone to school faced teasing for using what is seen as a phone for old people. Google, it seems, would like to do something about that. The screenshots from the blog post, which weresaved by9to5Google, give us a peek at what Google’s attempt to appeal to the youth looks like. It builds on Material You, the interface that Googleintroduced with Android 12, with a focus on customizability. It added the ability to change the system-wide color palette based on your wallpaper, a feature thatApple more or less copied in iOS 18with an option to tint homescreen icons. Material Three pushes even further, mixing in bold fonts, bigger icons, and vibrant colors. The leaked blog post calls Material Three its “most-researched update to Google’s design system, ever.” Google’s leaked post says it conducted 46 studies testing its new designs, with over 18,000 participants. “While there was a net positive indication across all age groups, younger study participants had the most enthusiastic preference for M3 Expressive, and also rating the designs as high in Visual Appeal and Intention to Use,” the post claimed. It’s notallabout the youth. It also says, “…with Expressive versions, we’re seeing a removal of age effects in fixation times, helping 45+ year old users perform on par with their younger counterparts.” Let’s just remember that anyone who’s 45 has probably owned a smartphone longer than the “younger counterparts” have been alive, and I think they were finding the email send button just fine, but I appreciate the consideration. Google’s researchers had participants rate the designs for certain attributes, including those “Coolness Attributes” like “Stand Apart” and “Fascinating.” Great! What the hell does that mean? Apparently, Google thinks it’s an indicator that people might actually be willing to switch to Android based on these designs. “We’ve also seen that this coolness isn’t just a vanity metric, but a positive driver of behavioral intent, meaning users are more likely to want to switch to a product with this design.” There’s only so much Google can do. No amount of vibrant color treatments and “fascinating” icons will change the fact that an Android owner is still the green bubble in the group chat. Apple knows that locking people into iMessage is a huge factor in keeping them in the ecosystem,particularly with the phones people give their kids. RCS has made cross-platform chats much more bearable, but we’re still not quite at feature parity — and those bubbles are still green. Honestly, I don’t hate Material Three, and leaning into a design that looks so different from iOS strikes me as a better idea than making an iOS knockoff. But, at least in the US market, a decision by Apple to open iMessage and FaceTime would do more to boost Android sales than anything Google’s designers can dream up. Is that fair? Not at all, and regulators aretrying to do something about it. The UI glow-up doesn’t hurt, but I don’t think this is a situation Google can design itself out of.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 7, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump will nominate Dr. Casey Means,an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and prominent advocate for his agenda, to serve as the U.S. surgeon general, the president announced Wednesday. Means replacesDr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination waswithdrawnby the White House a day before she was scheduled to appear at a Senate confirmation hearing. Mr. Trump said in aTruth Socialpost that Means \"has impeccable \"MAHA\" credentials\" — referring to the acronym for \"Make America Healthy Again,\" a slogan used by Kennedy. \"Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely outstanding,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History.\" The surgeon general oversees 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, and plays a key role in setting the national agenda on public health. The nominee must be confirmed by the Senate. Means was close to Kennedy during the campaign, along with her brother, Calley Means, who played a key role in orchestratingKennedy's endorsementof Mr. Trump, according to some of Kennedy allies who played a role in the transition. Casey Means haswritten abouthow, after attending Stanford Medical School and training to become a surgeon, she opted to leave \"traditional medicine\" to devote her life to \"tackling the root cause of why Americans are sick.\" She co-founded Levels, a health app that canconnect to glucose monitors, and has built a large following online for writing about health and wellness. Both Means siblings soared to prominence in recent years after viral interviews decrying the influence of the food and drug industry. Their views align with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices underpin a vast swath of Americans' health conditions. The two siblings authored the bestseller \"Good Energy\" after their mother died of pancreatic cancer, saying that she had been \"simply prescribed pills and not set on a path of curiosity about how these conditions are connected and how the root cause can be reversed.\" An interview the two did with Tucker Carlson —ranked by Appleas the most-shared podcast episode of 2024 — was titled \"The Truth About Ozempic, the Pill, and How Big Pharma Keeps You Sick.\" \"She's qualified. She's energetic. She's been a good communicator, which is the role of surgeon general. She seems to have good ethical moorings. And she reflects this new thinking about where HHS should be. I think it's a bold pick,\" Dr. Robert Malone, another close ally of Kennedy, told CBS News. Casey and Calley Means have also earned skepticism from some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, who have grown frustrated with what they fear has been Kennedy's drifting attention away from what they hoped would be a ban of several vaccines and towards a crackdown on unhealthy foods and additives like syntheticfood dyes. \"The nutritional agenda is a core part of MAHA. It may not be their core part of MAHA. But there's no doubt that it's a central part of the overall mission,\" he said. Malone acknowledged the perception among some of Kennedy's base that Means had not been \"sufficiently vocal, early enough, in rejecting the mRNA vaccine products,\" as he had been. Malone himself rose to prominence criticizing the shots while painting himself as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, a claim that other scientistsrejectedas misinformation. He was with Kennedy and Mr. Trump in Floridaon election night. Meanshas saidshe backs Kennedy \"relentlessly pushing for vaccine safety\" and said she thought it was\"criminal\"to require vaccinations. She has also claimed \"the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule\" could be \"causing health declines in vulnerable children. This needs to be investigated,\" she wrote on her websitelast year. Calley Means now serves as a special government employee, advising Kennedy and backing state bills promoting his agenda. Casey Means was initially favored as one contender for the surgeon general pick, some of Kennedy's allies said, but was passed over for Dr. Nesheiwat. Some of Kennedy's allies said they believed Nesheiwat's appearances on Fox News and ties to former national security adviserMike Waltz, who is married to Nesheiwat's sister Julia, played a role in the president's decision. Nesheiwat's nomination waswithdrawn Wednesdayamid concerns about how she portrayed her credentials. For example, asCBS News previously reported, she has publicly listed an M.D. from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but she actually got her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean.

Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, 48,  allegedly drove his car throughAniston's gateon Tuesday after harassing the actress for the better part of two years. The Los Angeles County District Attorney said he allegedly left unwanted voicemails, social media messages and emails to the Friends star between March 1, 2023, and May 5, 2025. While Aniston was home when Carwyle crashed through the gate, herprivate security detained himbefore police arrived. Prosecutors charged him with stalking and vandalism.

    "title": "Real ID requirement kicks in today at airports across U.S.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 7, 2025 / 5:34 PM EDT/ CBS News As of Wednesday, U.S. travelers flying domestically are required to show a Real ID at airport checkpoints. The May 7 deadline for Americans to switch to thefederally compliantidentification comes after more than 20 years of being delayed. Real IDs will also be required to enter certain federal facilities. Despite the new security requirement, it was business as usual at many airports on Wednesday, with some airport websites reporting wait times at security checkpoints of just a few minutes. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's website, for example, showed wait times ranging from 5 to 16 minutes. At Chicago's O'Hare airport, wait times were actually lower than usual. Jim Spriggs, TSA's federal security director for Illinois, said 90% of O'Hare travelers were prepared for the Real ID deadline. TSA employees at Newark Airport said they were pleasantly surprised by how prepared passengers were. Travelers at the New Jersey airport haveexperienced serious delaysin recent days due to a mix of air traffic controller issues and staffing shortages. At New York's LaGuardia Airportnot all travelers had their Real ID yet, although some had remembered to bring their passports, which is another acceptable form of identification for checkpoints. \"I'm  hoping that it's really quick  and easy,\" one woman at LaGuardia told CBS News New York. \"But I will say I was  really happy that I happened to  bring my passport on this trip because we're going back home.\" Another traveler was making his way from New York to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"I wish we  probably picked a different day  to travel because it might be a  little bit tougher for everyone  else,   but we'll be alright,\" he said. The TSAhas extra staffon hand at airports Wednesday to help travelers and explain the differences between acceptable forms of ID. Officers are using a secondary process to confirm the identity of travelers without a Real ID, passport or other compliant form of identification. Still, officials advised travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially if they don't have a Real ID. People without Real IDscan still fly, although they may face extra security hurdles. The agency said it's seeing about 81% Real ID-compliance at airports. According to aCBS News analysisfrom April, at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with the law. While the ID cards are required for domestic air travel as of Wednesday, officials have emphasized that May 7 is not the last day Americans can get a Real ID. \"The vast majority of people do not need a Real ID before Wednesday,\" Secretary of State Alexi Giannouliastold CBS News Chicago. Even so, state government offices that issue driver's licenses and state IDs have seen a significant increase in demand for Real ID, with some extending their office hours to meet the spike in applications. In the weeks before the new ID requirement was set to take effect on Wednesday, state driver's license agencies across the country saw lines of travelers gathered outside to secure theirReal ID, which has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card. CBS News captured long wait times at theReal ID Supercenterin downtown Chicago and theDMV in Pomona, California, where lines snaked around the block. People who aren't flying until later in the year can wait to make an appointment. Air travelers are also allowed to bring an alternative form ofidentification, such as a passport, to get through security checkpoints, according to the TSA. A list of alternative forms of identification that will be accepted at security checkpoints can be found on the TSA's websitehere. Five states — Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont — also issue what is called anEnhanced Driver's License(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card. The Better Business Bureauis warning peoplewho have yet to apply for a Real ID to keep an eye out for scams, as fraudsters look to exploit confusion around the application process. Keep in mind that the only way to apply for a Real or Enhanced ID is to visit the DMV in-person after making an appointment. Remember that the DMV will never reach out via text, social media, email or phone to ask for personal information,CBS News Minnesota'sPauleen Le recently reported. \"Experts say if you experience any of these, it's likely a scam,\" she said. — CBS News' Cassandra Guathier, Mabel Kabani, Kris Van Cleave and Maddy Wierus contributed to this report.

    "title": "Trump wants to replace grocery aid for seniors with \"MAHA food boxes\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 7, 2025 / 5:31 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump'sproposed budgetfor next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under theplan, funding for the program — called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) — would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers. The food boxes — whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" — could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes. The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program. \"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes. The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget,accordingto the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA. The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans. Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said. \"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\" Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas. \"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store — it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\" The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut. But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about$1 billion in fundingto schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers. The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\" The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a2021 analysisfrom the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes. MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop usingsynthetic food dyesand has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches. The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas toban the use of food stampsfor purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans. In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it. \"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\" Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 7, 2025 / 2:45 PM EDT/ CBS News An officer in central Ohio encountered a pet raccoon while conducting a traffic stop earlier this week. The animal, named \"Chewy,\" had a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth and was sitting in the driver's seat of a car that the officer had pulled over, police said. The discovery led Springfield Township Police Officer Austin Branham, who conducted the traffic stop, to search the vehicle more thoroughly. He and other officers found methamphetamine, crack cocaine and three used methamphetamine pipes elsewhere in the car,accordingto the Springfield Township Police Department. The vehicle was pulled over because its registered owner had an active warrant and a suspended driver's license, the department said. Law enforcement arrested and charged the owner of the car, 55-year-old Victoria Vidal, with drug possession and three counts of drug paraphernalia and cited her for driving under suspension, the police department said. Vidal may face more charges for crack cocaine possession, depending on the outcome of lab results still to come from the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The raccoon was not harmed, police said, adding that \"notification was made to the proper authorities to determine that she has the proper paperwork and documentation to own the racoon.\" (In Ohio, people are allowed to have pet raccoons, but the process to keep them domestically is highly regulated and certainpermits are required.) Springfield police released body camera video of the traffic stop, which shows Chewy emerging from the car. \"While our officers are trained to expect the unexpected, finding a raccoon holding a meth pipe is a first!\" the department said.

    "title": "Trump now wants everyone to stop asking when the trade deals are coming",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and White House aides were boasting that his tariffs would force a legion of foreign nations to rush into new trade deals — and that Trump's prowess would yield more favorable terms for the U.S. “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,” Trump said last month before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. \"They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything. I’ll do anything, sir!’” Follow live politics coverage here \"We've got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" a few days later — after Trumppaused some of his tariffsand declared a three-month negotiating window. But Trump has changed his tone and his tune in recent days, as it has become clear that trade agreements don't materialize as quickly as he would like and that there aren't dozens in the queue. His shift also comes amid heavy criticism that his tariffs willhike prices for consumersand harm an American economy that had its first negative growth in years in the first quarter. \"You keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign one? It’s very simple. We’re going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. In some cases we want you to drop your tariffs,\" an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters Tuesday. \"So I wish they’d keep, you know, stop asking, 'How many deals are you signing this week?' Because one day we’ll come and we’ll give you 100 deals. And they don’t have to sign.\" It was Trump who set the 90-day clock. Beyond the ambitious sweep of trying to haggle with scores of nations at once, the U.S. has yet to open discussions with its largest trading partner — China — since Trump applied a 145% across-the-board tariff on that nation's products. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers Wednesday that hisplanned meetingwith Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend amounts to an early phase of negotiations that is not as far along as talks with less-crucial nations. \"On Saturday, we will begin, which I believe is the opposite of advanced,\" Bessent said under questioning from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y. The previous day he said that discussions are occurring with a far smaller number of countries than Trump and Navarro have counted and that the time horizon for agreements could be much longer. \"There are 18 very important trading relationships, and we are currently negotiating with 17 of those trading partners,\" Bessent told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government on Tuesday. \"Approximately 97 or 98% of our trade deficit is with 15 countries, 18% of the countries are our major trading partners. And I would be surprised if we don’t have more than 80 or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the year, and that may be much sooner.\" Bessent went on to say that there could be deals announced this week. And yet, the end-of-year timeline is far different from what White House officials had previously suggested. The change in rhetoric is intentional, according to one White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. The substance matters more than the speed, the official said. \"Obviously, we're working as expeditiously as possible, but we're not trying to make deals that are Band-Aids for the sake of making deals,\" the official added. Trump has used his authorityunder an emergency declarationto raise tariffs on U.S. trading partners — and he can lower them in similar fashion if and when he chooses — but hemight have to involve Congress for more comprehensive trade agreements. For now, Trump is operating with one blunt-force tool — the levies applied to goods entering the U.S. from abroad — in order to win concessions on both duties and \"nontariff barriers\" to trade. \"We don't need Congress to pass a bill\" because the U.S.-applied tariffs should be enough to win those concessions, the White House official said. \"The onus is obviously on the countries we're negotiating with.\" On Wednesday night, Trumpwas ready to again talk about deals— now that, it seemed, he had something to tout. He said that on Thursday morning, he posted on Truth Social, he would have an Oval Office press conference \"concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!\"",

    "title": "Trump's tariffs put the Fed in a tough spot on interest rates and inflation",
    "article_text": "The Federal Reserve isholding interest rates steadyas it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps pressuring the central bank to lower them. It’s an ironic, whiplash-inducing reversal for Fed policymakers who just months ago wereon the vergeof a rare feat — wrestling down a historic run-up of inflation without triggering mass layoffs, known as a “soft landing” — and preparing to keep cutting borrowing costs. But President Donald Trump’srapid upending of global tradehas pushed the Fed and its leader into a difficult position, in which they feel a wait-and-see approach may be their best strategy for now. “The Fed has been plunged into an almost impossible situation whereby its two mandates will likely move in opposite directions,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the Fed’s dual mission of keeping employment high and inflation low. “But government policy — which is incredibly uncertain itself — will dictate both the timing and magnitudes of those moves,” she wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. The concern is that an economy damaged by tariffs will force the Fed to cut interest rates to stave off job losses, at the risk of driving inflation higher. After having peaked above 9% in mid-2022, the annual inflation rate has been hovering just north of the central bank’s 2% target for nearly a year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that holding pat on rates allows the Fed to “wait and see” how the economy unfolds. But policymakerswarned in their statementWednesday that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,” renewing concerns about “stagflation” — a situation in which job losses and price hikes both mount even as the economy lags. “The tariff shock will reduce real GDP growth and raise prices at the same time, putting the Fed on the horns of a dilemma,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, warned in a note Wednesday afternoon. “The policy move necessary to maintain full employment is the opposite of that necessary to contain inflation. Moving one policy lever to hit two conflicting targets is problematic.” Politics are adding to the difficulty, with the Fed’s decision likely to draw Trump’s ire. Trump has broken long-standing norms against political influence over monetary policy by repeatedly bashing Powell — whom he appointed in 2018 — and escalating his attacks in recent weeks. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”he wrote on Truth Socialon April 4. Two weeks later,he posted again, nicknaming Powell “Too Late” and saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” In yet another post a week later,Trump called Powella “major loser.” Powell told reporters Wednesday that Trump’s comments had no impact. “It really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it,” he said, adding that neither has he asked for a meeting with Trump nor has the president requested one. President Joe Biden reappointed Powell in 2022, and despite the recent barrage of criticism,Trump toldNBC News’ Kristen Welker last week that he wouldn’t seek to remove him before his term ends in May 2026. “Why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time,” he said. The challenges of recent months mark the second time Powell has weighed how to handle economic fallout from Trump’s trade policies. In 2019, Trump was similarly threatening higher duties on China. Powell, who faced similar jabs from Trump through a barrage of Twitter posts at the time, wound up cutting interest rates three times to pre-emptively cushion the U.S. economy from the blow of higher duties. Powell signaled Wednesday that this time is different. The Fed was less worried in 2019 about the inflationary impacts of lower rates, he indicated, because prices were rising more slowly at a slower pace than they are now. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’spreferred measure of inflation, showed pricesrising at an annual rateof 2.6% in March, whereas the same measure clocked in beneath 2% for all of 2019. “It’s not a situation where we can be pre-emptive, because we actually don’t know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,” Powell said. Althoughmarkets expectthe Fed to cut interest rates three times by the end of the year, some analysts aren’t so sure. Bank of America researchers said Wednesday, “If our base case of a steady labor market and rising inflation is correct, we don’t see a path to cuts in 2025.” In the meantime, Powell has avoided committing to future moves given the widespread uncertainty Trump’s tariffs have generated forcorporate bosses,small-business ownersandconsumersalike. “There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn’t,” he told reporters Wednesday. “We just don’t know.”",

    "title": "Trump abruptly pulls surgeon general nominee and names new pick with ties to RFK Jr.",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump withdrew the nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat to be surgeon general Wednesday, days after right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer criticized her, and he simultaneously announced a new pick who has close ties to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump confirmed Nesheiwat's withdrawal on Truth Social and praised the forthcoming nominee, Dr. Casey Means, for “impeccable ‘MAHA’ credentials,” referring to the “Make America Healthy Again” slogan. \"Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the finest Surgeon Generals in United States History. Congratulations to Casey! Secretary Kennedy looks forward to working with Dr. Janette Nesheiwat in another capacity at HHS,\"Trump wrote. Follow live politics coverage here Trump said Means, if she is confirmed, would work alongside Kennedy to “reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health, in the future, for ALL Americans.” The surgeon general oversees theU.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, more than 6,000 uniformed officers who are public health professionals, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Means, who received undergraduate and medical degrees from Stanford University, has held research positions at the National Institutes of Health, New York University and Oregon Health & Science University. She is a proponent of metabolic health, when your body processes food in a way that keeps your blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and weight within healthy ranges. Kennedy is a longtime supporter of Means and Calley Means, her brother, whom he characterized as children’s health and chronic disease experts in an interview in August after he ended his presidential campaign and endorsed Trump. Calley Means, according to Kennedy, worked on his presidential campaign and had also advised Trump about health policy. The siblings, co-authors of the self-help health book \"Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health,\" became MAGA darlings and key architects of the offshoot movement now known as Make America Healthy Again. Casey Means quickly became a fixture in right-wing media. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., cited one of her many media appearances as “the catalyst” for his Capitol Hill roundtable event in September titled “American Health and Nutrition: A Second Opinion,” which featured Means and Kennedy, who linked chronic illness to “metabolic dysfunction” and criticized seed oils, processed foods, the food pyramid, microplastics and a host of other factors blamed for the poor health of America’s children. In apodcast appearancewith Tucker Carlson — which now has over 3.7 million views on YouTube — Means questioned the necessity of vaccinating infants according to the schedule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically against hepatitis B, which she said was “emblematic of how we are put on the pharma treadmill from the moment we are born in this country, for reasons that are very strange.” Nesheiwat is the second nominee for a top health position the White House has pulled a shortly before Senate confirmation hearings. In March, Trumppulled the nominationof former. Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., who had been picked to be director of the CDC. A White House official told NBC News that Weldon’s nomination was pulled because it became clear that he did not have the support necessary for Senate confirmation because of past controversial comments about vaccines. Nesheiwat's confirmation hearing had been scheduled for Thursday morning before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ShewroteWednesday evening onXthat she is \"looking forward to continuing to support President Trump and working closely with Secretary Kennedy in a senior policy role to Make America Healthy Again!\" \"My focus continues to be on improving the health and well-being of all Americans, and that mission hasn’t changed,\" she added. According to her website, Nesheiwat is a board-certified medical doctor who was a medical news correspondent and medical director at CityMD. She previously was a medical contributor at Fox News. Loomer shared a lengthy post Sunday accusing Nesheiwat of being \"entangled in an intricate medical malpractice litigation\" and highlighted her past support of the Covid vaccines. While she was a Fox News contributor, Nesheiwat encouraged of the use of the vaccines and boosters. \"We have many vaccines in existence that treat a variety of non-life threatening diseases but to have a COVID vaccine, i.e. a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA that will actually save you from dying is a gift from God,\" Nesheiwat wrote in aFox News opinion piece. Loomer, who has been influentialin the removal of Trump aides, said Nesheiwat's support for Covid vaccines \"render her unfit for the role of United States Surgeon General, and she should not be confirmed by the US Senate to hold the position.\" Loomer also hammered Nesheiwat for what she alleged was \"promotion of DEI-focused initiatives.\" Trump is a fierce critic of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, andhe banned federal agenciesin January from implementing DEI programs,fired federal employeeswho worked in DEI roles andthreatened to cutfederal funding to schools that maintain DEI practices. Nesheiwat did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Loomer's social media posts. Nesheiwat is the sister-in-law of former national security adviser Michael Waltz,who was oustedlast week amid scrutiny over his creation of a Signal chat group to discuss sensitive military information that inadvertently included a journalist.

    "title": "Judge blocks deportation flight of Asian migrants to Libya",
    "article_text": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing migrants from being sent to Libya or any other third country after immigration attorneys filed an emergency motion Wednesday. The United States reportedly plans to send a group of migrants to Libya as early as this week. A U.S. military aircraft is expected to transport the migrants who are from the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, among other countries, the motion said. The plaintiffs are being set for removal “without any reasonable fear screening, let alone a fifteen-day window to file a motion to reopen with the immigration court to contest any negative reasonable fear determination,” according to the motion, which was filed in U.S District Court in Massachusetts. In one case, the attorneys said in the motion, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at a South Texas detention facility gathered several detainees in a room. The detainees were told that they needed to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya, the document said. When they refused, they were put in separate rooms, “cuffed in,” and forced to sign the document, the motion says. Libya’s provisional Government of National Unity said on social media that it is not coordinating deportations with the United States and that it rejects using the country as a destination for deported immigrants without its knowledge or consent. “The Government categorically denies the existence of any agreement or coordination with it regarding the reception of any migrants deported from the United States,” it said. It also suggested that “some parallel parties that are not subject to legitimacy” could be involved with the developments. Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army,which controls eastern Libya, said in a statement that it also opposed the country‘s taking in deported migrants because it would violate “the sovereignty of the homeland.” A State Department spokesperson said the agency does not discuss the “details of our diplomatic communications with other governments.” The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on anything related to Libya deportations. The Trump administration has been deporting migrants in what experts have said is amove to strong-arm weaker countries. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month at a Cabinet meeting that the United States is “actively searching for other countries to take people.” “We are working with other countries to say, ‘We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries,’” Rubio said. “‘Will you do that as a favor to us?’ And the further away the better, so they can’t come back across the border.” The Trump administration struck a $6 million deal with El Salvador this year to imprison deportees it says are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the street gang MS-13. The administration has labeled both gangs foreign terrorist organizations. Hundreds of peoplehave already been sent to El Salvador. Many of them are from Venezuela, and almost all were bound for the maximum-security Terrorist Confinement Center, known by its Spanish acronym, CECOT.Human rights groupshave criticized prison conditions in the country, alleging systematic torture, malnutrition and other abuses. Other countries, like Costa Rica, have also agreed to serve as a bridge between the United States and the migrants, many of whom have no criminal records. Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves said at a news conference in February that the country is helping its “economically powerful brother from the north.” Libya has long been criticized for its treatment of migrants. TheIndependent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya,established by the United Nations Human Rights Council, found in its  report from 2023 that it was likely that “crimes against humanity were committed against Libyans and migrants throughout Libya.” The report documented examples of “arbitrary detention, murder, torture, rape, enslavement, sexual slavery, extrajudicial killing and enforced disappearance, confirming their widespread practice in Libya.” A six-year civil war between the country’s rival political factions ended in a ceasefire in 2020. However, threats to the region’s stability have continued.",

    "title": "Trump's words undermine DOJ's argument about men deported to El Salvador's CECOT",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — The words of President Donald Trump and members of his administration undermined the government's contention at a court hearing Wednesday that the men deported from the country under the Alien Enemies Act and delivered to El Salvador were not in the constructive custody of the United States. At a hearing Wednesday evening, Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg questioned a Justice Department attorney over whether Trump was telling the truth when he said he could secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the CECOT facility in El Salvador. Boasberg used Trump’s own words, as well as statements from press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, to chip away at the government’s contention that those incarcerated at CECOT in El Salvador were not in the constructive custody of the United States. “Constructive custody” refers to the legal notion that people can be held at the behest of the government even if they are not held in its physical custody. Trumpsaid last weekthat he “could” have Garcia returned to the United States with a phone call, while Leavitt said the United States was paying El Salvador “approximately $6 million” to keep the men and Noem said CECOT was “one of the tools in our tool kit” that the United States could use. “Is the president not telling the truth, or could he secure the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia?” Boasberg asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Abhishek Kambli, who was representing the government Wednesday. “Was the president telling the truth” when he said he could pick up the phone and secure Garcia’s release or not? Boasberg asked. “That goes towards the president’s belief about influence he has,” Kambli responded, saying, \"Influence does not equate to constructive custody.\" Under questioning from Boasberg, Kambli said a \"grant\" dated March 22 that was described as being for law enforcement needs related to the 238 men alleged to be Tren de Aragua members who were recently deported to El Salvador. Kambli confirmed that “grants were made” that “can be used for detention of these individuals.” Boasberg said the plaintiffs had “a lot of facts in your favor” in arguing that the United States had what is called “constructive custody” of the men — which the Trump administration has argued in and out of court it does not have. Boasberg questioned Kambli about whether the government would concede that transferring people to CECOT without due process would mean the government had violated their rights. “I don't know if I would put it in those terms,\" Kambli replied. Boasberg has ordered the Trump administration to provide sworn declarations from administration officials regarding the issue of who exactly has custody of the people at CECOT. Boasberg has ordered lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward who brought the lawsuit to review the information and to decide by Monday whether to request discovery — and, if so, exactly what questions, depositions and documents they are requesting. After that, Boasberg will decide what to order the government to produce, if necessary. The Supreme Court last monthlifted Boasberg's order, which temporarilyblockedthe administration from sending members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, but it did not reach a decision on the merits of Trump's invocation of the act. Last week, a Trump-appointed judge became the first tostrike down the administration's use of the act, which had previously been deployed only during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. While the Trump administrationproclaimed that it wonthe Supreme Court argument, Boasberg questioned Kambli about the decision, noting that the court had not reached the merits of the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg asked whether Kambli acknowledged that the Supreme Court did not reach the arguments about the administration's use of the act itself, and Kambli conceded that it \"did not analyze that precise issue.\" \"I assume that's a yes,\" Boasberg replied. CORRECTION(May 7, 2025, 8:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of the White House press secretary. It is Leavitt, not Levitt.",

    "title": "The best and brightest young scientists are looking beyond the U.S. as cuts hit home",
    "article_text": "Jack Castelli had it all figured out. The University of Washington doctoral student had spent the past three years developing new gene-editing techniques that could spur immunity to the virus that causes AIDS. Early testing in mice showed promising results. His research group hoped it could develop into a treatment, or even a cure, for HIV. Castelli, who is Canadian, saw two career paths after his graduation this spring: He could join a U.S. biotech company, or he could find a postdoctoral position at a U.S. university or research laboratory. “This is where the money is at and where all the clinical trials are happening,” Castelli said, making the U.S. “the only place in my mind I could push that forward.” Then the Trump administration’s science cuts hit. And so, on a rainy late April day in Seattle, Castelli stood at a lectern before his friends and family and defended his doctoral thesis — about using stem cells to express antibodies against HIV — with his scientific life at a crossroads. Should he join a lab in his native Canada? Accept recruiting calls to a European university? A Chinese biotech company? They were all possibilities now, and his U.S. visa is likely to expire in a few months’ time. “I have a personal interest in Jack getting the best opportunity for himself, and as much as I’d love to say the U.S. is the place, I can’t necessarily say that right now,” said Jennifer Adair, who was Castelli’s principal investigator at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, a partner institute to the university. Castelli speaks three languages fluently and completed two internships while earning his doctoral degree. He is a generous colleague and an exceptional scientist, Adair said. But his uncertain future is hardly unique. TheTrump administration’s slowdown in science funding— which stalled thousands of grants at the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, among other organizations — has left U.S.-based scientists and researchers scrambling to find homes for promising work that could lead to medical treatments and cures. Now many are looking abroad. As of May, Castelli had not made a decision on whether he’ll stay in the U.S. The slowdown has forced the University of Washington, a top public university for biomedical research, to implement a hiring freeze, travel restrictions, class size reductions and furloughs. Some departments are pushing students to graduate sooner than expected. In a court filing, a university representative said it funds about 3,000 researchers through NIH grants. Interviews with more than 20 graduate students, faculty members and university administrators at UW describe a research hub thrown into chaos. Other institutions have made similarly drastic moves, according to court filings in lawsuits that aim to thwart the cuts. Many of those interviewed said a generation of scientists — and the innovations their research would bring — could be decimated. “Really talented people are not able to get jobs; other really talented people are able to get jobs, but they’re choosing not to take them because of the craziness,” said David Baker, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who won the Nobel Prize in 2024 for protein research. “Why would you stay in a country where there’s not really an obvious commitment to science, when you could go somewhere else and be better funded and not worry about what you can read in the news or what email you’re going to get?” In an April 14 court filing, the university’s vice provost for research, Mari Ostendorf, said the campus mood had dimmed. “Faculty and staff don’t know if their funding will be cut, if their research will be terminated, whether they will be able to attend conferences, or even whether they will continue to have jobs,” Ostendorf wrote. “Funding gaps have forced researchers to abandon studies, miss deadlines, or lose key personnel.” A spokesperson for the National Institutes of Health declined to comment. And there may be even more funding lost in the future due to Trump administration decisions. After a protest at the University of Washington campus Monday over the war in the Gaza Strip, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, announced that it was part of a task force reviewing UW’s response to the demonstration. About 30 people were arrested after occupying a campus building Monday, according to the university, whichcondemned the protestin a statement and described it as “dangerous” and “violent.” The Trump administration previously canceled federal grants at Columbia Universityduring a similar reviewand has said Harvard University will receive no new grants until it makes a series of reforms, includingchanges to policies about protests and antisemitism. Although the review was only announced Tuesday, the administration’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a news release that “the university must do more to deter future violence and guarantee that Jewish students have a safe and productive learning environment,” adding that it expected UW “to follow up with enforcement actions and policy changes.” A university science laboratory operates like a small factory where workers are churning out ideas, research and data, rather than furniture or light bulbs. Traditionally, these labs’ primary customers are federal science agencies, like NIH or NSF. Think of a lab’s principal investigator as akin to a company president. In the grant process, they must convince the government or private funders to buy their product — unique research — and then pay graduate students in wages and tuition. “I’m like a small-business owner,” said Adair, who recently left Seattle to serve as a professor and associate director at the UMass Chan Medical School’s gene therapy center. “I have to pay myself. I have to pay my staff. I have to find the money to do the research.” In the first few months of 2025, funding for NIH grants has lagged the year prior by at least $2.3 billion,according to STAT News. NIH has also canceled grant applications as ittargets politically disfavored topicslike infectious diseases, according to critics. That funding slowdown has forced many principal investigators to reduce their lab’s size. “We’ve had to make personnel cuts,” said Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine at UW Medicine, adding that he had been forced to rescind a job offer to a postdoctoral researcher from China who had been doing research in his lab for nearly three years. It cost the researcher her visa, he said. Another member of his lab left to take a job at a Chinese gene synthesis firm. Several have seen placements rescinded at other institutions. “This is the first year where people didn’t get into graduate school,” Greninger said, about technicians in his lab who have completed undergraduate degrees, adding that they had done “everything right.” Dr. Anna Wald, the head of allergy and infectious diseases at UW Medicine, the university’s school of medicine and hospital system, said several principal investigators in her department cut part of their own salaries to keep their staffers on. Meanwhile, Adair paid out of her own pocket to send students to conferences that could advance their careers. The uncertainty has also simply wasted time, some said. “Everybody is spending a lot of time dealing with changes in how the university operates,” said Jakob Von Moltke, an associate professor of immunology at the University of Washington. “Everything just functions less efficiently and there’s less innovation.” With so many professors uncertain about funding, many first-year graduate students seeking a lab are struggling to find positions. At some UW departments, first-year graduate students often rotate between labs for several months before they select a home for the following four or five years. “A lot of people are scrambling to find a lab to settle into and a lot of faculty are unable to commit to taking students, or backing out of commitments,” said Dustin Mullaney, a first-year doctoral student studying molecular and cellular biology. Still, many first-years consider themselves lucky — at least they got in. Most UW departments have reduced upcoming graduate classes by 25%-50%, according to court filings in a case filed by16 state attorneys general aiming to restore the flow of NIH funding. “I think we are going to lose most of a generation of scientists,” said Henry Mangapalli, a first-year doctoral student in the laboratory medicine department. Meanwhile, doctoral students nearing graduation say they’re being recruited to move abroad. Kristin Weinstein, a fourth-year doctoral student in the department of immunology working on autoimmune research, planned to graduate next year, find a postdoctoral research position at a U.S. university and eventually become a professor. But now, faced with hiring freezes and shrinking labs, Weinstein said she’s considering moving her family, including an infant son, out of the U.S. Before UW’s austerity actions, Weinstein booked travel to Switzerland so she could present her research at the World Immune Regulation Meeting 2025, a key conference in her field. “What it turned into was a lot of informational interviewing,” Weinstein said. “I talked to faculty who are in Australia, faculty who are in Germany, faculty who are in Luxembourg and Denmark. … There was active recruiting happening.” Baker, the Nobel winner who directs the Institute for Protein Design, said that more than 15 of his graduate students and postdoctoral researchers were aiming for new roles overseas. Meanwhile, other students have seen their research upended. Nelson Niu, a fourth-year doctoral student in mathematics, said he had planned to spend six years teaching students and completing his thesis, a timeline sanctioned by his department. But on March 11 he received an email from his department chair saying the policy had changed for fourth-year students because of new financial realities, and people like Niu were now only guaranteed five years of funding. “Jarring,” Niu said of the notice; now he’d have to pack two years of study into one. Arjun Kumar, a third-year doctoral student studying why T cells lose their ability to fight off tumors, was working with National Cancer Institute researchers to potentially apply some of his research findings to a type of treatment pioneered there. But Kumar said he lost weeks of time after the NIH placed a temporary communications freeze on federal researchers this winter. “They were already working on key experiments for us and they already had data they couldn’t send us because they couldn’t email us,” Kumar said. Later, Kumar learned the NCI researchers no longer had the bandwidth to help. “It was an exciting collaboration that was snuffed out in the moment,” Kumar said. Washington is one of 16 states suing the NIH and HHS over its slowdown in grant funding. A judge will hear arguments Thursday as the state attorneys general seek a preliminary injunction. Meanwhile, the pressure on scientists to leave the U.S. is only increasing. On Monday, the European Unionlaunched a drive to attract scientists to Europe, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a commitment of $566 million to attract U.S. talent and “make Europe a magnet for researchers.” “It has been really challenging to my identity as an American citizen to think about having to leave the country to pursue my career,” Weinstein said. “It feels like the American dream is dead.”",

    "title": "Attorney Mark Geragos calls Sean 'Diddy' Combs prosecutors a 'six-pack of white women'",
    "article_text": "Defense attorney Mark Geragos was admonished by the judge in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ sex-trafficking trial for referring to prosecutors as “a six-pack of white women.” Geragos, whois not officially onCombs’ defense team but is working with its jury consultant, made the comment recently on the “2 Angry Men” podcast he co-hosts with TMZ founder Harvey Levin. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian told Geragos in a conversation in his chambers that he would be listening and watching him to make sure he doesn’t say anything that could interfere with a fair trial. “I think this is ridiculous,” Subramanian said. “I think referring to the prosecution in this case as a six-pack of white women is outrageous. ... This would not be tolerated in any court from any lawyer anywhere across the nation.” “You have one more listener for your podcast,” he added. “As long as you subscribe, I’m all for it,” Geragos responded. Geragos’ daughter, Teny Geragos, is on Combs’ legal team and has been a guest on the podcast. Mark Geragos has offered his opinion on a variety of topics about the case on “2 Angry Men,” including a March 2016 hotel surveillance video that shows Combs beating and dragging his former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, who was signed to his music label as Cassie. Prosecutors have said the video isa critical piece of evidence against Combs, 55, who is charged with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. Subramanian rejected a request from the defense towithhold the video from evidence. After CNN aired the video last year, Combs apologized publicly, saying that his behavior in it was “inexcusable” and that he took full responsibility for his actions. On his podcast, Geragos described the video as “character assassination.” Before prospective jurors were questioned Tuesday, the second day of jury selection in federal court in Manhattan, Subramanian asked Mark Geragos whether he was advising Combs. Geragos, who has had a number of high-profile clients, including O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson and singer Chris Brown, said he has known Combs for years and is representing his mother in another case. “I do talk with him with great frequency,” he said, adding that he has represented Combs in the past. Geragos also defended his statements, telling the judge, “I think when you’ve got a Black man who’s being prosecuted and the client feels like he’s being targeted, it’s an observation.” The prosecution asked Subramanian in a letter filed Tuesday to remind Geragos and members of his law firm not to make public statements that might hinder a fair trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik, a member of the six-women prosecution team, outlined those concerns about Geragos’ comments in court Tuesday, saying that the podcast has several million subscribers and his remarks could infect the jury pool. Subramanian had said he hoped to seat a jury of 12 people and six alternates by Wednesday, but it appears it could take until the end of the week. Many prospective jurors have said they were aware of the sex-trafficking case andhad seen the surveillance videoon CNN.",

    "article_text": "Chief Justice John Roberts stressed the importance of an independent judiciary Wednesday in remarks delivered at a time whenTrump administrationofficials are frequently criticizing courts that have blocked their policies. Roberts, speaking at a public event in Buffalo, New York, said an independent judiciary is a key feature of the U.S. constitutional system that had not existed in other countries when it was founded. \"In our Constitution ... the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government, separate from the others, with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,\" he said. \"And that innovation doesn't work if ... the judiciary is not independent,\" he added. \"Its job is to, obviously, decide cases but, in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive, and that does require a degree of independence.\" Follow live politics coverage here Roberts, responding to a question from Buffalo-based U.S. District Judge Lawrence Vilardo, was not addressing President Donald Trump specifically, and his comments were mild compared with forceful remarks liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jacksonmade last week. Vilardo also asked Roberts about calls from Trump and his allies to impeach judges who have ruled against the administration. Roberts pointed to astatementhe had issuedon the subject and did not elaborate further. \"Well, I've already spoken to that. You know, impeachment is not how you register disagreement with decisions,\" Roberts said. Referring to the Supreme Court's taking up cases on appeal, Vilardo said, \"That's what you're for, right?\" \"That's what we're there for,\" Roberts replied. Last year, Roberts authored the majority opinion when the courtruled that Trump had some immunityfrom criminal prosecution for acts taken during his first term in a decision that boosted Trump's re-election bid. The court hears oral arguments next week on Trump's effort to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States. Roberts, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, was in Buffalo to mark the 125th anniversary of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. He spent his early years in Buffalo, he noted, but after he moved to Indiana he changed his allegiances from the Buffalo Bills to the Chicago Bears. That admission led to some boos from the audience Wednesday.",

    "title": "HHS plan to use Medicare and Medicaid data to study autism alarms experts over privacy",
    "article_text": "Autism experts and advocates expressed alarm after the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday it intends to create a database of enrolled Medicare and Medicaid patients to support a study aimed at identifying the “root causes” of autism. Under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will partner up to build the database, using insurance claims data, electronic medical records and wearable technology, like smartwatches. In a release, Kennedy said the agency is “pulling back the curtain — with full transparency and accountability — to deliver the honest answers families have waited far too long to hear.” An HHS spokesperson declined a request to make an agency official available to discuss the project, including how it will be implemented, how it will define autism and how the data will be able to identify its causes. In a news release, the agency said researchers would focus on autism diagnosis trends, outcomes from medical and behavior therapies, access to care and disparities by demographics and geography, and health care costs. Scientists have identified a variety ofrisk factors linked to the development of autistic traits— most of whichexist before birth— including more than 100 genes believed to play a role in 60% to 80% of cases. Experts who’ve already spent decades researching the disorder said they worry about patient privacy under the new plan. There’s a “lack of clarity around how the data will be collected, how it will be shared, maintained, and how we know it’s going to be accurate,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit group that helps to fund evidence-based autism research. Singer said her team has been inundated with calls and emails from people in the autism community concerned over the lack of transparency from federal health officials about how their private medical data would be obtained and managed. Thedatabase project doesn’t include input from the autism community and overlooks well-established genetic links to the disorder, experts say. “We’ve had expert scientists who have been studying this issue for 20 years,” Singer said. “If there were one environmental toxin, I think we would have found it.” In a statement, the HHS spokesperson said, “Wearable devices can provide continuous, real-world data on sleep patterns, physical activity, stress markers, environmental exposures, and more — all of which may help researchers identify early-life factors associated with autism spectrum disorder.” The spokesperson didn’t respond to a question about how wearable devices would detect environmental exposures or who would be using them. Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics and director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford Medicine, called the idea of using wearables to learn more about autism in general a “phenomenal idea.” The challenge, he said, is that using wearables to get at the causes of autism would ideally require participants to wear them at an early age, before a diagnosis, and would also require a large sample size. Snyder is leading a small pilot study with a wearable device his team invented that measures environmental exposures as well as sleep and activity levels, to see if there are any links to autism. Singer said that currently, wearables are only used to alert teachers and caregivers to when an autistic person may become overwhelmed and overstimulated, and in need of a break. “In the profound autism community, we’re using wearables to give an early warning as to when a meltdown might occur or self-injury may occur,” she said. “That enables someone to intervene.” Autism and its possible causes have been an obsession for Kennedy over decades, starting with his false claim linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to the disorder — aconnection that has been widely debunked by research from several countries.Experts predicted that Kennedy would revisit his mission as health secretary — which came true last month when he announced a study to identify the root causes by September. Following areport published in April by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthat found a rise in autism rates in children in the U.S., Kennedy said the study wouldlook at “environmental exposures,”including mold, food additives, pesticides and medicines. Federal health officials were recently forced to walk back a plan to create a national registry of people with autism after backlash from the autism community. The registry would’ve included data from private medical records, which autism advocacy groups warned could violate people’s privacy and lead to people with autism to avoid or refuse medical care “for fear of their data being shared without their permission,” according tothe Autism Science Foundation. It's unclear how the new project, which will also rely on medical records, is any different. Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said, “None of us have been consulted on this. Under previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, we have had more contact with HHS and more involvement in major projects involving autism.” “Had we been able to give input into this, we would have suggested more clarity and different research aids,” Gross said.",

    "title": "Pro-Palestinian protesters take over room in Columbia University library",
    "article_text": "Several people were arrested Wednesday night after protesters took over a room of a Columbia University library in a resurgence of theon-campus pro-Palestinian demonstrationsthatrocked the nation last spring. A New York police spokesperson could not provide the number of arrests, which came hours after demonstrators, many wearing keffiyehs, stormed into Butler Library, chanting slogans and facing off with police and campus security officers. Two Columbia Public Safety Officers were injured in a \"crowd surge\" as people tried to \"force\" their way into the library, the university said. Officers later ushered around 76 protesters in zip ties out of the building, an NBC News crew witnessed Wednesday night. Columbia Universitysaid in a statement Wednesday afternoonthat it was \"dealing with a disruption in reading room 301 of Butler Library,\" saying its public safety team was \"working to mitigate the situation.\" Columbia waited hours after the disruptions began to request police assistance, withofficers respondingat around 7:10 p.m. Multiple people who did not comply with verbal warnings from police to disperse were taken into custody. Israel's security Cabinetapproved a plan to seize all of the Gaza Stripon Monday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the plan an intensive military operation aimed at defeating Hamas. Gaza remains under a blockade by Israel, the longest since the war began in October 2023, as Israel'stotal ban on the entry of all goods, including food, fuel and medical supplies,enters its third month. The Trump administration is also seeking to block federal funding from some universities, includingColumbiaandHarvard, for what it says is their failure to quell last year's protests and combat antisemitism on campus. The administration is reviewing the status of \"the trespassers and vandals\" who were involved in Wednesday's demonstration,Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media. Around 3:30 p.m., Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), a group that calls on the university to divest its ties from Israel, publicized an \"EMERGENCY RALLY: ALL OUT TO BUTLER LIBRARY\"on social media. The group said more than \"100 actionists have reclaimed the main reading room as the Basil-Al-Araj Popular University.\" The post called on others to \"support, bring noise, and wear a mask.\" \"The flood shows that as long as Columbia funds and profits from imperialist violence, the people will continue to disrupt Columbia's profits and legitimacy,\" CUADwrote on Substack. \"Repression breeds resistance — if Columbia escalates repression, the people will continue to escalate disruptions on this campus.\" Videosposted by the group Columbia Jewish & Israeli Studentsshowed people chanting \"free, free, free Palestine” as they walked throughout the building. A second video showed a large group of people, many wearing keffiyehs, gathered and loudly chanting in what appeared to be the reading room. Those involved protest also appeared to have vandalized structures in the library.Photos posted by CUADappeared to show messages, including \"free Gaza\" and \"we will always come back for Palestine,\" scribbled in marker on tables and glass cases. Columbia had asked protesters to identify themselves and leave. It said that it repeatedly asked the protesters for their identification and that they \"were repeatedly told that failure to comply would result in violations of our rules and policies and possible arrest for trespassing.\" The demonstrators werebarred from leaving the librarywithout presenting public safety officers with their identifications. A large group of protesters, their faces obscured by keffiyehs, appeared to try to force their way through a set of doors where a group of what appeared to be security officers was standing,video on social media shows. Officers appeared to resist and push the group back as someone on a megaphone pleaded with the group to \"stop pushing, please,\" the video showed. The speaker says the protesters would be allowed to go if they took out their ID cards, to which the group responded with a resounding \"No!\" and a chant of \"Let us go!\" The university allowed others in the library who were not involved in the protest to leave. In an alert sent to students, it said that the library was closed and that the area should remain clear. The people involved in the protest refused to identify themselves and leave, Columbia said Wednesday evening, prompting the call to police. “Requesting the presence of the NYPD is not the outcome we wanted, but it was absolutely necessary to secure the safety of our community,” it said in a statement, saying it believed people not affiliated with the university were also involved. \"Disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated and are violations of our rules and policies; this is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams,\" it said. \"Columbia strongly condemns violence on our campus, antisemitism and all forms of hate and discrimination, some of which we witnessed today.\" Outside the library, other groups of masked protesters in various locations around campus continued chanting, videos showed. Avideo showed dozens of peoplepushing up against police barricades just outside the campus at 114th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In the Substack post, CUAD offered insight into the protest's location and meaning. The group said it \"renamed\" the library to Basel Al-Araj Popular University as a reference to Basel al-Araj, a Palestinian writer \"whose writings on the Palestinian resistance and on the nature of war guide revolutionaries around the world today.\" He was killed by Israeli forces in 2017,Al Jazeera reported at the time. The group said it chose Butler Library to rebuke the man for whom the building is named, Nicholas Murray Butler, a former president of the university whom the group called \"a shameless Nazi sympathizer.\" CUAD also offered its demands of Columbia, including full financial divestment from Israel, for police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to leave campus, and amnesty for all \"targeted by Columbia University's Discipline.\" In April of last year, after she met with student groups amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus,then-President Minouche Shafiksaid that the schoolwould not divest from Israeland that it and the students were unable to reach any agreement to end the protests. Theuniversity announced\"multi-year suspensions, temporary degree revocations and expulsions\" in March for people who participated in the protest occupying Hamilton Hall on campus last spring. It was not clear how many students were disciplined. It is not clear whether ICE agents maintain a consistent presence on Columbia's campus, as CUAD's demands suggest, but agents were on the premises at least once in recent months, when they took student protest organizerMahmoud Khalil into custodyat his university-owned apartment building in March. Khalil has been detained in Louisiana since shortly after he was arrested and has beenfighting his detentionand potential deportation in court. In three statements in the two days after Khalil’s arrest, the university said its policy is to comply with the law but also to require law enforcement operating in its nonpublic spaces to have judicial warrants. Khalil wasdetained without an arrest warrant, the Trump administration said later. In March, the schoolagreed to a list of demands from the Trump administrationto restore federal funding that had been stripped. One of the demands was to hire 36 new campus security officers who, unlike previous security officers, will have the authority to arrest students.",

    "title": "Mysterious brain diseases in Canada weren’t a mystery after all",
    "article_text": "Six years ago, a Canadian neurologist claimed to notice strange symptoms in a cluster of patients in New Brunswick, a province bordering Maine. According to the neurologist, Dr. Alier Marrero, the patients suffered hallucinations, spasms, rapid memory loss and the sensation that bugs were crawling underneath their skin, but their symptoms and brain scans didn’t neatly fit an existing diagnosis. In other words, the cases were a mystery. But since then, neurologists who have reviewed the cases have identified clear diagnoses, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer. Astudy published this weekin JAMA Neurology reinforces those findings, putting the probability of a mystery disease at roughly 1 in a million. Doctors working on the study evaluated 25 people who had been identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster. Eleven of the patients had died, so neuropathologists used autopsies to determine their illnesses. For the 14 living patients, neurologists relied on cognitive assessments, among other tests. They concluded that all of thepatients had well-known conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cancer, traumatic brain injuries or post-concussion symptoms. “We really felt we had a good explanation for 100% of the cases,” said an author of the study, Dr. Anthony Lang, a neurologist at University Health Network’s Krembil Brain Institute. However, some doctors worry it won’t be enough to quash speculation that the cases have an unknown origin — a theory many patients and their families have clung to. According to the study authors, 52 people identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster refused second opinions, and 42 more didn’t respond to the authors’ reaching out. The study attributes that to declining trust in health institutions and the spread of misinformation on both traditional and social media. “These were examples of misdiagnosis that then led to misinformation. And sadly, the physician involved continues to believe and convince the patients and families that they have a mysterious illness,” Lang said. Marrero took issue with the study and its findings in a statement. “I am in profound disagreement with the study conclusions and have many questions regarding the methods and the content,” he said. “I am sure that our patients, families, and communities share the same very serious concerns.” Dr. Valerie Sim, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Alberta who wasn’t involved in the study, said there has been no proof that the patients’ illnesses are related. In fact, she said, the cases are “so broad in their description that we could all have this mysterious illness.” “Sadly, the one thing that all the patients have in common is the same neurologist,” Sim said. “And the patients who have been seen by other neurologists get a diagnosis of a known entity that’s not a mystery.” James Mastrianni, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago who wasn’t part of the research, said the study reinforces that “a second opinion by an expert in the field is often helpful.” The mystery illness theory gained traction in 2021 when Canadian health authorities began investigating cases based on Marrero’s reports. But even after the investigationdetermined that most patients had known conditions, some families were skeptical. In November, the premier of New Brunswick, Susan Holt,called on the province’s health ministerto conduct a scientific review “into the mystery brain disease.” “New Brunswickers deserve answers,” Holtsaid in a statementlast year. “We need to know what’s making us sick.” Some patient advocates now believe an environmental exposure is triggering the illnesses, claiming patients’ blood and urine tests show the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and rare antibodies that warrant further study. “It wasn’t ever about whether a patient could have an alternative diagnosis,” said Kat Lanteigne, an advocate from New Brunswick. “It was what has triggered them to have this neurodegenerative disease?” Dr. Yves Léger, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, said in a statement Wednesday that the new study “doesn’t change my Office’s intention to complete its own investigation into cases of undiagnosed neurological illness in New Brunswick.” His office has received222 reports of casesidentified as part of the cluster. Marrero said he has “evaluated more than 500 patients in this cluster, and provided a significant amount of unequivocal, sometimes critical environmental exposure evidences, as well as rare autoimmune markers in many of them.” But Lang said that just because a substance is in blood or urine doesn’t mean it caused someone’s neurological symptoms. “You don’t do a shotgun approach looking for anything and everything and then finding something and claiming it’s related to what the problem is,” he said. Neurologists with no connection to the New Brunswick cases point to a few reasons advocates, doctors and government officials are still debating the cause of the illnesses. For one, they said, accurate diagnoses can take time. And some of the conditions detected in the study, like Alzheimer’s, can have complex presentations. “It really takes a cohesive story from the family and a timeline to understand if someone is developing dementia. There can be confusing signs on a neurologic exam,” said Dr. Kimberly O’Neill, a neurologist in the NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. One of the core symptoms used to identify the New Brunswick patients was rapidly progressing dementia. But families sometimes miss early signs of neurodegeneration, making it appear that dementia came on suddenly, Mastrianni said. Once debilitating symptoms arrive, patients and their families are often desperate for answers and may be reluctant to let go of the first diagnoses they get, Sim said. “We see this all the time in medicine, that patients gravitate to a diagnosis or a group entity,” Sim said. “That’s clearly what’s happening here.” The misdiagnoses are “really a tragedy,” she added, because patients could be missing out on treatments or proper care.",

    "title": "Trump changes his tune on speedy trade deals: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Jonathan Allen digs into how Team Trump is shifting its message on trade deals as they’ve been slow to come to fruition. Plus, Andrea Mitchell examines a potential crossroads in the relationship between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and White House aides were boasting that his tariffs would force a legion of foreign nations to rush into new trade deals — and that Trump’s prowess would yield more favorable terms for the United States. “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--,” Trump said last month before his reciprocal tariffs were due to go into effect. “They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything. I’ll do anything, sir!’” After Trump paused some of his tariffs and declared a three-month negotiating window, his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said a few days later on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” “We’ve got 90 deals in 90 days possibly pending here.” But Trump has changed his tone and his tune in recent days, as it has become clear that trade agreements don’t materialize as quickly as he would like and that there aren’t dozens in the queue. His shift also comes amid heavy criticism that his tariffs will hike prices for consumers and harm an American economy that had its first negative growth in years in the first quarter. “You keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign one? It’s very simple. We’re going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. In some cases we want you to drop your tariffs,” an obviously frustrated Trump told reporters Tuesday. “So I wish they’d keep, you know, stop asking, ‘How many deals are you signing this week?’ Because one day we’ll come and we’ll give you 100 deals. And they don’t have to sign.” Beyond the ambitious sweep of trying to haggle with scores of nations at once, the United States has yet to open discussions with its largest trading partner — China — since Trump applied a 145% across-the-board tariff on its products. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers Wednesday that hisplanned meetingwith Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend amounts to an early phase of negotiations that is not as far along as talks with less crucial nations. Read more → Holding steady:The Federal Reserve said it wasleaving interest rates unchangedas it warned that the chances of both higher unemployment and higher inflation had climbed in the wake of Trump’s tariff plan. When President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the Yemeni Houthis had agreed to stop firing on U.S ships in the Red Sea and that the United States had halted its airstrikes against the Iran-backed militia, America’s closest ally in the Middle East was caught unaware. Israel didn’t even know a ceasefire was in the works, and its vessels aren’t covered by the truce. In fact, the same day, Israel had hammered the airport in Yemen’s capital, retaliating for a Houthi strike almost hit Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. The Houthis haven’t said whether they are also extending safe passage to other international shipping so they could resume sailing through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, a much cheaper route than the lengthier voyage around the Horn of Africa. The first public hint of a possible breach between U.S. and Israeli leadership came when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House last month, hoping the United Stateswould provide air support for a possible Israeli operation against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Instead, Trump announced he would agree to direct talks with Iran. And now, the administration is pressuring Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release within days. That’s because Trump wants to announce an agreement before he leaves next week for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar for the first foreign trip of his second term. His impatience is rooted in his hope of making progress toward completing the Abraham Accords, which he initiated in his first term, by getting Saudi Arabia to take the first steps toward recognizing Israel. The effort continued under President Joe Biden, but it collapsed when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggering the war in Gaza. And the Saudis won’t consider it while the war continues. But Hamas is entrenched, Israel has reoccupied two-thirds of Gaza, and Netanyahu’s Cabinet has called up the reserves to expand the fighting. This week, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff keynoted Israel’s Independence Day celebration in Washington, D.C., by gently chiding Israelis to overcome their political divisions. On Wednesday, Netanyahu’s closest political adviser, Ron Dermer, the former ambassador to the United States, arrived in Washington for ceasefire talks with Secretary of State/national security adviser Marco Rubio and Witkoff. The question is: Will Netanyahu reverse course in Gaza to achieve an even more important shared goal with the United States — an economic and security agreement with Saudi Arabia, completing his dream of peace and prosperity with the Arab world? That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Bridget Bowman.

    "title": "Road rage victim 'speaks' via AI at his killer's sentencing",
    "article_text": "The road-rage killer of an Arizona man was sentenced last week to 10½ years behind bars after his victim spoke to the court via artificial intelligence in what could be the first-of-its-kind use of the technology, officials said Wednesday. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang on Thursdaygave the maximum sentence to Gabriel Paul Horcasitas for the fatal shooting of Christopher Pelkey, 37, on Nov. 13, 2021, prosecutors said. Horcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and endangerment this year. Lang allowed Pelkey's loved ones to play an AI-generated version of the victim — his face and body and a lifelike voice that appeared to ask the judge for leniency. “To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me: It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" the artificial version of Pelkey said. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness.\" The idea of using an AI version of Pelkey came from his family, not the state, according to his loved ones and a Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesperson. Stacey Wales, Pelkey’s sister, and his brother-in-law both work in the AI field. When Wales suggested bringing her late brother to life like that, she said, her husband was more than hesitant. \"He recoiled,\" Wales told NBC News. \"And he said: 'Stacey, do you know what you're asking me to do? This is my best friend.' And I said: 'I know. It's my brother.' And then he said, 'If this isn't perfect, if this doesn't go out and really embody the spirit of Chris, I'm not going to let this be shown.'\" Horcasitas had been convicted of manslaughter and endangerment at trial in spring 2023. But a new trial was ordered when a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to property disclose potentially key evidence in a timely manner. Wales said she hadn't come up with the idea in 2023. After two years of trying to craft a victim impact statement, she said, she had the epiphany that the only voice that mattered was her late brother's. \"Every time I'd get in the shower or the car and my thoughts were quiet, I wrote down what I was feeling — frustrated, crying or emotions, yelling, anger, love, anything that I could think of,\" she said. \"I've been writing it for two years, but I never had the idea to help Chris speak until a week and a half before this second trial.\" She added: \"What I had to say did not seem like it would do justice to the last person listening to make a decision on Chris' life.\" Horcasitas faced seven to 10½ years in prison. The defense asked for the lowest punishment. Lang delivered the maximum, but he acknowledged the words in the presentation. \"And as angry as you are, justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" he said. \"I feel like that was genuine, that his obvious forgiveness of Mr. Horcasitas reflects the character I heard about [Pelkey] today.\" Defense lawyer Jason Lamm said the AI presentation created a strong issue for appeal. \"While judges certainly have latitude as to what to hear, particularly from victims, an appellate court will have to decide if this was error,\" Lamm said, \"if it was just simply too far over the line in terms of being inflammatory and to what degree the judge relied on it in imposing a sentence on my client.\" Arizona State University law professor Gary Marchant, who specializes in ethics and emerging technologies, praised Pelkey's loved ones for producing a work that appeared to be against their self-interest of securing a maximum penalty for Horcasitas. But he said he's worried about the precedent it set. \"The family did a really good job of representing what he would have said, and they would have the best sense of what he would have said,\" Marchant said. \"But on the other hand, it's completely fake, right? It's not true.\" While prosecutors and defense lawyers have long used visual aids, charts and other illustrations to make their points, Marchant said, AI presents new ethical challenges. \"I mean, it's a blurry line, right?\" said Marchant, who is on a state Supreme Courtcommittee advisingon the use of AI. \"You see someone speaking who isn't really speaking, right? You see that person in the courtroom actually speaking, and in reality, they're dead and they're not speaking. So this is an extra jump that I feel is going to get us into dangerous grounds.\"",

    "title": "Energy Star, efficiency program that has steered consumer choice, targeted in cuts",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press An Energy Star logo is displayed on a box for a freezer Jan. 21, 2025, in Evendale, Ohio.Joshua A. Bickel/APhide caption An Environmental Protection Agency plan to eliminate its Energy Star offices would end a decades-old program that gave consumers a choice to buy environmentally friendly refrigerators, dishwashers and other electronics and save money on electric bills, consumer and environmental groups said. The changes, outlined in agency documents reviewed by The Associated Press, are part of a broad reorganization at the EPA that would eliminate or reorganize significant parts of the office focused on air pollution. Those plans advance President  Trump's sharp turn away from the prior administration's focus on climate change. The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program, first reported Tuesday by CNN, but said the reorganization \"is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency's core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.\" The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 with the goal of tackling environmental protection and economic growth. It boosts the market for energy-efficient products and benefits companies that design appliances that earn the label. A home that decides to buy Energy Star products can save $450 annually on energy costs, the program's website says. \"People recognize it right away, so they would be like 'oh, it is Energy Star, so I should probably go with this one,'\" said Francis Dietz, spokesperson with the trade association Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the program enjoyed bipartisan support until recently. It promotes efficiency by tightening standards when lots of products are able to meet the label requirements, he said. Since its start, the program has reduced energy costs by more than $500 billion and prevented about 4 billion metric tons of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, according to its website. Appliances can be responsible for tons of air pollution, but efficiency measures can reduce the carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and fine particulate matter that producing the electricity releases into the atmosphere. These pollutants can harm the heart and lungs, and cause other health issues. Trump's proposed budget asks that Congress eliminate the EPA's entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The budget described the program as \"an overreach of Government authority that imposes unnecessary and radical climate change regulations on businesses and stifles economic growth.\" But Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, said America's energy independence depends on the ability to meet U.S. energy demands, and cutting the program imperils that and strains households at the same time. Gleeson said losing Energy Star will make it harder for consumers to have trustworthy information about products' energy use. The Energy Star label is voluntary for products that meet certain efficiency levels, and differs from Department of Energy standards that set minimum efficiency requirements that products must meet to be legally sold. In the 2000s, Congress directed the EPA and Department of Energy to run an energy-efficiency program and promote Energy Star. The DOE did not comment on the changes and its role moving forward, deferring questions to the EPA. According to the program's website, DOE's role includes developing product testing procedures. The EPA is responsible for setting performance levels and ensuring consumers can rely on the label. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said it supports a streamlined Energy Star program through the DOE. Spokeswoman Jill Notini said that \"would meet the administration's goals of preserving a full selection of products from which consumers can choose, and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.\" The move is the latest in the Trump administration's broader deregulatory effort. They've announced plans to slash Biden-era policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritized fossil fuels and an energy-dominance policy. The president has been particularly keen on eliminating efficiency standards, arguing they result in products that cost more and are less effective, and that they deny consumer choice. Trump has reversed rules restricting water flow for showerheads and other household appliances. Trumptargeted Energy Star during his first stintin the White House, but faced backlash. \"For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an 'energy emergency,' Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,\" Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club said in a statement. \"When we waste energy through inefficient appliances the fossil fuel industry uses it as an excuse to extract and sell more of its product to make more money on the backs of the American people.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "In the wake of tariffs, cargo at the Port of LA is down 35%",
    "article_text": "By Steve Futterman A view of shipping cranes at the Port of Los Angeles on May 06, 2025 in San Pedro, California. Los Angeles and Long Beach ports are seeing significant drops in expected cargo ships coming into port this week due to tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images North Americahide caption Each weekday morning outside the Dispatch Office of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Local 13, dozens of dock workers gather, hoping to get some work at the vast ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Usually it's relatively easy to find – and workers are given a white slip of paper with details of where to go and when to show up. But on Tuesday morning, many left empty-handed. \"Less volume of cargo containers means less work for us,\" said longshore worker Charlie Camacho. His job typically consists of loading and unloading shipping containers. \"So we feel it, we definitely feel it,\" he said. Together these two ports comprise an extremely busy port complex – the Port of Los Angeles alone is the busiest in theWestern Hemisphere. But inthe monthor so since tariffs against Chinese goods ratcheted up – port officials here have been predicting a drop in cargo. This week, they announced it was down 35% compared to the same week last year. The immediate impact of the cargo decline affects virtually every business around the ports: trucking, shipping, distribution centers, and others. But port officials say this downturn will soon be felt much more broadly – by manufacturers and retailers around the country, as well as consumers. In 2024,approximately 31%of everything that came into or out of the U.S. in shipping containers over water, came through this port complex. Last year, the ports handled 19.9 million of those containers – but it's likely to be less in 2025. Camacho, whose family has worked at the ports for three generations, spoke with pride about working as part of this system. \"My grandmother was one of the first women to work at the ports,\" he said. \"I sometimes think I am doing this for her.\" When asked about his chances of finding work on Tuesday, he was not optimistic – \"Ah man, like 25 percent, maybe,\" he responded. He ultimately left the dispatch office with no gig. It's not just longshore workers who are being affected – a dip in cargo affects a huge ecosystem of businesses that are connected to the importing and exporting of goods in Southern California. Frank Groves is an independent salesman who makes his money selling gloves and safety gear to port workers. He was also at the dispatch hall on Tuesday, trying to find customers – but he says business has dropped nearly 75 percent in recent weeks. \"No sales at all really.

He's the CEO of Customs Goods, which is based in nearby Carson, California and handles shipments of products once they arrive at the ports. \"We've seen significant reductions of import shipping volumes into this country,\" he said. \"That means significantly less volumes we will be handling on behalf of our customers.\" \"The situation is not good,\" said Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. \"People are quite concerned, absolutely.\" According to the Port's website, 1 in 12 jobs in Los Angeles and Long Beach are supported by the ports. But their economic footprintgoes well beyond Los Angeles and California. Trucks line up amid stacks of shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, in early April.Jae C. Hong/APhide caption \"The impact the Port of Los Angeles has on the city, the region, and the country cannot be understated,\" said Seroka. \"The cargo that moves through this port reaches not only all 50 states, but each one of our 435 congressional districts.\" That could include food, medical supplies, manufacturing components, and finished products, according to Sal Di Constanzo, a labor Relations Representative for the ILWU Local 13. The portlistsfurniture, auto parts, apparel and electronics among their top imports. \"You name it, they all come through our ports,\" Di Constanzo said. According to Seroka, big importers say shoppers could start to see shortages in four to six weeks, once inventory that was stockpiled ahead of the tariffs runs out. He says they also may start to see significant price hikes. Even if the increased tariffs go away, some of these problems could persist for a while, said Diane Middleton. She's a former Los Angeles City Harbor Commissioner who has been working with the ports for more than 50 years. \"You don't just have ships lined up like taxi cabs,\" she said. \"You have to reserve vessels. You have to specify a time. Once you've cut all that off, you can't bring it back in a minute.\" And in the long term, she added, decades-old trade patternsmay be permanently changed. She thinks that while the U.S. will always be a desired customer, countries like China may seek out others with less political upheaval in the trade sector to do business with in the future.

    "title": "How a visit from actor Jon Voight led Trump to post about movie tariffs",
    "article_text": "Mandalit del Barco Actor Jon Voight, his advisor and CEO of SP Media Group Steven Paul, President Trump, and SP Media Group/Atlas Comics president Scott Karol met at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend.Steven Paulhide caption Film industries around the world were surprised and confused this week by President Trump's announcement that he wanted to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. But the president's plan seems to be far from final — and his announcement has kicked off a broader conversation about the film industry's current struggles and potential policy solutions. \"The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,\" heposted Sunday night on Truth Social. \"Other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.\" The president later appeared to hedge on his initial plan for tariffs, telling reporters on Monday he was not looking to hurt the American film industry, and wants to meet with entertainment business leaders to make sure they're happy with his plan to bring back movie jobs. \"Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business,\" he said. \"They have a nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much.\" Trump's Truth Social announcement came after he met with actorJon Voight and two business associates over the weekend at Mar-a-Lago. The president named Voight one of his \"special ambassadors\" to Hollywood earlier this year — along with Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson. In a video shared with NPR this week, Voight said he presented Trump, who he called a friend, a plan to \"rescue\" the American film industry with federal tax incentives, co-production treaties with other countries and subsidies for theater owners and film and TV production companies. Voight called Trump \"the greatest president since Abe Lincoln\" and said the president \"loves the entertainment business, and wants to see Hollywood thrive and make films bigger and greater than ever before.\" Thetrade publicationDeadlinelater printedVoight's proposal, suggesting it included a 10% base rate federal tax credit for film and TV productions that could be combined with other credits — and an \"American cultural test\" that productions would have to meet to qualify. Voight's advisor Steven Paul, the CEO of SP Media Group, sent NPR a statement that the draft document was part of a private discussion not meant to be shared publicly. \"All of the ideas contained in the document were crafted solely for the purpose of discussion,\" he wrote. \"They are not intended to drive definitive political action, nor do they reflect any formal policy or position.\" He wrote that the document was the result of \"broad conversations\" that he and Voight had shared with guilds, unions, studios, and more about how to \"strengthen the future of our industry.\" Trump's initial announcement on Sunday gave few details, leaving many in the film industry to question how a tariff on films made outside the U.S. would work: Who would have to pay the tariffs? The studios? Film distributors? Will ticket prices go up? Would tariffs apply to international films or to American films shooting or filming around the world? What about TV and streaming shows? The news led to speculation on social media and in industry group chats, even late night talk show jokes. \"Next year,The White Lotusis gonna be set at a Hampton Inn,\"Jimmy Kimmel quipped on his show Monday night. Stock shares of Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Comcast dipped briefly during early-morning trading on Monday, after Trump's announcement went public. So far, studio executives have not commented about the tariff plan publicly. Neither has the Motion Picture Association, whose members include the major Hollywood studios. Though Trump blamed Calif. Governor Gavin Newsom earlier this week for \"allowing\" productions to leave California, Newsom signaled an openness to collaborate with the president to increase U.S. incentives for film and TV production — to the tune of $7.5billiondollars in federal tax credits. \"We're eager to partner with the Trump administration to further strengthen domestic production and Make America Film Again,\" Newsom said in a statement. Last fall, Newsom proposed more than doubling the current $350 million tax credit program for productions to shoot and film in California. Meanwhile, Trump's tariff idea was applauded by leaders of the Teamsters labor union. \"For years, Hollywood studios have hollowed out the industry by following Corporate America's crooked playbook of outsourcing good union jobs. Studios chase cheap production costs overseas while gutting the American workforce that built the film and TV industry,\" General President Sean O'Brien and Teamsters Motion Picture Division Director Lindsay Doughertysaid in a statement posted on X. \"This is a strong step toward finally reining in the studio's un-America addition to outsourcing our members' work.\" The head of IATSE, the union representing behind-the-scenes entertainment workers, said in a statement that any plan must not harm the U.S. or Canadian film industries. Studios and unions around the world are worried a tariff on movies made outside of the U.S.could spell the end of their own production industries. For decades, Canada, the UK, Australia and nearly 100 other countries have offered international productions generous tax incentives, rebates and grantsto shoot or film in their countries. Some have even built new sound studios to entice productions wanting to cut costs. Trump said on Truth Social that those global incentives are a \"threat\" to national security, and that his tariff proposal is meant to bring back show business jobs.

    "title": "After an Arizona man was shot, an AI video of him addresses his killer in court",
    "article_text": "Juliana Kim A screenshot of the AI generated video of Christopher Pelkey.YouTubehide caption For two years, Stacey Wales kept a running list of everything she would say at the sentencing hearing for the man who killed her brother in a road rage incident in Chandler, Ariz. But when she finally sat down to write her statement, Wales was stuck. She struggled to find the right words, but one voice was clear: her brother's. \"I couldn't help hear his voice in my head of what he would say,\" Wales told NPR. That's when the idea came to her: to use artificial intelligence to generate a video of how her late brother, Christopher Pelkey, would address the courtroom and specifically the man who fatally shot him at a red light in 2021. On Thursday, Wales stood before the court and played the video — in what AI experts say is likely the first time the technology has been used in the U.S.to create an impact statement read by an AI rendering of the deceased victim. Wales has been thinking about her victim impact statement since the initial trial in 2023. The case was retried in 2025 because of procedural problems with the first trial. The chance to speak in court meant a great deal to Wales, who held back her emotions throughout both trials to avoid influencing the jury. \"You're told that you cannot react, you cannot emote, you cannot cry,\" she said.  \"We looked forward to [sentencing] because we finally were gonna be able to react.\" Wales' attorney told her to humanize Pelkey and offer a complete picture of who he was. So Wales went on a mission. She said shecontacted as many people from Pelkey's life — from his elementary school teacher to high school prom date to the soldiers he served alongside in Iraq and Afghanistan. A photo of Christopher Pelkey walking his sister Stacey Wales down the aisle at her wedding.A photo of Chris Pelkey walking his sister Stacey Wales down the aisle at her wedding./Stacey Waleshide caption In total, Wales gathered 48 victim impact statements — not counting her own. When it was time to write hers, she was torn between saying how she truly felt and what she thought the judge would want to hear. \"I didn't wanna get up there and say, 'I forgive you,' 'cause I don't, I'm not there yet,\" she said. \"And the dichotomy was that I could hear Chris' voice in my head and he's like, 'I forgive him.'\" Pelkey's mantra had always been to love God and love others, according to Wales. He was the kind of man who would give the shirt off his back, she said. While she struggled to find the right words for herself, Wales said writing from his perspective came naturally. \"I knew what he stood for and it was just very clear to me what he would say,\" she added. That night, Wales turned to her husband Tim, who has experience using AI for work. \"He doesn't get a say. He doesn't get a chance to speak,\" Wales said, referring to her brother. \"We can't let that happen. We have to give him a voice.\" Tim and their business partner Scott Yentzer had only a few days to produce the video. The challenge: there's no single program built for a project like this. They also needed a long, clear audio clip of Pelkey's voice and a photo of him looking straight to the camera — neither of which Wales had. Still, using several AI tools, Wales' husband and Yentzer managed to create a convincing video using about a 4.5-minute-video of Pelkey, his funeral photo and a script that Wales prepared. They digitally removed the sunglasses on top of Pelkey's hat and trimmed his beard — which had been causing technological issues. Wales, who was heavily involved in making sure the video felt true to life, said recreating her brother's laugh was especially tough because most clips of Pelkey were filled with background noise. The experience made Wales reflect on her own mortality. So one evening, Wales stepped into her closest and recorded a nine-minute-video of herself talking and laughing — just in case her family ever needs clear audio of her voice someday. \"It was a weird out-of-body experience to think that way about your own mortality, but you never know when you're going to not be here,\" she said. The night before the sentencing hearing, Wales called her victim rights attorney, Jessica Gattuso, to tell her about the video. Gattuso told NPR that she was initially hesitant about the idea because she had never heard of it being done before in Arizona court. She was also worried that the video may not be received well. But after seeing the video, she felt compelled that it should be viewed in court. \"I knew it would have an impact on everyone including the shooter, because it was a message of forgiveness,\" Gattuso said. Ten people spoke in support of Pelkey at the sentencing hearing. The AI-generated video of him went last.\"Hello. Just to be clear for everyone seeing this, I'm a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile,\" the AI avatar said. The videowent on to thank everyone in Pelkey'slife who contributed an impact statement and attended the hearing. Then, the video addressed his shooter, Gabriel Paul Horcasitas. \"It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances. In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the video said. The video ended with the avatarencouraging everyone to love one another and live life to the fullest. \"Well, I'm gonna go fishing now. Love you all. See you on the other side,\" it concluded. Neither the defense nor the judge pushed back. Later in the hearing, Judge Todd Lang said, \"I loved that AI. Thank you for that.\" A photo of Christopher Pelkey.Stacey Waleshide caption He added, \"It says something about the family because you told me how angry you were and you demanded the maximum sentence. And even thought that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart, as you saw it. I didn't hear him asking for the maximum sentence.\" Horcasitas received 10.5 years for manslaughter. Wales said she didn't realize how deeply the video would affect her and her family. For her teenage son, it was a chance to hear his uncle say goodbye. For Wales, it gave her the strength to finally look back at photos of her brother. \"Going through this process of AI and what he'd sound like and trimming his beard and inserting laughs and all these other things, it was very cathartic and it was part of the healing process,\" she said. Over the years, there have been a growing number of examples testing the bounds of AI's role in the courtroom. For instance, in 2023, President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen unwittingly sent his attorneybogus AI-generated legal citations. More recently, last month, a man attempted to use anAI-generated lawyer avatarin court — an effort that was quickly shut down by the judge. But the use of AI for a victim impact statement appears novel, according to Maura Grossman, a professor at the University of Waterloo who has studied the applications of AI in criminal and civil cases. She added, that she did not see any major legal or ethical issues in Pelkey's case. \"Because this is in front of a judge, not a jury, and because the video wasn't submitted as evidence per se, its impact is more limited,\" she told NPR via email. Some experts, including Grossman, predict generative AI will become more common in the legal system, but it raises various legal and ethical questions. When it comes to victim impact statements, key concerns include questions around consent, fairness and whether the content was made in good faith. \"Victim statements like this that truly try to represent the dead victim's voice are probably the least objectionable use of AI to create false videos or statements,\" Gary Marchant, a professor of law, ethics and emerging technologies at Arizona State University's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, wrote in an email. \"Many attempts to use AI to create deep fakes will be much more malevolent,\" he added. Wales herself cautions people who may follow in her footsteps to act with integrity and not be driven by selfish motives. \"I could have been very selfish with it,\" she said. \"But it was important not to give any one person or group closure that could leave somebody else out.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "3 former Memphis police officers found not guilty in the death of Tyre Nichols",
    "article_text": "By Katie Riordan A composite image of former Memphis Police Department officers Tadarrius Bean (from left), Justin Smith and Demetrius Haley in court in Memphis, Tenn., on May 3. The former officers were charged with fatally beating Tyre Nichols in 2023. They each took the stand to decline to testify on their own behalf.Chris Day/The Commercial Appeal via APhide caption A jury found three former Memphis, Tenn., police officers not guilty of all charges in the death of Tyre Nichols, including the most serious charge of second-degree murder. The men, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, faced a total of seven counts in the state trial for their role in the 2023 fatal beating of Nichols, a 29-year-old father who had told officers he was on his way home when they stopped him. They hugged each other and their attorneys after the verdict was read. Nichols' family left the courtroom without speaking to the media after the verdict. They spoke briefly with Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who said they were \"devastated\" and \"outraged.\" \"I think we can understand why they'd be outraged by this result, given the evidence,\" he said. Mulroy said he respects the jury's decision but couldn't make sense of it. \"What I do know is this, Tyre Nichols is dead and deserves to be alive, and that is a tragedy,\" he said. A total of five former officers were initially fired and charged with both federal and state crimes related to Nichols' death.Two pleaded guilty in federal courtlast year andtestified against their former colleagues. Both Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills also intend to plead guilty to state offenses. This was the second time the three officers faced trial. Last fall, they were convicted in a separatefederal case of witness tamperingfor misleading superiors about their actions. Bean and Smith were acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights, but the jury found Haley guilty. The officers pulled Nichols over on Jan. 7, 2023, for a traffic stop that spiraled into violence. Nichols ran on foot after being pepper-sprayed and threatened with a stun gun. Graphic body camera footage and a police neighborhood surveillance cameracaptured officersthen either restraining, kicking, punching or striking him with a baton as they took him into custody. He eventually went intocardiac arrest at the scene, according to a responding paramedic and medical records. He died at a hospital three days later. An autopsy attributed his death toblunt force trauma to the head. Throughout the trial, the sequestered juryfrom the Chattanooga, Tenn., areawatched video footage of the arrest multiple times from multiple angles. Prosecutors said the men on trial either used or witnessed excessive force and failed to stop it. Officers also didn't alert medical responders, the prosecution said, that Nichols had been struck in the head. Over about two and a half days, prosecutors moved quickly, calling only five witnesses, including Mills, a medical examiner and Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells. Delivering her closing arguments Monday, Assistant District Attorney Melanie Headley encouraged jurors to listen closely to the videos. She said that as Nichols struggles with his injuries before being cuffed, he moans for help. \"Who is supposed to help him? Those guys. They've got a duty — a duty to help him — and they don't,\" she said. \"No witness told you Tyre punched, Tyre kicked, Tyre spit. He didn't cuss. He didn't … do any of those things.\" Headley also emphasized the law of criminal responsibility for the jurors, which they could use to convict the officers of second-degree murder using proof that a \"defendant's guilt is based on the conduct of another person.\" \"They're all out there,\" she said. \"They're all doing it together.\" Defense attorneys for the three former officers pushed back and said that although Nichols' death was a tragedy, he posed an unknown risk to officers because he fled the stop before he was searched. Each defendant called his own use-of-force experts who testified that the individuals used their police training to escalate force against Nichols to handcuff him when they say he resisted. The defense also sought to blame Nichols' death on Martin, who is shown on video repeatedly kicking and punching Nichols in the head. Attorneys for Smith and Bean dispute whether they were unable to see or stop Martin's conduct due to the heavy use of pepper spray and the chaos of the arrest. \"First of all, they didn't see it, and second of all, they could not let go of this suspect,\" Martin Zummach, who represents Smith, said. \"This is crazy to evaluate this case on slow-motion video in a 70-degree courtroom versus out there on a dark street.\" Haley arrived at the arrest scene last and kicked Nichols, which his attorney says was to the arm and necessary to help handcuff him. \"This case is a case that started with officers doing a legal investigation, having probable cause to stop a motorist, having probable cause to put him in handcuffs and search him, and then everything falling apart from there when Mr. Nichols would not cooperate,\" Stephen Leffler said. For the first time, the defense introduced evidence of items that investigators found in Nichols' car, including a small amount of a hallucinogenic drug. The defense also said there were credit and debit cards not in Nichols' name that the defense alleges were stolen. The prosecution said that officers did not know about the contents at the time of the arrest and that the contents were irrelevant to the officers' conduct. Nichols ran from the traffic stop, the prosecution said, because of the officers' aggressive tactics, which included pulling him from his car and shouting combative threats and commands. \"You know who's not on trial this week? Tyre Nichols,\" Headley said. \"He's the victim in this case.\" In the wake of his death, Nichols' parents have becomevocal advocates for police reform. His mother issuing the city of Memphis for $550 million. The case is slated to go to trial next year. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "By Andee Tagle , Malaka Gharib \"You do not have to spend hundreds of dollars to be prepared,\" says Alyssa Provencio, an emergency management expert. Dig around your junk drawer for batteries and candles. Buy used gear like a headlamp. And save on nonperishable food by buying in bulk.Olivia Fields for NPRhide caption Preparing an emergency go bag can be overwhelming. It can be hard to know exactly what to pack. Buying food and supplies or opting for a premade survival kit can be expensive. And the task of gathering dozens of random items can feel like a big to-do. It's no wonder that only about half of Americans say they've assembled or updated their stash of emergency supplies, according to a2023 surveyconducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to be prepared. To make the process easier and cheaper, \"build out your kit a little at a time, buy used supplies and start with what you already have,\" saysAlyssa Provencio, a professor at the University of Central Oklahoma who researches emergency and disaster management. \"You do not have to spend hundreds of dollars to be prepared.\" Between theAmerican Red CrossandReady.gov, a lot of go bag checklists are out there with helpful ideas about what to pack. If you're concerned about the cost and effort to gather the recommended items, remember that \"something is better than nothing,\" Provencio says. Provencio andJonathan Sury, an associate at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia Climate School, share a list of items to prioritize, along with tips on how to make packing effortless and budget friendly. 🎒A good bag.It should be sturdy enough to hold your food and emergency supplies, as well as light enough to carry with you in case you have to evacuate on foot, Provencio says. Bonus points if the bag has wheels and straps for easy transport, Sury says. 💧At least a gallon of water.You should ideally pack a gallon of water per person a day for three days, but you may find that three jugs of water will make a bag too heavy. Pack at least 1 gallon of water, Sury says, or as much as you can carry, Provencio says. 🍫Three days of food.Choose lightweight, calorie-dense foods, like granola bars, peanut butter and tuna in pouches, Provencio says. 💉Items vital to your personal situation.For some people, that might mean lifesaving prescription medicines, a cane for walking or a favorite toy to comfort your little one. 🩹 Basic first-aid equipment.Provencio says this might include different sizes of bandages, gauze, alcohol, pain relievers and antiseptic wipes. If you have room to spare and the budget, stock your kit with more itemssuggested by the American Red Cross. 📜Important documents.These include photocopies of insurance paperwork, your birth certificate and the deed to your house. Put them in a zip-close bag to protect them from water damage. You could also save digital copies on a flash drive or the cloud too, Provencio says. 🔪 Emergency supplies.As you look through different go bag checklists, you'll see a wide range of supplies like work gloves or plastic sheeting. At the very least, Provencio says, your bag should contain the following items: a multi-tool or knife; paracord or rope for, say, pitching a tent; duct tape for making repairs; a flashlight or headlamp with extra batteries; and something with which to start a fire. Sury says it's also a good idea to pack an emergency blanket. 🪥 Personal hygiene supplies.If you had to live off the land for a few days, what would you need? Provencio suggests wet wipes, a toothbrush, toothpaste and sanitary products. 📲 A power bankwith which to charge your phone so you can make emergency calls. Don't forget to keep it charged, Sury says. 💵 Some cash.Don't assume you'll be able to use your credit cards or get cash from an ATM in an emergency, Provencio says. You should have enough money to buy a full tank of gas and a day's worth of food, Sury says. \"For those low on resources, it's always tough to set aside some cash, but a little here and there will add up.\" \"Once you have your bag together, all you need to do is maintain it and make sure it's in good condition a couple times a year,\" Sury says. Swap out the expired food and replenish any bandages you may have swiped from the first-aid kit. Don't forget to create a basic emergency plan. \"Knowing your evacuation routes, identifying a meeting place for your family and writing down key phone numbers costs nothing but can make a huge difference,\" Provencio says. \"Even simply being mentally prepared and thinking through [disaster] scenarios can help you act more quickly and confidently under stress.\" The podcast episode was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

    "title": "NASA scrambles to cut ISS activity due to budget issues",
    "article_text": "\"The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research.\" NASA is considering scaling back its activities on the International Space Station, according to multiple sources. The changes, which are being considered primarily due to shortfalls in the space station budget, include: The changes align with a desire that was reflected in the Trump administration's \"skinny budget\" proposal for NASA, released last Friday, which seeks to have the US space agency reduce its activities on the ISS. \"The Budget reduces the space station’s crew size and onboard research, preparing for a safe decommissioning of the station by 2030 and replacement by commercial space stations,\" stated thebudget request for fiscal year 2026. \"Crew and cargo flights to the station would be significantly reduced. The station’s reduced research capacity would be focused on efforts critical to the Moon and Mars exploration programs.\" The president's budget proposal estimates this would save $508 million from a budget of about $3 billion annually to support the ISS. However, Ars understands that the changes contemplated above were being implemented before the president's budget was released. Some of the changes contemplated here are not completely unreasonable. By extending the standard crewed mission from six to eight months, NASA would only need to fly three crewed missions to the station on Crew Dragon every two years instead of four. This would save a considerable amount of money in transportation costs. Such a change would also match what Roscosmos plans to do with its Soyuz missions. Similarly, as a cost-saving measure and beginning with the Soyuz MS-27 mission launched last month, Russia has extended the duration of flights to eight months. The primary downside of extending missions for NASA is that fewer of its astronauts would get experience in orbit. Canceling thetracker layer upgradeto the spectrometer would also not be catastrophic. The addition of a silicon tracker layer on top of the detector would increase the amount of data from the $2 billion physics experiment over the next five years by a factor of three. However, the experiment has been in operation since 2011, so it has had ample time to collect information about dark matter and other fundamental physics in the universe. The real eye-catching proposal in NASA's options is reducing the crew size from four to three. Typically, Crew Dragon missions carry two NASA astronauts, one Roscosmos cosmonaut, and an international partner astronaut. Therefore, although it appears that NASA would only be cutting its crew size by 25 percent, in reality, it would be cutting the number of NASA astronauts on Crew Dragon missions by 50 percent. Overall, this would lead to an approximately one-third decline in science conducted by the space station. (This is because there are usually three NASA astronauts on station: two from Dragon and one on each Soyuz flight.) It's difficult to see how this would result in enormous cost savings. Yes, NASA would need to send marginally fewer cargo missions to keep fewer astronauts supplied. And there would be some reduction in training costs. But it seems kind of nuts to spend decades and more than $100 billion building an orbital laboratory, putting all of this effort into developing commercial vehicles to supply the station and enlarge its crew, establishing a rigorous training program to ensure maximum science is done and then to say,'Well, actually we don't want to use it.' NASA has not publicly announced the astronauts who will fly on Crew-12 next year, but according to sources, it has already assigned veteran astronaut Jessica Meir and newcomer Jack Hathaway, a former US Navy fighter pilot who joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021. If these changes go through, presumably one of these two would be removed from the mission. The cuts are by no means a certainty. There was some confusion on Wednesday because, although the cuts appear to align with the Trump administration's goals, they were not being considered at the request of Trump space officials or in response to the budget release. Rather, they were made at the programmatic level. This is because of a shortfall in the space station budget. According to one source, this is because the program used funding earmarked for other activities to begin funding a deorbit vehicle that would manage the safe disposal of the ISS at the end of 2030. Because of this, cuts are needed in space station operations. None of these decisions are final, and may reflect the fact that NASA at present is operating under an acting administrator. The decision to fly fewer than a full complement of astronauts is not consistent, for example, with the goals of the Trump White House nominee to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman. He spoke in favor of \"maximizing\" science on the space station during his confirmation hearing last month. Insubsequent answersto written questions, Isaacman reaffirmed this position. \"My priority would be to maximize the remaining value of the ISS before it is decommissioned,\" Isaacman wrote. \"We must prioritize the highest-potential science and research that can be conducted on the station—and do everything possible to 'crack the code' on an on orbit economy.\" Congress has been broadly supportive of the space station, which is slated to fly through 2030 before being decommissioned. A final vote on the floor of the US Senate to confirm Isaacman could come within the next week or two. The story has been updated to reflect additional reporting.

    "title": "WhatsApp provides no cryptographic management for group messages",
    "article_text": "The weakness creates the possibility of an insider or hacker adding rogue members. The world has been abuzz for weeks now about the inclusion of a journalist in a group message of senior White House officials discussing plans for a military strike. In that case, the breach was the result of then-National Security Advisor Mike Waltz accidentally adding The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the group chat and no one else in the chat noticing. But what if someone controlling or hacking a messenger platform could do the same thing? When it comes to WhatsApp—the Meta-owned messenger that’s frequently touted for offering end-to-end encryption—it turns out you can. A team of researchers made the finding in arecently releasedformal analysis of WhatsApp group messaging. They reverse-engineered the app, described the formal cryptographic protocols, and provided theorems establishing the security guarantees that WhatsApp provides. Overall, they gave the messenger a clean bill of health, finding that it works securely and as described by WhatsApp. They did, however, discover a largely overlooked behavior that should give some group messaging users pause: Like other messengers billed as secure—with the notable exception of Signal—WhatsApp doesn’t provide any sort of cryptographic means for group management. “This means that it is possible for the WhatsApp server to add new members to a group,” Martin R. Albrecht, a researcher at King's College in London, wrote in an email. “A correct client—like the official clients—willdisplaythis change but will notpreventit. Thus, any group chat that does not verify who has been added to the chat can potentially have their messages read.” The chance of someone exploiting this weakness to access a WhatsApp group for soccer parents is likely nil. A nation-state operative, on the other hand, trying to crash a group of government officials discussing sensitive national security issues is well within the realms of possibility. In such a case, a WhatsApp admin with sufficient system privileges could add as many users to an existing group as desired. So could an attacker who managed to hack the WhatsApp infrastructure. With many groups numbering in the dozens or even hundreds of members, the notification might not be easy to notice. The flow of adding new members to a WhatsApp group message is: With no cryptographic signatures verifying an existing member wants to add a new member, additions can be made by anyone with the ability to control the server or messages that flow into it. Using thecommon fictional scenariofor illustrating end-to-end encryption, this lack of cryptographic assurance leaves open the possibility that Malory can join a group and gain access to the human-readable messages exchanged there. WhatsApp isn’t the only messenger lacking cryptographic assurances for new group members. In 2022, a team that included some of the same researchers that analyzed WhatsAppfoundthat Matrix—an open source and proprietary platform for chat and collaboration clients and servers—also provided no cryptographic means for ensuring only authorized members join a group. The Telegram messenger, meanwhile, offers no end-to-end encryption for group messages, making the app among the weakest for ensuring the confidentiality of group messages. In contrast, the open sourceSignal messengerprovides a cryptographic assurance that only an existing group member designated as the group admin can add new members. In an email, researcher Benjamin Dowling, also of King’s College, explained: Signal implements “cryptographic group management.” Roughly this means that the administrator of a group, a user, signs a message along the lines of “Alice, Bob and Charley are in this group” to everyone else. Then, everybody else in the group makes their decision on who to encrypt to and who to accept messages from based on these cryptographically signed messages, [meaning] who to accept as a group member. The system used by Signal is a bit different [than WhatsApp], since [Signal] makes additional efforts to avoid revealing the group membership to the server, but the core principles remain the same. On a high-level, in Signal, groups are associated with group membership lists that are stored on the Signal server. An administrator of the group generates a GroupMasterKey that is used to make changes to this group membership list. In particular, the GroupMasterKey is sent to other group members via Signal, and so is unknown to the server. Thus, whenever an administrator wants to make a change to the group (for instance, invite another user), they need to create an updated membership list (authenticated with the GroupMasterKey) telling other users of the group who to add. Existing users are notified of the change and update their group list, and perform the appropriate cryptographic operations with the new member so the existing member can begin sending messages to the new members as part of the group. Most messaging apps, including Signal, don’t certify the identity of their users. That means there’s no way Signal can verify that the person using an account named Alice does, in fact, belong to Alice. It’s fully possible that Malory could create an account and name it Alice. (As an aside, and in sharp contrast to Signal, the account members that belong to a given WhatsApp group are visible to insiders, hackers, and to anyone with a valid subpoena.) Signal does, however, offer a feature known assafety numbers. It makes it easy for a user to verify the security of messages or calls with specific contacts. When two users verify out-of-band—meaning using a known valid email address or cell phone number of the other—that Signal is displaying the same safety number on both their devices, they can be assured that the person claiming to be Alice is, in fact, Alice. Waltz, the former National Security Advisor, failed to follow this crucial step when adding The Atlantic editor-in-chief to a Signal group. That failure resulted in sensitive military plans being sent to someone unauthorized to receive them. No matter what app three or more people use for group messages, it’s crucial that they know the identity behind all fellow group member names. The hurdles for causing the WhatsApp server to add a user to an existing group—either by a malicious insider or someone hacking WhatsApp infrastructure—are high enough that the weakness is likely to be exploited only in extraordinary cases. The fact that the weakness exists at all is a good reason for groups trading truly sensitive messages to steer clear of the app. The researchers previously sent their findings to WhatsApp. In a statement, WhatsApp said: \"We’ve reviewed the researchers’ submission and appreciate their work. We’ve designed WhatsApp to bring simple, reliable and private messaging at-scale to billions of people. For all groups, you are notified when someone new joins, and you can also enable security notifications that prominently let you know of any security code changes with who you’re chatting with. We’re always adding new layers of protection and we’ll keep doing so.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Genetic-engineered bacteria break down industrial contaminants",
    "article_text": "Five clusters of genes from different organisms put into a single bacterial strain. Over the last century or more, humanity has been developing an ever-growing list of chemicals that have never been seen by Earth's creatures. Many of these chemicals end up being toxic contaminants that we'd love to get rid of, but we struggle to purify them from the environment or break them down once we do. And microbes haven't had much chance to evolve the ability to break them down for us. Over the last few years, however, we've found a growing number of cases where bacteria have evolved the ability to break down industrial contaminants and plastics. Unfortunately, these bacteria are all different species, target different individual contaminants, and thrive in different environments. But now, researchers have developed a new way to take the genes from all these species and place them in a single bacterial strain that can decontaminate complex waste mixtures. The inspiration for this work was the fact that a lot of industrial contamination contains a mixture of toxic organic molecules, but is found in brackish or salty water. So, the research team, based in Shenzhen, China, started by simply testing a number of lab strains to determine the ability to survive these conditions. The one that seemed to do the best is calledVibrio natriegens. These bacteria were discovered in a salt marsh, and their primary claim to fame is an impressive growth rate, with a population being able to double about every 10 minutes. Unfortunately,Vibrio natriegensdoesn't have the sophisticated molecular tools that are available in a species likeE. coli. So, the researchers spent some time makingVibrio natriegensa bit more amenable to manipulations, making it more capable of taking up DNA and incorporating it into a specific location in the genome. Once that was done, the researchers started looking through the genomes of species that have been identified as breaking down industrial contaminants. The breakdown of complex molecules typically involves more than one enzyme, and the genes for these enzymes tend to end up clustered together, so that they can be produced as a single, large RNA that encodes all the proteins needed. This simplifies regulating their production, making it easy to ensure the bacteria only make the proteins if the molecule they break down is actually present. In this case, the clusters ranged from just three genes all the way up to 11. Once nine of these gene clusters were identified, the DNA that would encode them was ordered and assembled into a single DNA molecule in yeast. The researchers took some time while ordering this DNA to better optimize the genes to be active and produce proteins inVibrio natriegens, as opposed to whatever species the genes were normally used by. From yeast, each of these individual gene clusters was inserted intoVibrio natriegens, creating different strains that could digest one of the following: benzene, toluene, phenol, naphthalene, biphenyl, DBF29, and dibenzothiophene (DBT). (Some of the nine clusters target the same contaminant.) Each of these bacterial strains was then put in a solution with the chemical they were engineered to digest. Five of the nine worked, giving researchers strains that could digest biphenyl, phenol, napthalene, DBF, and toluene. From there, the researchers developed a system that would enable them to iteratively insert a new gene cluster at the tail end of a previously inserted gene cluster. This allowed them to build up a cluster of clusters, eventually including all five of the ones that had shown activity in the earlier tests. Given two days, this single strain could remove about a quarter of the phenol, a third of the biphenyl, 30 percent of the DBF, all of the naphthalene, and nearly all of the toluene. All those contaminants came from a mixture created by the researchers specifically for the test. To get a better sense of its capabilities, the team got hold of two wastewater mixtures that also included some salt in the water. Here, the engineeredVibrio natriegensstrain proved highly effective, eliminating over 95 percent of most chemicals, and about 80 percent of phenol. The strain also worked against contaminated soil. That said, this shouldn't be seen as the solution to contamination with organic chemicals. For starters, there were a number of chemical targets that weren't digested—not to mention a huge range of chemicals that weren't tested. In addition,Vibrio natriegensdoesn't grow especially well when salt isn't present, so it can't just be unleashed on all of our contamination. But perhaps the biggest problem is that, unlike the bacteria that the gene clusters originated in,Vibrio natriegenshas no way of using the broken-down products of these reactions. Other bacteria evolved these gene clusters because the clusters allowed them to incorporate the breakdown products as if they were food. In contrast,Vibrio natriegenslacks the enzymes that enable this sort of incorporation; instead, these chemical products just end up sitting around when the bacteria are done digesting. That means that, while this engineered strain gets rid of dangerous chemicals, it will leave a variety of less dangerous chemical contaminants. And, since theVibrio natriegenscan't use this material as food, there's no evolutionary selection going on for the activity of these engineered gene clusters. That means that there's no pressure to even keep the gene clusters around (though the researchers confirmed they weren't lost during these experiments). Also, no pressure that could improve their activity further. So, in the long term, it might be best to start plugging in to the pathways that break down contaminants into the cell's basic metabolism. Despite these limitations, though, the work is a clear demonstration of the potential of bacteria to help us clean up some of the messes we're making. Nature, 2025.

    "article_text": "Matter is taking care of a few common smart home headaches. There is no product category that better embodies theXKCD take on standardsthan smart home. With an ocean of connectivity options and incompatible standards, taming this mess has been challenging, butMattercould finally have a shot at making things a little less frustrating. The latest version of the standard has launched, offering multiple ways to streamline the usually aggravating setup process. The first public release of Matter was in late 2022, but compatible systems didn't get support until the following year. Now, there are Matter-certified devices like smart bulbs and sensors that will talk to Apple, Google, Amazon, and other smart home platforms.Matter 1.4.1includes support for multi-device QR codes, NFC connection, and integrated terms and conditions—all of these have the potential to eliminate some very real smart home headaches. It's common for retailers to offer multi-packs of devices like light bulbs or smart plugs. That can save you some money, but setting up all those devices is tedious. With Matter 1.4.1, it might be much easier thanks to multi-device QR codes. Manufacturers can now include a QR code in the package that will pair all the included devices with your smart home system when scanned. QR codes will still appear on individual devices for pairing, but it might not always be a QR code going forward. The new Matter also gives manufacturers the option of embedding NFC tags inside smart home gadgets. So all you have to do to add them to your system is tap your phone. That will be nice if you need to pair a device after it's been installed somewhere that obscures the visible code. The last change revamps how users interact with a device's terms and conditions, but don't underestimate this. The new \"Enhanced Setup Flow\" has the option to display the OEM's terms and conditions, which you probably don't care about. Still, for legal reasons, every company shoves that document in your face. By integrating that with Matter setup, it saves you from being kicked to another app to review the terms, which can screw up the pairing process. The value proposition of many smart home devices has always been suspect. It's really not that difficult to use a light switch or a regular deadbolt. The smart alternatives do offer useful functionality, but they cost more, and managing devices is a pain. More than a few speed bumps and you may miss your dumb home. With these changes to onboarding, Matter is one step closer to eliminating those pain points. However, companies have to start producing new devices with Matter 1.4.1 before you can enjoy the benefits. The good news is that, after someearly hesitation, Matter support is picking up steam.

    "title": "We have reached the “severed fingers and abductions” stage of the crypto revolution",
    "article_text": "Wave of crypto kidnappings hits Europe. Frenchgendarmeshave been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, andHODL!shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline. This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14tharrondissementon May 1 by men in ski masks. The 14th is a pleasant place—I highly recommend a visit to the catacombs in Place Denfert-Rochereau—and not usually the site of snatch-and-grab operations. The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son. According toLe Monde, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared \"other mutilations\" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s. (According tothe BBC, French police used \"phone signals\" to locate the house.) Sounds crazy, but this was the second such incident this year. In January, crypto maven David Balland was also abducted along with his partner on January 21. Balland was taken to a house, where he also had a finger cut off. According toThe Guardian,\"Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner, who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day.\" And a few weeks before that, attackers went to the home of someone whose son was a \"crypto-influencer based in Dubai.\" At the father's home, the kidnappers \"tied up [the father's] wife and daughter and forced him into a car. The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol.\" It's not just France, either. Early this year, three British menkidnapped another British manwhile all of them were in Spain; the kidnappers demanded 30,000 euros in crypto \"or be tortured and killed.\" The kidnapped man escaped by jumping off a balcony 30 feet high, breaking both ankles. Or there's the Belgian man who posted online that \"his crypto wallet was now worth €1.6 million.\" His wife was thevictim of an attempted abductionwithin weeks. Similar things are happening in the US, too. I reported last year on a gang based out of Florida that had beenstaging home invasions of people perceived to own lots of crypto. One of their hits took place in Durham, North Carolina. Here's a snippet: The next morning at 7:30 am, St. Felix and Castro rolled up to the Wells Street home once more. Instead of surveilling it from down the block, they knocked on the door. The husband answered. The men told him some story involving necessary pipe inspections. They wandered around the home for a few minutes, then knocked on the front door again. But this time, when the wife answered, St. Felix and Castro were wearing ski masks and sunglasses—and they had handguns. They pushed their way inside. The woman screamed, and her husband came in from the kitchen to see them all fighting. The intruders punched the husband in the face and zip-tied the hands and feet of both homeowners. Castro dragged the wife by her legs down the hallway and into the bathroom. He stood guard over her, wielding his distinctive pink revolver. In the meantime, St. Felix had marched the husband at gunpoint into a loft office at the back of the home. There, the threats came quickly—St. Felix would cut off the man's toes, he said, or his genitals. He would shoot him. He would rape his wife. The only way out was to cooperate, and that meant helping St. Felix log in to the man's Coinbase account. Crypto is perceived as being anonymous and hard to trace—though this is not always true—and the huge price swings around bitcoin in recent years have minted plenty of new millionaires, many of whom are happy enough to flaunt their newfound wealth online.

    "title": "Cue: Apple will add AI search in mobile Safari, challenging Google",
    "article_text": "“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was none of the others were valid choices.\" Apple executive Eddie Cue said that Apple is \"actively looking at\" shifting the focus of mobile Safari's search experience to AI search engines, potentially challenging Google's longstanding search dominance and the two companies' lucrative default search engine deal. The statements were made while Cue testified for the US Department of Justice in the Alphabet/Google antitrust trial, as first reported inBloomberg. Cue noted that searches in Safari fell for the first time ever last year, and attributed the shift to users increasingly using large language model-based solutions to perform their searches. \"Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,\" Cue said of the deal Apple had with Google, which is a key component in the DOJ's case against Alphabet. He added: \"I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.\" Here he was alluding to companies like Perplexity, which seek to offer an alternative to semantic search engines with a chat-like approach—as well as others like OpenAI. Cue said Apple has had talks with Perplexity already. Speaking of AI-based search engines in general, he said \"we will add them to the list\"—referring to the default search engine selector in Safari settings. That said, \"they probably won’t be the default\" because they still need to improve, particularly when it comes to indexing. The enormous amount of money Google pays Apple (estimated at $20 billion per year) to remain the default may be a factor as well. Both Google and Apple shares dropped in the market after Cue's comments as investors fear that this may be the first sign that the deal will not last. Apple currently allows users to pick a default search engine from a list in the Settings app on their phones. Current choices include Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia, with Google as the default. Apple also includes an AI chatbot extension on the latest version of iOS, which currently uses just OpenAI's ChatGPT. The iPhone maker plans to give users the option to pick alternatives like Google's Gemini later. But Cue's testimony revolved around the choice of which search engine will be used when the user types a query into Safari's address bar. AI search tools have significant pros and cons versus semantic search engines. On the plus side, new deep research and agentic features allow them to respond to a natural language query (like \"I saw a movie that started with a teen lip-syncing in her bedroom, and it had a girl dressed as Thor stuck on a skyscraper\") with a robust approach involving multiple searches before delivering a result, which is usually accurate or at least helpful. On the other hand, they may sometimes hallucinate incorrect answers when prompted in areas that are knowledge and training blind spots, as is infamously the situation with Google's (admittedly much less sophisticated) AI search summaries.

    "title": "Starlink: Here’s a free satellite dish—if you pay $120 a month instead of $90",
    "article_text": "Accepting free dish blocks $90 monthly price available in excess-capacity areas. Starlink last weekannounceda new deal for its standard hardware kit, giving the satellite dish and Wi-Fi router for free to customers who sign up for a 12-month commitment. The deal is reminiscent of the hardware rental agreements long used by cable companies, but Starlink's offer has generated a bit of excitement. Some analystssuggestedthat the free kits are a reason for the federal government's $42 billion broadband deployment fund tosend grantsto Starlink instead of to fiber-to-the-home providers, or that the government shouldbuy Starlink kits at the regular price of $349 eachso that Elon Musk's company doesn't have to eat the cost. You may not be surprised to learn that the free hardware kit isn't really free. But much of the discussion around the offer has ignored the fine details that could make a reasonable Starlink buyer decide to reject the deal. Similarly, policymakers deciding which ISPs should get government money might be wise to remember that fiber provides superior and more future-proof Internet service and that Starlink's offers to customers could change at any time. Starlink's free-dish offer isn't available nationwide, and in many of the places where it is available, you'll be able to pay a bit less overall by buying the kit at the full price of $349. Customers in these areas who are certain they will use Starlink for at least 12 months may want the free kit in order to pay for it over a year instead of all at once, but anyone enticed by the offer should compare their options before diving in. Where you live is a major determining factor in whether it will be worth it. In some areas, the offer with a free kit will be significantly cheaper over the first year. In other areas it will be slightly cheaper during the first year to pay the up-front price for the kit, and this might also result in a better monthly price after the first year. Starlink is offering the free kit in parts of the US and other countries; you can see where it's availablehere. The limited availability isn't surprising since Starlink already charges different rates in different areas depending on network availability. In early 2023, Starlink started charging $120 a month for service in areas with limited capacity and $90 a month in areas with excess capacity. Starlink also imposes a \"congestion charge\" on new users in high-demand areas. You can see the price at your home by going through theStarlink ordering page. First, we'll look at a scenario in which the $90 monthly price is available for those who buy the kit at full price. Looking at my address in Massachusetts this week, I saw two options. One option is to pay $349 up front for the Starlink Standard Kit, plus $21.81 in tax, and buy service for $90 a month with no time commitment. The other option is to get the Starlink Standard Kit for free, plus the same $21.81 tax, and pay $120 a month while committing to at least 12 months of service. Canceling before the year is over can result in a $325 fee, but there's a 30-day trial during which you can get a refund and not pay that fee. With a free kit, this works out to $1,440 over 12 months, excluding the tax. Purchasing the kit for $349 and paying $90 a month adds up to $1,429 in the first 12 months. It's a tiny bit more expensive to get the free kit, but the deal lets you spread the cost out evenly over the first year and possibly let you earn some extra interest if you invest the $349 initial savings. But a buyer's decision still isn't that clear-cut because there's an unanswered question about what you'll pay in year two. The question is what the monthly service price will be after the first 12 months. Do people who choose the \"free\" kit have to keep paying $120 a month in the second year and beyond while those who bought the kit for $349 keep paying $90 a month? I contacted Starlink support to ask those specific questions about the price after 12 months. I received a vague response that did not answer my questions and a link to anFAQthat I had already read. I also contacted SpaceX's media relations team with the same questions yesterday and received no response. If I were buying Starlink service, I would assume that the $120 price doesn't automatically drop to $90 after the 12-month commitment and that I'd have to contact SpaceX at that time and hope to get a $30 price cut. Operating under that assumption, I'd feel more comfortable buying the kit at full price and paying $90 a month from the beginning. Starlink could raise that price at any time—either by declaring the area to have limited capacity or simply by changing the standard rates. But taking the $90 price from the beginning strikes me as more likely to work out in my favor in the long run. This is just guesswork, and perhaps the process of changing plans would be as easy as Starlinkdescribes on its website. However, in the absence of a specific answer from Starlink about this scenario, I would be hesitant to start out with the $120 price in any area where the $90 price is available. Complicating matters is that in some areas, Starlink offers a Residential Lite plan that costs less than the standard plan and has slower speeds. Starlinkexplainsthat Residential Lite is \"deprioritized compared to Residential service during peak hours,\" and that \"speeds should range from 50 - 100 Mbps (as compared to 150 - 250 Mbps for the Residential service plan.\" The free kit wasn't available with this tier of service when I tested the ordering site this week. There are 15 US states in which Residential Liteis offered: Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Hawaii. This territory generally overlaps with the larger territory in which the free Starlink kitis available. Some states, such as California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts, have access to the free kit offer but not the Residential Lite plan. When attempting to order service in one of the overlap areas where both are available, an address in Maine, I was given three options. One option was to get the hardware for free and pay $120 a month with a 12-month commitment. Another option was to pay $349 for the kit and get the standard residential plan for the same $120 monthly price, but with no minimum term commitment. The third option was to pay $349 for the kit and get the worse Residential Lite plan for $80 a month, with no commitment. The $90 price for full-speed service wasn't available. If you don't mind the Lite plan's slower speeds and deprioritization during peak hours, it's cheaper during the first year to buy the kit at full price and pay $80 a month ($1,309 compared to $1,440). If you want to avoid the lite plan and you live in a place where the $90 full-speed plan isn't available, it's significantly cheaper to get the free kit because you'd have to pay $120 either way. You presumably would be able to switch to the $80 lite plan after the 12-month commitment, assuming Starlink still offers it a year from now. In summary, if you were thinking about getting Starlink already, check out the free-kit offer and see if it makes sense for you. Just don't hit the buy button immediately without examining the other options. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "VMware perpetual license holders receive cease-and-desist letters from Broadcom",
    "article_text": "Broadcom says it may audit VMware users. Broadcom has been sending cease-and-desist letters to owners of VMware perpetual licenses with expired support contracts, Ars Technica has confirmed. Following its November 2023 acquisition of VMware,Broadcom ended VMware perpetual license sales. Users with perpetual licenses can still use the software they bought, but they are unable to renew support servicesunless they had a pre-existing contractenabling themto do so. The controversial move aims to push VMware users to buy subscriptions to VMware products bundled such that associated costs have increased by300 percentor, in some cases,more. Some customers have opted to continue using VMware unsupported, often as theyresearch alternatives, such as VMware rivals or devirtualization. Over the past weeks, some users running VMware unsupported havereportedreceiving cease-and-desist letters from Broadcom informing them that their contract with VMware and, thus, their right to receive support services, has expired. The letter [PDF], reviewed by Ars Technica and signed by Broadcom managing director Michael Brown, tells users that they are to stop using any maintenance releases/updates, minor releases, major releases/upgrades extensions, enhancements, patches, bug fixes, or security patches, save for zero-day security patches, issued since their support contract ended. The letter tells users that the implementation of any such updates “past the Expiration Date must be immediately removed/deinstalled,\" adding: Any such use of Support past the Expiration Date constitutes a material breach of the Agreement with VMware and an infringement of VMware’s intellectual property rights, potentially resulting in claims for enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees. Some customers ofMembers IT Group, a managed services provider (MSP) in Canada, have received this letter, despite not receiving VMware updates since their support contracts expired, CTO Dean Colpitts told Ars. One customer, he said, received a letter six days after their support contract expired. Similarly, users online havereportedreceiving cease-and-desist letters even though they haven't issued updates since losing VMware support. One user on Spiceworks’ community forumreportedreceiving such a letter even though they migrated off of VMware and to Proxmox. Some users who reported receiving a letter from Broadcom said they ended up getting legal teams involved. Ars has also seen confusion online, with some people thinking that the letter means Broadcom perceives that they've broken their agreement with VMware. However, it seems that Broadcom is sending these letters to companies soon after their support contracts have expired, regardless of whether they continue to use (or not use) VMware. Broadcom didn't respond to a request for comment. The cease-and-desist letters also tell recipients that they could be subject to auditing. Failure to comply with [post-expiration reporting] requirements may result in a breach of the Agreement by Customer[,] and VMware may exercise its right to audit Customer as well as any other available contractual or legal remedy. In response, Colpitts told Ars: \"The one thing that does kind of piss me off is the fact that Broadcom retains the right to still perform audits whenever they choose. But ... that's utter BS anyways. If a customer wanted to hide stuff, it could easily be done (disclaimer: I have never done this, but since it's all self-reporting in clear text with no security checksums or anything to detect tampering, it would be easy to do).\" Since Broadcom ended VMware's perpetual licenses and increased pricing, numerous users and channel partners, especially small-to-medium-sized companies, have had to reduce or end business with VMware. Most of Members IT Group’s VMware customer base is now running VMware unsupported. The MSP's biggest concern there is ensuring that staff don't accidentally apply patches to customers, Colpitts noted. In recent months, Broadcom has sought to rein in potential use of VMware products that it considers unwarranted. For example, it engaged in a since-resolvedlegal battle with AT&Tover the telecom’s right to renew support services and has accusedSiemens of pirating VMware software. Broadcom’s changes to how VMware is distributed have resulted in various firms ditching VMware and doubting Broadcom's care for customers. WhileBroadcom’s financial successsince acquiring VMware suggests that its business plan will remain steadfast, sending cease-and-desist letters to VMware users risks further harming its reputation with current and former customers.

    "title": "Ars Technica’s gift guide for Mother’s Day: Give mom some cool things",
    "article_text": "Wondering what to get the mom who has everything? We've got some ideas! Greetings, Arsians, and welcome to Mother's Day, which I am told is once again happening this weekend in the US! Do you, much like the rest of humanity, have a mother? Well, if you do, then this is the time of year when you're supposed to buy her something to make up for all the pain and suffering she went through in order to bring you into this world! Mom raised you, and while what your mother probably wants more than anything is for you to pick up the phone andtalk,you could do a lot worse than throwing some money at the problem and buying your mother something from the list we've assembled below! Whether the mom in your life operates primarily as an \"innie\" or an \"outie,\" if she's a fan of the Apple TV+ showSeverance, she may appreciatethis ceramic coffee mug inspired by the series. The mug features the iconic phrase \"The Work is Both Mysterious and Important\" in blue text that mirrors Lumon Industries' sterile corporate aesthetic. It's an ideal conversation starter for fans enjoying the show's second season after the painfully long production delay. Best of all, it's perfect for morning coffee before Mom begins her own mysterious and important work. The same company also offers a \"Woe's Hollow\" mug if you'd like an alternative design. Celebrate the Sisyphean every-day-is-the-same blessing of motherhood with confidence as these mugs are dishwasher and microwave safe, and they are available in both 11oz and 15oz sizes. From awkward baby pictures, to wedding memories and last year’s holidays, your mother likely has more photos than she knows what to do with.Frameo digital picture framesgive your mom somewhere to show off those countless photos without embarrassing, unexpected tags on Facebook. The digital frame shows uploaded pictures like a slideshow. With the iOS or Android app, it’s easy to upload photos from their phone to the frame. Mom hates the cloud and prefers PC storage? No proble—Frameo frames also support PC upload via USB. You can even help ensure the frame puts your best face forward: With the proper permissions, you can access the thing remotely and upload photos to your mom’s frame from afar. Other handy features include sleep mode and the ability to display the time or weather. There are various Frameo frames available depending on the size, resolution, and look your mom prefers.Hereis a popular 10.1-inch IPS one with 1280ˣ800 resolution and 32GB of storage. Smartphones haven't come with chargers for a few years now, which means most people like your mom are using one that's years old. And that old plug probably can't hit the increasingly lofty charging speeds of new phones. If mom has an old 18W plug, a new one could juice up her phone at double the speed or more. We like Anker's Nano II charger (on sale for $28) because it's compact and reaches an impressive 45W, which is fast enough to hit the max wattage for even high-end phones from Apple, Samsung, and Google. It supports USB-PD and PPS charging technologies, which means it can max out anything with a USB-C port to a limit of 45W. Let's face it: Moms need uninterrupted sleep. When relieved from kid or pet duty, or perhaps resting after a night shift, it's great to wipe out a sleep deficit thanks to some good earplugs.These silicone earplugsoffer 24dB noise reduction while avoiding the uncomfortable pressure of cheap foam plugs. The most frustrating thing about traditional earplugs is that there's a wide variety in \"ear hole\" sizes out there. To fix that, Loop includes four different tip sizes to ensure a proper fit in any ear canal. The silicone design works well for side-sleepers, and the rubber loop makes them easy to pull out and won't get lost in your ear canals. Amazon reviewers praise these earplugs highly for travel, focus work, and sensitive hearing situations, with many noting they're comfortable enough to forget you're wearing them. These courses do a few things at once. They give a bird-loving mum hours of engagement. They nicely supplement a complementary webcam-equipped bird feeder or binoculars. And they support an organization that advances bird education, research, and conservation. You can start withbeginner basics, pick a lane likeducksorowls, or pack in more with asavings bundle. They pair well with pointing mom to the freeMerlin Bird IDapp and trading sightings with her throughout the year. Hope to avoid dinner conversations about why you shouldn’t vaccinate your kids? Don’t want forwarded messages about how climate change is a hoax? Can’t endure intense lectures on the perils of germ theory? Know the symptoms of brainworms—and stay safe with Ars Technica. Brainworms are an active public safety threat in the US. They can infect people you know and love. Brainworms have already attacked ourcurrent HHS secretary; they could be coming for your mom next! Fortunately, there is a vaccine. Get the peace of mind that comes froman Ars Technica subscription. Provide your mom with a completely ad-free viewing experience and access to extra homepage stuff (like the ability to hide news categories she doesn’t like!). An Ars Technica subscription, if applied topically on a daily basis, should inoculate against dumb Facebook memes and other vectors for brainworm infection. Keep your mom away fromjade eggsand pseudoscience! An Ars subscription will show insteadhow measles is killing kids again, or how the administration’s attack on scienceis ending America’s worldwide leadership in research, or howNOAA is being stripped bareeven as the Atlantic hurricane season gets underway. Every single subscription helps support the work we do at Ars, and every one is appreciated. So help fight the brainworms andgive a subscription to your mother! Soon, she’ll be proudly posting memes in theArs OpenForum! These arethe strangest headphones we’ve ever liked. They’re made for people who want excellent environmental awareness and don’t want the weight of headphones or the discomfort of in-ear units. If those two things are high on your list, these deserve a look. If not, move on because they’re relatively expensive otherwise. When we first tried these, we expected muddy sound and paltry bass, but to our surprise, they sound extremely good–leaps and bounds beyond bone-conduction headphones that have become popular with some runners in recent years. And unless you crank these, or are sitting somewhere very quiet, people near you won’t hear your music. They are comfortable, too, despite being clamped on the outer ring of your ear. You can almost forget you’re wearing them, unless you’re one of the rare people for whom these are pure torture. All this said, beware: a recent firmware update improved the microphone, but it’s now only average, and we couldn’t recommend these for anyone who plans on doing a lot of calls with them on. As we said at the outset, these are designed for a particular use case; outside of that, there are better options. Your mom's TV probably has streaming apps built in, but they're terrible. A good streaming box can offer better audio and video options, as well as a smoother experience.Google’s TV Streamer 4Kfits the bill, with support for HDR10+ and the more rare Dolby Vision video, plus Atmos audio. There are other streaming boxes out there, but we think mom will appreciate Google's Android TV interface over the cluttered, clunky stuff you get from Roku or Amazon. Google’s streamer also connects to the Play Store for apps, which is much better than the alternatives. Part record player, part boombox, part Bluetooth speaker, all class. Victrola’s Empire 6-in-1 Wood Record Player could be the last speaker your musical mother ever needs. With the ability to play vinyl records (33 1/3, 45, or 78 RPM), CDs, cassettes, and FM radio (unfortunately, there’s no AM tuner), this speaker lets your mom enjoy all that physical media she has stacked in the house, while also allowing her to tune into live radio to hear the latest hits or about current events. If your mom doesn’t need all that, Victrola also makes record player-Bluetooth speaker combos that skip CD, cassette, and radio functionalityfor less money. Keeping mom in the 21st century, the Empire also lets you connect to its speaker via Bluetooth or a 3.5mm jack, so she can stream music from her favorite apps or play filesstored on her phone. With a vintage look available in multiple hues, the speaker makes for a classic living room piece that looks vintage without feeling overly dated or antiquated. This standis partly pitched at video creators, sure—but it’s also a boon to anyone who wants to reduce the pain of FaceTime calls with their parents. Set up the stand in their home, make the call, and your folks can sit, stand, wash dishes, wander about, or do anything besides hold a phone in the air or crouch over a table. It comes with a cable and charger, it requires no companion app, and it’s a gift to you, too—the person spending far less time looking up your parents’ noses. The thing about a bouquet of flowers is that it looks nice for a few days, maybe a week, and then it dies. Not so with a Lego Botanicals set, which will always look as good as it did the day you built it. (Speaking from experience, they’re also great conversation starters!) This 1,161-piece flower arrangement is one of the larger and pricier sets, but the good news is that the Botanicals series includes many sets at all kinds of prices. Sets likethis mini orchidorplum blossomrun around $24, or you could pick upa flower bouquetfor $48. Longtime Lego fans will also enjoy seeing how Lego has repurposed heads, hats, and other shapes from other sets to create plastic plants. In our estimation, Bose still sits atop the noise cancellation game. And that’s why you buy these:best in class noise cancellation. The first time I used Bose’s QC line was on a trip from Boston to London. A flight attendant offered me a pair for the flight, and the rest is history: they became my go-to for travel. Apple and Sony can’t touch this noise cancellation. It's not just bout noise cancellation though. The sound quality is excellent, even if we might give the Sony’s high-end WH-1000XM5 the nod on bass. We found the Bose QC Ultras to be warm and detailed, and certain types of music (hello, Radiohead) sounded amazing with their spatialized stereo option, dubbed Immersive Audio. Critically, we stumbled upon these as a gift for someone who found the AirPod Max too heavy (385g). At 252g, they’re nearly a third lighter. Bose primarily accomplished this using plastic rather than metal, but in our usage, we appreciated the lightness more than the looks. We last checked in with Oura when they releasedversion 3.0 of the Oura ring, and it did not impress us much. WithOura Ring 4.0, we’re ready to recommend this device to fitness fanatics with a few caveats. First, the good stuff. The Oura has slightly better battery performance, and we can go 6 days between charges. It’s more comfortable now, too, thanks to repositioning improved sensors. If you want a smart ring, this is the best one right now. But yes, caveats: fit is critical. If you want accurate steps and activities, you must get the tightest ring you can still easily remove. Order the sizing kits, or use the sizing its in the story. Do not rely on your traditional ring size. It might not fit! Most annoying, full use of the ring’s software requires a subscription, which is best purchased annually at $70. This makes the Oura quite a splurge, but if that special mom is looking for extra motivation to focus on fitness, wants to track her sleep, and doesn’t want a wrist-tracker or Apple Watch, we’d recommend this. Though no longer as budget-friendly as Apple’s old, discontinued iPhone SE, Apple’s new iPhone 16E still gives you a lot of value for your money (readour review here). It excels at all the things that most people use their phones for—it’s fast, it’s well-built, it has a great camera, and it will get years of software support from Apple. For anyone using an aging iPhone SE, or any iPhone that’s more than three or four years old, it will feel like an immense upgrade. It also ditches Apple’s Lightning port in favor of USB-C, so you can charge it with the same power brick you already use for your laptop/Nintendo Switch/Kindle/etc. Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post throughaffiliate\n    programs.

    "title": "Everything you ever wanted to know about four-wheel steering",
    "article_text": "With roots in early 20th-century trucks, 4WS is not widely understood. Like any big industry, the automotive business has several dumpsters filled with products and ideas that should have remained conceptual. From modern climate controls buried within successive infotainment menus that neither Lawrence of Arabia nor Columbo could find to the old and unlamented Chrysler TC by Maserati with its atrocious build quality and a terrible cylinder head (the Maserati part), the collective car circus has spawned no shortage of bad ideas. However, there are a few good ideas buried under the weight of poor execution, lousy technology, dreadful marketing, steep pricing, or just merely something being ahead of its time. Several of these morsels deserved a better launch and a second chance. One of them is four-wheel steering. The idea of steering a two-axle vehicle's front and rear wheels isn't new. Very early American 4x4 trucks from the dawn of the 20th century sported four-wheel-steering systems (4WS), including the Cotta Cottamobile, the American ¾-ton to 10-ton trucks, and Jeffery/Nash Quad Lorry 3-ton trucks. By the early 1980s, a more modern iteration of active 4WS systems was found as a feature on concept (show) cars. However, since that breed of machine rarely had to prove itself, these are more display pieces than working technology. Active 4WS systems do two physical things. First, they impart opposite-phase steering angles to the rear wheels from those applied to the fronts. When the fronts turn right, the rears turn left at a fraction of the front's steering angles. This effectively diminishes the vehicle's turning circle or radius, making it more maneuverable in tight spaces like parking lots. Credit:\n\n          \n          Honda Depending on the system's engineering, opposite-phase steering takes place only below a certain vehicle speed or with lots of steering lock applied (generally, more than three-quarters of a turn of the steering wheel or about 270 degrees of lock from center). It also never occurs above a trotting pace. Inducing opposite-phase steering above 30 or 40 mph could cause drastic instability at speed, creating a very rapid yaw moment that would likely cause an unrecoverable skid. The second action of active 4WS is same-phase steering angle input to the rear wheels. Turn the wheel right, and the rear wheels also turn slightly to the right. However, that rear angle is even shallower than the opposite-phase angles in the above scenario. This improves higher-speed stability, like when a driver changes lanes or corners rapidly through fun twisties or on a racetrack. Rear steering angles vary anywhere from 2.5 degrees to 10 degrees, depending on vehicle design and purpose. In real nuts, bolts, and notoriety, Honda first brought 4WS to modern production in the 1988 Prelude Si as an option. Nissan followed suit with its HICAS system, and Mazda had a system with extremely limited production, but Honda made the biggest splash. The Honda system was entirely mechanical. It used a shaft connecting the front steering rack to a planetary gear. That gear created the phase (direction) and degree of rear steering indexed to steering wheel input. This shaft led to a sliding rod that acted like the rack of a rack and pinion steering gear, carrying that input to the rear wheels. At small steering angles, the rear wheels turned a maximum of 1.5 degrees in phase (in the same direction) as the fronts. At larger steering wheel angles above roughly 270 degrees from center, the rear wheels steered as much as 5.3 degrees out-of-phase with the fronts, tightening the turning circle about 10 percent. The results in those 1980s and ’90s Preludes were impressive. Some auto critics,like that most cerebral of British scribes, L.J.K. Setright of Car Magazine, cited that the third and fourth-generation Honda Preludes with 4WS exuded the finest steering in the history of history. Weight, feel, accuracy, and telepathic information all sent the auto critic into automotive euphoria. As Honda engineers toiled away on their system outside Tokyo, about 37 km away, Nissan worked on its HICAS (“High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering”) variants. Only active above roughly 90 km/h (55 mph) and below 200 km/h (125 mph), it used a computer-controlled hydraulic actuator to move the rear lower lateral links. A computer signaled a rear steering rack, allowing toe changes of plus or minus one degree, depending on speed and front steering angle. The rear wheels of Nissan's system would initially (and briefly) steer out of phase with the fronts to improve turn-in response. It then switched phasing for greater stability. This enabled excellent slalom performance with rapid directional changes, which Nissan considered important in contemporary vehicle reviews and tests of sporty vehicles at the time. However, this early HICAS system had no rear steering at low speeds. The Nissan system also differed from Honda's in that it relied on a variety of sensors to instruct operation, whereas Honda's was entirely analog. Other manufacturers had been working on 4WS at roughly the same time, and others even launched production cars with the system before Honda. Mazda's MX-02 concept car in 1983 showed a real working system, reaching production in the 1988 626 Turbo. Mitsubishi had a system in the Galant VR-4 in 1987 that only steered with same-phase angles above 50 km/h (30 mph). But none made as big an impact as Honda's. However, 4WS did not take the world by storm in the marketplace. The complexity of sporty cars coming out of Japan in the 1980s grew enormously. Coupled with the Japanese Yen's dramatic rise in value against the US dollar and after the Plaza Accord agreement in September 1985 between major industrial countries, the cost of Japanese cars in overseas markets skyrocketed. In the US, the 1984 Nissan 300ZX Turbo cost around $16,000. By 1990, the 300ZX Turbo's MSRP was $33,260, more than doubling in just six years. The bigger meaning for us in 2025 is that, conceptually, today's 4WS systems essentially do the same thing. Slow-speed opposite-phase inputs tighten maneuverability. Same-phase steering at high speed improves directional changes like lane shifting with generally small steering angles at the rear. Even though the 4WS concept dates back to the early 20th-century trucks, GM is the only manufacturer that has produced a 4WS pickup in the modern era. (Ford has tested systems, though.) The initial Quadrasteer system of the 2000s used a set of trailing tie rods (behind the axle), leading to a steering rack, the pinion of which was an electric motor. This motor dialed a maximum of 15 degrees of steering angle out-of-phase with the front wheels, but only below 45 mph. Where a normal GM pickup had a turning circle of 47 feet, a Quadrasteer truck required only 37 feet, a giant 22 percent improvement. The Quadrasteer's in-phase rear-steering topped out at 5 degrees to improve highway stability at higher speeds. More importantly, since this was on a pickup truck, towing had to be considered, too. Therefore, GM limited the low-speed, opposite-phase steering angle in towing mode to 12 degrees. This prevented drastic angles from binding up a trailer while turning. However, GM's Quadrasteer system fell flat because of its high price. It didn't cost the moon to produce, but GM priced it at $5,600. The company also made it optional only on the top trim levels of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. GM also faced resistance among truck buyers because more complex mechanicals could mean a threat to durability. And if nothing else, pickup buyers want durability from their trucks, especially work trucks. Today, 4WS is still not commonplace, but many luxury cars and SUVs use it for the same reasons that existed nearly 50 years ago when Honda, Nissan, and Mazda began their studies in the mid-1970s. Mercedes offers it today on several vehicles like theelectric EQS, plusS-ClassandE-Classmodels. And it is showing up on some large GM EVs, like the newSilveradoandHummer. GMC offers a system on pickup trucks that aids low-speed maneuverability and allows the vehicle to crabwalk, changing direction with no yaw. Somehigh-powered Porsche modelsandtop-level Audisuse 4WS with slight variations, but all for the same fundamental reasons as in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite other developments in suspension design, computer aids, and active driving assists, which didn't exist in the 1980s, the fundamental benefits of four-wheel steering—improved maneuverability at low speed and improved high-speed turning stability—still exist nearly 50 years after the concept first saw the light of day.

    "title": "Open source project curl is sick of users submitting “AI slop” vulnerabilities",
    "article_text": "\"One way you can tell is it's always such a nice report,\" founder tells Ars. \"A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time,\" wrote Daniel Stenberg, original author and lead ofthe curl project,on LinkedIn this week. Curl (cURL in some realms), whichturned 25 years old in 2023, is an essential command-line tool and library for interacting with Internet resources. The open source project receives bug reports and security issues through many channels, including HackerOne, a reporting service that helps companies manage vulnerability reporting and bug bounties. HackerOne has fervently taken to AI tools in recent years. \"One platform, dual force: Human minds + AI power,\"the firm's home page reads. Stenberg, saying that he's \"had it\" and is \"putting my foot down on this craziness,\" suggested that every suspected AI-generated HackerOne report will have its reporter asked to verify if they used AI to find the problem or generate the submission. If a report is deemed \"AI slop,\" the reporter will be banned. \"We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help,\" Stenberg wrote. One report from May 4 that Stenberg wrote \"pushed me over the limit\" suggested a \"novel exploit leveraging stream dependency cycles in the HTTP/3 protocol stack.\" Stream dependency mishandling, where one aspect of a program waits for the output of another aspect, can lead to malicious data injection, race conditions and crashes, and other issues.The report in questionsuggests this could leave curl, which is HTTP/3-capable, vulnerable to exploits up to and including remote code execution. But as curl staff point out, the \"malicious server setup\" patch file submitted did not apply to the latest versions ofa Python tool in question. Asked about this, the original submitter responded ina strangely prompt-like fashion, answering questions not asked by curl staff (\"What is a Cyclic Dependency?\") and included what seem like basic instructions on how to use the git tool to apply a new patch. The submitter also did not provide the requested new patch file, cited functions that do not exist in the underlying libraries, and suggested hardening tactics for utilities other than curl. Curl coders eventually closed the report, but also made it public to serve as an example. Alex Rice, co-founder, CTO, and CISO of HackerOne, said in a statement to Ars that reports containing \"hallucinated vulnerabilities, vague or incorrect technical content, or other forms of low-effort noise\" are treated as spam and subject to enforcement. \"We believe AI, when used responsibly, can be a powerful tool for researchers, enhancing productivity, scale, and impact,\" Rice said. \"Innovation in this space is accelerating, and we support researchers who use AI to improve the quality and efficiency of their work. Overall, we're seeing an aggregate increase in report quality as AI helps researchers bring clarity to their work, especially where English is a second language.\" \"The key is ensuring that AI enhances the report rather than introducing noise,\" Rice said. \"Our goal is to encourage innovation that drives better security outcomes, while holding all submissions to the same high standards.\" In an interview with Ars, Stenberg said he was glad his post—which generated 200 comments and nearly 400 reposts as of Wednesday morning—was getting around. \"I'm super happy that the issue [is getting] attention so that possibly we can do something about it [and] educate the audience that this is the state of things,\" Stenberg said. \"LLMs cannot find security problems, at least not like they are being used here.\" This week has seen four such misguided, obviously AI-generated vulnerability reports seemingly seeking either reputation or bug bounty funds, Stenberg said. \"One way you can tell is it's always such a nice report. Friendly phrased, perfect English, polite, with nice bullet-points … an ordinary human never does it like that in their first writing,\" he said. Some AI reports are easier to spot than others. One accidentally pasted their prompt into the report, Stenberg said, \"and he ended it with, 'and make it sound alarming.'\" Stenberg said he had \"talked to [HackerOne] before about this\" and has reached out to the service this week. \"I would like them to do something, something stronger, to act on this. I would like help from them to make the infrastructure around [AI tools] better and give us more tools to strike down this behavior,\" he said. In the comments of his post, Stenberg, trading comments with Tobias Heldt of open source security firmXOR, suggested that bug bounty programs could potentially use \"existing networks and infrastructure.\" Security reporters paying a bond to have a report reviewed \"could be one way to filter signals and reduce noise,\" Heldt said. Elsewhere, Stenberg said that while AI reports are \"not drowning us, [the] trend is not looking good.\" Stenberg has previouslyblogged on his own siteabout AI-generated vulnerability reports, with more details on what they look like and what they get wrong. Seth Larson, security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation, added to Stenberg's findings withhis own examples and suggested actions, asnoted by The Register. \"If this is happening to a handful of projects that I have visibility for, then I suspect that this is happening on a large scale to open source projects,\" Larson wrote in December. \"This is a very concerning trend.\" This post was updated at 3:45 p.m. to include comment from HackerOne.

    "title": "Trump tariffs could make Americans pay $123B more annually for 10 common gadgets",
    "article_text": "Average US price of smartphones, game consoles, and laptops may soon exceed $1,000. China has finally agreed to open negotiations with the Trump administration as the tech industry warns that tariffs could soon spike Americans' costs for the 10 most popular consumer technology products by more than $123 billion annually. On Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy in the USannouncedon X (formerly Twitter) that \"China’s lead on China-US economic and trade affairs,\" He Lifeng, will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent from May 9 to 12 to open talks. For those talks to go smoothly, China's Ministry of CommercetoldreportersWednesday, the US must \"demonstrate sincerity\" and come ready to \"correct its wrongdoings,\" including facing \"the severe negative impacts of its unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world.\" Previously, China had demanded that President Trump drop all tariffs to begin negotiations, which Trump refused while seemingly holding out on making a deal on TikTok to keep the potential bargaining chip. While tensions don't exactly appear to be dissipating, these talks are the first sign that the trade rivals could reach a resolution after Trump raised tariffs on some Chinese imports as high as 145 percent. And they come just as Americans expect to soon feel the sting from tariffs in their wallets. According to the Consumer Technology Association's most recent estimates released Tuesday, Americans risk paying much higher prices for any Chinese imports that are not exempted from those 145 percent tariffs. They also face potentially higher prices from other tariffs the Trump administration imposed, including a baseline 10 percent tariff on all imports from all countries and reciprocal tariffs that kick in July, which would add an additional 11 to 50 percent tax on all imports from 57 countries. For example, non-exempted video game consoles—perhaps less than 1 percent of which are produced in the US, industry analysts estimate—could soon cost more than $1,000 on average, up by about 69 percent. And as the price goes up, the CTA warned that supply chain disruptions could cause shortages since \"shifting the large quantities of Chinese production to other suppliers would bevery difficult given the volumes involved.\" Even some of the seemingly less painful smaller price hikes could \"rob\" the US economy, the CTA warned. For example, headphones costing Americans up to $5 more or speakers costing up to $60 more could drain wallets nationwide by more than $2.5 billion, the CTA estimated. And an estimated 11 percent increase on imports of non-exempt China-made TVs—which only account for a small share of total US TV imports—could significantly hurt the US economy by \"forcing consumers to pay $1.9 billion more than they otherwise would for the televisions they continue to buy,\" the CTA forecasted. Meanwhile, \"buyers of smartphones, laptops and tablets, and connected devices would likely feel the greatest impact,\" the CTA said. In 2023, China accounted for 87 percent of video game consoles, 78 percent of smartphones, 79 percent of laptops and tablets, and 67 percent of monitors imported into the US, and there is still very little US production of those goods. On average, laptops could soon cost more than $1,000, tablets nearly $600, and smartphones nearly $1,100, while connected devices could cost up to 22 percent more, the CTA estimated. Overall, Trump's tariff regime threatens to \"shrink the US economy by $69 billion annually\" from price shifts of just 10 popular tech products, the CTA warned. To prevent this, the CTA has been advocating on Capitol Hill for more exemptions while urging the Trump administration to stop using tariffs to force production into the US, echoing other analysts who have long warned Trump that shifting supply chains into the US cannot be done immediately. \"The effort to reshore manufacturing through higher tariff rates on imported goods comes at a cost: the research shows that consumers would lose about $16 in spending power for every $1 gained by domestic producers,\" the CTA reported. And that loss of spending power, the CTA noted, means Americans have less money to spend on things like groceries or other essential goods that are also impacted by tariffs. Although the US-China talks likely won't trigger changes on Trump's tariffs impacting other parts of the world, China's role as a hard-to-replace global production hub has left many tech companies eager to see trade talks resume. As consumers brace for sticker shock, tech companies' revenues could be hit hard if sales significantly decrease. That seems likely, as the CTA is already forecasting drastic drops in consumption of video game consoles (down by up to 73 percent), laptops and tablets (45 percent), and smartphones (nearly 50 percent). For low-income families, the smartphone price hikes could hit the hardest, the CTA warned, which would be especially burdensome since imports triggering price drops only recently were credited with making smartphones more accessible in the US. China still appears to potentially have the upper hand in negotiations. Trump apparently had been pushing to meet with China's president Xi Jinping, seemingly wanting to be viewed as the sole dealmaker on tariffs, the South China Morning Postreported. But China refused, insisting on each country appointing special envoys, a concession that Trump appears to have granted in directing Bessent to meet with Xi's trade chief instead of leading the talks himself. For China, refusing to deal directly with Trump is depicted as necessary to preserve mutual respect in negotiations. After Trump claimed China was engaged in talks that China denied and suggested that China was \"doing very poorly\" due to his tariffs, the president suddenly pivoted to promising to \"play nice\" with China. Now China seems to be holding Trump to his word. Ahead of trade talks this weekend, China's Ministry of Commerce warned the US that China wouldn't resolve trade tensions without safeguarding its own interests, promising to keep fighting \"if provoked.\" \"If the US says one thing but does another, or even attempts to use negotiations as a pretext to continue coercive and blackmailing tactics, China will never agree, nor will it sacrifice its principles or international fairness and justice to seek any agreement,\" the Ministry said. For US chipmakers who are still waiting for Trump to release his semiconductor tariff plan, the trade talks will likely be watched closely. Ahead of talks, Nvidia, AMD, Super Micro, and Marvell have warned investors of potentially billions in lost revenue, with some postponing further investor guidance until after the tariff plan is revealed, CNBCreported. Other tech giants both inside and outside the US are also reportedly scrambling, even if they aren't completely reliant on China-based production. Despite exemptions on smartphones and a plan to shift production of US-destined products into India, Apple recently estimated that tariffs could add $900 million in costs in this quarter alone, the BBCreported. So far, there are no clear winners in Trump's trade war. South Korea-based Samsung—which has a Vietnamese production hub subject to 46 percent tariffs—was expected to potentially gain from any Apple losses. But an executive on a recent earnings call warned investors that \"there are a lot of uncertainties ahead of us,\" CNBC reported. \"Due to the rapid changes in policies and geopolitical tensions among major countries, it’s difficult to accurately predict the business impact of tariffs and countermeasures,\" the Samsung executive said. And although trade talks could dramatically shift global markets again, the CTA warned that \"ongoing reviews of semiconductors and downstream products in the electronics supply chain, copper, lumber, critical minerals, and other materials\" could potentially add to cost pressures and trigger even more price hikes for Americans.

    "title": "The Third Crisis dawns in Foundation S3 teaser",
    "article_text": "\"If we fail, humanity will be lost forever. We act, or we lose.\" It's been nearly two years, but the third season ofFoundation,Apple TV+'s epic adaptation (or remix) of the Isaac Asimov series, is almost here. The streaming platform released an action-packed teaser of what we can expect from the new ten-episode season: the onset of the Third Crisis, a galactic war, and a shirtless Lee Pace. (Some spoilers for first two seasons below.) Showrunner David S. Goyer took great pains in S1 to carefully set up his expansive fictional world, and the scope only broadened in the second season. Aspreviously reported, Asimov's fundamental narrative arc remains intact, with the series taking place across multiple planets over 1,000 years and featuring a huge cast of characters. Mathematician Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) developed a controversial theory of \"psychohistory,\" and his calculations predict the fall of the Empire, ushering in a Dark Age period that will last 30,000 years, after which a second Empire will emerge. The collapse of the Empire is inevitable, but Seldon has a plan to reduce the Dark Ages to a mere 1,000 years through the establishment of a Foundation to preserve all human knowledge so that civilization need not rebuild itself entirely from scratch. He is aided in this endeavor by his math prodigy protegé Gaal Dornick (Lou Llobell). The biggest change from the books is the replacement of the Empire's ruling committee with a trio of Eternal Emperor clones called the Cleons—a genetic triune dynasty comprised of Brother Day (Pace), Brother Dusk (Terrence Mann), and Brother Dawn (Cassian Bilton). Technically, they are all perfect incarnations of the same man at different ages, and this is both the source of their strength as a team and of their conflicts. Their guardian is an android, Eto Demerzel (Laura Birn), one of the last surviving androids from the ancient Robot Wars, who is programmed to protect the dynasty at all costs. The first season ended with a major time jump of 138 years, andS2 focusedon the Second Crisis: imminent war between Empire and the Foundation, along with an enemy seeking to destroy Empire from within. The Foundation, meanwhile, adopted the propaganda tactics of religion to recruit new acolytes to the cause. We also met a colony of \"Mentalics\" with psionic abilities. Goyer stepped down as showrunner after S2 but has reportedly remained very much involved with production. And we're getting another mega time jump for the Third Crisis. Per the official premise: Set 152 years after the events of S2, The Foundation has become increasingly established far beyond its humble beginnings while the Cleonic Dynasty’s Empire has dwindled. As both of these galactic powers forge an uneasy alliance, a threat to the entire galaxy appears in the fearsome form of a warlord known as “The Mule” whose sights are set on ruling the universe by use of physical and military force, as well as mind control. It’s anyone’s guess who will win, who will lose, who will live, and who will die as Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, the Cleons and Demerzel play a potentially deadly game of intergalactic chess. Most of the main cast is returning: Pace, Bilton, Mann, Harris as Llobell, and Birn, as well as Rowena King as legendary mathematician Kalle. Pilou Asbæk plays the Mule, briefly introduced in S2. New S3 cast members include Cherry Jones, Brandon P. Bell, Synnøve Karlsen, Cody Fern, Tómas Lemarquis, Alexander Siddig, and Troy Kotsur. The third season ofFoundationpremieres on July 11, 2025, on Apple TV+. New episodes will air weekly through September 12, 2025. A few first look images are featured in the gallery below.

    "title": "Ford raises prices on Mexican-made cars—but not the full tariff cost",
    "article_text": "Mach-Es, Bronco Sports, and Mavericks already in inventory won't see a price increase. Price rises are coming to some Mexican-made Ford vehicles this summer as a result of President Trump'sdecision to launchan international trade war.According to Reuters, which saw a memo that Ford sent to dealers, the price increase will affect the Mustang Mach-E electric crossover, the Bronco Sport crossover, and the Maverick pickup truck, which cost as much as an extra $2,000. The Trump auto tariffs went into effect at the beginning of April, adding a 25 percent charge to any imported vehicle.When challengedon the fact that this would cause significant price rises for US consumers, Trump told NBC that he \"couldn't care less if they raise prices.\" And now that's happening. Ford told Ars that the price increases are part of its \"usual mid-year pricing actions combined with tariffs we are facing\" and that the price bumps do not cover the full costs of the tariff. Additionally, the move only affects vehicles that have been imported since May 2, which should only appear in dealerships in late June—any cars already in inventory are not subject to the price rise. Ford also told Ars that it will continue to offer employee pricing to all its customers until at least July 4, even on vehicles made after May 2. Ford published its Q1 2025 financial results earlier this week, reporting a net income of $471 million, a $900 million decrease compared to Q1 2024. In its statement to investors, the company said that it estimates that the Trump tariff will cost it as much as $1.5 billion in 2025. Still, the price increases will be felt keenly, particularly for hybrid Maverick customers.When Ford faceliftedthe hybrid pickup truck last year, it also added several thousand more dollars to the MSRP; now that's going up yet again. Meanwhile, a separate 25 percent tariff on imported car parts went into effect last week. Whilethere is a small breakfor OEMs to apply for up to 3.75 percent reimbursements, the parts tariff will affect all OEMs building cars in the US, all of which depend to greater or lesser degrees on suppliers in Mexico and Canada. On top of the persistent 25 percent price increase that almost all cars have experienced since 2020, it seems it's becoming an even more horrible time to have to buy a new vehicle.

    "title": "Dangerous clear-air turbulence is worsening due to global warming",
    "article_text": "Climate change is making high-altitude winds much more volatile. VIENNA—Scientists at the European Geosciences Union conference last week said there is growing scientific evidence that global warming is driving a big increase in dangerous clear-air turbulence, which is invisible from the cockpit and can surprise pilots and damage aircraft. Along some busy flight routes, turbulence is projected to “double or treble or quadruple over the next few decades,” saidPaul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science and head of the weather research division at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. “What we find … is that the jet stream regions in both the Northern and the Southern hemispheres are affected.” As its name implies, clear-air turbulence can happen when there are no visible signs of a weather disturbance, often at or near the boundary of contrasting air masses, moving in different directions and at varying speeds. It can unexpectedly toss large airplanes up and down by several hundred feet, potentially damaging the airframe and injuring passengers and crew. The increase of clear-air turbulence has been documented for a few years. Researchers are now starting to understand how and why it happens, which could help develop new ways to forecast and avoid it, especially when it involves the jet stream, strong rivers of air in the Northern and Southern hemispheres that steer weather systems and air masses from west to east. But looking at how climate change affects wind speeds in the upper atmosphere hasn’t proven very helpful in understanding clear-air turbulence, Williams said. Vertical wind shear—the difference in the speed and direction of winds at different altitudes—is a much more useful variable for the researchers. “When we look in the same three re-analysis data sets of what the vertical wind shear has been doing, there’s been a clear increase by around 15 percent over the past four decades,” he said. Vertical wind shear in the jet streams can be compared to what happens when a smooth river starts flowing more steeply downhill and speeds up, saidDavide Faranda, research director of climate physics in theLaboratoire de Science du Climat et de l’Environnement, part of theFrench National Center for Scientific Research. “It can become turbulent,” he said. “So if you have a small boat and you put it in this river, you will see shaking a lot, and it’s the same for planes when they fly in the turbulent jet streams.” Faranda’s interest in clear-air turbulence stems from a childhood fascination with both planes and weather, as well as a personal experience with a very bumpy ride on the way home from a science conference in 2023. “It was LA to Charlotte, after the AGU conference in San Francisco,” he said. “We basically had clear-air turbulence for over three hours, with extreme things like the luggages storage opening, luggage flying away. So that traumatized me.” The waves in the jet streams can start on the land surface, Faranda said. “You don’t have rocks or slopes in the atmosphere, but in fact, it can feel the slopes of the continental shelves, the Rocky Mountains, or the Alps or Greenland,” he said. “Where you have these strong changes in elevation that perturb the atmosphere, it can propagate up to the level where planes are flying.” But the exact location of each rough patch changes constantly because the jet streams shift in wavy patterns, sometimes with big loops north and south, driven mainly by regional temperature contrasts between polar regions and the mid-latitudes, he said. “Global warming is faster at the poles,” Faranda said, “and it’s melting ice and it’s also warming differently in oceans and on continents.” As global warming jars climatic patterns, it affects the jet streams, he said. Williams, the University of Reading scientist, was “the first to understand that if the jet stream is affected, then turbulence in the jet stream is affected, and therefore flight operations are affected,” Faranda said. In his EGU presentation, Williams said it’s important to look at vertical wind shear because the signal in the data is much stronger compared to the noise. “Why do we care about stronger wind shear? Well, of course, it’s because we fly through it,” he said, showing a photo of a grounded jet plane that lost an engine in severe clear-air turbulence. The data shows there has been a 55 percent increase of severe air turbulence since the 1970s, he added. Climate models show that, under the most realistic greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a “hotspot in the tropical upper troposphere will continue to grow, which means an even stronger midlatitude temperature gradient,” he said. That hotspot in the upper troposphere is an area of amplified warming resulting partly from water vapor feedbacks, as moist, hot air steams off the tropical oceans. That heat bulge is increasing the temperature gradient in areas near some of the busiest flight paths, including transatlantic routes. If rapid warming continues, Williams said, studies show vertical wind shear could increase 29 percent by 2100, or 17 percent if global emissions are halved by mid-century and keep dropping. “This, of course, means a lot more turbulence in not that many years from now,” he said. Faranda added that his own experiences and research on clear-air turbulence won’t keep him from flying. New measurements by weather instruments and greater awareness of the potential for such turbulence will help keep most flights safe, and changes to wing design and plane construction could make them less vulnerable, he added. “In principle, you can fly through these areas without consequences in most cases,” Faranda said. But with projections for more intense and frequent turbulence, it’s important to maintain observation programs, he added. “With the new global political situation, there is a lot of talk of reducing instruments for monitoring the weather and the climate, and this would produce worse weather forecasts,” he said. And fewer weather observations will likely lead to shakier flights. This story originally appeared onInside Climate News.

    "title": "Jury orders NSO to pay $167 million for hacking WhatsApp users",
    "article_text": "The verdict is a major victory for opponents of exploit sellers. A jury has awarded WhatsApp $167 million in punitive damages in a case the company brought against Israel-based NSO Group for exploiting a software vulnerability that hijacked the phones of thousands of users. The verdict, reached Tuesday, comes as a major victory not just for Meta-owned WhatsApp but also for privacy- and security-rights advocates who have long criticized the practices of NSO and other exploit sellers. The jury also awarded WhatsApp $444 million in compensatory damages. WhatsApp sued NSOin 2019for an attack that targeted roughly 1,400 mobile phones belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. NSO, which works on behalf of governments and law enforcement authorities in various countries, exploited a critical WhatsApp vulnerability that allowed it to install NSO’s proprietary spywarePegasuson iOS and Android devices. The clickless exploit worked by placing a call to a target's app. A target did not have to answer the call to be infected. “Today’s verdict in WhatsApp’s case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,” WhatsApp said in astatement. “Today, the jury’s decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.” NSO created WhatsApp accounts in 2018 and used them a year later to initiate calls that exploited the critical vulnerability on phones, which, among others, included 100 members of \"civil society\" from 20 countries, according to an investigation research group Citizen Lab performed on behalf of WhatsApp. The calls passed through WhatsApp servers and injected malicious code into the memory of targeted devices. The targeted phones would then use WhatsApp servers to connect to malicious servers maintained by NSO. After discovering the attack, WhatsApp shut them down with a software update that patched the critical vulnerability and notified target users that their devices had been hacked. In the weeks following, Facebook and WhatsApp also kicked NSO employees off their platforms. WhatsApp’s lawsuit was unprecedented at the time because it was among the first to take aim at the unregulated industry selling sophisticated malware services to governments around the world. NSO argued that it should be immune from such legal actions because it sold tools solely to licensed government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies for use in fighting terrorism, child sex abuse, and other serious crimes. The company said it barred customers from using the tools against human-rights activists, journalists, and dissidents. NSO also said it acted as a check against strongly encrypted platforms that could be used as a haven for criminals. Tuesday’s verdict—from a jury empaneled by the US District Court for the Northern District of California—is a sharp rebuke of NSO’s defense. “Turns out regular people don't like companies that help dictators hack dissidents,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab,wroteon Bluesky. “NSO had all the fancy legal arguments. And all the PR spin. But when their conduct got laid bare... the jury sent a massive Monsanto-style punitive damages signal. Other spyware companies: you may be next.” Besides setting a possible precedent for hacking victims and their technology providers, WhatsApp’s suit exposed NSO practices the company had long tried to keep secret. Last year, the judge hearing the caseorderedNSO to reveal some of the source code that makes its products work. The litigation also exposed who some of NSO’s customers were and the location of many of the targeted WhatsApp users. NSO Group didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "title": "Here’s When Samsung Will Reveal Everything About Its Ultra-Thin Galaxy S25 Edge Phone",
    "article_text": "TheSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeis flying into the limelight on Gossamer-thin wings on May 12. Samsung’s hosting an “Unpacked” eventâfully virtual this timeâto share details on the super-thin smartphone that’s barely thicker than a USB-C charging port. The virtual event will take place on May 12 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT. Youâll be able to watch the livestream onSamsungâs websiteor its officialYouTube channel. Don’t expect new versions of theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6andGalaxy Z Fold 6, thoughâthose will likely come at a separate event this summer. Samsung first showed off the Galaxy S25 Edge at itsJanuary Unpacked event. The company burped out the news for the phone as the âone more thingâ for the event, but it didnât offer many details other than highlighting its thin frame. Theanticipated April launch datedidnât pan out, and Samsung still hasnât gone into details about the device. In a release, Samsung said the S25 Edge is âmore than a slim smartphoneâ that âunlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.â What can we expect other than executives boasting about the phone’s thinness? Boasting about the camera, perhaps. The company confirmed its slim device houses a 200-megapixel camera that may be based on the main sensor found on theGalaxy S25 Ultra,but weâll need to see if it has the same levels of zoom. Images show the phone has two lenses compared to three or five found on Samsung’s other Android phones. Samsung has previously said the S25 Edge cameras have âpro-grade capabilities,â which implies they will have access to Samsungâs suite of photo editing tools. The phone will also likely be engineered with AI in mind, with at least some of the generative AI editing and creation tools available on current Galaxy phones. The Galaxy maker will need to convince uswhy we should want a super-slim phone. Rumors suggest Apple is set to launch its own skinny phone, the iPhone 17 Air, and might bring back an external battery case tomake up for what sources have described as more limited batterycompared to regular and pro iPhones.

    "title": "Mon Mothma’s Senate Floor Speech Changes Star Wars Canon for the Better",
    "article_text": "One of the most important momentsAndorfans have waiting for happened inthis week’s episode dropof the hitStar Warsseries. On the last episode, following theconflict on Ghorman, Mon Mothma took to the Senate floor to deliver a damning indictment of Emperor Palpatine’s true reign of tyranny. It solidified Mon Mothma as a leader of the Rebellion in the public sphere in an preamble expansion of the moment seen onStar Wars Rebels. The new scene serves as a sort of companion speech to the one she delivers while en route to Yavin with the Gold Squadron, and it’s aimed directly at Palpatine and those working to keep his favor out of fear. ActressGenevieve O’Reilly and show creator Tony Gilroytalked toEntertainment Weeklyabout the moment Mon’s life trajectory changed forever. “The monster who will come for us all soon enough is Emperor Palpatine,” the character declares in the speech. “[Mon] knows that now is the time to use her one weapon, which is her voice, and she must use it and be as impactful as possible,” O’Reilly said. “She is ruthless in that moment, in the name of the Rebellion.” O’Reilly continued to explain how it was something she wanted to make sure to do in full. “It was everything I was hoping for,” she told EW. “That’s like the best gift you can get as an actor. She speaks to how important the Senate is to her. You can see that it’s like her church. She reveals so much and then she calls out some really brutal truths.” “I knew that that would be important to fans. I knew it was also really important to me for her. That’s the fulcrum of who Mon Mothma is right there. And so I got to stand up for her in that moment. That was really important to me, and I hope it means something to people because it felt really great to be able to give her that voice.” And yes, it diverges from what was in the animated canon before. Gilroy admitted, “In a really sneaky way, we’re minimizing what they did inStar Wars Rebels, but we’re keeping it consistent. We’re just saying you don’t really know the whole story of what happened.” O’Reilly asked Gilroy to expand on what was originally cut up between other moments of the episode’s final act, because she knew it was essential to Mon’s character to give her that full moment. “Within a day or two, he came with that whole speech,” she explained. “He gave it to me, the idea being that I would learn it and then they would just do those moments. Then, I went to the director, and the director was like, ‘Yeah, let’s film the whole speech.’ It was such a huge thing to me to give that whole speech. It feels really special.” Andorairs weekly on Disney+. Want more io9 news?

Cooking at home is rewarding and cheap, but it can take time. You don’t always have loads of time to do it, either. You’ve got to prep ingredients, wait for meals to cook, and then clean it all up.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Starlink Is Quietly Benefiting From Tariff Negotiations",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration’s tariff regime hassqueezed most Americans, causing new financial pressures as the cost of goods goes up, but at least one person seems to be making out pretty well from the situation: Elon Musk. According to areport from the Washington Post, Musk’s satellite internet company Starlink has attracted new interest from nations that are looking to wiggle their way out of Trump’s tariff crunch. The Post highlights the small nation of Lesotho, which was inexplicably subjected to a 50% tax when Trump first announced his so-called “reciprocal” penalties (which turned out to be the result of some sort of very strange, nonsensical formula that may or may not havecome from a chatbot). Two weeks after the tariffs were announced, Lesotho leadership met with representatives of Starlink, which had been trying to get a foothold in the country for some time prior, and signed a deal to make the company Lesotho’s first-ever satellite internet service. Coincidences happen, of course. It’s just that,according to the Post, they’re happening pretty regularly right now with Starlink. Around the same time as the tariffs were being discussed and implemented, Starlink also struck deals to provide service in parts of Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Pakistan, Somalia, and Vietnam. In the case of Lesotho, a memo obtained by the Post makes it clear that there’s an attempt to curry favor happening: âAs the government of Lesotho negotiates a trade deal with the United States, it hopes that licensing Starlink demonstrates goodwill and intent to welcome U.S. businesses,â the internal State Department communication read. It’s hard to imagine that other nations haven’t had similar thoughts of strategically aligning themselves with a company run by a Trump White House employee in order to get some relief. The Trump administration has not been explicitly pushing Starlink on these companies, according to the report, but it has been encouraging countries to do business with US-based satellite internet firms, and there happens to be one very big, prominent one that comes to mind. And it certainly seems like countries are treating Starlink favorably. India, for example, reportedly sped up the approvals process for the company in an effort to grease the wheels for trade deals, per the Post. Lining Musk’s pockets may not be the primary purpose of the Trump admin pushing satellite internet on countries (though it surely doesn’t hurt, either). Chinese companies arequickly ramping up to offer an alternative to Starlink, and the US would prefer to capture those markets before its competitors can. So it’s using the leverage to push American products. It is funny how it seems to always benefit Trump’s backers, though, right? Coincidences happen all the time.

    "title": "Clown in a Cornfield Lives Up to That Tremendous Title",
    "article_text": "Clown in a Cornfieldis such a succinct yet evocative title for a horror movie. Your villain and your setting are right there, plus all theawful connotationsyour imagination can whip up regarding both.Eli Craig’s new slasherhas a lot to live up to with a title like that, butthe directorofTucker & Dale vs. Evilknows what he’s doing. He’s got all the ingredients: appealing characters, a small town with a huge secret, a ghoulish killer, and an underlying message that makes sure the film is about more thanjusta killer clown splattering victims around a cornfieldâthough rest assured, there’s still plenty of that. After a preface set in 1991 that immediately deliversâkids partying in a cornfield are ambushed by a maniac withvery largeshoesâwe cut to the present day and get a closer look at Kettle Springs, Missouri, a farm town that’s fallen on hard times since the Baypen Brand Corn Syrup factory closed. The company’s mascot, a grinning clown named “Frendo,” still looms over the town as a reminder of more prosperous days. More recently, desperately bored local teens have cast him as the masked killer in horror shorts they put out on YouTube. The sleepy rural community soon adds two new residents: Quinn (Ginny & Georgia‘s Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams). He’s accepted the job of town doctor, figuring that after the sudden loss of Quinn’s mother, the pair could use a fresh start. Though she quickly befriends the YouTube clique, Quinn’s not thrilled about relocating to Nowheresville, especially as she picks up on how hostile the older residents are toward the local teenagers. But there’s not much time to marinate on that as things get going;Clown in a Cornfieldtakes place over just a few days and nights, and a good amount of screen time is given over to red-nosed, red-wigged terror, wielding chainsaws, crossbows, cattle prods, and other conveniently available implements of destruction. Despite that title, and despite Craig being the guy behind the cult-belovedTucker & Dale vs. Evil,Clown in a Cornfieldis actually less of a comedy than you might think. There are witty, self-referential linesâthe script is by Craig and Carter Blanchard, adapted from the novel by Adam Cesareâbut Frendo is not to be fucked with, as one character cautions Quinn. Whoever’s under the mask is ruthless and furious, andClown in a Cornfieldengages in some sly misdirection about the killer’s ID as more and more bodies pile up. Throughout the film,Clown in a Cornfieldpulls on the threads of that generation-gap conflict and even brings technology in as part of it. Quinn’s new friends love making videos and being online, but they’re surrounded by adults who don’t see the point of even the most basic progress. (One of the funniest scenes, teased in the film’s trailer, is a crisis that occurs when the only way to call for help involves a rotary phone.) The motivation behind Frendo’s slaughter ties into this divide, and if the pieces don’t quite completely fit together at the end,Clown in a Cornfieldhas by then built up a lot of energetic goodwill. It ultimately proves itself to be amostlystraightforward slasher filmâcomplete with many of the expected tropes, including pleasingly gruesome goreâwith some clever and subversive jabs along the way. Clown in a Cornfieldalso stars Kevin Durand, Will Sasso, Carson MacCormac, Vincent Muller, Cassandra Potenzo, and Verity Marks. It hits theaters May 9. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Border Officials Are Soliciting Companies for Real-Time Facial Recognition to Use on Cars at the Border",
    "article_text": "Once again, the United States Customs and Border Protection wants to purchase new surveillance technology. This time, CBP aims to beef up its border surveillance byusing facial recognition on anyone entering the U.S. by car.As CBP continues to expand its surveillance infrastructure, it appears that facial recognition will remain a key part of the agency’s net. Last week, CBP’s Office of Field Operations Biometric Program Office issued aRequest for Informationsoliciting vendors for technology to capture high-quality facial images of people inside vehicles at inbound land ports of entry. These images would be used for real-time comparisons with the Traveler Verification System, which is a pre-existing facial recognition system that DHS relies on at various entry points including airports and at pedestrian border crossings. Currently,CBP collects a wealth of information at border crossingsincluding a “vehicle package” that consists of a license plate, scene photo, and biographic information. The new technology wouldn’t replace this. Instead, CBP would use it to develop a two-layer system. Vehicles would start by entering what CBP calls the Pre-Primary Zone where live encounter photos are compared to any “in government holding.” Then, vehicles continue into the Primary Zone where CBP’s new technology would take and analyze photos of anyone who wasn’t already “biometrically confirmed” in the PPZ. Per the RFI, CBP is open to passive or officer-actuated systems as long as they can offer real-time feedback. In addition, it must be able to filter for non-human passengers, like pets or animal graphics on a shirt, and take usable images of people even in unideal circumstances, like if they aren’t looking at the camera or are wearing hats, sunglasses, etc. This is far from CPB’s first foray into using facial recognition on vehicles. Last year, The Interceptreportedon a different RFI from DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate, which wanted information on running facial recognition on vehicle occupants as they approached border checkpoints. Per the outlet, DHS has tested facial recognition on vehicles since 2016, including at the Anzalduas International Bridge, Nogales’ Mariposa Port of Entry, andBuffalo’s Peace Bridge Port of Entry. In a press release for Buffalo’s test, CBP stated that it is pursuing facial recognition at vehicular crossings “in accordance with CBP’s Congressional mandate to biometrically record all foreign nationals who enter and exit the United States.” It also stated that facial recognition can stop “imposters” from using other people’s travel documents. The Electronic Frontier Foundation obtained a2022 postmortem by DHSon the Anzalduas test. Although the document said that all “stated objectives were successfully met”,Â  pictures were only obtained about 76 percent of the time and only 81 percent of images were usable. It’s unclear where the problems with capturing pictures stems from. However, the RFI acknowledges these shortcomings, stating that, “Human behavior, multiple passenger vehicle rows, and environmental obstacles all present challenges unique to the vehicle environment.” CBP’s plans to expand facial recognition at the border aren’t ideal for many reasons. First, Dave Mass, director of investigations at the EFF, told Wired that CBP’s one-to-one facial recognition system opens up possibilities where people aren’t matched to their own documents. But in addition, CBP’s hopes to expand real-time facial recognition to vehicles bring up a slew of privacy concerns. As Mass previously told The Intercept, “We have already seen how automated license plate readers are able to create a massive surveillance dragnet of people’s vehicles and driving patterns.” “If law enforcement is able to add face recognition capture from moving vehicles to the mix, they’ll be able to track not only where your vehicle is going, but who is driving it, and who is in the car with you,” Mass continued. According to the Anzalduas postmortem, CBP “must significantly increase” the number of images it takes. The RFI seems to be taking that into account as it states the new technologyÂ would augment “passenger images in the PPZ” and allow CBP to “capture 100% of vehicle passengers”.Â Vendors have until May 30 to respond to the RFI. borderFacial Recognition Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

An Ohio judge has ruled that critical evidence in a murder trial isn't admissible because of how police used Clearview AI. A hat and sunglasses may not be enough to fool the most sophisticated facial recognition algorithms. You can opt out of facial recognition at airports, for now, but the TSA has indicated it wants to make the invasive technology a requirement.

    "title": "Apple’s Stock Price Falls After Exec Says It Is Considering Injecting Safari With AI",
    "article_text": "On Wednesday, Appleâs senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, said that the company is âactively looking atâ bringing AI search options to its Safari web browser. Cue also said he believes that AI search engines will eventually replace standard search engines like Google. Cueâs comments came as he testified in the remedies phase of Googleâs antitrust trial in Washington. The Apple executive also shared that the number of Google searches made on Safari decreased for the first time ever this year. He attributed the change to the rise of AI search engines. âThat has never happened in 22 years,â he emphasized. (Safari was released in early 2003.) While Cue says that AI search technology isnât ready to be rolled out on Safari (âTo date, theyâre just not good enoughâ), he did say that the company has already had conversations with OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic. Last August, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to some of its products, but Cue says he wanted to âmake sure we have the capability to switch if we have to,â in case another company distinguishes itself as a leader in AI search. Share prices of both Alphabet and Apple fellâAlphabetâs by around 8% and Appleâs by around 2%âafter Bloomberg reported on Cueâs testimony. Executives from a range of tech companiesâincluding Yahoo, Microsoft, and OpenAIâare expected to testify during the remedies phase of this trial, which kicked off last month. Appleâs testimony is particularly relevant to Googleâs fate because the search company pays Apple around $20 billion a year to be the default search engine on Safari. Under this agreement with Google, Apple receives a portion of Googleâs ad revenue from searches on Safari. During his testimony on Wednesday, Cue said heâs âlost a lot of sleepâ over the idea of losing the revenue share. Google is currently the defendant in two separate antitrust suits filed by the Department of Justice. Todayâs testimony was part of the trial that emerged from the Justice Departmentâs 2020 lawsuit against Google. That suit alleges that Google illegally maintained a monopoly on search and search advertising markets. A central argument in the DOJâs case was that the exclusivity agreements Google struck with certain platform providers (like Apple) to become the default browser on their tools were illegally monopolistic. Last August, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the US District Court of the District of Washington, DC, ruled against Google in the trial. While Google has said it plans to appeal the verdict, that action will have to wait until the remedies phase of the trial is complete. Separately, a 2023 suit filed by the DOJ against Google argues that the search giant illegally monopolized the digital ad tech market. Last month, Google was found guilty of two of the three charges brought against it. Google also plans to appeal this ruling. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "GQuuuuuuX Is a Celebration of Gundam Blorbos",
    "article_text": "Now that it’s almost halfway through,Gundam GQuuuuuuXis setting the stage for a fascinating story between its young trio of protagonists and the forces at play beyond them in the show’s vision of an alternative version ofÂGundam‘sÂbeloved original continuity. But something has become clear about the series with every episode: this is a series that is made by creatives who are absolute sickos for the originalÂGundam. Set in an alt-future re-imagining of whatÂGundamcould look like if the Earth Federation lost theOne Year Wardepicted throughout the original 1979 anime, by its very natureÂGQuuuuuuXhas had plenty of opportunity to include tons of familiar characters. It’s pulled out some big guns: Char Aznable, arguably one of the most famousÂGundamcharacters of all time, if notthemost, has both appeared and left an indelible shadow over the series’ whole narrative even as he has become largely absent from it. You might have expected, in some ways, for the series’ cast to be peppered with oodles of other prominent characters from the original show, from series protagonist Amuro Ray, to Char’s sister Sayla, to Bright Noa, or other members ofthe White Base crewthat could’ve been, if Zeon hadn’t won the war. ButÂGQuuuuuuX‘s primary cast is both blessedly largely original,Âandfilled with 1979 throwbacks… just the wildest, weirdest choices imaginable. Challia Bull, animportant yet one-offcharacter from the 1979 showâparadoxically both fundamentally vital to that series’ early explorations of one of the franchise’smost fascinating concepts, Newtypes, and also unimportant enough that he was killed off in his debut appearance, and even left on the cutting room floor of the original show’s movie compilation trilogyâis a major figure and potential antagonistic force inGQuuuuuuX, radically re-imagined as an incredibly closepartner of Charnow in search of his missing friend and the Red Gundam he piloted. But he’s a major character in a sea of what the internet would otherwise affectionally call “blorbos” (or Glup Shittos, if you take your fandom parlancefromStar Wars): incredibly minor one-hit wonders whose invocation is for the most diehard of fans. We’ve had Cameron Bloom, a minor bureaucrat from the original show who mostly existed to get in the way of Mirai’s burgeoning relationship with Bright and be subject toone of the funniest punchesinGundamhistory, in one of several weekly appearances of a random minor character inÂGQuuuuuuX‘s narrative. That’s a list that has included Mosk Han, a Federation scientist who appears in a single late episode of the original to upgrade the Gundam’s response time; and Dren and Denim, Char’s stooges (and most hilariously by absence Gene, a Zaku pilot who’s presence on the mission to scout out the Gundam is apparently thedecisive turning pointofGQuuuuuuX‘s entire timeline). This week we got Gaia and Ortega, two-thirds of the Black Tri-Stars, a trio of Zeon ace pilots best known for one extremely cool attack maneuver that they then proceed to immediately whiff when they try to use it on Amuro more than once. Next week, we’re getting Kycilia Zabi, a member of the fascistic ruling family of Zeon whose main plots in the original show were executing her Nazi-loving brother and then getting gruesomely blown up by a Char bazooka headshot in the series’ closing episode. The vast majority of these characters are not ones you would expect an alternative retelling ofÂGundam‘s primary “Universal Century” timeline to even mention, let alone give prominent plotlines to. And yet, for as incredibly referential and reverential of the originalÂMobile Suit GundamasÂGQuuuuuuXis, its story is not beholden to a cameo fest.GQuuuuuuXnever slams the breaks on its narrative to grab its audience by the shoulders and scream “look! a reference!”, or make awareness of the originalGundamvital knowledge to that narrative’s logic. Anyone watching the series without prior knowledge of a 46 year old anime is still getting a compelling story, one built largely on entirely new characters (or characters like Challia, so drastically re-imagined that they might as well be new). Anyone whodoesknow? Well, they get to delight in whatever Little Guy of the Week will show up next. It makes the fanservice not the point of the series, but a shared language between the creative team and diehard audiences that reminds the latter, every week, that the formeradores all this weird stuffas much as you do. There’s a kind of absurd sincerity toÂGQuuuuuuXin that sense, that invites trust: come along this wild ride with us, the show asks, wherever it takes this remixing ofÂGundam‘s fundamental world. And you kind of want to, because you can tell just bursting from every seam is a creative team that understands all the flavor and minutiae that made that world so compelling in the first place.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Samsung’s latest true wireless earbuds are the Galaxy Buds3 Pro, and they are the brand’s most feature-complete and powerful audio accessory yet. Today, they take on the AirPods Pro andset a new benchmark for premium wireless sound(anda Gizmodo Editor’s Choice). If you were considering buying these flagship earbuds, they are hittingan all-time low price on Amazonat just $189, down from $249 and $10 below even Samsung’s own official storewhere they’re on sale right now at $199. This is the best deal youâll find on the Galaxy Buds3 Pro and it is the perfect moment to upgrade your audio experience. See at Amazon The Galaxy Buds3 Pro are designed for those who look for the best in sound quality and intelligent features.

Inside, the Buds3 Pro are powered by Samsung’s most advanced audio hardware yet: They use a dual amplifier system (a woofer and tweeter that can be controlled independently) which offers a detailed soundstage with deep bass and clear highs. The enhanced two-way speaker system features a planar tweeter (a Galaxy Buds first) which picks up on every detail in your music for a high-resolution audio experience that’s among the best in the business.

That guarantees you get the best audio however you wear them. Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation is fueled by Galaxy AI and intelligently eliminates background noise and lets in helpful sounds (like voices or sirens) when you need to hear them. It’s also intelligent communication: TheBuds3 Pro provide real-time translation for face-to-face conversation and callswhen paired with compatible Samsung devices using Galaxy AI.

    "title": "Kyle Soller Breaks Down Syril’s Biggest Andor Moment Yet",
    "article_text": "OnAndor, few characters havegone on a ride quite likeSyril Karn. Played by actor Kyle Soller, Syrill has seenincredible highs, terrifying lows, and in recent episodes, finds a sort of purpose as a key player inhis girlfriend Dedra Meero’s planto gain Imperial control on Ghorman. That then came to a head in this week’s episodes and, in two new interviews, Soller discussed what it was like to… well… time to dive into spoilers. In this week’s run ofAndorepisodes, Syril found himself in the middle of what would later be called the Ghorman Massacre and finally came face to face with his arch-nemesis, Cassian Andor. The moment did not go well for him, though, as he realized Cassian had no clue who he was. The insignificance of his existence engulfed him, and he was subsequently blown away. RIP Syril. Speaking toVariety, Soller revealed whenAndorcreator Tony Gilroy told him about Syril’s fate. “He didnât tell me until between seasons one and two,” Soller said. “I thought it was a perfect ending for him. It felt like just before something else could happen to Syril, itâs taken away.” “So much had been taken away from him within the last 10 minutes of his life, all these revelations and betrayals coming to light, the veil being lifted from all the truths he held to be right about the Empire and the choices in his life completely crumbling,” he continued. “Instead of having a redemption story, I think it was much stronger and much more real to life. For all of Syrilâs vanity, romanticism, and delusions of grandeur about himself, heâs just another cog in the wheel. Heâs just another casualty of war.” Maybe the most shocking moment is when, after two seasons, Syril finally confronts Cassian himselfâand realizes that while Cassian has been Syril’s obsession for years, Cassian’s line “Who are you?” makes it clear he has no idea who Syril is. Soller discussed the momentwith IGN. âItâs so brutal for Syril to be confronted with his anonymity. He feels like heâs making such a difference, desperate to make change and be recognized and to be somebody and to have actually made a difference on Ghorman,” he said. “In 10 minutes, his whole world is turned upside down. And then he sees [Cassian]âthe physical representation of all of his anger and frustration and worthlessness, and he pours it into him in this fight. And then he just goes, âWho are you?â And heâs killed. Even if he hadnât been blasted, heâs annihilated in that moment.â Interestingly enough, “Who are you?” was not the only line filmed. “There were three or four different things Cassian was going to say, and they finally ended up on ‘Who are you?’ which I think was perfect because that breaks Syril in that moment,” Soller said. “‘Oh, my God. My obsession doesnât even know who I am.’ How gutting is that?” “It was a short list,” he continued, revealing the other lines. “‘You’ and ‘Itâs you’ and ‘Who are you?’ It just completely cuts him in that moment. If Cassian had said ‘Itâs you,’ would Syril have had more resolve to do something or would he still have lowered his gun? I donât know, but in terms of Syrilâs arc, it just perfectly completes the journey being used by powers that are bigger than you in this huge machine and mayhem of life. You think youâve made a difference, but you havenât.” For more from Soller on his character’s hugely impactful demise, head toStar Wars News Net, which broke the interviews down even further.

Amazon has established itself as a smart home leaderwith a large portfolio that includes such big names asEcho,Blink, andRing. The devices made it easier than ever to control and secure your home while integrating with Alexa. Amazon’s desire to dominate the smart home space was evidentwhen it attempted to acquire iRobot, the firm behind Roomba robot vacuums. However, after regulatory setbacks, Amazon withdrew the purchase in January 2024. In any case, Amazon continues to offer some of the lowest prices on smart home products, andtoday’s offer on the iRobot Roomba Combo Essential (Y0140 model) robot vacuum and mopis excellent. Now, this greatiRobot Roomba combo is only $149 which is a massive 46% off its regular price of $274. That’s the all-time lowest price for this model, and it’s great if you’re looking to keep your home clean any time. See at Amazon This Roomba model unites mighty vacuuming and mopping in a single machine witha 4-stage cleaning system that strikes dust and dirt on all types of floors. Its edge-sweeping brush picks up even baseboards and corners spotless.

    "title": "Seattle Worldcon’s Chair Clarifies Use of ChatGPT and Offers Another Apology",
    "article_text": "As sci-fi fans well know by now, it wouldn’t be the Hugo Awards without some spice on the side. In recent years, the esteemed prizeâhanded out annually at the World Science Fiction Society convention, also known as Worldcon, whose members vote on the honoreesâhas weathered its share ofcontroversies, with negative headlines (take your pick:geographical censorship;racism;ties to defense manufacturers;anti-“woke” backlashbefore anti-“woke”was even a thing) sometimes getting more attention than the books and other media the Hugos aim to celebrate. Asio9 previously reported, this year’s flashpoint is the use of ChatGPTâbut fortunately, not in a way that has any impact on the actual Hugo Awards. The Hugo ceremony is just one part of August’s Seattle Worldcon 2025; it’s also a convention that hosts panels featuring authors and other sci-fi and fantasy luminaries. Within the past two weeks, it was discovered that ChatGPT had been used to help vet program participants; three people involved, including two Hugo administrators, resigned as a result, and Seattle Worldcon 2025 chair Kathy Bond issued firsta statementon the issue, followed by a separateapology. However, the issue is still rankling sci-fi and fantasy fans on social media, not to mention would-be Hugos honorees; as blogFile 770reported, author Yoon Ha Lee went so far as to remove his novelMoonstormfrom Hugo consideration (it had been nominated for the Lodestar Award honoring YA works). Yesterday, Bond posteda third messageabout the controversy, with an additional statement from program division head SunnyJim Morgan. Bond’s portion reiterates how ChatGPT was used, with details and specifics. Of particular note, it was not used for “creating the Hugo Award Finalist list or announcement video” or “administering the process for Hugo Award nominations.” She also includes a renewed apology not just about the use of AI, but the way she initially responded to concerns by releasing a “flawed statement” when the issue was first brought to light. She also says that “we are redoing the part of our program process that used ChatGPT, with that work being performed by new volunteers from outside our current team” and pledges that Worldconâwhose staff is all-volunteer, she notesâwill do all it can to regain the community’s trust moving forward. To that end, Morgan’s statement is also both apology and even deeper dive into how ChatGPT was used, including the actual prompt used to vet potential program participants: REQUEST Using the list of names provided, please evaluate each person for scandals. Scandals include but are not limited to homophobia, transphobia, racism, harassment, sexual misconduct, sexism, fraud. Each person is typically an author, editor, performer, artist or similar in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and or related fandoms. The objective is to determine if an individual is unsuitable as a panelist for an event. Please evaluate each person based on their digital footprint, including social, articles, and blogs referencing them. Also include file770.com as a source. Provide sources for any relevant data. Morgan reports that his team “did not simply accept the results that were returned” as a result of ChatGPT’s vetting. “Instead, links to primary content returned during vetting were reviewed by our team and myself before a final decision whether to invite the person was made. Ultimately, this process led to fewer than five people being disqualified from receiving an invitation to participate in the program due to information previously unknown.” Read the full statements from Bond and Morganhere; Bond writes that Seattle Worldcon’s next update will come May 13, so it’ll be interesting to see if there’s more coming on the ChatGPT issue, or if the organizers will be moving forward from this point.

    "title": "U.S. Amps Up Spying on Greenland and Denmark as Trump Covets New Territory",
    "article_text": "U.S. intelligence agencies were ordered last week to focus more attention on spying on Greenland and Denmark, two longtime American allies, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. The order came from two high-ranking officials under Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to the newspaper, as President Donald Trump continues to say he wants to take Greenland one way or another. The spying order, known as a “collection emphasis message,” was sent to the heads of U.S. intelligence agencies instructing the use of surveillance satellites, wiretaps, and spies to gather information in Greenland and Denmark, according to theJournal. The goal is to learn more information about any people who may be sympathetic to Trump’s quest to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. Identifying locals who may like Trump and his particular brand of fascism would presumably allow the U.S. to provide those people with support and boost their message around the world. This kind of strategy was tremendously popular during the Cold War, as the U.S. invested heavily in amplifying anti-Soviet sentiment, sometimes going so far as toinvent fake writersto appear in newspapers. The new instructions to focus on Greenland are classified, according to the Journal, which cites two “people familiar with the matter.” And Tulsi Gabbard, anextremistwho pretends to be an isolationist, focused on the classified nature of the order when responding to the newspaper’s request for comment. âThe Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the President by politicizing and leaking classified information,” Gabbard said. “They are breaking the law and undermining our nationâs security and democracy.â Greenland, an island of just 56,000 people, first became a fixation of Trump’s during his first term as president in 2019 when he reportedly wanted to talk with Denmark about taking over the country. News of Trump’s interest in Greenland leaked to the press, and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she had no interest in talking about it. Trump acted like a petulant child over the matter, as he so often does,canceling a meetingbetween the two world leaders. Trump later tweeted animageof a Trump Tower in Greenland with the message, “I promise not to do this to Greenland!” I promise not to do this to Greenland!pic.twitter.com/03DdyVU6HA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 20, 2019 Trump’s obsession with taking over Greenland came back into full force after he won the 2024 presidential election. JD Vance even traveled to Greenland in March to make an extremelyinsulting speechto American allies, claiming that Denmark hadn’t been a good protector of the island. Trump has repeatedly tried to suggest that America would take better care of Greenland, with a recent New York Times report suggesting the White House may try to float a $10,000annual paymentto all Greenlanders as a form of universal basic income. Trump has also pushed out apropaganda videothat insists it’s part of Greenland’s “destiny” to become part of the United States. But Greenlanders themselves have no interest in becoming part of the U.S., according to opinion polls. Eighty-five percent of Greenlanders don’t want to join the U.S., with just 6% in favor and 9% undecided, according to theGuardian. Trump’s latest propaganda video on Truth Social is about Greenland. “This is not just history, it is destiny. Now is the time to stand together again. For peace, for security, for the future. America stands with Greenland.” [image or embed] â Matt Novak (@paleofuture.bsky.social)March 28, 2025 at 12:00 PM Trump has previously said that he thinks he can convince the people of Greenland that it’s a good deal for the country to be conquered by the U.S., and this new spying effort seems like it will be part of a propaganda push just over the horizon. Trump was asked during an interview on Meet the Press this past Sunday whether he would rule out using force against Greenland. âI donât rule it out,â Trump toldNBC News. âI donât say Iâm going to do it, but I donât rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which weâll take care of, and weâll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.â Even if Trump doesn’t get buy-in, it seems likely he’ll try to make a play for the island in some fashion before he leaves office. And it’s not like he’s hiding his goals. The president has been consistent in saying that he’s going to have Greenland eventually. “We need Greenland for national security and even international security, and weâre working with everybody involved to try and get it,â Trump said in March whilespeaking to Congressfor the entire world to hear. âOne way or the other, weâre going to get it.â denmarkDonald TrumpgreenlandMette Frederiksen Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "NOAA Warns of Attacks on Radar Systems by Militia That Thinks They Are ‘Weather Weapons’",
    "article_text": "Bad news for weather agencies around the nation: there is a shit storm brewing in the minds of the most conspiracy-addled people you know, and their offices are right in the path. According to an internal memo sent by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) security office on Monday, an anti-government militia group has declared Doppler radar systems to be “weather weapons” and is threatening to attack them,CNN reported. The group responsible for the attack warning that impacts National Weather Service (NWS) locations across the country isVeterans on Patrol,an anti-government, anti-immigration, Christian nationalist organization founded in 2015. They have apparently been encroaching upon NWS offices, both physically and virtually, in recent weeks, and the situation has gotten concerning enough for NOAA to put its network on notice. âThis group is advocating for anyone and everyone to join them in conducting penetration drills on NEXRAD sites to identify weaknesses which can be used to ultimately destroy the sites,â the agency’s email said,per CNN. NEXRAD refers toNext Generation Weather Radar, NOAA’s network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars that are operated jointly by NWS, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the US Air Force. Despite the name and the newfound interest being taken by the militia group, NEXRAD is not new. It’s been in place since the 1990s, and is a key technology for predicting tornadoes and thunderstorms. Just what Veterans On Patrol believes is going on with NEXRAD radar systems is unclear, but the group has had an obsession with weather for a while. The Substack Cops & Congress, run by independent journalist Annie Dance,reportedlast year that VOP leader Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer claimed Hurricane Helene, the storm that battered North Carolina as well as parts of Florida and Georgia last year, was created by a âweather weaponâ and was part of the US military’s attempts to kill U.S. citizens with âdirected energy weapons.â He reportedly tampered with cell towers in the area to prevent “military deployments against Mankind.” The Washington Postreportedthat Meyer and his crew traveled to North Carolina after the storm supposedly to help the community rebuild, but in reality seemed to use the opportunity to gain a foothold in the community and further their anti-government agenda, threatening members of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and preventing other aid from reaching the area. There is never a great time for essential government infrastructure to be under attack by conspiracy-pilled militia groups, but now is a particularly bad moment for it.NWS is already short-staffedthanks to cuts made by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, including currently having at least 90 vacancies for technicians who work on radar systems. Now they are being spread even more thin as the agency takes precautions to protect itself and its employees, who will have to travel in pairs or groups when working at remote sites for their own safety,per CNN. militiaNational Weather ServiceNOAAWeather Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Weather balloon operations will stop or be reduced at 11 locations across the country due to staffing shortages caused by recent NOAA layoffs. After mass layoffs at NOAA, meteorologist Andrew Hazelton finds himself in a bureaucratic no manâs landâfired, then reinstated, but still unable to work. About 10% of the NOAA workforce was laid off, according to some reports, in a move that could kneecap the agency's ability to forecast local and national weather events. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts has debuted its own forecast AI model on the heels of a cutting-edge Google model released in December. Storm warnings are in effect in the Plains, the Midwest, the Great Lakes, and the mid-Atlantic through tonight. Moisture sweeping down the coast will drench much of California, including areas that burned severely just a month ago.

    "title": "Humans Have Never Seen 99.999% of the Seafloor, Study Finds, as Trump Greenlights Deep-Sea Mining",
    "article_text": "Weâve got better visuals of Mars than we do of our own ocean floorâand by a much larger margin than youâd think. A newstudyin Science Advances crunched the numbers from 43,681 deep-sea dives conducted since 1958 and comes to a mind-blowing conclusion: weâve visually observed just 0.001% of the deep seafloor. Thatâs an area just slightly larger than Rhode Islandâor about a tenth the size of Belgiumâacrossabout 70%of the planet. The average depth of the ocean is 12,080 feet (3,682 meters), making it impossible to visually observe unless you’re Aquaman or have a deep-sea submersible. As of June 2024, 26.1% of the global seafloor has been mapped,according to NOAA, though visual observation is a tougher nut to crack. “This small and biased sample is problematic when attempting to characterize, understand, and manage a global ocean,” said Susan Poulton, a researcher at the Ocean Discovery League and co-author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo. Scientists estimate that two-thirds of the 700,000 to 1,000,000 species in the ocean (excluding microorganisms) have yet to be discovered or officially described,according to NOAA, making the vast amount of unexplored seafloor a remarkable venue for new research. Making matters worse, nearly two-thirds of all visual seafloor observations have taken place within 200 nautical miles of just three nations: the U.S., Japan, and New Zealand. Almost every single deep-sea dive has been carried out by institutions from just five countries: those just mentioned, plus France and Germany. “Imagine trying to tell the story of critical environments like the African savanna or the Amazon rainforest using only satellite imagery and DNA samples without ever seeing what lived there,” Poulton said. “It wouldnât paint a very complete picture.” Furthermore, the study found a heavy bias in sampling toward shallow waters (less than 6,562 feet deep, or 2,000 meters), even though nearly three-quarters of the seafloor lies deeper. Features like canyons and escarpmentsâand specific ones, at thatâget all the love, while vast regions of undersea ridges and plains remain essentially overlooked. We owe it to ourselves to better understand these vast sweeps of the deep sea, the research team posits. They’re not wrong. The deep ocean plays a crucial role in everything from climate regulation to the production of oxygen and medicine, yet our visual assessment of it is a very slim slice of the pie. We’re missing a huge amount of information about not just the creatures that inhabit these zones, but the way these zones contribute to Earth’s global processes. Some thorough deep-sea research was born out of commercial interests, including research into the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a region of deep sea mining interest. That’s led to the discovery of hundreds of new species and even hints atnew mechanisms of oxygen production, which we mightâve missed entirely if companies hadnât been eyeing the area for minerals. The team’s findings come on the heels of the Trump AdministrationÂfast-tracking deep-sea mining, which could imperil species that inhabit the seafloor and midwater ecosystems. In the past six months, two research teams foundÂevidenceÂ of creatures thrivingÂunderneath the seafloor, pushing the boundaries of where we know life to exist. Deep-sea mining will probe these disproportionately understudied reaches of the planet, potentially endangering species before science even has the opportunity to identify them. If we want a representative picture of Earthâs largest and least-understood biome, weâll need more nations, more institutions, and more tools to take the plunge, the study argues. At our current rate, by the team’s calculations it would take more than 100,000 years to visually explore the deep seafloor, leading the team to call for a “fundamental change in how we explore and study the global deep ocean,” as noted in an AAASpress release. For now, weâre making global ocean policy, climate decisions, and biodiversity assessments with a shockingly small sample size. It would be in the interest of scienceâand the thrill of discovery itselfâto innovate and scale how we explore the most inaccessible reaches of our world. deep sea miningdivingmappingoceansSurveys Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Andor‘s Finest Hours Just Delivered a Huge Gut Punch",
    "article_text": "What it takes to sustain a rebellion is brought into question in this week’s episode arc ofAndor, which covers what happens two years before the main events ofRogue One: A Star Wars Storyand the originalStar Warssaga. Thematically it’s time for the rebels to figure out if they want to just fight or actually win, as tensions come to a head onGhormanin what’s probably the most gut-wrenching watch of the series, and perhaps evenStar Warsas a whole. Having this be the episodic story that dropped onRevenge of the (May) Sixthmade it extra powerful and a transmitted a timeless message of resistance when needed most. Ghorman is collapsing. Cassian (Diego Luna) and Wil (Muhannad Bhaier) are sent there to finally take out Dedra Mero (Denise Gough) as the front is pushing for action against the Imperial siege. They realize that in this moment they are not in alignment: Wil thinks it’s time to fight, and Cassian asserts that just fighting won’t secure a victory sooner if they’re not ready. The rebellion on Yavin is getting there but it’s not quite ready; however, they see tensions mount on Palmo Plaza with the Ghorman front knowing the time for peace is over as mining equipment arrives on the planet. Cassian understands that Luthen’s (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) agenda here is at work with Ghorman being poised to “burn brightly,” and that taking out Dedra is to seal her death in its aftermath to prevent her from continuing her search for him as Axis. Wil is driven to help because she’s responsible for the death of their loved ones on Ferrix. She’s just been Luthen’s persistent threat as he orchestrates the rebellion. Mon Mothma’s increased surveillance for her opposition to the Emperor has iced her out of support. People across the Senate representing their populaces are afraid as they’ve seen what’s been happening to the Ghormans. It’s simply become untenable, whether or not they agree with the Imperial narrative that the Ghor have been acting out of character as savage opponents to the Imperial presence for the once-rich metropolis of fashion houses. Everyone is afraid to catch the interest of the Empire and are too scared to speak up against the clear propaganda out of the civil unrest on Palmo. Mon knows that her purpose is changing and Genevieve O’Reilly’s performance masterfully captures that shift; her people are no longer on Coruscant and are waiting for her on Yavin. And yet as Mon is still respected, she begins to ponder what to do with her last shred of dignified reputation in the Senate. Before Cassian leaves to join the Ghorman Front and take out Dedra, he and Bix enjoy the quiet life on Yavin. Seeing Diego Luna and Adria Arjona imbue their rebel couple with moments that make what they’re fighting for all the more real and pressing gives the survivors of the Imperial colonization multitudes. There’s joy throughout the “flight or fight” life that makes it all worthwhile. Seeing that is important and poignant because anyone who is seeking freedom knows what peace can feel like even if it’s fleeting, and as days get harder the hope of it staying is what would keep anyone going. As they get rest Cassian lets Bix talk him into seeing a Force healer for an injury. Pretty much until now, the Force not been specifically addressed, though you could argue its presence has been felt through the actions of the heroes and villains. The healer, a Saja if I had to guess, tells them that while some people carry their past and burdens, Cassian gathers as he goes as a messenger of purpose. And knowing what we know, it’s so impactful to see Bix come to the realization of Cassian’s destiny before he can. Arjona really says so much without a word in a powerfully stirring performance. Over the course of seasons one and two, Bix has become a steadfast rebel in ways we haven’t gotten to see previously, making a wonderful addition to the heroic women ofStar Wars. There’s another moment between Bix and Vel (Faye Marsay) where they’re concerned about the recklessness of Luthen’s strategies, which resulted in the loss of Cinta for Vel. Seeing them determine that this man might only see them as pawns stands in stark contrast to what Draven (Alistair Petrie) and the Yavin rebels want for them and Andor. On Yavin their roles are essential and filled with responsibility to a larger community that needs their numbers. Like Cassian, they have been courted to evolve into reliable leaders, not just Luthen’s radical operatives. The Yavin rebels, once unorganized survivors on the fringe, have survived the wildness of the planet by realizing that working together is better. They have outgrown Luthen’s extreme methodology. It makes sense they’re wary of unsanctioned activities like Cassian and Wil taking off for more spy missions that could compromise the rebellion as it draws closer to being ready. On Ghorman, Wil and Cassian see how the Empire’s presence has motivated an affluent populace into doing whatever it takes, with Luthen’s influence over Rylanz’s (Richard Sammel) peaceful demonstrations beginning to take hold. It’s the sort of exploitation from the Empire that fed Luthen’s encouragement for them to take up arms. Wil and Andor perhaps begin to realize Luthen could have orchestrated a similar outcome on Ferrix, or got the idea to set a more visible demonstration on Ghorman. By this time Syril (Kyle Soller) has a soft spot for his friends on the Ghorman front and has been attempting to divert the Empire’s attention from his comrades. He’s been seeing the unjust moves against the Ghor firsthand and it’s not what he signed up for. Soller does an incredible job at depicting a man who committed his identity to the Empireâonly to have that deteriorate when he sees that he’s not there to keep the rules from breaking, since the rule makers consistently manipulate them to their liking. This makes him question his loyalty to Dedra as she assures him they’ll be going home soon.Â  Meanwhile, she’s bristling at the green and young Stormtroopers arriving, recognizing the difficulty in controlling them when the time comes to provoke the Ghorman rebels. Rylanz finally figures out Syril’s true reason for being present at the Ghorman front’s meetings. While Syril naively thought he was there to police them, it’s understood he was there to be an informant to keep the Empire up to date on their actions for a more nefarious reason. It was never about wrong or right, it was about working the front into reaching a breaking point that could be used against them. The civil unrest gets pushed over the edge around them as the trap works. Syril feels played by Dedra for being manipulated into treating his friends unjustly. Andor gets a moment with that hotel receptionist who had helped him earlier, who reminds himÂ Â “Rebellions are built on hope.” As the Palmo memorial plaza is under siege, the Ghormans try to reclaim it against Imperial regiments of stormtroopersâa sight that sends Syril over the edge. Syril rushes Dedra inside the ISB building and physically attacks her for what she’s done and for making him complicit. She reveals that it was always in the plans to deliberately trap the Ghormans into having no other choice but to act so they could be violently displaced. He finds out the truth about the kalkite needed for the project he was purposefully left out on by his girlfriend.A shocked Syril tells her good luck, as he seemingly aligns himself with the fate of the people he betrayed.Â Similarly, Cassian realizes Luthen played the Ghormans into walking right into that trap to get the Empire to employ violence and excuse it as a necessary defense. The exact outcome Luthen wanted all along was to show that even the most civilized and rich of places was not safe under the Empire’s rule; they ran a smear campaign for years to get the galactic leadership to turn against them. The casualties mount on Palmo square as Stormtroopers close everyone in. Andor presses on to complete his mission to assassinate Dedra but as he prepares for the shot, Syril sees him and is overtaken by his grief at losing his purpose.Â Thanks to that early in the series run-in with Cassian, which was truly his villain origin story, Syril lost his way. He ultimately decides to save Dedra by tackling Cassian. Violence breaks loose and in that moment, you realize Syril didn’t make a breakthough, he’s still a petulant manchild with a fragile ego who isn’t being redeemed.Cassian and Syril engage in hand to hand combat at the hotel lobby bar, culminating in a powerful moment where Syril has a blaster aimed at Cassian as he asks “Who are you?” It completely deflates Syril, who had made Andor this enemy in his head, when he was just like his Ghorman friends seeking the right to exist. Even as it maybe clicks, Rylanz shoots Syril point blank in the headâhe didn’t overcome his bigotry in time.Â  And Dedra, who can’t find Syril, ultimately breaks down. As the KX units are unleashed, there’s more casualties in the tragic extermination of the Ghorman people. Cassian just wants to get Wil and gets saved from a KX unit they end up running over. His young friend makes the difficult decision to stay behind and asks Cassian to tell their story. He agrees to and takes the KX pieces back with him. Transmissions from the scene go out describing the atrocities being committed as people call out for help as they hide. On Coruscant, the Ghorman ambassador is arrested. Mon Mothma prepares to address the Senate and speak out against Emperor Palpatine because enough is enough. Bail Organa agrees to support her by making a speech against the Emperor at his own risk. Cassian returns, and Kleya assigns him with extracting Mon from the Senate after her speech in case immediate retaliation is planned. Andor agrees but lets her know he’sdoneafter that, and Kleya essentially says, “Yeah, sure.” He’s provided a cover as a journalist and heads to Coruscant. Mon discovers she’s been bugged as her time is running out. She also finds out her own assistant has been planted by Luthen, leaving her feeling alone and isolated. She has no one on Coruscant anymore and her family has distanced themselves. All she has left is the family of rebels waiting for her on Yavin. When Mon delivers the speech it’s masterfully glorious; all props toAndorcreator Tony Gilroy. O’Reilly shines as the rebel leader ascendant and she utterly decimates Palpatine’s narrative and pins the Empire as behind behind the Ghormsn provocation to suit their nefarious end. “The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil” she says to the Senate as she calls Palpatine the monster who will come for them all. The ISB try to lock down the building to get Mon as their agent is taken out by Andor. Her driver calls it in as he works for ISB too. Andor gets her out and kills for her; she’s shocked, but hey that’s the price of being in the rebellion now. The edge of your seat action is one of the most thrilling and satisfying sequences in all of recentStar Wars. Quickly Mon and Andor bond over not trusting Luthen anymore and get on the same page. Mon trusts Andor and the risks he takes to get her out safe. This perfectly begins to set up their relationship inRogue One. He delivers her to Kleya who informs him that she’ll be escorted by Yavin’s Gold Squadron and will make a speech upon arrival. Fans ofStar Wars: Rebelsknow that her ship gets intercepted and theGhostcrew step in to help her get to the rebel base safely. It’s not an obvious call out but nice to have it be canonized. Mon doesn’t know how to thank Cassian and he tells her “Make it worth it.” Andor focuses on getting Wil to Yavin for help after Kleya delivers his friend to Coruscant injured but on the mend. Upon arrival Andor gives Draven the KX pieces and lets him know he’s not running missions for Luthen anymore. Andor and Bix reunite and he reiterates that he’s done. He’s done what he can, he’s done a lot, and he just wants a life with her. She listens as he explains that wants to find someplace quiet. “The only special thing about me is luck,” he says, and he feels he’s over played his hand. He wakes up the next morning and she’s gone. She leaves him a message that delivers him to his destiny to winâwith the promise to find him when he fulfills his purpose in choosing the rebellion. Captain Andor rises and K2-SO wakes up.

    "title": "Pentagon’s Hypersonic Drone Hits Mach 5 in Record-Breaking Tests",
    "article_text": "A California-based startup pulled off two hypersonic flights of its reusable aircraft, which became the first fully autonomous drone to reach Mach 5 speeds. Stratolaunchâs Talon-A2 completed a series of test flights for the Pentagonâs Missile Defense Agency, part of a hypersonic testbed program that echoes Cold War-era efforts like the X-15, which retired in 1968. The hypersonic vehicle exceeded Mach 5 speeds during the tests that took place in December 2024 and March 2025, Stratolaunchrevealedthis week. “Weâve now demonstrated hypersonic speed, added the complexity of a full runway landing with prompt payload recovery, and proven reusability,”Â  Zachary Krevor, president and CEO of Stratolaunch, said in a statement. The Talon-A prototype is an autonomous, reusable aircraft capable of flying at least five times the speed of sound. During its test flights, Rocâthe largest airplane ever builtâreleased the vehicle over the Pacific Ocean. Stratolaunch’s Roc took off with Talon-A1 tucked in its belly before the hypersonic vehicle conducted its own flight and landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base. When it was founded in 2011, Stratolaunch intended to use Roc to launch Orbital ATK’s Pegasus XL rocket into space. Following its founder Paul Allenâs death in 2018, the company switched gears to focusing on developing, deploying, and flying hypersonic vehicles instead. In December 2021, Stratolaunchannounceda contract with the Pentagonâs Missile Defense Agency to provide a testbed for developing defense strategies against hypersonic threats. In March 2024,Talon-A1 launched for its first powered test flight, reaching hypersonic speeds that didn’t quite make it to Mach 5. Unlike Talon-A1, Stratolaunch’s latest prototype, Talon-A2 is fully reusable. The company is developing future versions of the Talon-A, which will be rocket-powered and capable of carrying customizable payloads at hypersonic speeds. Stratolaunch is also working on a larger hypersonic vehicle, dubbed Talon-Z, and a spaceplane nicknamed Black Ice, that would carry payloadsâand possibly passengersâto Earth orbit. Talon-A2’s recent flights mark the first hypersonic flights since the X-15 program conducted by the U.S. Air Force and NASA. The X-15 hypersonic aircraft were air-launched from a B-52 aircraft, and flew a total of 199 times over the span of 10 years. The program ended in the late 1960s due to a lack of funding and a shift of focus toward orbital missions. The Department of Defense has shown a renewed interest in hypersonic vehicles as other nations like China and Russia are working on developing their own. The U.S. has never operated a reusable hypersonic vehicle, a capability that could significantly reduce costs. “Demonstrating the reuse of fully recoverable hypersonic test vehicles is an important milestone for MACH-TB,” George Rumford, director of the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center, said in a statement. “Lessons learned from this test campaign will help us reduce vehicle turnaround time from months down to weeks.” Aircraftstratolaunch Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The six-rotor aircraft passed a cool milestone, but weâre still waiting to see if these sky Ubers ever actually lift off commercially. The SuperScooper Quebec 1 has been grounded from the damage. Colorado-based Wilson Aerospace says Boeing abruptly severed communications after it developed hardware for the NASA contractor. The Matrice 350 RTK is available starting today, but if you have to ask the price, you probably can't afford it. The gigantic  Roc  carrier aircraft released TA-0, an expendable prototype of the Talon-A hypersonic aircraft the company is seeking to build. Eve Air Mobility says it has completed testing its eVTOL in wind tunnel trials, claims the sci-fi vehicles will enter service in 2026.

    "article_text": "Even thoughwe hear about them all the time, Disney only has theme parks in six locations: Anaheim, Orlando, Paris,Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Theydon’t pop up everywhereor without some very careful thought. So anytime a new one is announced, it’s pretty big news, and Disney just announced a new theme park is coming to a seventh location: Abu Dhabi. In conjunction with Miral, Disney will open its latest location on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It will “combine Disneyâs iconic stories, characters and attractions with Abu Dhabiâs vibrant culture, stunning shorelines, and breathtaking architecture,” according to the press release. Miral will build the park with help and direction from Disney Imagineering. âThis is a thrilling moment for our company as we announce plans to build an exciting Disney theme park resort in Abu Dhabi, whose culture is rich with an appreciation of the arts and creativity,â Disney CEO Bob Iger said. âAs our seventh theme park destination, it will rise from this land in spectacular fashion, blending contemporary architecture with cutting-edge technology to offer guests deeply immersive entertainment experiences in unique and modern ways.” “Disneyland Abu Dhabi will be authentically Disney and distinctly Emiratiâan oasis of extraordinary Disney entertainment at this crossroads of the world that will bring to life our timeless characters and stories in many new ways and will become a source of joy and inspiration for the people of this vast region to enjoy for generations to come.â We don’t specifically know what any of that means in terms of attractions or the look of the park, but this announcement video does potentially offer a few hints. There’s a lot of footage in there, much of which is from rides or lands from other parks, such as theZootopiaone in Shanghai. ThatAvatar: Flight of Passage-type ride, but forThe Lion King, is in line with recent news on Disneyland Paris, etc. But when it talks about the park being the most advanced ever, and you see speeding cars and beachfront property, the possibilities are endless:Tron, Moana, Lilo & Stitch, Cars, etc. And is it really going to go with that almostFrozen-esque castle? That is pretty cool. There’s no word on an expected completion date, but these things take time so we imagine this is something we won’t see until the 2030s. But, as news breaks, we’ll let you know.

    "title": "Spanish TV news uses Dark Souls 3 boss fight to illustrate, with 100% accuracy, how the conclave will elect a new Pope",
    "article_text": "This is truly the Dark Souls of old guys voting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I consider myself an expert in the process of electing a new Pope. I am not Catholic, but I did happen to watch the 2024 film Conclave all of a month before the death of Pope Francis on April 21, and see no reason to doubt its complete and total accuracy. So you can trust me when I say that a key step for the conclave of cardinals now convened in the Vatican is defeating Pontiff Sulyvahn, the self-declared ruler of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, who awaits all challengers who enter his cathedral with the Profaned Ultra Greatsword in hand. Spanish television channel Cuatro can absolutely back me up on these papal facts. On Monday, the stationaired a segmenton the contest to succeed Pope Francis and illustrated it with a clip from Dark Souls 3. A player decked out in the game's unmistakably Pope-esque Archdeacon armor faces off against Pontiff Sulyvahn while the presenter adds, uh, let's call it \"context.\" \"The prediction markets are going viral these days in Italy. If we were to imagine a conclave with a videogame aesthetic, it could be this battle for the throne of St. Peter,\" she says (via Google Translate) as the player knocks Pontiff Sulyvahn out of the air with a well-timed fireball. The broadcast then cuts to what looks like a football team formation of cartoonish clipart versions of cardinals, including viral favorite Pierbattista Pizzaballa in the center, while she riffs on the idea ofPapal Fantasy Football. I get the sense Cuatro may not be the most serious news channel in Spain, but clearly everyone's having some fun betting on who's going to be the next Pope. The only issue I take with Cuatro's conclave reporting here is the reporter's use of the word \"imagine.\" Again, as an authority on this subject based on the two hour film I watched one month ago, I can assure you that defeating a Dark Souls 3 boss isabsolutely a real requirement to becoming the next Pope. Francis famously used a perfectly timed parry-into-riposte against Sulyvahn to deliver the coup de grâce. Look it up! These are simply Pope Facts. Francis even used a rapier to exploit Sulyvahn's weakness to thrusting damage;thatis how you demonstrate the wisdom required to become Pope. If Pizzaballa or any other cardinal wishes to claim the top spot, they better be prepared for the foe who awaits them in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. They wouldn't put it on TV if it weren't real!

    "title": "EA thinks it got Battlefield right this time, projecting confidence to investors in advance of a summer reveal: 'When we get it right, Battlefield is a giant franchise and often the biggest shooter in the year'",
    "article_text": "The new Battlefield is being tested by thousands of players, and more will be let in soon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After the unhappy reception forBattlefield 2042, EA went all in on player feedback, methodically addressing complaints and promising that the next Battlefield game will center the opinions of fans from the start, with what EA CEO Andrew Wilson calls \"the biggest playtesting initiative in franchise history.\" Wilson has been talking up Battlefield 6 (or whatever the new game ends up being called) to investors for a while now, and in this week's quarterly address he reported that a \"core group\" of playtesters have already played thousands of hours of the game. The CEO reiterated his usual talking points during the call: This is the \"biggest Battlefield\" yet, with \"the biggest team behind it\" yet, and EA has learned its lesson from Battlefield 2042. \"We've always worked closely with the community, but we haven't always worked as closely as we should have,\" he said during the Q&A portion of the call. \"We haven't always really worked to help them understand the things that we're building and for us to understand the things that they really want out of a Battlefield. \"We know that when we get it right, Battlefield is a giant franchise and often the biggest shooter in the year. And so this time, we wanted to ensure that, one, our player base and our global community had a better understanding of the things that we were building and how we were building and some of the approaches that we're taking to building, but more importantly, we wanted them to have the ability to feed back on map construction, weapon lineup, progression, all of the things that make Battlefield great at Battlefield scale.\" Wilson also acknowledged that hewouldsay that everything is going great, but even so, I can't say I'm not curious about what makes this Battlefield so \"big.\" The word probably doesn't refer to map size or player count, since Battlefield 2042's 128-player maps weren't received all that well. It may just mean that they've spent a lot of money on it, which they clearly have. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is the first Battlefield produced with Infinity Ward and Respawn co-founder Vince Zampella in charge of the series, and a bunch of studios are involved aside from series progenitor DICE. Ripple Effect, which made the cool Portal custom servers mode for Battlefield 2042, is \"working on a new Battlefield experience.\" Motive, the studio behind the Dead Space remake and Star Wars: Squadrons, is working on singleplayer. Need for Speed studio Criteorion is working on Battlefield, too, as well as another \"Central Tech Team.\" Fellow PC Gamer Battlefield-liker Morgan Park and I have a running joke about new Battlefield games, which is that the newest Battlefield is always the worst Battlefield ever, but only until the next one comes out, at which point it becomes the best Battlefield ever, and everyone wonders how EA could've been so foolish as to change direction. Will the new Battlefield break the cycle? It's hard to imagine a lot of people going to bat for Battlefield 2042 given how acidic the initial response was, but it is funny to notice Delta Force, a free-to-play shooter thatcribs quite a bit from Battlefield 2042, doing brilliantly on Steam today. EA will now open up itsBattlefield Labstesting program to even more players as it heads into a summer reveal. So far,a 10 second clipin the Battlefield Labs announcement video is all we've seen of the game, at least officially—you can find supposed leaked footage with a quick search, and, yep, it looks like a Battlefield game. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

    "title": "FTC loses bid to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which already happened in 2023",
    "article_text": "It's not technically over, but yeah, it's over. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. More than a year after Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of videogame behemothActivisionBlizzard wassuccessfully completed, the US Federal Trade Commission's effort to block it has run aground. A federal appeals court has rejected the FTC's appeal of a ruling that denied its request for a preliminary injunction against the deal, saying the lower court applied the \"correct legal standard\" and that the FTC has not demonstrated that it was likely to win its case. If this all seems a bit of a \"delayed reaction,\" well, you're not wrong, but such is the way the system works. The short version is that as part of its battle against the acquisition, the FTC requested a preliminary injunction against it in June 2023, which would put the deal on hold until the FTC's entire case was heard, ruled on, and then appealed to whatever extent possible—a process that would not likely be wrapped up in short order. The courtdenied the request, however, which effectively meant the deal could move ahead even though the FTC was still pursuing its case against it. And move ahead it did: A few months later, Microsoft convinced the UK's Competition and Market Authority that the acquisition was a good idea and then immediately mashed the big red button, officially making Activision Blizzard a Microsoft company. That didn't bring an end to the FTC's appeal, though, and it remained active until today's ruling, which declared that the lower court got it right when it rejected the request for a preliminary injunction blocking the deal. Technically, at least, this does not actually signal the end of the matter. The full ruling, available fromThe Verge, notes that \"the merger is the subject of an administrative proceeding that remains pending before the FTC.\" Given the repeat losses in its request for a preliminary injunction, though, not to mention the fact that the deal is already done, I suspect the FTC will ultimately content itself with an \"I warned you, bro,\" and move on to other things. Microsoft declined to comment on the ruling, while the FTC is thus far just ignoring me outright. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Confusion reigns as report of an A24 Elden Ring movie emerges, disappears, and emerges again",
    "article_text": "Is there anything here, or are we all tarnishing our reputations? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hoo, boy. Alright, let's see here. Yesterday, an otherwise unremarkable Tuesday rapidly became confusing forElden Ring-heads and people looking at particular corners of the internet when Nexus Point News, an entertainment news site, published an article claiming that Annihilation and Civil War director Alex Garland is set to direct an Elden Ring film adaptation for production company A24. Though it probably goes without saying, the story seemed peculiar—and not just because Nexus Point News isn't exactly a household name in entertainment coverage. Less than an hour after the story was published, Nexus Point News retracted the report. The story, which is still readable through theWayback Machine, said that \"Elden Ring is expected to be Garland’s next film and is expected to begin shooting in 2026.\" During its brief lifespan, the story had been shared on ResetEra in anow-closed thread, earning immediate and understandable replies of \"What.\" It was then boosted by a tweet from well-known videogame news and deal aggregatorWario64, whose 1.1 million X followers accelerated its exposure with the intensity of a deeply confused centrifuge. While that tweet's also been deleted, it was like a flashbang exploding in thousands of minds at once: Were we supposed to look into this at all, or collectively agree that it was a very strange dream? For our part, we reached out to A24 for a statement and didn't receive an official response. We also contacted Nexus Point, who said \"I am sorry, we can't comment on this at the moment.\" Things took an interesting turn, however, when we also reached out to a Bandai Namco PR representative, who replied with \"This was a fun thing to land to after my PAX flight!\" and nothing else. Not a confirmation, but notnota confirmation. The plot thickens! I think! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. An additional wrinkle occurred this morning when Jeff Sneider, a self-described \"Hollywood rule breaker\" with aseemingly mixed hit rateon entertainment leaks,tweetedthat \"Alex Garland IS in negotiations to direct Elden Ring for A24.\" So where does that leave us? According to80 Level, Nexus Point might deserve more credibility than it received. In September, Nexus Pointbroke newsthat Luca Guadagnino and Justin Kuritzkes were working on thenow-cancelledSgt. Rock adaptation. Guadagnino previously directed the A24 film Queer, giving some indication that Nexus Pointmight,in fact, have a connection to a source at the studio—but at this point, we're stacking speculation on speculation. It is worth noting, however, that Garland is a self-reported Elden Ring sicko. Last month, Garland said ina Reddit AMAfor A24's upcoming movie Warfare that he was currently playing Elden Ring on NG+6, which—I'll be honest—scares me. If A24waspursuing an Elden Ring movie, it's got an obvious director pick on deck. And after the 2023 announcement of its partnership with Kojima Productions on aDeath Stranding adaptation, it wouldn't be the studio's first foray into a videogame setting. Still, until an official confirmation, best to continue prescribing yourself some healthy grains of salt. I have to wonder though: What would the plot of an Elden Ring movie even be when it communicates most of its fiction through item descriptions? Maybe a Marika-focused prequel, or a Ken Burns-style documentary of the war between Radahn and Malenia. A Boc biopic, perhaps? That'd be nice.

    "title": "Props for the honesty: Tim Sweeney says the reason 'people characterize the Epic Games launcher as clunky' is—wait for it—'because the Epic Games launcher is clunky'",
    "article_text": "The Epic boss recently shared his thoughts in a lengthy interview with Lex Fridman. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 'The Epic Games Store launcher sucks less than it used to' is not very high praise but it's about as far as I'm willing to go. It has improved, undeniably, but it's still painfully slow, awkward, and just not pleasant to use—not to the point that I refuse to use it, but if I have a choice between Steam and Epic, all else being equal I'm going with Steam. My PR pals at Epic may not be super-happy to hear me say that out loud, but I'm not the only one who feels that way: Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney thinks so too. \"One of the reasons that people characterize the Epic Games launcher as clunky is because the Epic Games launcher is clunky,\" Sweeney said during a recent interview withLex Fridman. \"We need to improve this.\" \"We've not put enough emphasis on the quality of life features. We've recognized this very clearly multiple times and we've gone through multiple refactorings. But you know, that's definitely been a disappointment to us and to a lot of users.\" It has indeed been disappointing: In our 2024 comparison of the manylaunchers available for PC, Epic scored a miserable 41%—better than the Microsoft Store, EA, and Battlenet, to be fair, but still a far cry from Steam, GOG Galaxy, and even Itch.io. One of the challenges facing Epic, according to Sweeney, is that its launcher's problems aren't \"uniform,\" but can vary dramatically depending on the user's distance to a CDN (content delivery network) and the size of their collection. Speaking from experience, that rings true: I have no idea where my neighborhood CDN is but I do have pretty crappy internet, and loading up any kind of sizable Epic library is an exercise in frustration—especially when compared to Steam, which flows like water by comparison. Comparisons with Steam also came up in the interview, naturally: Sweeney reiterated his long-held position that the Epic launcher shouldn't adopt all the features offered by Steam, but said he does want \"all of the convenience features that makes it as easy and fun to use as Steam.\" He also predicted—boldly, I would say—that in the long run, \"the benefits of the Epic Games approach are going to outweigh the benefits of this Steam approach, especially as gaming becomes multi-platform.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Your game vastly benefits by connecting all of its players together and not segregating them off into different online platform populations and so on,\" Sweeney said. \"I think the future trend is in that direction. I wish Valve had opened up Steamworks to just work on all platforms. They could have easily done it, we did it, but they seem to be using it as a lever to keep people locked into the Steam PC game store.\" Sweeney also took a moment to call out \"a very toxic group of Steam users\" who engage in \"harassment campaigns\" against developers who use Epic Online Services. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, for instance, suffered a spate ofearly negative reviewson Steam because it automatically installed Epic Online Services along with the rest of the game in order to enable crossplay and synchronized friends lists. \"Developers do that so they can connect their players across platforms and have friends across platforms and voices across platforms,\" Sweeney said. \"But, you know, suddenly that's trying to be turned into a negative.\" Whether Sweeney's prediction that Epic will ultimately outlast Steam (or, I suppose, that he'll one day convince Gabe and company to open their walled garden) remains to be seen. For now, though, I think we can all agree that he's right that we're right about the Epic launcher: It is definitely clunky. Fortunately, if you're one of the Epic users struggling with it, there are options: GOG Galaxy will do the job, and for something more purpose-built,Heroic\"is miles better at being the Epic Games Launcher than the Epic Games Launcher,\" according to PC Gamer dot com.

    "title": "The latest GTA 6 trailer confirmed its most exciting feature: A bunch of logos for pretend companies",
    "article_text": "That's the stuff. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After the release of yesterday'sGTA 6 trailer, I became someone I've never been before. I was feverish, hungry—I was ticking through the footage frame by frame, drinking in as much detail as possible. Unlike the countless frenzied YouTubers and Reddit theorycrafters, however, I wasn't trying to divine anything about GTA 6's story or gameplay. I was answering a higher calling, pursuing a greater aesthetic purpose. I was looking at all the fake logos, because I think they're neat. This isn't a bit. I've always been fascinated with minute environmental details. For years I've had a regular practice of firing up empty private lobbies just so I could comb Halo and Call of Duty maps for the small creative decisions environmental artists might've made that are easy to miss when you're actively being murdered. When you focus so closely on those granular choices—the placement of furniture nobody will ever sit in, the arrangement of bookshelves that'll become a mess as soon as the first grenade goes off—you can appreciate the artistry in crafting a digital environment. And there's no granular detail I love like some good fictional branding. The only good brand is a fake one. I'm a sicko for logos for pretend companies, seals for governmental organizations that don't exist, and packaging for imaginary snack products. There's a beauty to me in the knowledge that the Destiny 2 artists who crafted the look for the Tex Mechanica gun foundry had to think through what brand identity would make sense for space cowboy guns in a world where it's been thousands of years since anyone's actually known what a cowboy was. Fictional branding is the kind of hyperspecific consideration that helps a space and setting feel unique—and makes it sting when someoneshoves a Darth Vader costumein there. In a game with a production budget like GTA 6, though, that artistic appreciation gives way to an almost existential awe. I'm fascinated by its density of fake beer brand signage and perfectly crappy billboard ads in the same way I'm fascinated by James Cameron making one of the best-selling movies of all time just because he really wanted to look at the Titanic. It's arresting. It's uncanny. It's an obsessive aesthetic emanation of money moving around at an unfathomable scale. The new GTA 6 trailer first sent me into weirdo mode about 43 seconds in. As Jason walks through a convenience store with a six pack of Patriot beer, it wasn't the packaged bundles of Zesta brand soda or the abused Leonida lottery kiosk that grabbed my attention. It wasn't even the bodega cat on the right. It was the door. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As someone enters the store, the glass door swings inward, revealing a set of pretend stickers showing the pretend logos of the four pretend credit card brands the pretend gas station accepts. Nearby, another sticker shows GTA's own spin on a tap-to-pay symbol. And for good measure, there's an ad for Redwood cigarettes, and the obligatory disclaimer that the store IDs for every alcohol purchase. That's more than a half-dozen bespoke bits of branding and signage on a visual space that the majority of players will, at most, glance at momentarily. Somebody had to design those. Somebody else had to approve them. And every moment it took was money that was deemed necessary and appropriate and important to spend. The trailer's two minutes and 46 seconds are stuffed with fictional marina t-shirts, fictional fridge magnets, fictional bumper stickers. When we see a harborside bar at 1:30, I made a sound with my real human mouth that was somewhere between delighted and scandalized. It's draped with pennants, neon logos, vintage wooden signage, state license plates, snack bags, booze bottles, beer cans. Does it suck that some of those beers are named \"Piswasser\" and \"Pindayho\"? Yes, but I'm mesmerized nonetheless. I'm sure GTA 6 will play pretty good. I bet the cars will be fast and the crime will be fun. But I want to look at the bar—to see what's produced when someone's allowed to spend an unprecedented fortune to create a completely imaginary bar that's like a normal bar, but maybe a little sillier.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered mod finally fixes the loot levelling, so no longer do you need to complete quests then wait forever to hand them in",
    "article_text": "\"No more worrying about what level you should or shouldn't complete certain quests at!\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As well as the enormous visual glow-up, Oblivion Remastered went out of its way to tweak elements of the original game that were just a little annoying. So you don't have to grind minor skills anymore in order to level efficiently, and praise the Nine can now actually run through this vast open world. But one crime remained: levelled loot. Levelled loot has always been a pain for Oblivion players, who over the years have come up with various ways to mitigate this element of the game. The long and short is that Oblivion made certain non-random drops, usually quest rewards, into a levelled version of that item that roughly aligned to your character's level. Which would be all well and good, except the gear then stays at that level: So pick up Chillrend at a low level, for example, and you've just ensured that one of the game's best weapons will now be useless once you've levelled up further. Some mods fix this by simply making every itemthe best possible version it can be, but modder TheOneTrueRy now offers a slightly more elegant solution. TheAuto Upgrade Levelled Itemsmod is one of those that does what it says on the tin. The description says it \"automatically replaces leveled unique items obtained as quest rewards with a version fitting for your level as your character progresses. No more worrying about what level you should or shouldn't complete certain quests at!\" TheOneTrueRy clearly felt that he was doing god's work (not Todd's work) after \"a 10 hour long hyperfixation where I forgot to eat or sleep\" and instead got deep in the guts of Oblivion's tools and scripting. The result now happily means that \"the days of waiting tens of levels to tell Farmer Odiil that you actually saved his farm and both his sons years ago so you can get the strongest version of Chillrend are now overrrrrrrrr!\" The mod comes in three different flavours that will automatically upgrade the items in slightly different ways, such as a variant where you cast your own spell to trigger the upgrades. The mod covers over 100 different levelled items and two levelled spells across the base game and all DLCs. The only items currently not supported are those that came with the deluxe edition, but they're to be added in the next update. The levelled loot system always felt like a clumsy solution that just made playthroughs worse, and it says everything that you'll easily find a million guides and videos on how to game it effectively. It's kind of surprising that this isn't one of the things Oblivion Remastered tried to fix itself but, as ever, the Elder Scrolls modders have delivered.

    "title": "Electronic Arts CEO feels 'very good' about the next Battlefield's launch now that Grand Theft Auto 6 is out of the way",
    "article_text": "\"That window is clearer than it was before.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant,\" former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeausaid in 1969, describing the relationship between the US and Canada. \"No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.\" This is also true of some videogames, which are so massive that their impact has ripples across the entire industry—Cyberpunk 2077, for instance, muscled more than a couple games out of its way ahead of its splashdown in 2020. Grand Theft Auto 6 is poised to be an even bigger deal, and game industry executives not employed by Take-Two Interactive have been sweating: As one anonymous executive put itearlier this year, \"We don't want to be anywhere near that.\" The recently announcedGTA 6 delayis thus very good news indeed for anyone looking to release a game prior to May 2026—people like, for instance, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson. The matter came up during the Q&A portion of EA's recent quarterly investors call, when Wilson was asked about the impact of \"the big major expected release [that] has moved out of fiscal '26,\" a clear reference to GTA 6. Wilson declined to comment on how the shift might impact other companies, although he noted that the long lead-up to major game launches means \"that if you weren't already ready to launch in this window, it may be hard to get ready and take advantage of what might be otherwise a less competitive window than we may have anticipated earlier.\" But for the nextBattlefield, it's great: The game was already slated to launchsometime in EA's 2026 fiscal year, which ends in March 2026, so there's really nothing EA needs to do except show up on time. \"What we have said all along is we've been building towards a window that we thought made the most sense for Battlefield, but we wouldn't launch into a window that we thought truncated the value that we've invested into the franchise or the value that we think our players will derive from it once they jump in and start playing,\" Wilson said, using CEO-speak to explain that there was no way EA was going to put Battlefield anywhere near GTA 6. \"I think now, without going too far, we believe that window is clearer than it was before, and we feel very good about launching Battlefield in FY '26.\" It's not quite as unrestrained a statement as the all-caps thrill shared by Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 actorLuke Dale, but there's no mistaking the sentiment: The GTA 6 delay is a big win for EA. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. EA is going hard on the next Battlefield game, with four studios working on it—Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect (formerly DICE LA), and Motive—and a major playtesting initiative calledBattlefield Labs. The official reveal isn't set to happen until this summer, and there's always the possibility that it could be delayed too, which would be very bad news for EA. There's no sign of that happening at this point, and in fact Wilson said during the same call that the response to the new game during playtesting \"has far exceeded expectations,\" but even so I suspect there'll be some real pressure on the development team to ensure it gets done on time. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "I pride myself on keeping up with Steam's under-the-radar gems, but April was packed with enough new games to keep me busy for the rest of 2025",
    "article_text": "One of the busiest months in years meant that not every studio could be a winner. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I don't think it's controversial to say that there's a lot of good games coming out in 2025, but April in particular wasridiculous. More than 100 games on my wishlist dropped over the course of just 30 days, and some of those (like the galaxy-brainedBlue Princeand the hotly debatedClair Obscur) were all-eclipsing hits. We lovedPromise Mascot Agency, but its release on the very same day as Blue Prince meant it was destined to be overshadowed. And yet Promise Mascot Agency is practically a juggernaut next to dozens of other games I had my eye on, all released in just four weeks. While I tried my best to keep up with smaller releases, there were still tons of highly promising picks that slipped my net in April, only to land themselves on my to-play menu for the next few weeks. These are the ones I'm most eager to dig into. Released:April 22nd |Steam reviews:94%, 39 reviews |Steam Link Would you believe that Clair Obscur was thesecondfrench JRPG of April? Released just two days prior was Maliki: Poison Of The Past, a game based on a French comic series about time travel, farming and evil plant monsters. By all accounts, it's a fun Chrono Trigger-inspired romp that just happened to land at exactly the wrong time, overshadowed by the vastly higher profile release. Released:April 28th |Steam reviews:97% positive, 45 reviews |Steam Link A truly mysterious anomaly. A narrative-driven Vampire Survivors-like by the developers of the utterly oddball religious character action game El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron, which the store page claims it has some story ties to. Recently tripled in size as it left early access, but with a price tag increase to match, making it at least double the price of most of its peers. Still, a higher budget take onPicayune Dreamsisn't an unpleasant idea, and the few user reviews so far show promise. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Released:April 17th |Steam reviews:90% positive, 264 reviews |Steam Link This stylish, tricky-looking platformer made a bit of a splash when its debut trailer landed, but by the time the game was ready to roll out, April was already happening and it got lost in the crush. A shame, as it looks like a fascinating blend of precision Super Meat Boy-ish action, stylish (and sometimes silhouetted) visuals riffing off Limbo and smart physics puzzles reminding me ofThe Swapper. Released:April 23rd |Steam reviews:93% positive, 49 reviews |Steam Link Anyone who knows me can confirm that a month has to be PACKED for a super-stylish Space Harrier tribute to fly under my radar. And yet here we are, with Asura The Striker's kaleidoscopic dash through weird worlds, blasting and punching weird enemies. While this one is riffing off a Sega arcade classic that's almost as old as I am, it does look to freshen it up a bit with multiple routes and endings. Released:April 11th |Steam reviews:92% positive, 26 reviews |Steam Link Baldur's Gate 3 was a great reminder that bards are the most fearless member of any adventuring party. Who else would dare to just rock out in the middle of a swordfight? Traveler's Refrain is a great-looking bardic-themed action RPG in the vein of Bastion or Hyper Light Drifter with an interesting spellcasting system where actions and choices alter the music. Released:April 7th |Steam reviews:90% positive, 262 reviews |Steam Link Another low-fi, high-agility shooter seemingly inspired by the meteoric rise of Ultrakill. Voidborn has been a faint blip on my radar ever since its early access debut back in 2023. The final launch put it in my library but I've just not found the time to dig into it, despite vibing with the aesthetic. I've heard rumblings that it's less roguelike-ish than it first seems, but honestly, that only has me more intrigued. Released:April 17th |Steam reviews:95% positive, 20 reviews |Steam Link Not even gettinga full Digital Eclipse interactive documentaryseems to have put Welsh game dev legend Jeff Minter (who apparently lives just a few miles from me) back in the spotlight. A shame as this looks to be one of his most fascinating works yet. A lurid reimagining of the first arcade game to have flat-shaded 3D polygon graphics instead of transparent vectors, and a weird one to play even before Minter moved in. Released:April 15th |Steam reviews:97% positive, 188 reviews |Steam Link Even launching in the middle of Steam's recent block-pushing puzzler event, and receiving no shortage of praise, this Portal-inspired dystopian comedy seems like something that should have had longer in the limelight. Great graphics, a strong sense of humor and what looks like a chaotically shifting rule set has me excited to dig into this one, especially afterVoid Stranger rewired my brain. Released:April 7th |Steam reviews:95% positive, 266 reviews |Steam Link One that I've been waiting on for a while, and had a quick poke around when it first launched. As a platformer, it's merely okay, with some unusual movement physics. But Peppered is more of a Jazzpunk-esque joke delivery system. A madcap scramble through a world where nobody can die, but decisions (or repeated failures) can send the story spiralling off into wildly different directions. I've already had a few laugh-out-loud moments and really want to see how far its timelines diverge. Released:April 14th |Steam reviews:90% positive, 74 reviews |Steam Link With an aesthetic that reminds me of (shockingly good) spooky Virtual Boy maze adventureInnsmouth no Yakata, and a workplace horror story with shades of Severance, Repose has been on my radar since its debut trailer. Your job is to venture into an abandoned industrial complex and retrieve abandoned oxygen tanks from those who died in there before. You are assured that the cleaners will handle the corpses later. I'm sure things are fine and the gun they gave you won't be needed. And that's not even close to everything from April that's on my backlog. I've still yet to only scratch the surface of Clair Obscur, and even putting in dozens of hours,The Hundred Lineis an intimidatingly massive undertaking.

    "title": "Just months after reportedly cancelling two live service games in development, Sony announces a new PlayStation studio with a live service game in development",
    "article_text": "TeamLFG is a new internal PlayStation studio that may be working on the former Bungie project codenamed Gummy Bears. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just a few months after reportedlycancelling two unannounced live service gamesin the wake of the Concord catastrophe, Sony has unveiled a brand-new internal studio called TeamLFG, and yup, it's making a live service game. \"TeamLFG originated at Bungie, but has also rallied developers from across the industry to bring to life an ambitious incubation project that I’m very excited about,\" Sony's Hermen Hulst said in today'sannouncement. \"The studio is now fully formed and ready to be introduced to the world.\" The new studio isn't being headed up by any big names—or at least, none were mentioned in the reveal—but its developers include \"industry veterans\" who have worked on games including Destiny, Halo, League of Legends, Fortnite, Roblox, and Rec Room, as well as \"newcomers with fresh creative perspectives and skills.\" What exactly they're getting up to also hasn't been revealed, but there's clearly going to be a strong social element to it. \"We want our players to feel excited when they log on to discover their teammates already hanging out online,\" the studio wrote. \"We want our players to recognize familiar names and to make myths and memes out of each other. We want our players to love remembering that one time where they pulled off That Play that changed the whole story of the match. \"We will make immersive multiplayer worlds propelled by action games that players can learn, play, and master for countless hours. We want to build our games with our communities, inviting players to be a part of our development process through early access playtests. It’s critical that we stay nimble enough to react to player feedback, not just in our lead-up to launch, but throughout live service as we continue to grow the game and community for years to come.\" So, live service confirmed, which is interesting given that Sony seemed a little gun-shy about the whole thing back near the start of the year. Understandably so: Concord was amassive failurethat consumed hundreds of millions of dollars and years of development time, and nobody wants a repeat of that. Of course, the flipside of that coin isHelldivers 2, a huge 2024 success that's still putting up enviable player numbers.

TeamLFG said in the announcement that its first game \"is a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games,\" that takes place \"in a lighthearted, comedic world set in brand-new, mythic, science-fantasy universe.\"Eurogamerspeculates, probably correctly, that it's the MOBA-style PvP game codenamed Gummy Bears that began development at Bungie, but eventually transitioned to a brand-new PlayStation studio. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "article_text": "Simon says? No, Simon dies. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's endgame is pretty nutty—for good and for ill. In case you're unfamiliar, the game allows you to equip Pictos (equipment that you have three slots for), each which come with their own passives. Italsoallows you to unlock those passives as \"Luminas\" for all your characters. This requires spending points from a pool to equip them—a point pool that can go into the hundreds. Imagine, if you will, your average RPG. Then imagine being able to (with a bit of grinding) equip dozens of passive effects from all the gear you collected in your run at the same time. That is how Expedition 33 does it. Players have stumbled across the peak of this maze of systems-based nonsense in the character of Maelle, a teen duelist and, apparently, walking nuclear weapon.There'll be some very minor spoilers for Act 3 of the gameto follow. So, here's the basic concept. Maelle has a skill called Stendhal. Stendhal does a lot of damage. Maelle also has a stance called Virtuose, in which she deals 200% more damage. You put her in Virtuose stance, slap enemies with Stendhal, and then watch as they explode. There's a whole laundry-list of Luminas that make this actuallywork,but the key ones are Cheater, which gives you a second turn, and Shortcut, which gives you a turn when you drop below 30% hit points. As for how to get into Virtuose stance? It's a combination of Medalum, which has you start each battle in Virtuose stance, as well as her skill Last Stand, which puts you into Virtuose stance and reduces you to one hit point. Once you have these pieces assembled, you do this: This is just the core of this nonsense—there's a ton of other Pictos and Luminas you want to put in place to buff Maelle's damage into the stratosphere. Sciel gets a special mention for being able to double her damage, but there's a whole bunch of Luminas you can huck at Maelle to have her melting gods. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Naturally, you'll need the Pictos that lets you deal more than 9,999 damage from the end of Act 2, but that's just what you need to get started: At Death's Door gives you an extra 50% at low health, Burn Affinity gives you 25% against burning targets, Confident Fighter gives you 30% but removes your ability to heal (this doesn't matter), Inverted affinity gives you 50% extra damage but makes healing hurt you (this, if you can believe it, also doesn't matter). This is just a shortlist, there are more—but this jumble of bullcrap allows you to do, uh, 2 billion, 177 million, 438 thousand damage. I doubt I am topping this. https://t.co/OhBiF8fG8x pic.twitter.com/kD4FDlBqULApril 29, 2025 For contrast, Simon, the post-endgame superboss I just spent ages killing, has around 45 million HP. This build hits hard enough to kill him 48.3 times over—a sort of poetic number, working out to roughly one full health bar for every million health I spent time chipping through the hard way. I might've had a more satisfying knock-out brawl with the guy, parrying him 193 times in a gruelling 16-minute skirmish, but I definitely could've saved some time (and grinding) with this build. And you know what? I'm glad. All my favourite games in the genre have me breaking my ankles on their hardest challenges, only to stumble into someone who found the secret arcane language of buildcraft, rocked up to god, and slapped them in the face for 2 billion damage. And I wouldn't have it any other way.After all, I'm something of a powergamer myself.

    "article_text": "What is the penguin hiding behind that enigmatic smile? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The days are very much numbered; official support for Windows 10will end on October 14, 2025. After a decade of ongoing-support, it's perhaps no surprise Microsoft is finally laying this operating system to rest. However, millions of users are now staring down the question of what to do next. For instance, what if you don't meet the somewhat stringent minimum hardware requirements to straightforwardly upgrade to Windows 11? Ispaying Microsoft for Extended Security Updates, or upgrading to a fresh Windows 11 Copilot+ PC really your only options? No, absolutely not.Ian's guide from last yearexplains you have a few avenues to explore, butEnd of 10zeroes in on one possible solution for Windows 10 users who'd rather not part from perfectly serviceable hardware: jumping ship to Linux (viaTechSpot). Put together bya number of folks involved in Linux development, the End of 10 website argues that there's no need to buy an expensive upgrade if your post-2010 hardware still runs to a satisfactory standard (obviously, gaming rigs aren't really a huge part of this particular conversation). Instead, End of 10 claims users can make their possibly more than decade-old hardware \"fast and secure again\" by switching to the latest version of the open-source OS—evenoffering a list of places worldwidethat will assist with installing Linux for those not confident attempting it alone. Obviously, learning Linux isfar from a novel proposition, especially withWindows 11's very particular system requirements. To upgrade to Windows 11, you will need a processor from either Intel's 8th-generation or AMD'sRyzen2000 series at least. Without either of these or something newer, the system requirements for Microsoft's latest OS leaves a lot of pre-2017 setups out in the cold. There are ways around this, withFlyby11 circumventing the installation processes' hardware checks. Otherwise there'sISO burning tool Rufus, though Microsoft only endorses this specific method for actually compatible rigs. But End of 10 strikes me as targeting Windows 10 users with limited tech literacy who feel The Fear at the thought of sneakily sidestepping official hardware requirements—so, definitely not folks who emerged from the womb knowing that the penguin is called Tux. The simple language the website uses and its easily accessible, helpful links feel very much in keeping with Linux's open-source spirit. Granted, anyone going this route then has to try and learn how to actually use Linux. If you've been a lifelong Windows user, that's definitely an adjustment, but arguably not impossible—especially with End of 10's gentle nudging of visitors towards Linux-based communities. Furthermore, I appreciate End of 10 at least gesturing towards the concern of mounting e-waste.A 2024 investigation by the United Nations Institute for Training and Researchshared that a record 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced in 2022 alone. UNITAR highlights that that's 82% more than 2010, with the world on track to churn out another 82 million tonnes in 2030.

    "article_text": "Josef Fares and team have certainly found a big niche. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the year's most pleasant surprises was Hazelight's Split Fiction, which left PC Gamer's Fraser Brown breathlesswith its pace and variety: \"it's hard to imagine another game cramming so many surprises and script-flips into a single 15-hour romp.\" The studio has carved out a sizeable niche for itself with excellent co-op adventures such as A Way Out and It Takes Two, with Split Fiction very much in that lineage and proving an instant success: selling no less thana million copies in the first two days of release. Now publisher EA has announced, as part of its latest financial results, that the game had a \"hugely successful launch\" and sold just under four million copies. That number was swiftly shared by Hazelight itself to confirm that, yep, it had tipped over the four million mark. \"4 MILLION SOLD!!!!\"said the developer's official account. \"So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it’s amazing… Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made…\" Split Fiction is apparently also being turned into a movie in conjunction with Story Kitchen, though Hazelight's main man Josef Fares is phlegmatic about the whole thing: \"I'll believe it when I see it\"says Fares of the proposed project. \"There’s a lot of talks, but nothing happens.\" As for what the future holds for Hazelight now, the answer is presumably more of the same: original co-op adventures. One thing's for sure: regardless of what EA says, Josef Fares and team won't ever be making a live service game: \"Never.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Intel slashes the price of its Core Ultra 265K CPU from $399 to $299, making it a killer deal for gamers despite all the early issues",
    "article_text": "Arrow Lake CPU, anyone?...Anyone? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We reported a couple of weeks back on the slightly odd news thatIntel's elderly Raptor Lake CPUs are still flying our the door. Now Intel has slashed the price of two of the most gamer-friendly variants of its latest Arrow Lake desktop processor family by upwards of 25%. Intel hasuploaded a blog post detailing cuts to the \"suggested pricing\" of the Core Ultra 7 265K and 265KF models. The 265K drops from $399 to $299, while the 265KF tumbles from $384 to $284. The difference between the two models is that the 265KF forgoes an integrated GPU, enabling it to hit a slightly lower price point. Both chips get the same eight Performance and 12 Efficient CPU cores. They also share the same operating frequencies, including a top Turbo speed of 5.5 GHz. Of course, Intel's Arrow Lake CPU family had something of a troubled launch, what with variousmea cupla's from Intel itself over the chip's non-readiness. Earlier this year, we had our own look at how things had progressed following three months of patches and updates,only to find a rather mixed picture. But here's the thing. It's all relative and you're still getting a very powerful CPU with eight hefty P-cores plus 12 E-cores thrown in. The critical context is AMD'sRyzen7 9700X. That has an MSRP of $359 and stilltypically goes for over $300. Purely for gaming, there's very little between an Intel 265K or 265KF and the AMD 9700X, the latter perhaps being about 5% faster on average. Not enough, in other words, that you'd ever feel it. However, with a total of 20 cores versus the 9700X's eight cores—albeit 16 threads with multithreading support on each core—the Intel chips are much faster for productivity tasks like video encoding. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In the past, we'd have still opted for the 9700X. It had the lower MSRP and was marginally faster for gaming. Now? I might, just might, go Intel. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. The 265K now has both the lower MSRP and lower street price, with the 265KF lower still, and I think in terms of future proofing with all those cores, they could be the better pick. Indeed,we recently conducted some analysis that shows multithreading in games is at last becoming more widespread. Yes, a lot of games still load most of the work onto a relatively small number of threads. But the tide is turning towards multithreading. Still, with Intel's recent track record, going blue still feels like a bit of a gamble. The AMD chip is arguably the safer bet. Likewise, some question marks remain over the true efficacy of hybrid CPU architectures for desktop PCs, as opposed to, say, smartphones where power efficiency is so important. But with this price cut the Core Ultra 7 265K and 265KF certainly deserve to be taken very, very seriously indeed.

    "title": "Check out this brilliant video breaking open a bricked Nintendo Switch 2 chip to see what makes it tick, and why we're looking at around Steam Deck GPU performance from the new console",
    "article_text": "Want to literally see inside the Switch 2's processor? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new video from the ever effusive Geekerwan has broken down the details of the silicon at the heart of theNintendo Switch 2. He picked up a bricked console motherboard for 1,000 Yuan (approx. $140) from a Chinese eBay analogue, Xianyu, and has absolutely gone to town on the chip. Like, above and beyond. I absolutely recommend you watch the video, because as well as being incredibly detailed on the extent they went to in order to get the full details of the chip—including cutting it down the middle with a very thin ion beam in order to measure a cross-section to ascertain the process node—he's super-engaging and always enthusiastic about what he'd covering. It's a joy, honestly. Anyways, the main takeaway is that yes, this is the Nvidia T239 chip that was widely rumoured to be the chip powering the new Nintendo handheld, and you can see from the metal layer inscription that this was a processor taped out in 2021. Geekerwan notes that this four-year gap is averylong time between tape out and release, and likely hints at a Switch 2 that was supposed to be released a while back and was postponed for whatever reason. It's Nintendo; the reason could be anything. Because it's an already broken chip—they tried powering it on, but got nowhere—there was nothing stopping them from ripping the Nvidia chip open to see what was going on under the logo'd heatspreader. Lapping the top meant they could get a great die shot, highlighting that while this does indeed house Ampere-generation Nvidia hardware, \"this Ampere is not the other Ampere.\" There are definite differences between an RTX 30-series die and the layout of the GPU component in the T239 chip. Geekerwan notes that the SM design actually looks far closer to the layout of an Ada SM than an Ampere one, which could suggest that there are some elements shared between the GPU generations on this chip. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are 12 SMs on this board, with 128 CUDA cores in each, for a total of 1536 cores. That's what the rumours had already said, so that's not a surprise here. Another thing which seems to straddle two generations is the process node itself. Theoretically, it's a Samsung 8N node, but their examination suggests this is a production process that shares features of both Samsung's 10 nm and 8 nm nodes. This is, however, a custom process, so that does make sense. With the GPU parts strangely wrapped around it, there is the CPU segment. This is made up of eight Arm A78C cores, each with 256 kB L2 cache, with a shared 4 MB of L3 in the middle. As well as ripping the wrapping layers off this silicon present, Geekerwan has also made an attempt at trying to dial into the potential performance of the Switch 2's core. With a similarly Ampere-based GPU, the GA107 of the RTX 2050 laptop chip is the closest match, though that comes with a far higher TGP and memory and core clocks. In order to try and get a bead on gaming performance, they hobbled their RTX 2050 laptop as best they could to match the rumoured handheld frequency of the Switch 2—421 MHz—and halved the memory clock. To getthatlow, they needed to employ internal tools to bring the target TGP and frequencies right down. Taking 3DMark Steel Nomad Light as their GPU test, you can see that in handheld mode, the Switch 2 actually has a similar level of performance as the Steam Deck, with the docked mode simulating 53% higher performance than Valve's classic handheld. Though it's worth noting that even in docked mode, it can't touch the Radeon 780M, which powers most of the rest of the handheld gaming PCs on the market. One thing they do note, however, is that while there is a significant difference between the original Switch chip and the theoretical performance of the new one, it's not the10x that Nvidia has been touting. At least not without DLSS, and maybe even Frame Gen. Remember that we said there were similarities between the Ampere GPU in the T239 and the Ada design? Best handheld gaming PC: What's the best travel buddy?Steam Deck OLED review: Our verdict on Valve's handheld.Best Steam Deck accessories: Get decked out.Steam Deck battery life: What's the real battery life? Geekerwan then goes on to show a simulated Cyberpunk 2077 run at the expected DLSS levels that a Switch 2 version, in both handheld and docked mode, might deliver. And, well, it's not bad, especially when you think it'll be on a relatively wee screen. He did turn on path tracing, too, but the less said about that the better. The same goes forMonster Hunter Wildswhere he says, \"even if you run 720p, low-definition, super-performance DLSS in dock mode, it becomes a shitty wilderness.\" Though Black Myth Wukong doesn't look bad, and the latest CoD also runs pretty well on this simulated hardware. As you might expect, it's the CPU component that is way behind the GPU part. The Arm cores run at 1.1 GHz, and in a Geekbench 6 analysis, that puts the simulated performance 140% behind the Steam Deck APU's single-core performance and 52% behind on multi-core metrics. It's a really interesting breakdown of the Switch 2's potential performance, and a great look at the actual silicon, too. And, again, I say go watch the video, this guy's great.

    "title": "On the prospect of an $80-$90 GTA 6, former PlayStation boss says 'it's an impossible equation' for big-budget studios to keep their prices down",
    "article_text": "\"People expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's every chance that GTA 6 will cost around $80—it's not been confirmed, but the wind is certainly shifting that way. That's as per the Xbox website, whichtold customers some bad news, writing \"Some of our new, first-party games will launch at $79.99 beginning this holiday season.\" I should note that while Rockstar is owned by Take-Two Interactive, not Microsoft, this still marks a shift in the big-budget industry and, honestly, having seen theabsurd graphical fidelity of GTA 6?If any game's gonna cost $80, it'll be that one. Former PlayStation boss and Sony vet, Shuhei Yoshida,who left the company in 2024after a whopping 38 years, thinks it was pretty much only a matter of time. \"It was going to happen sooner or later,\" he tellsplaystationinside. \"Maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually.\" The problem, he puts it, is inflation. Which is an unerringly boring but also correct answer: \"We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It’s an impossible equation.\" In fact, companies are \"keen to diversify their revenues\" to fund the ever-bloated scale of these projects. That includes all these remakes and remasters: \"Basically, the proliferation of remasters and remakes doesn’t really stem from any kind of nostalgia or a desire to bring games up to date, but is a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits that ultimately help finance new games.\" PC ports are part of that equation, but he says that's not as much of an issue because they're propped up by support studios—I'm inclined to agree with him, but mostly because I'd like to play these games on PC someday.Cough, Bloodborne, cough. A less savoury part, he also highlights, are \"subscription platforms and games as a service\". As for GTA 6, he doesn't know if \"Rockstar will jump at the chance\" to ramp up the price to $80—or even $90, all-told. But he maintains that \"a balance must be found between production costs and game prices. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but if you take the example of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the game is just as phenomenal visually, despite the fact that the team only has around thirty people. This is one of the ways forward, I think, because you can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality.\" It's admittedly a little funny to have thewide-spread meme'I want shorter games with worse graphics made by people who are paid more to work less and I’m not kidding' basically parroted in more professional, executive terms by one of the industry's longest-standing figureheads. But he's not entirely wrong. He's also not exactly saying the 'paid more to work less' bit, given the mention of budgets. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an interesting case because (aside from the fact it was made by a bit more than 30 people—it's just that was the size of the core dev team) I'd say the fact it looks good is more down to artstyle and aesthetic choice than the kind of raw, powerhouse technical fidelity that Rockstar flexes. I loved the visuals and the creativity of its world, but everyone's hair kept clipping through their necks, and I started to notice the constant reusing of scattered assets. That's not a complaint, mind. I love a game with a reasonable budget and ambitious scope. Even when it's coming from a bigger developer like, say, Atlus—I'll take the straightforward graphics of Metaphor: ReFantazio any day if the game is good.Rockstar's beer bottles may be shiny, but they're not mandatory for a good time.

    "article_text": "One of the Cheshire Cat's limited event duties. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. During theCheshire Cat's arrivalinDisney Dreamlight Valley, the Cheshire Cat Chaos event has introduced four new Dreamlight Duties to complete for some Wonderland-themed rewards. TheCalmer of Chaosduty is one of the easier challenges, but takes some time and dedication to finish. Especially since the duty gives you no clues as to how to go about solving it. The Calmer of Chaos challenge can be completed around the Valley, so unlike a handful of the Cheshire Cat's other trials and challenges, you won't need to dip in and out of realms to get this done. As a reward, you'll receive the Twisting Rabbit Mirror which is perfect for any Wonderland-themed room. Here's what you need to do. To complete the Calmer of Chaos duty, you need tofind all 10 pieces of the Cheshire Cat memory by digging at pink cracksin the ground. These cracks will only spawn during the Cheshire Cat Chaos event, so you need to work quickly if you want to tick this duty off fast and get your reward. There's no guarantee that you'll get a pink memory orb from each crack you dig up, and there's always a possibility that you'll get a duplicate orb. Fortunately, these purple rift cracks spawn throughout the day and you'll be able to find up to five at a time. Giving you plenty of opportunity to complete the task before theevent ends on May 20. Use your Royal Shovel on the ground to remove these cracks, and you'll hopefully get a pink memory orb. Unlike the other cracks in the ground you'll find while you wander around the valley, the ones linked to the Cheshire Cat won't glitter as you approach them, which makes them easier to spot. I also found it easier to go into the furniture placing mode, then use the freecam to look across the valley and find the location of each crack, rather than running around on foot.

The Big Bloom,Fallout 76'sspring limited-time event, is underway, which means there are new monsters for you to take on and rewards to win. The seasonal event will be happening until May 20, so there'll be plenty of time to frolic through the meadows, killing the most heinous mutated insects I've ever seen. \"Spring has sprung in Appalachia and that means verdant, rolling hills, warm sunshine and, best of all, flowers,\" a Bethesdablog postsays. \"Spring also means pollen, allergies, and pollinators.\" 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together The event revolves around Black-Eyed Susan, a woman who lives in Skyline Valley, picking flowers for her lovely arrangements and decorations: everyone needs a hobby, even in the apocalypse. Most of the year, her hobby is relatively chill, until spring rolls around and brings a bunch of so-called \"plant monsters\". These are actually the Overgrown, a monster inspired by the tales of Swamp Thing that was introduced to Fallout 76 back in theAtlantic City: Boardwalk Paradise update. I've killed plenty of these annoying creatures while taking part in The Most Sensational Game, and for the most part, they're pretty simple to take down. You can take out a good chunk of them by just setting a bunch on fire, and because they're essentially one big pile of grass, they'll go up in flames in an instant. The difficulty comes with the variants. Alongside the Overgrown, there's the Thorn and the Pollinator. The Thorn are pesky little buggers who can run really fast and just start swinging at a moments notice. Then the Pollinators are like big bloated balloons, which can shield the Overgrown and Thorn, so you need to take these out first before attacking the rest. Luckily, these variants don't make an appearance in The Big Bloom, so for funsies, there is a big honey beast, basically giant mutated honey bees, covered in bee hives and flowers, instead. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's all worth it just for the flower crowns. After speaking with Susan, your job is basically pest control. The first step is collecting 30 flowers of crystalcups, radlilies, and carnal weepers each and giving them to Susan. Bear in mind that the fields of flowers are also full of mines, which Susan helpfully placed around at random. Then, after you've collected the flowers, you need to get rid of all the Overgrown. You have to set them alight either with your own weapons or by using the Molotov cocktails Susan left out for you. Once you've killed 25 of them, the Beezlebub, Giant Bee of Yore, will emerge from a nearby cave and fight you. It's a lot of effort to go to for a random lady's hobby, but there are a couple of nice rewards waiting for those who complete the event. As usual, there's XP, caps, legendary modules, and some rare and common rewards available. But there's also some event-specific loot like base flowers, gamma green tea, three kinds of flower crowns, the Gardener player title, and a plan for Susan's floral secrets. Honestly, it's all worth it just for the flower crowns. Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "title": "Leaked pics of a supposed Asus ROG Ally 2 show an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC that is very peculiar to behold",
    "article_text": "It's like... one foot in the PlayStation Portal camp, the other in the normal one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We first heard about the possibility of an Xbox-branded handheld just a couple of months ago, and now we seem to have our first glimpses at this 'Project Kennan' device, which looks to be a version of a presumably upcomingAsusROG Ally 2. There have been a few ROG Ally 2 things spotted, most prominently an IndonesianDSPPI Postel certification(via91 mobiles), a KoreanRRA certification(viaIT Home), and pictures shared byX user 94G8LA(viaVideoCardz) supposedly leaked from an FCC certification to do with Wi-Fi modules. The certifications list \"RC73XA\" and \"RC73YA\" model names for the \"ROG Ally 2\". That multiple filings for a ROG Ally 2 have been spotted would itself be interesting. However, what's especially interesting is that the pictures seem to show the black version of the handheld has a button with an Xbox logo on the top left (the different colour schemes presumably being distinguished by \"XA\" and \"YA\" model numbers). The same button is there on the white version, but it looks like the logo has been completely covered up. The button does look like it's been blacked out a little even in the black version, too. This suggests that some version of these ROG Ally 2 handhelds might not hit the market as Xbox-branded (or alternatively just that the branding had to be covered up for legal reasons). However, that the button is there at all suggests that there will be an Xbox-branded version. Oh, plus the ABXY buttons which, on the white version at least, are clearly Xbox-coloured buttons. And the fact that the entire thing looks like a screen slapped in the middle of an oversized Xbox controller, Playstation Portal-style. But at least with the Portal those grips were separated a little more. ROG Ally 2RC73XA Black 20V 5A 100WRC73YA White 20V 3.25A 65Whttps://t.co/jgx4HFHUUu https://t.co/QUwZwa8t9a pic.twitter.com/dq3CP2SbA9May 7, 2025 This would make this handheld the rumoured 'Project Kennan' device thatwe heard aboutback in March. At the time, Windows Central, whichbroke the news, said the device would be made in cooperation with a \"PC Gaming OEM (think ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, Razer, etc).\" It seems that this OEM has turned out to be Asus. Windows Central was also told that the handheld would \"look unmistakably 'Xbox'... complete with an official Xbox guide button, and Xbox design sensibilities.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And we can't really go any further without discussing those \"design sensibilities\", can we? If those FCC photos are legit and represent what Kennan will really be like, I can't help but think that Asus and Microsoft's design sensibilities are a little freaky. I'm getting real N64 controller vibes from it, and not in a good way. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Still, as adevotee of all things 'comfort', I must say thatifthe grips are very comfortable then I'd probably consider using such a strange-looking handheld anyway. The thing I liked the least about theoriginal Lenovo Legion Gowas how comfortable it could be to hold for any length of time. TheLegion Go Sfares much better in that regard, and that's one of its main allures, but I bet it won't hold up to this Frankensteinery in terms of pure comfort. We don't know much else about the ROG Ally 2 (Xbox version or otherwise) other than that, judging by the Korean certification details, there might be 512 GB, 1 TB, or 2 TB versions using either Micron, Western Digital, or SK Hynix SSDs. The labels that VideoCardz highlights suggest that the black version has aRyzenZ2 Extreme processor with 64 GB of LPDDR5-8533 RAM and the black version has a Van Gogh-successor processor. With certifications popping up left, right, and centre, and with a design that looks so finished—labels and all—we can probably expect an announcement very soon. It might make sense for Asus to announce it at Computex 2025 later this month. With this, and with apossible Nvidia laptop processor announcement, the event is sure shaping up to be a spicy one for PC gamers.

MSI has three QD-OLED screens that gamers will want to pair with their next-gen graphics cards for the ultimate PC gaming setup. Getting the right mix of screen and GPU is essential for achieving the best gaming graphics and the highest framerates. There's no point in equipping your PC with a graphics card that can achieve over 200fps in 4K and HDR in your favourite game, then hooking it up to a monitor that supports none of these things. A new monitor is one of the most significant upgrades you can supply for your gaming rig, as there's been a recent glut of new technologies that improve on the 60Hz panels of the past in almost every way, and the latest DisplayPort 2.1 technology means you can really take advantage of their cutting-edge features. If you’ve been lucky enough to source and install an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 in your PC, such as theMSI GeForce RTX 5090 32G SUPRIM SOC, then theMSI MPG 322 URX QD-OLEDis the ideal companion. From MSI’s premium MPG series, this 32in screen offers a 4K resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, giving gamers the best of both worlds and not forcing you to choose between sharpness and speed. As a QD-OLED screen you can expect the best in HDR performance, with a 1,000 nit peak brightness, and with a 0.03ms GtG response time there's no danger of ghosting or smearing. Having DisplayPort 2.1 on the latest Nvidia GeForce graphics cards is a big step forward. The latest revision of the video connector offers 80Gbps of bandwidth, supporting the full 4K resolution at 240Hz, and future-proofed for the 8K (7680 x 4320) displays of the near future. MSI’s latest QD-OLED monitors support the standard, along with HDMI 2.1 and USB Type-C to give you the option to connect many different sources to your screen, with a handy USB hub so you can switch keyboard and mouse dongles over too. The GeForce RTX 5080 is a mighty fine GPU, and MSI’sGeForce RTX 5080 16G VANGUARD SOCis equipped with DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI 2.1 ports to supply a 4K/240Hz signal to a monitor such as theMSI MPG 321CURX QD-OLED. This 32in QD-OLED screen has a 1700R curve to enhance gaming immersion, and benefits from an exceptionally fast GTG response time of just 0.03ms. Having a curved monitor means objects in your peripheral vision can appear larger and closer, which can reduce the time it takes to identify and react to them - and when you’re playing esports games at 240fps, every little improvement counts. The Nvidia GeForce 5070 and 5070Ti have quickly built themselves a reputation as solid value picks in the RTX 5000-series lineup, and theMSI 272URX QD-OLEDis a top-end monitor choice to pair with them. This 27in 4K QD-OLED screen offers exceptionally vivid images in a slightly smaller frame than the 32in giants, making it lighter too, and more suitable for more compact living areas. Coupled with a graphics card such as theMSI GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16G GAMING TRIO OC PLUSorGeForce RTX 5070 12G GAMING TRIO OC, it’s capable of the full 240Hz with DisplayHDR True Black 400 and a 1,000-nit peak brightness. Like all MSI QD-OLED monitors, it’s treated with an anti-glare coating to reduce reflections from light sources behind you, and its multiple inputs are all capable of supporting the top resolution and refresh rate. Pairing a graphics card and monitor when building or upgrading your rig is a great way to ensure you’re getting the best quality visuals out of your gaming PC, and these fantastic offerings from MSI utilise some of the latest technology in both GPUs and screens, allowing you to play games at faster refresh rates and higher resolutions than ever before.

    "title": "The BioWare we loved is mostly gone, but '2017 is when EA finished digesting' it, says Dragon Age studio veteran",
    "article_text": "\"EA buys studios, and then consumes them, and they start to lose their culture.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With the somewhat-middling debut ofDragon Age: The Veilguard, a game I sort of blandly enjoyed for 60 hours but certainly never in a 'this is a great Dragon Age' way, as well as thesolemn layoffsfollowing its muted fanfare, I think we can pretty much light a candle for the whole series. As well as the BioWarewe knew and loved, mind. As PC Gamer's Fraser Brown puts it \"The Veilguard was the very shiny, very pretty nail in the coffin.\" It was the last real shot the studio had at convincing anybody it still had the juice after the stumbling of Mass Effect: Andromeda and the trainwreck of Anthem, but some of us were still holding out hope. Mark Darrah, a studio vet who worked there for over 20 years beforeleaving the studio in 2020, has revealed that the bones of BioWare were actually being Weekend at Bernie's-d for much longer than that. In a grim tell-all on hisYouTube channel, Darrah explains that 2017 was really the year that BioWare was fractured. Following a double-whammy of Dragon Age devs being peeled off to work on Andromeda, then Anthem, the team was then given marching orders to make a live service game. Marching orders that we know werelater rescinded. Didn't stop EA trying to blame the game's underperformance on alack of 'em anyway, but what can you do. \"I wish that had never happened. I wish that pivot had never occurred—I wish that had never happened,\" Darrah emphatically states. Still, \"EA said, 'make this a live service', we said, 'we don't know how to do that, we should basically start the project over'.\" This marked the second age of \"leadership discontinuity on Dragon Age,\" says Darrah—with this all going on while the team's core leadership is tied to Anthem. \"This ends up causing massive amounts of changes to the project, to the team makeup, to the culture. \"In this time, Dragon Age is pursuing a goal that ultimately it doesn't want to be pursuing. But it does its best, but in doing its best, it changes the nature of the project in fundamental ways. So as we come to the end of 2017, we are in a state where almost everyone is on Anthem, but Dragon Age [is] running without most of its core leadership.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Darrah damns these changes and leadership decisions without qualification, in a way that's a little heartbreaking. \"In the process of this change, EA and BioWare have dramatically damaged their relationship with myself, but also with a lot of other, more senior members of BioWare. Because they've said things are going to happen that didn't happen, they've made assurances that did not come true.\" Now, obviously, this is only one person's view on the subject—a reality Darrah makes room later in the video to discuss—but it really does seem like BioWare, in particular its Dragon Age team, was the victim of a slow kind of corporate vampirism that saw it become a husk of its former self. \"As we come out of 2017,\" Darrah continues, \"BioWare is a different thing. It is focused on making a live service in Anthem, it has lost one of its studios in Montreal being taken away,\" studios that—earlier in the video—Darrah was praying would return to the Dragon Age team, not bemerged into the wider EA hivemindafter Andromeda's debut, \"and now it moves into the future in this new state.\" Ultimately, Darrah concludes that: \"EA buys studios, and then consumes them, and they start to lose their culture into the overall EA culture. To me, it feels like 2017 is when EA finished digesting BioWare, which they had bought nine years earlier, in 2008.\" It's a grim picture to paint—and one to be taken with a grain of salt, given Darrah left in 2020. But it certainly tracks with similarly-damning words fromother BioWare veteransabout the state of BioWare post-Dragon Age: Inquisition.

When you hit a level four friendship with the Cheshire Cat, you'll unlock theIt's All Nonsensequest. He'll ask you to set up what he calls a \"nonsense party\" to make amends with the villagers he's already upset while moving in. It's the least he could do after the chaos he's caused. This involves a lot of cooking and crafting and running around chasing up villagers. In fact, Cheshire will immediately ask for your help in preparing for the party by cooking four dishes, so it's worth stocking up on your ingredients beforehand. Here's everything you need, and all the other steps you need to complete to set up the perfect nonsense party. The Cheshire Cat will give you an extensive list of ingredients to gather as soon as you start the It's All Nonsense quest. These are used to create two different dishes, thegarlic chocolate tart and tea sandwiches. Since you need to create two of each dish, you need to double the ingredients in both recipes. Here's what you need to create a garlic chocolate tart: You need the following ingredients to create tea sandwiches: When you've created two of each dish, take them all to the Cheshire Cat, and he'll ask for your help to craft some decorations for the party. He will only ask you to craft one item from scratch, the Cheshire Smile Balloon Arch. You'll need the following materials to craft one: Alongside the arch, you need to place three random items of furniture around the Cheshire Cat's tree. This can be literally anything in your inventory, so don't overthink it.You also need to change your outfit to include something orange, something bold, and three additional random accessories too. Cheshire will then ask you to invite Tiana, Remy, Scar, and Daisy to the party. When you speak to them, they're all a bit hesitant to do anything for the Cheshire Cat given how much upset he's already caused, but they agree to come anyway. When everyone has arrived, speak to the Cheshire Cat and you'll be able to take a photo with all the visitors. After this, speak to each attendee and get their opinion on the nonsense party. It's safe to say that no one had a particularly enjoyable time, but when you report all this back to the Cheshire Cat, he's (unsurprisingly) thrilled with the outcome.

    "title": "AMD says it's set to lose out on $1.5B worth of AI GPU sales due to export restrictions, but Dr. Su hails its latest Ryzen chips as 'the CPU of choice for gamers' after huge rise in sales revenue",
    "article_text": "PC processor revenues up by nearly 70%. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD's client PC division is going gangbusters. The company has just had its latest earnings call with the usual high-end bean counters and among other positive news, AMD says thatrevenues from its Client PC division are up by an epic 68%compared to the same period last year. Boom. That's mostly PC processor sales, underlining the broader narrative that AMD's latestRyzenCPUs, including theRyzen 7 9800 X3D, are a smash hit. Indeed, AMD CEO Lisa Su hailed the new CPU family as a \"best seller\" and \"the CPU of choice for gamers.\" However, it wasn't all good news. AMD's Gaming division reported yet another drop in revenue, falling a hefty 30% year-on-year from an already much diminished position. The Gaming division includes both graphics cards for PCs and chips for consoles. The latter were approaching the end of a product cycle for the period in question, which was the first quarter of 2025. What's more, it's probably too early to see the impact of AMD's latest Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. Su once again highlighted the early sales success of theRX 9070 and 9070 XT, saying, \"first week sellout set a record, and was more than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch.\"But we've heard that beforeand no new information was provided in that regard. Long story short, we'll have to wait for AMD's second quarter results to see if RDNA 4 really is bringing in the cash. AMD does say it expects the Gaming division to grow next quarter, so we'll be watching closely when the numbers come out. The other bad news story involves AI chips. Well, bad news up to a point. Su said AI GPU sales were up, \"by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year,\" but declined to say exactly how much. No doubt the figure wasn't quite as impressive as she would have liked, otherwise it would have been touted as a badge of honour. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. More worrisome, however, was the revelation from AMD's CFO Jean Hu that the company expects to lose out on $1.5 billion in AI GPU revenue thanks to export restrictions that apply to China. Still, first quarter revenue for the company as a whole was up by 36%, year-on-year, to $7.4 billion. So, the overall picture is pretty rosy. However, just to put that figure into context, it's slightly below the$7.6 billion Intel reported in the same quarter, just for its Client Computing Group, which excludes server chip sales. In other words, there's plenty of scope left for AMD to pinch market share from Intel. Apart from gaming GPU sales, the other area where AMD could probably stand to improve its performance involves laptop CPUs. AMD doesn't break out mobile CPU sales from the rest of its Client group. But anecdotally, at least, the laptop market still seems to be dominated by Intel. Notably, the latestRazer Blade 16 has made the switch from Intel to AMD. But the broader industry-wide move towards AMD that we thought may happen this year doesn't appear to be playing out, for now at any rate.

    "article_text": "Not the worst thing you can clap eyes upon in your PC case, but not ideal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Writing about hardware is an often humbling experience. More recently than I'd like to admit, I popped open a PC case only to ask '...what isthat?' Embarrassingly,thatwas my first encounter with a particularly stylish GPU riser bracket—a bit of kit that allows for vertical installation of your graphics card. Unfortunately for some folks with vertically mounted Gigabyte RTX 50-series cards, they've peeked inside their PC case only to see something far more worrying. The saga began last month, when a translated post from a Quasar Zone user alleged that the thermal gel on their Gigabyte Aorus Master IceRTX 5080appeared to be\"crawling out\". They claimed to have only had the card for a month, having used it to play World of Warcraft for about two hours every day—hardly the heaviest of performance loads. Now, a number of other users have taken to the TechPowerUp forum to share that the thermal gel on their Gigabyte cards also appears to be either melting or otherwise making a break for it (viaVideocardz). One TechPowerUp forum member,remekra, shared photos of thermal gel slippageon their vertically installed card. They write, \"So far it does not overheat on memory modules. I will hold off sending it to Gigabyte service as I don't have good memories of them, so until it overheats or stops working I will use it. But if you have a vertical case or stand then be aware.\" Rather than issue a recall of the affected cards, Gigabyte acknowledged the situationin a press releasepublished last month. The company previously admitted, \"In some early production batches for the GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 50 Series, a slightly higher volume of [the thermal] gel was applied to ensure sufficient thermal coverage.\" The company claims the amount of thermal gel applied has since been adjusted, adding, \"While the appearance of extra gel might be concerning, this cosmetic variance does not affect the card's performance, reliability, or lifespan.\" In that April press release, the company also explained its thermal gel \"is engineered to ensure optimal contact across uneven component surfaces, and is applied via a fully automated process to minimize human variance compared with traditional thermal pads.\" The company also attempted to reassure, \"The thermal conductive gel is an insulating, deformable, putty-like compound. It is engineered to remain in place when applied properly, and can endure at least 150 °C before any melting or liquification could happen.\" Gigabyte also maintains its quality assurance testing is rigorous, accounting for not only performance under heavy loads, but \"multi-axis drops and vibration testing,\" as well as \"vertical and horizontal installation orientations.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While I have yet to find any reports of this thermal gel slippage negatively impacting the function or performance of Gigabyte's RTX 50-series, it's far from an ideal situation. For one, components that should've been covered by the thermal gel now potentially aren't, which may impact the long-term performance of the card itself. For another, this gel could possibly continue to slip into crevices within your PC case that would be a mission to clean at best. That said, we don't yet know just how widespread this thermal gel slippage actually is. So, let's stick to what we do know:Gigabyte's 50-series cards have been available for not even three months, with the Gigabyte Aorus Master Ice RTX 5080 mentioned up topcosting as much as $1,900 from Amazonright now. That's a lot of money to spend on a card with such a concerning issue—cosmetic or otherwise. Right now, it doesn't seem like a major disaster ofmelting cable proportions—we've no data about the GPUs performing notably worse over time, or whether the compound has, in fact, leaked entirely from the necessary contact points—but it's still not a great look for the company especially when we are talking about some very expensive graphics cards.

    "article_text": "Creating a digital world isn't as easy as you might think. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Prologue: Go Wayback!is an upcoming survival game made by PlayerUnknown Productions, the devs behind PUBG.It's pretty hard going, with an unforgiving environment and survival mechanics like hunger, thirst, and temperature all constantly on your back, making it harder to cross the rocky and confusing terrain. But its difficulty isn't actually the main appeal of Prologue; it's probably the fact that its map, which is randomly generated, is going to be 100x100 kilometres. It's an impressive bid to make a massive, realistic world for a survival game to be set in, but it's also no easy task. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together \"We didn't have a serious plan,\" creator Brendan Greene says in an interview withEpic Games. \"The leadership team I had at the start, up until a year and a half ago, wasn't the right team to lead the studio. They didn't have enough experience making games. I don't think they fully accepted the vision from my side. I was a photographer, graphic designer, and then someone gave me a bunch of money and a studio. I had very little experience, so there's a deep learning curve. \"They sat down and went, 'Can we do this? Here's the vision. [Greene] wants to do millions of players, Earth-scale worlds—basically a digital place,'\" he says. \"After 10 minutes of hemming and hawing, they were like 'Oh wow, we can do this,' and they came back with a plan.\" Prologue is set tolaunch into Early Access soon, with the idea being that players get to test out all the maps and see if the generative AI, which helps make a new map every time a player launches the game, is up to scratch. \"This is a long, one-plus-year Early Access,\" director Scott Davidson says. \"Then a couple of years of post-full-launch support. We haven't figured it out fully.\" While what Early Access will look like is not entirely nailed down, Greene makes it clear that the main goal is just to make enough money to fund the second game and the next stage ofProject Artemis. \"We haveGo Wayback, which will fund us into Game Two, hopefully. We're also looking at raising funding at the moment,\" Greene says. \"I want to insulate the team from having to worry about making products to sell, because that often destroys some really good ideas.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even if it hasn't been tested by the general public yet, Greene seems to think it'll do just fine: \"I could see the possibility of the platform, and especially emergence. That's what made me fall in love. Seeing this kind of survival game where you tell your own story, rather than it being a path you're meant to follow, filled me with a lot of excitement. \"I always wanted to do a bigger survival game, because I loved what happens in Rust and this emergent space,\" Greene continues. \"I thought with 100x100 kilometres, you could do trade routes, or if there was a mountain where you knew there was iron, you could maybe become a salesperson for iron and become very wealthy that way, or a warlord.\" Fromwhat I played of Prologue, I'm not really sure how you'd manage to become a warlord. I spent most of my time doing up a cabin I found and getting scared by my own shadow, so again, not sure what the naked and afraid to warlord pipeline looks like, but I have no doubt someone out there could probably nail it. Lofty, evil warlord ambitions aside, Prologue's Early Access will hopefully just provide players with a fun, decent survival experience. \"I just want to deliver something that is stable and enjoyable,\" Greene says. \"The gameplay is there. It still needs polish. It still needs balance. But I enjoy playing it, and there's not a whole lot of games I enjoy playing.\" Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "article_text": "Let me give you a clue: it involves money. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you want to acquireNew Land BeyondinDestiny 2, it's important to preface one thing: you're going to have to open your wallet. For now at least, as with past pre-order exotics, there's no way to get this weapon for free in the game—though there likely will be in future. Shelling out cash now just gives you immediate access to the new exotic sniper rifle. Beyond revealing this new bolt-action exotic, Bungie also showed us the next four expansions coming to the game in the Edge of Fate stream, including one that'sheavilyinspired by Star Wars. If you were in doubt, one of the pre-order bonuses for the Ultimate Edition includes skins for Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous. Either way, here's how to currently get No Land Beyond in Destiny 2. To get New Land Beyond, you need topre-order the Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition for Destiny 2, which is to say, the highest purchase tier for the upcoming year of content. Sadly, as with previous pre-order exotics like Quicksilver Storm for Lightfall, and Tessellation for The Final Shape, spending a heap of cash is the only way to get the new exotic at the present moment. The good news is that, if all works the same as it did for previous expansions,you'll eventually be able to get New Land Beyond for free in-game, most likely by purchasing it from the Monument to Lost Lights exotic archive in the Tower. This is how it worked for Tesselation and Quicksilver Storm, so don't give up your dream of getting the gun just yet. If you do go through with purchasing the Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition, you'll also get all the playable content for the year, including the Renegades expansion, the battle passes, those three Star Wars outfits, an exotic sparrow, an emote, plus an exotic catalyst and ornament (presumably also for New Land Beyond). Just make sure to grab New Land Beyond in-game after you've pre-ordered. You usually collect pre-order bonuses from the Special Deliveries Terminal in the Tower, to the right of gunsmith Banshee-44, but it looks like you actuallyclaim New Land Beyond from the Exotic Archiveby your vault, under the Edge of Fate exotics section. Check both to be on the safe side.

    "title": "Nvidia and MediaTek rumoured to announce new Windows on Arm laptop chips at Computex 2025",
    "article_text": "The show kicks off in a few weeks, so AMD APUs could have stiff competition very soon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At the end of last year, I listed a possible Nvidia laptop chip (ie, not just the GPU but the CPU, too) as something I'd really like to see from 2025, and since then we've had plenty of intimations that we might actually see such a thing. Now, we're hearing this might be announced at Computex later this month. According toComputerBase(machine translated), \"the official unveiling [of an Nvidia PC chip] is now expected at Computex 2025.\" This wouldn't be a solo venture, though, as it's expected to be made in partnership with MediaTek, based on the Nvidia and MediaTek GB10 chip that sits insideDGX Sparkhome-user supercomputer (previously calledProject Digits). If it is based on GB10, that would presumably mean a processor using its Arm-designed CPU cores rather than custom Nvidia-designed ones. This wouldn't be a massive surprise, but there was previously at least some reason to believe that it could be using custom-designed chips, givenprevious rumoursand that Nvidia recentlyannounced a custom-designed Arm chip called Verato succeed its previous Arm-designed Grace chips. Whether it's custom or Arm-designed, it will be an Arm chip, meaning much will rely on Windows on Arm (WoA). We've seen Arm chips using WoA in the wild over the past year in the form of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips that sit inside some laptops. These have great battery life, but there are still some problems with Windows on Arm, especially for gaming. That's mainly thanks to Prism emulation thatstill struggles with some games. WoA does seem to be steadily improving, though, and one can only assume Nvidia would have a better time of getting gaming to work than Qualcomm, given the company is already king of the Windows graphics space. Still, there's not a lick that Nvidia can do about Prism emulation itself, so it won't be entirely in the chip giant's hands. To be clear, that an Nvidia PC chip is in the works isn't all based on rumours: At the start of this year, Nvidiaofficially confirmed it is working on an end-user system on a chip (SoC)based on DGX Spark. Now, bothNvidiaandMediaTekwill be delivering keynotes at Computex on May 19 and 20, respectively, so it makes sense that both companies would use this as a chance to announce an upcoming collaborative consumer SoC. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. ComputerBase points out that,according to DigiTimes, MediaTek has booked additional capacity for semiconductor assembly and testing with ASE, implying that this is because of the upcoming laptop chips. Without seeing what this additional capacity is officially booked for, however, we can't say for certain. We also can't say for certain how such chips will perform. Previous rumours had it that the upcoming SoCshould have RTX 4070 mobile and Strix Halo-level performance, and ComputerBase speculates that instead of the 20 CPU cores in the GB10, the laptop chips will likely have \"perhaps only eight to twelve, and the RAM [is] likely to be a quarter of that or even less, i.e. 32 or 16 GB—depending on which market segment is ultimately targeted.\" Whatever the case, it's certainly an exciting prospect that we could have an Nvidia chip sitting inside some laptops, which would presumably be low-power ones given Arm chips tend to be very efficient. And that they might give us all the benefits of theBlackwellGPU architecture for gaming. And we might not have too long to find out. Roll on Computex.

    "article_text": "Leonida's people and places all in one spot. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Grand Theft Auto 6 recently droppedits second trailer. It was almost three entire minutes filled with plenty of action—both on the streets and in the sheets—but if that wasn't enough for you, Rockstar also went ahead and dumped 84 brand-new screenshots and bits of artwork to feast your eyes upon. They're damn good pics, too, giving us a closer look atGrand Theft Auto 6's charactersand locations within Leonida. There are plenty of details so pour over, so we've gone ahead and compiled all the pics for you down below. Give them a peep: Located on Leonida's northern border, Mount Kalaga shows off the state's wilder side. Rockstar'sofficial websitesays the area offers \"prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails,\" with plenty of colourful characters dwelling in the thick of Mount Kalaga's backwoods. Touted as\"the untameable jewel of Leonida's crown,\" Grassrivers looks to be swampy as hell and full of alligators. I wonder if this is where we see that gator in the first trailer? If you're afraid of water, the Leonida Keys perhaps isn't the place for you. If you like waterandwatering holes, however, this seems like the perfect location. It may be newer and shinier, but modern-day Vice City hasn't changedthatmuch from the '80s, it seems. It's colourful and chaotic all at once, and it's the location Rockstar seems to be pushing the most across its two trailers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Leonida's industrial area. There's a big ol' sugar refinery here, as well as a biker gang we'll inevitably be crossing paths with in one or two quests. The official website says \"old school values still reign supreme,\" so I'm interested to see what sort of folk Jason and Lucia run into here. Rockstar calls Port Gellhorn \"Leonida's forgotten coast,\" being a run-down area with abandoned lots and seedy spots. Apparently it was once popular among tourists, but its current state doesn't look like a particularly friendly place to vacation. As Grand Theft Auto 6's two protagonists, it only makes sense that Rockstar has dropped a whole bunch of screenshots for both Lucia and Jason. They're a pretty good glimpse into both characters: Lucia as a trained fighter, Jason as a good friend of Cal Hampton with some sort of army-related firearms training. There's still shockingly few of them together outside of illustrations, though, but it's nice to see what their lives look like outside of each other. Rockstar has introduced us to a wealth of supporting characters due to appear in Grand Theft Auto 6: Brian Heder, Raul Batista, Real Dimez, Cal Hampton, Boobie Ike, and Dre'Quan Priest. We've already done an overview of allGrand Theft Auto 6 charactersrevealed so far, if you want extra info on who this colourful cast are.

    "title": "Forget megabucks Nvidia GPUs, apparently all you need to run an LLM is a Pentium II CPU from 1997",
    "article_text": "The catch? It's kinda slow, as in 20,000 times slower than a GPU. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Conventional wisdom says you need a mountain of Nvidia GPUs at about $50,000 a pop to have a chance of running the latest AI models. But apparently not. EXO Labs (viaIndian Defence Review) claims to have got the Llama 2 LLMup and running on a Windows 98 box circa 1997 courtesy of a mere Pentium II processor. Hurrah! The catch? It's running about 20,000 times slower than on a modern GPU. Haroo. Apparently, Exo Labs picked up the machine for just under $120 on eBay, following which perhaps the biggest headache was getting peripherals to work, what with the legacy PS2 ports and just a single USB input. Indeed, getting the required files onto the machine was a serious headache. Then there was compiling the files in a format which was compatible with the Pentium II's ancient instruction set. Anywho, with the code and hardware sorted, it was time to run Llama 2. Reportedly, the 260K parameter version of the model achieved 39.31 tokens per second on the Pentium II, while the larger 15M parameter version hit just 1.03 tokens per second. They even tried a partial data model run using a one billion parameter version of Llama 3.2 which returned a glacial 0.0093 tokens per second. To put that into context, there are references to the one billion parameter 3.2 model hitting 40 tokens per second on Arm CPUs and200 tokens per second on GPUs. In other words, it's running about 20,000 times slower on the Pentium II. But hey, it's running. The comparison isn't perfect, there are all kinds of variables in terms of how the models are set up. But that 20,000 times figure probably gives the right idea in terms of the performance delta in rough order of magnitude terms. Indeed, while it's impressive to get a modern LLM running on such an old CPU, the performance gap is a reminder that speed matters. Actually, it's a bit like 3D gaming. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Compiled correctly, you'd could no doubt get Cyberpunk 2077 running in full path-traced mode on a Pentium II at 4K. But you'd probably be looking a frame rate similar to the P II's 0.0093 tokens per second performance. At which point, it's all a bit academic. But maybe it would be fun to watch the pixels being rendered, one-by-one. On the other hand, completing a benchmark run could take years. Perhaps we'll leave all that, for now.

    "title": "The US DOJ recommends Google break up its ad-tech platform in light of illegal monopoly claims. Google disagrees, unsurprisingly",
    "article_text": "This could majorly affect the operation of Google platforms. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After accusing Google of running a 'decade-long campaign of exclusionary conduct', arguments have finally been made about how exactly Google can right the monopoly it allegedly holds. If the DOJ gets its way, that would result in Google breaking up major ad platforms AdX and DFP. Google has been in a bit of hot water for, well, a long time, thanks to its near-total domination of the online search market. Owning the means to search, plus the advertising platform around it, has led to two separate but equally big cases in the last few years. The case about Google's advertising ruled thatGoogle was running an illegal monopolyjust last month, and recent litigation has gone forward on how to remedy it. As reported byReuters, there are eight central remedies proposed by the plaintiff here, with the two most important being the divestiture of Google's ownership of AdX and DFP. AdX is Google's ad marketplace, which facilitates the sale of advertising space to potential advertisers through bidding. The court argues that Google incentivised the use of its platform over competitors as \"publishers would lose significant revenue if they did not use AdX\". The court argues Google should divest AdX through its sale, and the plaintiff is seeking the \"right to approve or disapprove the divestiture buyer.\" The divesting of DFP, Google's ad-serving platform, is the second remedy suggested by the DOJ. The divestiture of DFP is planned to roll out in stages, with the first forcing Google to provide API access and \"server-to-server connection for DFP to integrate with and receive bids from the open-source Prebid header-bidding wrapper\". The second stage pushes Google to change to DFP to allow final auctions of ads within the publisher's ad server. The code for this logic would then be made open source to organisations. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Effectively, this is all intended to demystify DFP, before it is then sold in the third phase. In the courtdocument, the DOJ argues, \"The broad sweep of these remedies is necessitated by the magnitude of Google’s violations—its 'decade-long campaign of exclusionary conduct.'” Google claims it is in favour of some outlined remedies, but argues forcing it to sell its ad tools is an overreach. Lee-Ann Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Reuters, \"The DOJ's additional proposals to force a divestiture of our ad tech tools go well beyond the Court's findings, have no basis in law, and would harm publishers and advertisers.\" The DOJ also argues that Google should be prohibited from \"distorting the competitive process\" after the case is fully concluded. The remedies also argue that Google should be transparent with its data to allow competitors to catch up on the advantage Google has gained through its ad practices. As well as mandating that Google pay for attorney fees and other costs, the outlined remedies argue for ways to monitor Google going forward. As these are proposed remedies, and Google seems to have declared problems it sees with the court ruling, both parties will now reconvene in a September trial to figure out the logistics of how to right Google's perceived wrongs. Ad platforms are a huge part of the way that companies like Google operate, so the divestiture of AdX and FDP will have rather large changes on the incentives in online digital spaces. Losing control of ad tools may change the way Google chooses to serve or work with ad companies, and it's likely to affect the profit it can make from its advertising spaces. Like the potential ofGoogle having to sell off Chrome, there's a complexity to not only the selling process but what the landscape looks like after, and we are due to hear much more about it in just a few months.

    "article_text": "Borderlands Online was revealed just a year before it was shut down. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In 2015 it was announced thatBorderlands Online had been canceled, and a bunch of people asked, \"What was Borderlands Online anyway?\" That's because it was planned to be a China-only MMO set in the Borderlands universe, with the kind of free-to-play model publishers used to see as a good way to \"crack the Asian market\" but wouldn't bother with in the west. Things have changed, hey? Now, modder and dataminer EpicNNG (responsible forWonderlands Redux, among other things), has dug up a build of Borderlands Online and got the character creator working again so a whole new generation can ask, \"What was Borderlands Online anyway?\" Here is gameplay of the Character Creator in Borderlands ONLINE, running for the first time since it got shutdown.Customization for each character is rather limited, but cool regardless.So surreal to have access to this in 2025. pic.twitter.com/8ga6U1gpe8April 29, 2025 Borderlands Online would have cast players as Vault Hunters who crash-land on Pandora, choosing from four character classes: Siren, Soldier, Berserker, and Hunter. It would have featured returning Borderlands NPCs like Claptrap and Dr. Zod, as well as familiar locations like Skag Gully and Tombstone, three PvP modes—last man standing, team vs team, and capture the flag—a gun-crafting system, and guilds. Trailers made it look like a laggier version of the original Borderlands, but it's still an interesting bit of videogame history to see unearthed, 10 years after it was lost. EpicNNG has alreadyfound Counter-Strike map Dust 2 in the Borderlands Online files, though presumably it was just there for testing purposes.

Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains. Starting with a strong wordlike LEASH—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Is the Galaxy S25 Edge ready for its debut? Samsung sets May 12 for virtual Galaxy Unpacked",
    "article_text": "The invite is slim on details When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever sinceSamsungteased its ultra-slim variant of the Galaxy S25 family at itsJanuary 2025 Unpacked, and since then brought theGalaxy S25 Edgeon a bit of a world tour with a stop at MWC, we’ve all been wondering when the tech giant would share more. Well, now we know. Samsung’s just dropped invites for its next Galaxy Unpacked, and it’s an entirely virtual affair with a clear focus – the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even with its ultra-thin design that will land at under theGalaxy S25's7.2-milimeters, it's still poking its way through the center of the invite. The invite image reveals, under a cloth of some kind, the super slim silhouette. It’s accompanied by “Beyond slim” on the left and “May 12, 2025 Live on samsung.com” on the right. That basically gives it away, and Samsung will stream this Galaxy Unpacked at 8pm ET/5pm PT/1am BST/ (10am AEST on May 13, 2025 in Australia) live on its site and onYouTube. A shared blog post from Samsung details much more on this addition to the Galaxy S lineup and actually names the Galaxy S25 Edge, writing, “This is more than a slim smartphone.” It teases that the Galaxy S25 Edge will offer flagship-level performance with ‘superior portability’ without compromising on any of it, seemingly. It also confirms a key spec for the Edge that’s been rummored alongside many others. “Even with its slim form, Galaxy S25 Edge’s 200MP wide lens continues Galaxy’s iconic camera experience, delivering pro-grade capabilities to intuitively capture the world around you,” thus confirming the ultra-slim phone will have a very sharp main shooter. It will also match theGalaxy S25 Ultra, which has the same sensor for the primary lens. Samsung’s really highlighting that it took a lot of engineering work to make the Galaxy S25 Edge a reality and that it didn’t have any shortcomings that would have dropped it from the mainline Galaxy S family of phones. Much of the May 12 Galaxy Unpacked will likely delve into how this device came to be. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We still expect the Galaxy S25 Edge to arrive at a premium price, somewhere above $999 / £999 / AU$1,699. It should feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy inside, considering that’s powering the rest of the lineup. We also expect it to match 12GB of RAM, which should make it a speedy and efficient phone, but we also don’t yet know what size battery Samsung’s been able to squeeze inside the svelte frame. Thelatest rumorspoint to the Galaxy S25 Edge having a titanium frame, weighing only 163 grams, and only 5.85 millimeters thick. That same report claims the Galaxy S25 Edge will have a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, which aligns with previous reports. The best news is that we’re just days away from this being official and Samsung telling us all about the Galaxy S25 Edge. It’s also the start of a new category of sorts – ultra-slim, premium smartphones for the masses, and Samsung will, in turn, be beatingAppleto the punch before the much-rumorediPhone 17 Airsees the light of day. Now, if you’re already sold on the Galaxy S25 Edge – maybe you’ve been holding out on getting an S25, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra – Samsung is rolling out an early offer.You can sign up to reserve the next Galaxy, with no commitment to purchasing or strings attached, and score a $50 Samsung Credit towards the S25 Edge. You can now sign up at Samsung to reserve the next Galaxy and score a $50 credit towards the next device, the Galaxy S25 Edge. As with past reserve offers, this is entirely commitment-free and doesn't cost anything. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "You can use the Google app to decode any eye-watering jargon you read on your iPhone – here’s how",
    "article_text": "The AI-fueled Simplify feature untangles any confusion When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Reading an article on a technical or particularly complex subject sometimes feels like navigating a maze rather than following a narrative.Google's iOS app has a new solution if you come across a scientific paper or an article written by someone a little too fond of being obtuse. The new Simplify feature for Google's mobile app rewrites any jargon-filled internet text into language that doesn't require a specialty dictionary, and without leaving the app. To use Simplify, you'll need to browse the web from the Google app. When you hit a wall of needlessly complicated text, you can highlight it, and a little Simplify button will appear. Tapping the button will rework that highlighted paragraph into something far more comprehensible to the average person. Simplify is essentially a shortcut for Google's Gemini AI. Google Research designed a prompt-optimization process that asks Gemini to transform the text into something easier to understand behind the scenes, activating when you tap the Simplify button. The Simplify button won't utterly change your life or redefine how you engage with content online, but it could cut down on the need for new tabs or at least remove the need to copy and paste opaque text into Gemini orChatGPTevery time you run up against a linguistic roadblock. According to the developers of the Simplify tool, the AI translation not only made dense content easier to parse, but it also helped them remember what they read. It's of a piece with other AI tools rolled out by Google to streamline tedious or annoying bits of people's experiences online. It matches neatly with features likeGoogle Gemini widgetsor the anticipatedPower Up buttonfor improving your prompts. The Simplify feature also falls under the AI enhancement of the browsing experience that Google has deployed (with occasional pratfalls), like the Search Generative Experience and AI Overviews for Search. Simplify feels more directly pitched to individuals, though, since you have to choose to use it. For now, Simplify is iOS-only, and it's not going to be perfect every time. Like any AI tool, it might make a mistake or oversimplify its response and lose some of the nuance found in the original text. That's a tradeoff common to any translation, however. It may also be a tradeoff most users will be happy to make, especially when the alternative is drowning in multisyllabic nonsense about blockchain governance protocols.

    "article_text": "AI-powered search is coming for your browser, and Apple’s holding the door open When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Appleis flirting with the idea of making AI tools the default search option forSafariinstead ofGoogle. As first reported byBloomberg, Apple’s services chief Eddy Cue revealed during testimony this week in the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust trial against Google that Apple is “actively looking at” bringingAI-powered search enginesas a Google replacement. Apple and Google currently have a mutually beneficial and lucrative deal where Google pays Apple around $20 billion a year to remain the default search engine across all Apple devices. That deal was part of the antitrust scrutiny, which led to the revelation of Apple's interest in alternatives. Eddy Cue mentioned several major AIchatbotdevelopers as potential new search partners for Apple, includingOpenAI, Perplexity, Anthropic, and xAI. Cue told the court that searches on Safari actually declined last month for the first time in recent memory, and his theory is that people are starting to swap out standard search engines for AI tools. Instead of typing in “how does Wi-Fi work?” into a search bar, users are askingChatGPTto explain it like they’re five. Cue wasn’t exactly subtle in hinting that Apple thinks traditional search might be on the way out. \"The only way you truly have true competition is when you have technology shifts,\" he said. “AI is a new technology shift, and it’s creating new opportunities for new entrants.” Apple’s already dipped its toes into AI search, linking Siri to ChatGPT and supposedly planning to do the same with Google Gemini. Cue also noted that Apple’s open to adding multiple AI search options directly into Safari, though no decision about a new default was mentioned. AI search tools have some good points, but they come with glaring weaknesses. In particular, they can respond with incomplete, inaccurate, or downright hallucinatory information. Whether those issues are worth the advantages of AI search tools is debatable, but Apple clearly thinks it might be a worthwhile change to make. After all, if people are okay switching from Google to AI tools because they're easier, and despite their errors, that's the direction any company would want to follow. And there's a reason Google has been willing to pay so much for its status on Apple devices. That user base is crucial to its search dominance. Just hinting that it might not be the case forever sent Google’s stock dropping nearly 9% after Cue’s testimony. Apple shares slipped too, but much more modestly. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. None of this may matter if Apple decides it has a good thing with Google as a company and makes Gemini its default search tool with a similar deal. And while AI still can’t quite be trusted to write a college essay or navigate the DMV website, it's already reshaping how we expect to interact with information. That means the tools we use to access that information are going to evolve in a way they haven't since perhaps the widespread adoption of mobile versions of websites.

    "article_text": "Backblaze offers 1 Tbps cloud speeds at $15 per TB When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Americancloud storagecompany Backblaze has launched a new B2 Overdrive tier designed to support AI, HPC, and other high-bandwidth workloads. With prices starting at $15 per terabyte and sustained network throughput of up to 1Tbps, the service positions itself as an affordable option for businesses handling massive data volumes. B2 Overdrive includes storage, read (Get), write (Put), and egress at a single price point. This contrasts with the tiered and often unpredictable pricing models used by competitors. The service is available immediately to customers with multi-petabyte workloads. It complements Backblaze’s existing B2 cloud storage tier, priced at $6 per terabyte per month. That basic tier includes features like object lock immutability and a 99.9% uptime SLA and is often listed among thebest cloud backupservices for small businesses or individual users. B2 Overdrive, by contrast, is aimed at organizations working at scale. According to Backblaze, it delivers 100% performance at roughly one-fifth the cost of AWS S3 and includes free egress up to three times the average monthly storage amount, with additional egress priced at $0.01 per GB. The tier is built on disk-based infrastructure and connects directly to customer environments via secure private networking. It enables data to move freely to GPU clouds or high-performance compute clusters without incurring egress charges. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Backblaze says B2 Overdrive is intended for use cases such as AI and machine learning training, inference, large-scale analytics, media processing, and research computing. Unlike most public cloud storage providers that emphasize latency, Backblaze focuses on sustained throughput. Among major US providers - AWS,GoogleCloud, Azure, and Oracle - Backblaze is the only one to publish throughput numbers directly. Though not a general-purpose solution, B2 Overdrive may appeal to businesses seeking performance and pricing transparency. While not commonly used for photo management, its affordability and expandable storage could make it a contender forarchival photo storageas well. “With B2 Overdrive, we’re challenging the industry’s assumption that organizations must pay colossal prices for colossal performance. We’ve engineered a solution that delivers the sustained high-throughput organizations need, without the egress fees and complex pricing tiers that are pervasive among legacy providers,” said Backblaze CEO Gleb Budman.

    "title": "Spotify’s new ‘snooze’ button will let you blacklist unwanted songs for a month – and I wish it had existed earlier",
    "article_text": "Which earworm will you be giving a 30-Day Snooze? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Spotify has been busy making small tweaks to its mobile app, like finally giving you the option todisable its Smart Shuffle feature– and it's just announced several more, including a potential godsend addition called '30-day Snooze'. While Spotify's music algorithm is one of the things that's kept me with the music streaming service for over a decade, it also has infuriating blind spots, like continually recommending the same song across automated playlists like Discover Weekly or Smart Shuffle. The new '30-Day Snooze' button is designed to fix this, letting you temporarily remove a track from your recommendations (without completely eradicating it from your musical life). Unfortunately, Spotify is only \"starting to test this for Premium users\" but says it's \"planning to bring it to more listeners soon\". 30-Day Snooze will be a bonus option among the tracks that you've chosen to 'hide' from playlists – this is done by tapping the three dots next to a song and hitting 'Hide in this playlist'. The 'Snooze' feature will give you a \"don't suggest this song anywhere for 30 days\" option, which will apply to all personalized playlists. If the feature hasn't rolled out to you yet, Spotify has pushed out some other new tweaks to keep you happy while you wait. The Queue button (the three lines in the bottom-right of the 'Now Playing' view) now gives you handy shortcuts to Shuffle, Smart Shuffle, Repeat, and Sleep Timer. In a tweak related to 30-Day Snooze, Spotify will also now show you the recommended songs it plans to play at the end of your queue, so you can eject any unwanted ones in advance. Spotify's 'Hide' button is also now more powerful – when you tap it, the song will be hidden from that playlist across all your devices, not just the one you're listening on. These changes are an admission from Spotify that its algorithms don't always get everything right, and I can definitely see myself using 30-Day Snooze when it eventually reaches my Premium account. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. For some reason, Spotify has persistently recommended Yo La Tengo's 'Autumn Sweater'across all of my automated playlists. Despite it being the least offensive song ever committed to recorded music, the opening drums now send me into a mild fit of rage, even though it's a perfectly pleasant track. It's my prime candidate for a 30-Day Snooze, and others on the TechRadar team have enthusiastically submitted theirs, including Mk.gee's'Are You Looking Up' after an unfortunate incident where our team's shared playlist was remotely co-opted by our cameras editor's son. One other new feature I'll likely use to escape the algorithm is a tweak to 'Liked Songs'. It's now possible to use this to build playlists: tap on a genre in the 'Liked Songs' playlist, and you'll now see a new 'Make this a playlist' option. We may still not haveSpotify HiFi(will it ever arrive?), whileboth price hikes and optional add-onsare seemingly on the cards – but at least Spotify is still making small, free improvements to save us from persistent earworms.

    "article_text": "New global and regional playlists are out now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Shazam already offers several different charts to track popular songs and the most discovered ones for many countries across the globe. And yes, many of those tracks are likely ones that users – maybe even you – have identified with Shazam on your phone. I mean, we’ve all been there, when we’re out and a song hits, that we can’t quite remember the name of, but we really need to know what it is. That’s where Shazam still hits as an excellent music recognition app. Now, though, it wants to do a better job tracking the music of the moment and the various feeds that could mean a new number-one hit is coming. The Shazam Viral Charts are launching today and are available right now on Shazam’s site and as a playlist onAppleMusic. The collection will consist of an updated daily ‘Global’ playlist with 50 tracks and 42 national charts with 25 songs each. Shazam’s twist here is that it will use unique signals, which likely include what people are recognizing with the app, to highlight and recognize popular, up-and-coming, or classic songs that are on the rise. Shazam is a bit cheeky in the Viral Chart description, noting that it’s not just what is trending on TikTok but taking a full view of the landscape. It says that it will track and identify the songs that are gaining popularity across “streaming, social, and TV placements,” but also tracks that are played in spaces like bars and restaurants. That’s a lot to track—but then again, it’s likely using data that Shazam already has. It also suggests that Shazam’s Viral Charts will feature a mixture of old and new songs across all genres. If you’re keen to listen to a wide variety of music or curious about what songs might be gaining streams in a specific location, Shazam’s Viral Charts are likely worth a try. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. You can view and listen to song previews on theplatform’s site under ‘charts,’but considering Apple owns Shazam, it’s also no surprise that these are integrated as playlists you can follow on the music streaming platform.

But there's some nuance in there that makes these claims somewhat less than clear-cut. While two of the ads, \"The Max Performance You Deserve,\" and \"Office Tripped,\" lean heavily into humor to make their case, the first ad, \"What's the Intel?\", is more pointed and uses the line, “Here’s a little intel on what’s really inside\" Clever, right? Qualcomm squeezed the brand name and the \"Intel Inside\" marketing campaign into one well-crafted dig. It's in this ad where Qualcomm clearly lays out its core premise, stating that the SnapDragon X Elite PC \"runs at max performance when it's unplugged.\" The ad then shows the Intel-based system and says, \"that PC drops to as little as 55%\". Another ad, \"The Max Performance You Deserve,\" focuses on the humor of asking people in various situations to \"give 55%\" of performance of love, of a bonus, of devotion to a country. The video does close with a Qualcomm rep telling a consumer, \"Yup, PCs powered by Intel can cut performance up to 55% when unplugged, but with Snapdragon X Series, max performance when unplugged.\" The last ad, \"Office Tripped,\" shows how \"when PC's powered by Intel perform at 55% when unplugged, it's like your whole team does.\" The ad comically depicts employees half-dressed, tables with half their legs gone, and signage half-lit. You get the idea. Of course, at no point in any of these ads does Qualcomm say that 55% of Intel's performance is worse than Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Series max performance. In fact, based on the systems they used to come up with those numbers, I'm not sure they could. In the fine print, Qualcomm explains the numbers came from a Cinebench 2024 Multi Core benchmark run inWindows 11. The Qualcomm system was aDellXPS 13 with a Snapdragon Elite running at 3.8Hz (unless it's been overclocked to 4.3GHz). It's compared against a Dell XPS 13 running an Intel Core Ultra 9 288V, which is Intel's top-of-the-line Ultra processor running at 5.1 GHz. Considering Qualcomm chose a system running Intel's most powerful Ultra processor, it might be difficult to draw direct comparisons to the Snapdragon X Elite chip. Of course, that's not really what Qualcomm did here. There are no direct performance comparisons. Instead, this is just a measure of how the systems, or rather the CPUs, perform when unplugged. The Intel system slows down its high-end Core Ultra 9 to, I bet, Core Ultra 5 processor-level performance. I would be curious to see what sort of performance hit an Intel Core Ultra 5 (245T) takes when unplugged. It might perform at something far higher than 55%, if not \"max\" performance. Sure, the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Series ads are cutting and funny, but I'm not sure they're entirely fair to Intel. I want my laptops to maintain as much performance as possible when unplugged, but I also want them to maintain battery life. Higher performing chips will draw more power, and the system, depending on how Intel and OEMs configure it, knows enough to reduce that power draw when you unplug the laptop. Snapdragon X Series CPUs were built with mobile in mind. They run at a lower GHz than the fastest-performing X86 chips, and with a lower power draw, of course, they do a better job of maintaining max power. In general, I love the mobile chip in laptops and desktops revolution that was kicked off byAppleSilicon. These mobile SoCs (system on chips) have transformed mobile computing and are a net positive for consumers and the industry, but let's not cloud the issue with ads that seem to make a direct comparison when, in fact, they really don't.

    "article_text": "Anker's new Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds are here When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ankerhas just launched a brand new pair of affordable wireless earbuds: the Anker Soundcore Liberty 5, and just like their predecessors they look like a cheap way to access premium features. The Liberty 5 buds boast some useful features including active noise cancellation, an 12-hour battery life with active noise-cancellation (ANC), which can be extended up to 32 more hours with their charging case. The new buds also offer improved bass performance thanks to dual bass-enhancing tubes that amplify the low frequencies resonance while increasing air flow, which according to Anker leads to more powerful, yet balanced, bass reproduction. What’s more if you’re using an Android device you can access higher quality audio transmission via LDAC – so you should find your audio sounds more complete than it does on non-LDAC earbuds. If you like the sound of these new earbuds they’re available to buy right now onAmazon.com,Soundcore.com, and from select retailers for $129.99 / £99.99 / AU$169.99. This means the buds aren’t quite as affordable as other recentcheap wireless earbudslikePanasonic’s new RB-F10 over-ear headphones, but with a premium suite of features a higher price is to be expected. We haven’t been able to test these earbuds yet, but previous Anker audio products scored well; we gave theAnker Soundcore Liberty 3 Prothree-and-a-half stars, and the older AnkerSoundcore Liberty Air budsearned four stars – though both could have been better.

One of the most useful features coming to devices withAndroid 16will be new battery health tools found in your Pixel phone’s settings app – and we now know which devices will get them when they launch for everyone. Android 16 will likely get detailed atGoogle I/O, but before then some software betas are cluing us into some of its features. This includes new battery health capabilities. The main tool is a stat at the top of the battery health page, which represents your phone’s current max battery capacity as a percentage of what a new standard battery’s capacity would be. For example, if it reads 93% that’sGooglesaying that your phone’s 100% charge is equivalent to a new battery (that is otherwise identical) being 93% charged. It also highlights if your phone’s battery health is normal or not – all batteries degrade over time, but you’ll know if it’s degrading faster than it should be – as well as links to articles which could improve your battery health. It doesn’t necessarily add new protective measures – like theGoogle Pixel 9a’s Battery Health assistance– but it should nevertheless be a handy tool for contextualising why battery health measures are useful, and offer you useful tips if you are struggling to look after your phone’s battery. So it’s a shame to discover that,according to Googlein an Android 16 beta bug report (via, the feature which is currently “supported in Beta 3 onPixel 8aandPixel 9products including 9 Pro Fold” won’t be coming to older Pixel devices due to “product limitations.” Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Google’s phrasing strongly suggests only Pixel 8 phones and newer will get the latest battery health tools – it does leave open the door for it to come to older devices when Android 16 launches in full, though we aren’t holding our breath. Battery health is one of the least flashy but most useful tools software updates can provide. Whether you replace your phone every two years or every five, knowing your device will be as reliable as possible for as long as possible is something we all appreciate. Afterall, no one likes those moments of terror as your phone’s battery ticks down at the worst possible time. Alongside battery changes Android 16 will includea major visual refresh, anew and improved desktop mode, andUSB hack protections.

    "title": "Just good enough: Huawei's new AI chip is only a small stepping stone towards domestic hegemony and an Nvidia-free China",
    "article_text": "Huawei prepares to test Ascend 910D, its most advanced AI chip yet When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Huawei has been stepping up its ambitions to be seen as the Chinese rival toNvidiain recent weeks - first, launching a new AI infrastructure architecture set, theCloudMatrix 384 Supernode, to rival the U.S. chip giant’s NVL72 system. Then, a day after the United States announced plans to further tighten restrictions on AI chip exports to China - including Nvidia's H20 processor - Huawei revealed theAscend 920, its next-generation AI chip, set to enter mass production in the second half of 2025. Now, a report inThe Wall Street Journalclaims Huawei is preparing to test its most advanced AI chip to date, the Ascend 910D, and has approached several Chinese tech companies to begin technical evaluations. Sample batches are expected to be available as soon as late May 2025. The Ascend 910D is the latest iteration of Huawei's AI processors, building on the existing 910B and 910C models. While the chip is not yet commercially available, Huawei reportedly hopes it can match - or even exceed - the performance of Nvidia's H100. Independent analysts are, naturally, skeptical that Huawei will be able to close the performance and ecosystem gap between itself and Nvidia anytime soon. HPCwirereports Neil Shah, VP at Counterpoint Research, as saying: “From an overall system-level design - compute, memory integration, networking scalability, and, crucially, software orchestration - Nvidia remains three generations ahead.” That gap is partly due to Nvidia’s established software stack, notably CUDA, which plays a major role in accelerating and managing AI workloads. Huawei, by contrast, lacks a similarly mature software platform, making it harder to optimize across GPUs or scale across complex AI infrastructures. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite these hurdles, Huawei continues to ship its 910C chips in volume to Chinese data centers and research labs and the move to test the 910D suggests the company is doubling down on efforts to build a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem. Whether the 910D becomes a true rival to Nvidia's H100, or remains a “good enough” option for domestic use, it signals a continuing shift in global AI hardware competition.

    "title": "Sennheiser's new AirPods-like open earbuds get official pricing – and they're a bargain, unless you live in the US",
    "article_text": "The Accentum Open weigh the same as a playing card but sound a lot better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's official: as wereported last month, Sennheiser has a new set of open earbuds called the Accentum Open – and they're cheaper than previous reports predicted, unless you live in the US. The new Accentum Open are available in a choice of cream and black with a recommended retail price of £69.99 / €89.90 / or about AU$145. Unfortunately, US pricing is somewhat steeper at $129.95. Ouch. If you're not familiar with open-style earbud designs, this means you're not plugging a tip into your ear canal and sealing yourself from the outside world. Unlike many of thebest open earbuds,the Accentum Opens are similar to theAirPods 4in offering a stem-like design that sits outside your ear canal. And despite lacking ANC (active noise cancellation), they could be a fine alternative to the AirPods 4 (which cost $129 / £129 / AU$219), depending on where you live... The Sennheiser Open look very like the AirPods 4, with a long stem containing touch controls and a fairly AirPods-esque charging case. Each bud is just 4.4g, roughly the same as a single playing card, and battery life is 6.5 hours per bud and 28 hours with the charging case. Ten minutes of USB charging delivers up to 1.5 hours of listening time. Inside each earbud there's an 11mm dynamic transducer that sits just outside your ear canal, enabling you to listen to music and podcasts in comfort without blocking out the outside world. Sennheiser didn't go into more details, but the product listing on the Thomann retail site says the frequency range is 25Hz to 15,000Hz and that the supported codecs are SBC and AAC. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The earbuds have Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint and there are dual beamforming microphones for clear calling. Overall, a compelling bundle then, particularly if they match the rest of the Accentum line during our testing – though that US price could make them less enticing if you live there.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has expressed displeasure over the pace of the US-brokered negotiations with Russia and Ukraine regarding the current conflict, stating that decisions need to be reached soon. According to US Vice President J.D. Vance, Washington currently considers Russia’s demands for ending the conflict unacceptable.“The Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions, in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,”he said at a Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Trump was asked to comment on Vance’s statement in a press briefing in the White House later in the day. “It's possible that he's right,”the US president replied. We are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made. “I'm not happy about it,”Trump said. Senior figures in the current US administration, including the president himself, have stated that Washington may have to step back from trying to mediate talks over the Ukraine conflict if sufficient progress is not made. “At some point in time, it either has to be something that can happen or we all need to move on. That’ll be a decision the president will have to make,”Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News last week. Washington has reportedly prepared a fresh set of economic sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking sectors, as potential leverage in the talks. Moscow has repeatedly declared that it remains open to peace talks with Kiev. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a 72-hour ceasefire around the upcoming Victory Day celebrations. Ukraine rejected the initiative, demanded an unconditional 30-day truce and increased UAV and missile attacks on Russia. Despite this, the ceasefire offer is still on the table, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Russia’s demands for ending the conflict have remained stable: Ukraine must demilitarize, denazify, abandon ambitions to join NATO, stay neutral and remain free of nuclear weapons. In addition, Kiev needs to recognize the Russian regions of Crimea, Kherson and Zaporozhye as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, Moscow has stated.",

    "article_text": "Germany’s new government has ordered tighter border controls, marking a sharp shift in immigration policy and fulfilling a key campaign promise of Chancellor Friedrich Merz. The leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Merz was elected chancellor on the second attempt on Tuesday after failing his first confirmation vote in parliament earlier in the day. He had pledged to turn back illegal migrants at the border on his first day in office. On Wednesday, newly appointed Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt signed an order banning asylum applications at all land borders. In a letter seen by Bild, he instructed the head of the Federal Police, Dieter Romann, to disregard a directive from 2015. “I hereby withdraw the verbal instruction given… on 13 September 2015,”he wrote. The instruction came from then Chancellor Angela Merkel, who opened Germany’s borders to more than a million migrants at the height of Europe’s 2015–16 refugee crisis. Her open-door policy later drew fierce political backlash and was labeled“disastrous”by critics. Dobrindt said Germany would not close its borders but would significantly tighten control. Police have been instructed to turn people away directly at the border, he told a press conference, noting exceptions for children, pregnant women, and other“vulnerable”groups. The minister added that around 2,000 to 3,000 officers would be added to the current 11,000-strong federal police force stationed at the borders. He emphasized that the new approach should not“place excessive demands”on neighboring states and confirmed consultations were already underway with those countries. Germany has a 3,700km-long land border with nine countries, including Poland, Austria, France, and the Netherlands. All are part of the EU’s Schengen Zone, which allows passport-free travel for most EU citizens and many non-EU nationals. Migration remains one of Germany’s most divisive political issues, with local authorities often warning that the number of asylum seekers is straining their budgets. The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, known for its strong anti-immigration stance, was designated a“confirmed extremist entity”last week by the domestic intelligence agency BfV, which said its activities could threaten Germany’s democratic order. The party filed a legal challenge on Monday. As the EU’s largest economy, Germany remains the top destination for asylum seekers. The country received a quarter (over 237,000) of all asylum applications across the bloc in 2024, though the number was significantly lower in annual terms.",

    "article_text": "The US military’s humanitarian pier mission in Gaza last year resulted in far more injuries, damage, and operational failure than previously publicly acknowledged, an investigation has found. The mission, formally known as Operation Neptune Solace, was launched under the administration of former President Joe Biden in 2024 after the US failed to persuade Israel to expand overland access for humanitarian deliveries. The US military constructed a temporary offshore pier and floating causeway to transfer aid from ships to the Gaza shoreline without entering Israeli or Gazan ports. The Pentagon had since acknowledged that the mission encountered certain challenges, such as rough weather conditions, which caused damage to the pier but did not disclose the full scope of the problems. According to the Department of Defense Inspector General’s report, which was published last week, the mission caused 62 injuries among personnel, including the death of Army Sergeant Quandarius Stanley, who was critically injured aboard a Navy vessel in May 2024 and died five months later. “The Army and Navy did not meet Service-level standards for equipment and unit readiness for their watercraft units,”the report stated, adding that neither service organized, trained, and equipped their forces to meet common joint standards. It also faulted the Transportation Command for shortcomings in logistics planning and exercises. The report also concluded that the mission cost approximately $230 million and led to $31 million in repair costs after more than two dozen watercraft and equipment pieces were damaged. It further underlined the questionable value of the operation, given that it ran for a total of three months but was actually functional for only about 20 days. During that time, the US military said it had delivered approximately 20 million pounds of food and supplies via the pier. However, aid groups had stated that Gaza required that amount on a daily basis to avert famine. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated sharply as a result of Israel’s military response to the attack on its territory by Hamas militants in 2023. Israel has been accused of indiscriminate bombings, deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure, and obstruction of humanitarian aid, which have reportedly led to the deaths of over 50,000 Palestinians. The imposed blockade has led to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and other essential resources, according to international organizations. Humanitarian organizations have repeatedly criticized both the US and Israeli governments for failing to unblock overland aid deliveries to Gaza and dismissed Washington’s efforts to open alternative routes as politically motivated.",

    "article_text": "The European Parliament has warned the European Commission (EC) that it could take it to court if it bypasses EU lawmakers to create a €150 billion ($170 billion) loan program to boost defense spending across the bloc. In March, EC head Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a plan to raise €800 billion to expand military potential across the EU in response to what she described as“a threat coming from Russia”– a claim rejected by Moscow. To raise the money, the Commission used Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows member states in emergencies to approve proposals from the executive branch in Brussels without going through the usual process. On Monday, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola sent a letter to von der Leyen, urging her to change the legal basis for the initiative, threatening to sue the EC if it fails to comply. The adoption of the Commission’s plan without a proper legal basis would end up“putting at risk democratic legitimacy by undermining Parliament’s legislative and scrutiny functions,”the letter read. The EC“will always be available to explain why Article 122 has been chosen as the appropriate legal basis,”its spokesman Thomas Regnier told Euronews. “[Western] Europe faces an unprecedented security threat. As stated by President von der Leyen in her Political Guidelines, Article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances, as the ones we are currently living in,”Regnier stated. The €150 billion loan program is seen by the Commission as a cornerstone of its ‘Readiness 2030’ proposal to invest over €800 billion into defense across the bloc by the end of the decade when – as Brussels claims – Russia would be in a position to attack an EU-member country. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly rejected allegations that Moscow harbors aggressive intentions toward EU countries, calling it“nonsense”designed to alarm Western Europeans and legitimize major increases in defense budgets.",

Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada and described its border with the US as“artificial.”During the meeting with Carney in the Oval Office, Trump reiterated that sentiment and said that a union between Canada and the US would be a“wonderful marriage”and could bring“tremendous”benefits. “When you get rid of that artificially drawn line... when you look at that beautiful formation when it’s together, I’m a very artistic person,”Trump said, recalling his real estate developer background. Carney interjected by stating that“there are some places that are never for sale,”likening Canada to the Oval Office and Buckingham Palace. “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it’s not for sale, it won’t be for sale, ever,”the PM said, adding that the two nations could nevertheless work toward building a strong partnership together. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Carney said he had asked Trump to stop using the term 51st state and described the comments as“not useful.”At the same time, he acknowledged that Trump is the US president and“he’ll say what he wants to say.” The meeting came days after Carney’s election victory, in which his Liberal Party secured a fourth consecutive term. Carney centered his campaign on attacking Trump over tariffs and his insistence on acquiring Canada. At the beginning of their meeting, Trump congratulated the new prime minister and joked,“I think I was probably the greatest thing that happened to him.” Despite ongoing tensions over tariffs, which Trump said would stay in place regardless of what Carney said, both sides ultimately described the talks as positive. “Regardless of anything, we’re going to be friends with Canada,”the US president told reporters. Meanwhile, Carney called the discussions“wide-ranging”and“very constructive”and stated that trade negotiations would continue, including during the upcoming G7 summit in Canada’s Alberta province.",

    "title": "‘Absolute insanity’ – Hungary slams EU plan to halt Russian energy imports",
    "article_text": "The European Commission’s plan to completely phase out Russian fuel imports violates the sovereignty of EU member states by depriving them of the right to choose their energy sources, according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Brussels has outlined plans to end the bloc’s energy reliance on Moscow by completely eliminating imports of oil, gas, and nuclear fuel in the coming years. Hungary obtains over 80% of its gas from Russia via pipeline, with LNG playing a supplementary role. Budapest has continued to strengthen its energy ties with Moscow despite the sanctions introduced by the EU in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. “The forced, artificially ideological-based exclusion of natural gas, crude oil, and nuclear fuel originating from Russia will lead to severe price increases in Europe, seriously harming the sovereignty of European countries, and cause major difficulties for European companies,”Szijjarto said in a video he shared on his Facebook page on Tuesday, adding that“what was announced is absolute insanity.” “Everyone in Brussels has lost their common sense,”the foreign minister exclaimed, emphasizing that Budapest would not allow the European Commission (EC) to violate Hungary’s sovereignty and would“uphold the right to source energy from where it reliably arrives and where it arrives at a low cost.” Earlier in the day, the EC published a“roadmap”outlining its ambitious strategy to end reliance on Russian energy by the end of 2027. The bloc’s executive branch said it would propose legislation in June requiring all member states to draft“national plans”to terminate their imports of Russian gas, nuclear fuel, and oil. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico also criticized the plan, calling the proposal“economic suicide.”He added that Slovakia would push for changes in the legislative process. Brussels announced its intention to wean EU members off Russian energy shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Supplies of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) have since replaced much of the cheaper pipeline gas previously delivered by Russia. Although Russian pipeline gas supplies to the EU have plummeted, the bloc has been increasing its imports of LNG from the sanction-hit nation. Last year, Russia still accounted for around 19% of the EU’s total gas and LNG supply, according to the EC.",

    "title": "German defense minister pushing for ‘drastic’ budget hike – Reuters",
    "article_text": "German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is seeking a major hike to the country’s military budget effective this year, Reuters has reported, citing sources. Pistorius, the only minister to retain his role under Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government, has previously claimed that Russia may attack a NATO country and that Germany“must be ready for war by 2029.” Moscow has repeatedly dismissed the claims as“utter nonsense.” Pistorius, according to a Reuters source, hopes for a“drastic increase”to over €60 billion ($68.21 billion) for the military in 2025, up from €51.8 billion in 2024. In an interview in December, he proposed an annual defense budget of up to €90 billion ($102 billion)“from 2028 onwards… due to the tightened security situation.” Total German military expenditure in 2024 actually amounted to up to €90 billion ($88 billion), the first time Berlin has met its NATO spending target. European NATO members have been under increasing pressure from the US to boost military spending. In March, the European Commission proposed a €800 billion plan to militarize the bloc. US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Pistorius in April that Washington wants“European allies to assume primary responsibility”for their security and urged his counterpart to“actualize defense spending increases.” New German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, announced a new package of armored vehicles, air-defense rockets, and howitzers for Keiv last month. Merz also suggested he could approve delivery of long-range Taurus missiles to the Ukrainian army, a move resisted by former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for fear of escalating the conflict. Moscow has warned that any cruise missile attack on Russian facilities or critical transport infrastructure with the assistance of the German armed forces would be seen as the country’s direct involvement in military operations. The ongoing militarization of the EU amounts to an“incitement of war on the European continent,”according to Moscow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova recently said the bloc“has degraded into an openly militarized entity and become de facto a branch of NATO.”",

    "title": "Pakistan vows retaliation for Indian cross-border attacks",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has accused India of killing civilians in a cross-border military operation overnight and promised a forceful response. In the attacks, Indian forces targeted what New Delhi described as“terrorist camps”in the neighboring country. The escalation follows a terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory that left 26 civilians dead last month. The Indian government has accused Islamabad of harboring an armed group linked to the incident and characterized the pre-dawn missile and drone strike on Wednesday as retaliation. The Pakistani National Security Committee (NSC) has dismissed India’s justification for the military action, calling it an“unprovoked, cowardly and unlawful act of war”in a statement issued after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Islamabad maintains the targeted sites were civilian areas and that the terrorist camps described by India are“imaginary.”Reports from Pakistan have mentioned at least 26 fatalities and 46 injuries. The NSC also claimed that Pakistani forces downed five Indian aircraft involved in the operation, including fighter jets and drones. ”Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defense, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing,”the statement warned, urging the international community to hold New Delhi accountable for alleged violations of international law. New Delhi described its Operation Sindoor as“focused, measured and non-escalatory,”targeting locations associated with the terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The April attack was claimed by a group called The Resistance Front, reportedly an offshoot of LeT, which India identified as the mastermind behind the incident. Russia has condemned the initial attack in Kashmir, with the Foreign Ministrystatingthat Moscow“objects to any terrorist activities and emphasizes the need for the international community to unite to effectively fight against this evil.”The country has urged both New Delhi and Islamabad to exercise restraint and pursue diplomatic solutions to their differences.",

    "title": "This is the Russia-Ukraine lesson India has to learn from its standoff with Pakistan",
    "article_text": "There is plenty to say about the chaos unfolding in Washington these days, but the sudden military escalation between India and Pakistan shifts our attention elsewhere – and provides some useful lessons. Since the start of Russia’s military operation against Ukraine, India’s official stance has generally aligned with Moscow’s interests. Yet it has consistently stressed the importance of peace. While many in India’s political and media elite – especially the pro-Western crowd – have criticized Russia, their views have been shaped by alignment with the West, not by deeper national principles. India’s official line, however, has always been dressed in polished diplomatic language, designed to project wisdom and balance. Early in the conflict, India’s Ambassador to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj, said: “India has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence.” Fast forward to 2024, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi added: “The conflict in Ukraine is a matter of deep concern for all of us. India firmly believes that no problem can be solved on the battlefield. We support dialogue and diplomacy for early restoration of peace and stability.” And of course, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar offered a soundbite which was repeated endlessly in international forums: “Wars are not the way to settle disputes.” The consistent refrain at countless conferences about“peace in Europe”boiled down to this: Russia was old-fashioned, clinging to outdated great power logic. The world had moved on, they insisted. And inevitably, some“public intellectual”would spice things up with a quote from Chanakya, Confucius, or even the Pope – advising Russia on how real diplomacy should look today. It was all reminiscent of a famous scene in Aleksei Balabanov’s 2005 movie Dead Man’s Bluff, where a bandit from the polished 2000s lectures his 1990s Russian counterparts:“Why do you keep shooting? Business is done differently now.” It wasn’t just the Indians who pushed this line. The Chinese, Brazilians, Turks (yes, them too), and other so-called“rising powers”repeated similar mantras. Now, let’s be clear: no one should gloat. War is a terrifying and extreme manifestation of unresolved contradictions. However, to pontificate about“wisdom”and peace as if it’s a fresh insight is banal – and, frankly, vulgar. Because when real danger arrives – when an enemy or existential threat targets your home – there is no high-minded choice left. States, like individuals, take up arms and fight for victory in order to restore peace. That’s not bloodlust; it’s the basic logic of international relations, from ancient kingdoms to today’s global order. You can deny it, but you can’t make it disappear. Western propaganda’s greatest success over the past three years was convincing much of the world that Russia’s offensive was a“war of choice”rather than a“war of necessity” –which it was. Many in the so-called rising powers naively believed that every conflict offers a choice, and that they themselves would never resort to arms. But history teaches otherwise. When survival and national security are truly at stake, even the most idealistic states will – without even realizing it – abandon their slogans and do whatever is necessary. That, too, is a timeless law of international life. As the Bible reminds us:“While people are saying, ‘Peace and safety,’ destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape”(1 Thessalonians 5:3). What should Russia do now? Stay the course – finish what we started. And be prepared for new challenges on other fronts. At the same time, we should follow diplomatic protocol and call on India and Pakistan to resolve their crisis peacefully. We can even offer to host peace talks, if needed. Because while the reality of conflict remains unchanged, so too must our commitment: Victory first. Peace second. Happy World War Two Victory Day – to us, and to peace.",

    "title": "Who der Leyen: The EU has a major, unfixable problem with its foreign policy",
    "article_text": "This one stings. When asked how the EU might dodge US President Donald Trump’s tariff hammer, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent replied,“My observation... goes all the way back to [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger’s statement: ‘When I call Europe, who do I call?’ So, we’re negotiating with a lot of different interests.”Translation: You can’t sit with us until you stop fighting at your own lunch table. Sure, the continent is tripping over its own policies and tumbling down an economic staircase, but at least everyone’s falling in sync. Brussels tightens the“unity”straitjacket, and they all cheer, or risk getting whacked back into line. Unity is the brand. Unity is the product. Unity is the hashtag. “Only together can we address the grave challenges we face,”unelected European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in January 2024. “It is thanks to all this that in the last five years, Europe has weathered the fiercest storm in our economic history. And we overcame an unprecedented energy crisis. We did this together, and we can do it again. And we have the political will. Because when Europe is united, it gets things done,”she said in an address earlier this year at the Davos World Economic Forum, explaining how solidarity will help the EU weather the problems created by its own policies. “The EU’s strength lies in its unity, including when confronted with major health crises. European solidarity, in sharing medical supplies, treating patients or helping repatriate citizens, and in the reconstruction of our economies, helped us to protect our citizens together and overcome the most difficult phases of the pandemic,”she said in 2023 about the Covid fiasco, during which she brokered a non-transparent deal for jabs with her pal, the CEO of Pfizer, viatext messagesthat have since vanished. Contracts which ultimately left EU member stateson the hookeven after they had no use for the jabs. “This 4th Ukraine meeting was another demonstration of European unity,”Queen Ursula posted a month ago on social media. Of course it was. What isn’t? Even just this week, in evoking fires in Israel and EU assistance, she wrote on social media that it was“EU solidarity in action.” Unity and solidarity are important to the EU in the same way that the concept of family is important to evoke every time two toddlers want to poke each other’s eyes out with crayons. As in,“you’re supposed to be brothers, so play nice!”All that helps to paper over the unfortunate history of family infighting and battlefield beatdowns. Enter Scott Bessent, politely suggesting that he’s not impressed by the EU’s unity thirst traps. And that hits deep. It’s like telling someone that what they think is their very best feature is really their worst. Say, for example, you really love your own butt, have been spending years in the gym doing every kind of squat, lunges, hip thrusts, and you’re so proud of your butt – and then one day, someone you’re interested in is like,“You know, you should really work on those glutes more.”That’s exactly what Bessent’s comment is when he says that the problem with the EU is their lack of unity. Nothing the US can do about it, he implies – just a little friendly feedback. Back to the gym, Brussels. And Queen Ursula must be fuming since she talks like it’s her best feature and she already spends all day and night obsessing over it. How is she possibly supposed to do more when she’s already maxed out on her unity obsession? Which is all superficial by the way. Her unity-at-any-cost talk really just means that dissent from countries that disagree is quashed. And those dissenters are typically those with ideological views and approaches similar to Trump’s that place their own country’s interests above those dictated by a supranational institution of global governance. This is some brutal negging on the part of the Trump administration saying basically, look, you’re not as hot as you think you are. So go work on yourself and then maybe get back to us afterwards. Because this is a YOU problem. Bessent specially mentioned the wide variation within the bloc when it comes to taxation of digital services.“We want to see that unfair tax on one of America’s great industries removed,”Bessent said. Funny how they can’t agree on that, but have no problem marching in step behind the Digital Services Act, which basically deputizes“fact-checkers, civil society, and third-party organizations with specific expertise on disinformation,”to keep EU internet users“safe and accountable.”When it comes to taxes, the EU is a jazz band. When it comes to censorship, they’re a military parade. Meanwhile, von der Leyen reportedly tried to book time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago before his inauguration. No dice. Her staff was ghosted by the White House despite blowing up its phone. When she finally caught up with Trump in Rome at Pope Francis’ funeral, it was said to be… not exactly a summit. More like a celeb sighting. Word is that Trump told her they’d meet. Perhaps just to get her to release his hand. Other than the fact that Queen Ursula is unelected, unlike all the leaders of individual EU nations with whom Trump has been meeting, why else might he be ignoring the EU’s top boss? Well, maybe it’s the constant scolding.“Global markets are shaken by the unpredictable tariff policy of the US administration,”von der Leyen said this week at a political gathering in Spain.”My friends, we cannot and we will not allow this to happen. We have to double down on our hallmark policies of open markets of win-win trade and investment partnership, and of free and fair trade.” Bessent’s whole“fix yourselves first”vibe also lines up with Trump's vice president, J.D. Vance’s stance. According to the UKIndependent, Vance reportedly wants future trade deals tied to countries, like the UK, abandoning speech-curbing laws. So if the Trump doctrine is a world order of free nations over rule by top-down globalist committee, then using trade as a crowbar to pry open authoritarian institutions certainly checks out.",

    "title": "New German chancellor tells US to ‘stay out’ of Berlin’s affairs",
    "article_text": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has told the US government to“stay out”of his nation’s domestic politics. It comes after Trump administration officials slammed the designation of Germany’s second-largest party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), as an“extremist”organization. Following the move last week by Berlin’s domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, US Vice President J.D. Vance said the“German establishment”had“rebuilt”the Berlin Wall. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in turn, declared that the EU’s largest economy has become“a tyranny in disguise”and called upon the German authorities to change course. Merz, who was elected chancellor only after failing his first confirmation vote in parliament, told the broadcaster ZDF on Tuesday that“absurd observations”were emanating from Washington regarding the treatment of the right-wing party AfD by German authorities. The chancellor stressed he“would like to encourage the American government… to largely stay out of”German domestic politics. The 69-year-old politician noted that he“did not interfere in the American election campaign”last year, which ended with Trump winning a second term in the White House. He also expressed his belief that US politicians should not support AfD because they“can clearly distinguish between extremist parties and parties of the political center.” Merz said he is planning a phone call with Trump on Thursday, with their first face-to-face meeting set for the NATO summit in the Hague on June 24 and 25. When asked about the possibility of AfD being outlawed in Germany altogether, the chancellor said the German government needed to show restraint on the issue.“Ten million AfD voters, you cannot ban them,”Merz argued. He said the ruling CDU/CSU alliance should instead focus on addressing the causes pushing people to vote for the right-wing party. AfD demands tighter immigration and asylum laws and opposes the“woke agenda.”It achieved its best ever result in February’s election, clinching 20.8% of the vote and finishing second after CDU/CSU, which got 28.5%. The party filed a lawsuit on Monday challenging the BfV’s decision to classify it an“extremist”organization.",

    "article_text": "Belgium will only be able to deliver F-16s to Ukraine“in the years to come,”Defense Minister Theo Francken has said, after his country initially promised to provide Kiev with jets last year. Brussels must first receive its own delivery of F-35s from the US, Francken stated. Belgium – along with fellow NATO members Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway – pledged in 2023 to arm Kiev with up to 80 F-16s after receiving permission to do so from the administration of then-US President Joe Biden. Last year, Ukraine received about 20 of the aircraft from Denmark and the Netherlands. Speaking at an event organized by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington on Tuesday, Francken claimed Belgium was Kiev’s“biggest supporter on the air domain,”despite his country not yet providing Ukraine with any planes. Brussels is“delivering 30 working F-16s [to Ukraine] in the years to come, as soon as possible,”he added. Francken explained the delay by saying that“when we have our F-35s [from the US], we will give the F-16s because we have DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) capacity in Belgium.” He insisted that Belgium is“very forward leaning”towards Kiev and“will support [Vladimir] Zelensky and every Ukrainian because it is very important.” Last month, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the country will send two non-operational F-16s to Ukraine to be used for spare parts by the end of 2025. De Wever also announced that Brussels will provide €1 billion ($1.1 billion) in military support to Kiev annually. According to Francken, the package“will pass the government within a few weeks.” Last week, the US approved a $310.5 million deal to sustain Ukrainian-operated F-16s, which includes training, spare parts, aircraft modifications, logistics assistance, and software support for the fourth-generation aircraft. The Defense Ministry in Moscow reported in April that Russian air defenses had shot down an F-16, making it the second confirmed loss of a US-designed jet operated by Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities initially claimed that F-16s would be a game-changer in the conflict with Russia. However, their use in combat has been limited, with the aircraft mainly being deployed away from the contact line for air defense purposes.",

    "article_text": "The US Supreme Court has permitted the White House to enforce its ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, overturning a lower court’s injunction and allowing the policy to take effect amid ongoing legal challenges. The 6–3 decision reinstating US President Donald Trump’s executive order“Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness”was made on May 6, 2025. Issued a week after Trump returned to office in January, the executive order prohibits transgender individuals from enlisting and requires the US Defense Department to identify and dismiss all service members who have“a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria.” The Supreme Court’s ruling lifts a nationwideinjunctionpreviously issued by a federal judge in Washington state in March. Under the reinstated policy, individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service unless they serve in their biological sex and do not seek to undergo transitioning. The Department of Defense has been directed to implement the policy, which includes halting sex-change operations and other related procedures for transgender service members. Trump first banned transgender people from serving in the US military in 2017. Former President Joe Biden repealed the ban shortly after taking office in 2021, only for Trump to reinstate it during his second term. Since returning to office, Trump has rescinded dozens of executive orders signed by his predecessor, including at least a dozen measures aimed at promoting the interests of racial minorities and the LGBTQ community. He also issued a formal decree recognizing only two genders – male and female – which, according to the order, cannot be changed. Trump further ended federal support for what he described as the“chemical and surgical mutilation”of children using puberty blockers, hormones, and medical procedures for individuals under the age of 19.",

    "article_text": "The US Navy has lost another fighter jet in the Red Sea, marking the second incident involving an F/A-18 Super Hornet from the USS Harry S. Truman in just over a week, and the third such loss since Washington intensified operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The aircraft reportedly plunged into the sea after experiencing an arrestment failure while attempting to land on the carrier, forcing both the pilot and weapons systems officer to eject. CNN first reported the incident on Tuesday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter. “The arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard. Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 11,”an unnamed defense official told USNI News.“The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured.” The incident reportedly occurred the same day the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group“took a shot”at the Truman, though it remains unclear whether the two events are connected. A formal investigation is underway, while the US Navy has yet to officially confirm the details. Just last week, another F/A-18 fell off the Truman during evasive maneuvers to avoid incoming Houthi missile fire. In a separate incident last December, an F/A-18 was mistakenly shot down by the guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg shortly after launching from the Truman for bombing raids against Houthi targets in Yemen. Each F/A-18 Super Hornet costs between $60 million and $70 million, according to Pentagon estimates. The Houthis have also claimed to have shot down more than a dozen American MQ-9 Reaper drones over the past year, each valued at approximately $30 million. The US has repeatedly clashed with the Houthis since the group began targeting Red Sea shipping in late 2023, claiming to act in solidarity with the Palestinian people amid Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The Truman strike group has launched numerous airstrikes on Yemen as part of a broader US-UK operation. However, on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would“immediately halt”its bombing campaign, claiming the Houthis had“capitulated”and no longer sought confrontation. Shortly after the announcement, Oman confirmed it had mediated a ceasefire agreement between Washington and the Houthis, with both sides pledging not to target one another in the Red Sea.",

    "title": "Antique diamonds: What’s so special about them and are they worth more?",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Living Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Living Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Experiences Dining Experiences Travel Singapore Singapore Experiences Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Singapore jeweller Choo Yilin tells CNA Lifestyle about the unique draw of old-cut diamonds and why they are topping jewellery charts right now. Choo Yilin's Estate collection featuring old cut diamonds. (Photo: Choo Yilin) This audio is generated by an AI tool. There’s something unusually alluring about vintage or antique jewellery. Besides the appeal of jewellery designs of the past, the gemstones that were cut and used for them back then were also uniquely different, as compared to what we see now. Antique or old-cut diamonds, in particular, had distinct qualities that set them apart from their modern-day counterparts. They were cut by hand back in the old days – with no help from machines, and with faceting that’s also significantly unlike that of today’s diamonds. This is exactly where their charm lies – because of the way they are cut, vintage or antique diamonds tend to produce a softer, gentler, and what many describe as a more “romantic, dreamy” sparkle, as opposed to that of modern-day diamonds, which are cut for a dazzling brilliance. Obviously, such olden-day diamonds are not easy to come by – you’d likely only be able to find them as part of vintage and antique jewellery, or re-set into new jewellery designs. There are international sellers, however, who stock loose old diamonds, although it’s advisable to only go to those with a proven reputation and credibility. Have you perhaps been intrigued by these gems, and would like to acquire more knowledge about them?Local jeweller Choo Yilin shares her appreciation for these old diamonds, as well as, her experience working with them. The specialist in jade fell in love with them when working on her namesake brand’s Estate collection. Whenreading up aboutantique diamonds, you’d often see them referred to as“old-cut” diamonds.The term is generally used in reference to antique diamonds that were cut by hand, and cutting styles that were prevalent before the 1800s. Some jewellers also use it to refer more specifically to old mine cut and old European cut diamonds – two old cuts that have gotten quite a bit of attention from antique diamond buyers in recent years. The old European cut diamond has a rounded shape that is similar to the modern round brilliant cut, while the shape of old mine cut diamonds can range from cushion, to rounded or irregularly shaped forms. Old mine cut diamonds, in particular, have seen a resurgence in popularity lately.“Unlike the engineered sparkle of modern diamonds,old minecutdiamonds have a softer, more natural radiance reminiscent of candlelight,” said Choo. “The old mine cut features larger, fewer facets – in comparison to the modern brilliant – that create broad flashes of light and deeper fire. It also has a smaller table (the flat top surface of a diamond), which emphasises the depth of the gem. Old-cut diamonds typically have a warmer hue (due to the mines that they come from), which adds to their richness and depth,” she elaborated. These diamonds do not have a perfectly symmetrical shape, since they are crafted by hand. Many old mine cut diamonds also have a cushion-cut-like shape, which evokes a certain “vintage-style” appeal. Slight inclusions in the diamond are generally embraced as part of the gem’s unique character, and are a characteristic accepted by sellers and buyers. A post shared by Julien Lorincz (@julien_lorincz) Naturally, the modern concept of the 4Cs of diamond grading cannot be applied in the same way to old-cut diamonds, since they are produced long before this system was created and without the aid of technology. They are to be appreciated with a different eye and for their unique beauty, and not by the type of perfection that’s defined by contemporary standards. “We love old minecutdiamonds for their individuality. Each stone is hand-cut, with no two diamonds visually alike. This uniqueness offers a beauty rooted in imperfection and authenticity, qualities we deeply cherish. It may be a little dramatic to say this, but these diamonds are more than just beautiful stones – they’re storytellers, steeped in history, artistry and character,”Choo said. Antique diamonds are not for everyone – some people will prefer the brighter dazzle of modern-cut diamonds. “The clients who are drawn to old-cut diamonds usually have a deep appreciation for heritage and history, and thus the unique qualities of these gems,” she added. “The nature of old-cut diamonds is that supply is genuinely scarce, and it can be a bit of a journey sourcing for them. We buy ours from highly respected specialists in Europe and the United States, specialising in antique and estate jewellery. Many of themare multi-generationfamily businesses that have been in the trade for decades, with some tracing their expertise back over 170 years,” shared Choo. Buyingmoderndiamonds, in comparison, is much more straightforward – besides being readily available, they can also usually be found in the size and specifications that one desires. A post shared by Larry Platt (@plattboutiquejewelry) “Old-cut diamonds, however, are a different story altogether. When we come across a piece we truly love, we acquire it – because supply is finite or scarce, and each stone is one of a kind. It’s virtually impossible to dictate exact specifications, simply because these diamonds were hand-cut and have little asymmetries and characteristics that modern-cut diamonds don’t have,” she added. “Each diamond is treasured as a singular work of art. No two are ever the same, and their value lies as much in a distinct feeling you get from each piece as you would in the technical specs. In other words, procuring old-cut diamonds takes a lot of time, patience…and a little bit of magic,” Choo said. Where cost is concerned, old-cut diamonds can vary widely in pricing. According to Choo, they can be available at prices in the low thousands (mostly for diamonds that are under one carat in size) while bigger sized ones can go up to millions of dollars. While carat weight is a pricing factor, there are also other determinants, such as the historical significance (the period in which the diamond is made) and overall quality of the diamond. There are no specific, set standards tied to these factors since the value of antique diamonds is tied to their perceived value and buyers’ preferences – unlike modern diamonds, which are largely priced according to their grading. Choo noted that old-cut diamonds may be less influenced by market fluctuations than modern diamonds.“Their rarity and perceived historical significance are seen by some as a degree of price stability. Some jewellery collectors and enthusiasts view them as having long-term appreciation potential, in addition to their aesthetic and sentimental value,” she explained. A post shared by Choo Yilin (@chooyilin) While some prefer retaining old-cut diamonds in the jewellery that they originally come in, others like to explore setting them in a brand new or partially reworked design. If you’re wondering if old-cut diamonds will work well with modern jewellery designs – the answer is yes, according to Choo, who thinks that old-cut diamonds can be very versatile. She has reimagined quite a number of antique jewellery pieces for her brand’s Estate Collection, turning them into updated styles that still retain the essence of their original forms. “Working with these stones requires a special skill, as their unique characteristics can differ greatly from modern-cut diamonds. Crafting and setting these diamonds is an art that not all contemporary bench jewellers may be accustomed to, as the techniques needed to honour their beauty are distinct,” she shared. While there are ways to bring out the best of old diamonds, there is, of course, no definite right or wrong when it comes to designing new jewellery styles for them. Ultimately, it’s all about one’s personal enjoyment of the resulting creation – what’s important is that it is a piece you will love and cherish for a lifetime. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "You could start losing teeth in your 30s – how to keep the rest of them before it’s too late",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Living Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Living Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Experiences Dining Experiences Travel Singapore Singapore Experiences Wellness Wellness Many adults lose anywhere from five to 10 teeth by the time they reach their late 60s or early 70s. But you don’t have to go through your senior years with even fewer teeth if you start caring for them now. (Photo: iStock/Yuji Karaki) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Remember squatting over the drain and brushing your teeth after recess in primary school back in the 80s? And the mixed emotions you’d get when the school’s dental nurse called you out of class? (Yay, you get to skip a period but uh-oh, will there be pain?) Your dental needs were taken care of back then, but after you’d traded your backpack for a briefcase and entered the workforce, you’re pretty much on your own. And as it turns out, many Singaporeans aren’t taking care of their teeth as well as they should: Only 56 per cent of people aged 55 and above in Singapore have 20 or more natural teeth as opposed to the full set of 32 adult teeth, according to the Ministry of Health. And it doesn’t help that many Singaporeans with tooth decay opted for the easier and cheaper way out: Extraction rather than a root canal procedure, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung at theMediSave update announcementa short while back. \"We will have fewer and fewer teeth as we grow old if we take this approach. This diminishes our ability to chew effectively and in our old age, affects our nutritional intake,\" he said. How can you ensure you won’t be \"bo geh\" (toothless in Hokkien) or still retain most of your natural teeth when you hit your senior years? We find out from the dental experts. A resounding “no”, said all the doctors that CNA Lifestyle spoke to. Becoming toothless “is a common misbelief and I understand why many people might think that way, especially since tooth loss becomes more prevalent as people get older”, said Dr Kong Rui Ling, an associate consultant with National Dental Centre Singapore’s Department of Restorative Dentistry, Prosthodontic Unit. Neglect, rather than age, plays a bigger role in tooth loss, said Dr Wong Li Beng, a senior consultant with Ng Teng Fong General Hospital’s Dentistry department. “We have seen patients with 28 healthy teeth well into their late 80s. Conversely, we have also seen patients in their 20s having fewer than 20 functional teeth due to neglect.” His colleague, consultant Dr Madeleine Tan, agreed. “You can still have your full complement of teeth in your later years if you take good care of them.” Unfortunately, even with good dental care, “adults can lose anywhere from five to 10 teeth by the time they reach their late 60s or early 70s”, according to Dr Kong. And you'll need to maintainat least 20 natural teeth for effective chewing, she said. The teeth that you tend to lose are the molars, said Dr Lee Jun Sheng, the founder of Smilee Dental Clinic. “These are the large teeth at the back of the mouth that are responsible for grinding and crushing food.” Dr Lee explained that there are several reasons for that: Difficulty in cleaning and the pressure they’re subjected to when chewing. “Molars have more pits and grooves where food particles can get trapped, making them more susceptible to cavities,” he said. “Molars are also considered high-pressure zones as they endure 90 per cent of the chewing force. Heavy usage over the years can lead to cracks, decay and eventual tooth loss.” Moreover, seniors with reduced dexterity caused by conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, stroke or Parkinson’s disease may have difficulty cleaning the molars, said Dr Tan. It can also be challenging for caregivers to adequately brush a dependent senior’s molars, she said. That doesn’t mean the incisors or front teeth are completely spared. “The incisors tend to be preserved longer because they are easier to clean and are less prone to the same issues, though they can still be affected by gum disease or trauma,” said Dr Lee. It can begin as early as in your late 30s to early 40s, said Dr Kong, particularly if there is dental neglect, poor oral hygiene habits or a genetic predisposition to conditions such as periodontal disease. “However, most tooth loss happens after age 60 when gum disease, tooth decay and other factors become more pronounced,” he said. “This happens due to changes in oral care habits.” Here’s a breakdown on the various common causes and how big an impact they have on tooth loss, according to Dr Lee: 1. Cavities: 96 per cent This is often due to developing a dry mouth and weakened enamel with age, said Dr Lee. “Seniors might not have as much saliva to neutralise the acids in the mouth or help with remineralisation.” They may also be on medications that can cause dry mouth such as some antihypertensives, antihistamines, antidepressants, pain relievers and diuretics, he said. Dr Kong highlighted that plaque buildup becomes harder to manage when dental visits often decline as people age. 2. Gum recession: 60 to 85 per cent Long-term gum diseases (gingivitis or periodontitis), poor oral hygiene and ageing are common causes. “When the gums recede, the tooth roots become exposed, which can increase sensitivity and the risk of decay,” said Dr Lee. 3. Poor diet: 30 to 50 per cent \"The typical Singaporean diet has added sugars, which may not be apparent to the older adult, such as 3-in-1 coffee or tea, desserts like cheng tng and ice kachang, herbal teas from traditional medicine halls, kaya, jam, kuehs and Swiss rolls,” said Dr Tan. Even some medicines like the cough drops or throat soothers that they suck on through the day can have added sugars, she said. “The frequency at which the seniors eat the aforementioned foods also matter,” continued Dr Tan. “Continuously snacking or sipping small quantities throughout the day is detrimental as the teeth are always coated with sugars. I usually advise my patients to limit their sweet treats, and to have them at mealtimes, rather than frequently grazing on the treats in-between meals.” 4. Enamel wearing down: 25 per cent This is due to the long-term exposure to the acids in foods and drinks as well as from the normal wearing down caused by chewing, said Dr Lee. 5. Smoking: 9 per cent “Smoking reduces blood flow to the gums, and weakens the body’s ability to fight infections and heal from injuries. It also contributes to gum disease and can stain teeth,” said Dr Lee. Beyond missing regular dental visits and forgoing daily brushing, there are some habits that seniors have in Singapore that can contribute to tooth loss, said Dr Kong. They include chewing on ice cubes, gnawing on bones, biting crab shells and cracking seeds. “These actions can lead to the wear and tear of their teeth and most commonly, cause fractures and cracks in the long run,” said Dr Kong. Seniors who wear dentures may also neglect proper care and cleaning, said Dr Lee, which can lead to bacteria and plaque buildup that cause gum irritation, infection and discomfort. Teeth grinding during sleep can be another issue that bothers seniors due to stress, anxiety or poorly fitted dental work, highlighted Dr Lee. “Some seniors may try to ‘adjust’ their dentures themselves, which can worsen their fit and lead to further oral health issues.” The use of traditional herbal remedies or home treatments may seem harmless but they may not be effective and instead, damage their teeth, said Dr Lee. “For instance, some herbal or natural remedies could be abrasive or acidic, which further damage the enamel and inadvertently worsen oral health problems such as erosion, sensitivity or bacterial buildup.” “I may sound like a broken record but prevention is always better than cure,” said Dr Wong. “Regular visit to the dentist is highly recommended.” Those twice-yearly dental visits still apply whether you have fewer or more than 20 teeth, or no teeth at all, said Dr Tan. “Your dentist can help to identify oral problems early.” She continued: “Oral problems can be treated with relatively simple and minimal procedures. If left untreated, these oral problems can worsen, requiring complex and costly procedures, or even tooth loss”. In the meantime, Dr Kong recommends the following ways to improve your odds of retaining your pearly whites: 1. Protect your teeth from grinding If you suspect you are grinding your teeth, especially at night, talk to your dentist about getting a custom-made nightguard. 2. Eat for better dental health A tooth-strengthening diet includes food rich in calcium, Vitamin D and phosphorus but low on sugar and acid. 3. Do not abuse your teeth That means no opening packages and bottles, or biting on hard objects such as pens and hard candy with your teeth. 4. Avoid smoking or using tobacco Smoking and using tobacco products can cause gum disease, bad breath and oral cancers. 5. Stay hydrated Saliva plays a crucial role in keeping your mouth healthy by neutralising acids and washing away food particles. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. 6. Be aware of your medications Some medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants and painkillers, can lead to dry mouth, which can cause cavities and gum disease over time. If you are on any medications that cause dry mouth, talk to your doctor or dentist. 7. Do regular self-checkups Look for signs of problems like gum recession, bleeding gums or unusual tooth sensitivity. If you notice any changes, such as pain, swelling or sensitivity, see your dentist as soon as possible. Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "title": "Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner Kept It Simple for Their Red-Carpet Debut",
    "article_text": "Despite skipping theMet Galaon Monday nightso he could watch the Knicksplay the Celtics on a tiny iPad screen, it turns out that Timothée Chalamet had some room in his schedule to hit up a red carpet this week after all. And in Italy, of all places! He also brought along his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, and they even sort of matched their outfits. Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet at the David di Donatello Awards in Rome on Wednesday. Since becoming an item in early 2023, Chalamet and Jenner have been spotted at all manner of public events:basketball games,tennis matches,poker nights. The one place theyhadn’tyet been seen together, however? On a red carpet. Despite the fact that Jenner—who, unlike her beau,didattend the Met this year—was by the actor’s side for much of hisgonzoA Complete Unknownpress tour, the duo had never actually walked in front of a step-and-repeat together. That is, until Wednesday, when Kylie and Timmy both graced the carpet at the 70th David Di Donatello Awards in Rome, where Chalamet is set to receive the David for Cinematic Excellence. (Per Timmy’s Instagram story, Marilyn Monroe was presented with the same honorary award back in 1959.) For the occasion, Chalamet wore a double-breasted black velvetTom Fordsuit, which he accessorized with a white rosette fastened to his coat pocket. Jenner, in a slinky Schiaparelli gown, opted for the same brooding, obsidian-forward color palate. The couple sat together during the ceremony, where Chalamet was presented with the David for Cinematic Excellence honorary award. For both Timmy and Kylie—the most high-key “low-key” couple that Hollywood’s had in years—this is the sartorial equivalent of playing the hits. Chalamet’s Tom Ford suit was designed byhis longtime pal, Haider Ackerman, who also cooked up the TF suits Timmy sported at theGolden Globesand theVanity Fairpost-Oscars partyearlier this year. And throughout theA Complete Unknownpress run, Jenner made a habit of wearing bombshell black gowns—which were still statement-making enough to fetch headlines, despite her skipping the red carpets. Now that they’ve broken the step-and-repeat seal, it’ll be fun to watch them really start dressing.",

    "title": "The Paraboot Michael Is the Hottest Men's Shoe of the Moment",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If we asked you to name the most sought-after men's shoe (non-sneaker category) in the world right now, would you guess the Paraboot Michael? Because it’s true: an 80-year-old French-made work derby that costs $635 has cracked the top-10 “Hottest Products,” according to the 2025 first quarterLyst Index. Paraboot’s Michael shoe sits alongside other “hot” pieces like theCeline flared jeans that Kendrick Lamar woreduring the Super Bowl, “It” bags by Miu Miu and Saint Laurent, andUniqlo’s universally-beloved $4 Colorful socks. Which makes the Paraboot Michael a relative underdog — but only if you haven’t yet joined the Paraboot brigade. The Michael, a Tyrolean derby with a chunky rubber sole and a separate piece of leather sewn over the moc-toe seam, has been around since 1945, but started getting some fashion heat in the last decade. The news of its 2025 ascendancy doesn’t come as a shock — we’ve beenhyping the virtuesof the brand on GQ for years. The Michael itself is theMJ Lendermanof men's footwear: slightly eccentric in its old-school approach, commercially underrated but critically adored. It was a staff favorite back when I worked on the floor of San Francisco’s Unionmade store (RIP) in the mid-2010s for being all-day comfortable while making every fit feel sharper, thanks to the shoe’s neither-fish-nor-fowl boot-plus-derby look. Paraboot Todd Snyder Paraboot Todd Snyder A pair of Paraboot Michaels will make jeans and a white tee look downright studied. And if you’re bored with yourloafers, the Michael can sub into the same fits, making the overall effect slightly more rugged than with your usual pennies orVenetians. A good friend, one of the most stylish people I know, even got married in anall-black pairof Paraboot Michaels. If you own a pair of chinos, slacks, fatigues or literally any other full-legged pant, you’ll look great in a pair of your own. If the Michael’s slightly unorthodox gentleman’s-hiker silhouette has opened your eyes to the advantages of slightly funkier footwear, then good news: Paraboot has a deep, equally underrated catalog. For instance, theReims Loafergets a lot of love, as it should, but theNante Loaferis a sleeper destined to crush for summers on end. Paraboot Todd Snyder Paraboot Todd Snyder I bought a pair ofParaboot Thierslast fall, wore them like they were sneakers for months, then bought a second pair this spring. Each morning, I’m forced to remind myself that I own other shoes. And for anyone still unsure about a substantial sole, know that Paraboot’s more low-profile shoes — particularly theColumbia Loaferand thePacific Sport fisherman sandal— bring the brand’s century-long dedication to exquisite craftsmanship. (Fun fact: Paraboot is one of the only shoe manufacturers in the world that makes its own soles.) For that reason, nothing Paraboot makes is cheap. You can findthriftier variations on the Michaelin particular, but the original delivers on its old-world promise. That’s maybe the miracle here: one of the world’s most popular men’s shoes is also one of the world’s best-made, longest-lasting, easiest-to-wear shoes, too. Wild to think that the Paraboot Michael has been around for 80 years, and it’s only just getting started. Paraboot Totem Shop Paraboot Neighbour",

    "title": "Best Garment Bag 2025: 15 Picks for Every Budget, Style, and Trip",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Buying even the best garment bag is a little like hiring a private bodyguard: You can’t imagine you’ll ever need one until, suddenly, you do.Multi-day weddingwith multiple outfit changes? Business trip where you’ll need to impress? Spontaneous city break? Wherever you’re going, if you’re taking a suit, you should be taking a garment bag, or you’ll risk arriving with a crumpled, wrinkled mess. Broadly speaking, you’ll want something spacious enough to carry a couple of clothing options, but not so bulky that you may as well have broughta full suitcase. Look for something streamlined, lightweight, and easily rollable—the more smoothly it folds, the less likely your precious fits inside will become creased. And note: Most modern garment bags are designed to fit within the carry-on guidelines of a plane, but be warned—overhead compartments are the Wild West, and other travelers might not hesitate to jam your bag into a crumpled ball if it gives them a little more space. For this reason, it’s always worth asking the attendants if there’s somewhere to hang a garment bag (there usually is.) Lastly, while durability and functionality are vital, it’s equally important to travel with a little style. With that in mind, we’ve gathered together the best garment bags that will get your stuff there in one piece, while still making sure you look good doing it. Mismo Mismo The biggest challenge facing most of the garment bags on the market is one of aesthetics – put simply, most of them just aren’t very sexy. With that in mind, best in class has to go to the Danish accessories brand Mismo, whose suit carrier manages to look streamlined, elegant, and most of all, grown-up, all without compromising on functionality. The bag itself is spacious enough to fit up to three full looks, with external pockets for an additional pair of shoes, or a couple of rolled-up t-shirts (and yes, you should be rolling and not folding your tees). Plus, it includes a front pocket for your laptop. Which means you could feasibly take this on a weekend away without needing another bag. But it’s in the details where this style really stands apart: the leather finishes and handsome brass hardware take it a level above pure functionality. While it comes in a few fabrics and finishes, our money’s on the military green canvas, which is finished with a water-repellent coating. Tumi Amazon You know those scenes in spy movies, when an innocuous briefcase unfolds to reveal a hidden arsenal of gadgets? CEO-favorite brand TUMI has achieved the business-trip version here. It folds up neatly enough to qualify as a carry-on (though it is large enough to qualify for additional fees on some budget airlines). Open it up, and you can fit two suits inside, with pockets to spare for additional garments or shoes. It’s also designed to slot neatly onto the handles of a wheelie suitcase. It’s a little more utilitarian than a traditional suit bag, but it has the cajones to make up for it: the ballistic nylon used on its outer is normally used to make motorcycle gear. Needless to say, it’s not going to scratch easily. Wallybags Target Considering its entry-level pricing (and admittedly absurd brand name), Wallybags’ garment bags punch quite significantly above their weight. This one holds up to six hangers (although we'd recommend calling it at around three) with space for shoes and toiletries. It’s also designed to clamp hangers in place, saving garments from slipping to the base of the bag and crumpling. While its polyester fabrication might not be the most glamorous on this list, it’s lightweight, functional, and highly water repellent. And for under sixty bucks, we’d say that’s pretty good going. Nomatic Nordstrom Consider this your solid, middle-of-the-road contender. It comes in under $200, and will do pretty much exactly what you need it to: carry up to three outfits, with extra space for shoes, belts, and watches. Aesthetically, it’s a little featureless, but it’s capacious enough and comes with a useful detachable shoulder strap. It’s water resistant, too, so you’re covered for inclement weather. Is it likely to turn colleagues and friends green with envy? No. But will you arrive at your destination with a trio of wrinkle-free suits? Absolutely. Rimowa Rimowa The LVMH-owned travel brand RIMOWA might already have appeared on your radar for their buzzy, instant sell-out collabs with everyone from Dior to Supreme. But their core collections are also well worth admiring for their unfussy, hard-wearing and elegant travel accessories. The Trifold garment bag is a remarkably compact and lightweight design: when fully zipped up, it could pass for an ordinary briefcase. But opened, it can carry one or two suits (depending on their thickness), which will attach to the internal coathanger. Plus, it’s made from tough recycled nylon, and is likely to last longer and withstand the battering of the airport better than many other styles. It’s even guaranteed against damage. Metier Mr. Porter If the thought of carrying a synthetic bag through the flight lounge makes you feel squeamish, you’re not alone. In that case, consider the British accessories brand Metier, who make handsomely designed versions of practical accessories. Their philosophy might as well be “make it work, but make it look good.” Métier's take on the suit carrier is a case in point: made from Italian leather, it’s smart and discreet, opening out to reveal a host of inner compartments. It even includes space for your cufflinks. While leather won’t withstand the elements quite as well as a synthetic, this one is made from a sturdy full-grain, which means it’ll only look better as it ages. Victorinox Bloomingdale's Victorinox built their name on the success of their signature Swiss army knives. It’s fitting, then, that their take on the suit bag is a real three-in-one: a duffel bag with an attached garment sleeve, which is also designed to attach neatly to the top of your suitcase. Its neat, boxy shape makes this the perfect accompaniment to sit atop a larger case, but it’s hard to top this as a standalone carry-on, too – it scores highly for storage, fitting two suits alongside the duffel space. Admirably, it’s also made from recycled water bottles, for those aiming to buy more responsibly made products. Porsche Design Nordstrom If you’re breezing in for one night only, you’ll need something streamlined and easy to maneuver. It fits, then, that Porsche Design—the apparel arm of the automotive giant—has the solution. This bag cuts a slimmer, sleeker silhouette than many of its competitors: even when filled, it’s less bulky than many others. The gently padded folding sections help to minimise creasing, while the inner lining helps to protect against both wrinkles and spills. Its lighter, more compact shape means it’s best for one suit only, so this is the perfect option for overnight trips, or weekends where you’re unlikely to need many changes. Bennett Winch Mr. Porter If you’ll be away for a few nights, but still want to avoid lugging a suitcase, the British accessories brand Bennett Winch has developed a rather brilliant solution. Its garment carrier neatly wraps around an enclosed holdall, meaning you get the capacity of two bags, but only need to carry one. Plus, a separate waterproof bag holds your shoes or toiletries – so there’s no risk of reaching your hotel room only to discover an exploded toothpaste tube sprayed across your suit. It’s compact enough to qualify as a carry-on for most airlines, and has a pleasingly unobtrusive design. If you’re partial to a long weekend away, this is the bag for you. Halfday Bespoke Post This water-resistant, heavy-duty garment duffel from Halfday shines wherever you bring it, from an exclusive airport lounge to the backseat of a rented Mitsubishi Diamante. Straps, clamps, and loops keep all your clothes secure and wrinkle-free, and the whole thing secures onto a suitcase handle via a nifty trolley sleeve. Briggs & Riley Briggs & Riley An ingenious garment bag from the American travel brand Briggs and Riley, which folds together to become a duffel. It’s also packed with pockets, so you’re unlikely to ever run out of space. Tumi Bloomingdale's For the traveler who wants the executive cachet of TUMI, at a less executive price, the brand's more pared-down garment bag is still made from the finest materials. Away Away The Away Garment Duffel was made for owning the overhead bin: With a built-in garment sleeve to keep your digs wrinkle-free, expandable shoe storage, and a hidden hook for over-the-door hanging, it's a top-tier weekender pick. Plus, its sturdy construction (this thing has someheft) gives your clothes a fighting chance against turbulence and overzealous flight attendants when stowed up top. Longchamp Longchamp Consider this the ‘quiet luxury’ of garment bags: minimal in shape, and made entirely from black leather, it’s the suit carrier Bruce Wayne would sling into the back of the Batmobile. Even the zippers are unobtrusive. Hudson Sutler Hudson Sutler A clean, practical option that comes in a broader range of colour combinations. The diagonal zipper is an especially nice touch, which helps to prevent clothes becoming creased during packing. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories: quality, fit, and price. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

These days, onthe Met Gala red carpet, absolutelynone of the watches are slouches. So to ready himself for the horological warfare ahead, A$AP Rocky brought a bazooka of a watch to the first Monday in May: Bvlgari’s alarminglythin Octo Finissimo Ultra. Rocky was one of the co-chairs for Monday night’s event, which celebrated the Costume Institute’s latest annual exhibition,“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.”Given the sartorial heft Rocky brings to every venue, it was especially important for him to show up to one of the very few menswear-themed Met Galas looking as outrageously stylish as possible. Enter the watch. At just 1.7 mm thick, the Octo Finissimo Ultra COSC set a record as the world’s thinnest mechanical watch upon its debut at Watches and Wonders 2024 last April. I’ve been lucky enough to try the piece on, and its presence very much outpunches its small stature. The watch is no thicker than a credit card, an incredible technical feat when you consider how many components have to go into making a functioning timepiece. Bulgari's 1.7mm-thick Octo Finissimo Ultra Bvlgari and Piaget have famously battled back and forth for the record for many years, with every new cycle of releases seemingly bringing a new achievement in thinness from one or the other. Recently, however, new players have inserted themselves into the conversation. Before Rocky’s Octo,Richard Mille’s RM UP-01 was the thinnest watch in the world at 1.75 mm. (Fellow Met co-chair Pharrellloves and wears that watch a lot—I wonder if he and Rocky talked about their love for record-breaking timepieces.) But newcomer Konstantin Chaykin stole the record last August when it released the 1.65 mm-thin ThinKing Prototype. As the stakes get higher and the watches get slimmer, watch brands have been settling for slices of the record if they can’t get the whole pie. Last April, Piaget introduced the world’s thinnest watch with a tourbillon at 2 mm, but Bvlgari quickly punched back here, too. This year, the brand released an even thinner tourbillon watch that measures just 1.85 mm. It’s a really fun rivalry to track over the years. When it comes to ultra-thin watches, it’s hard to decipher the actual differences without the help of calipers. At this point, collectors at this level are now picking between these models based on looks and understanding they’re getting one of the world’s most technically impressive timepieces. While Pharrell prefers his Richard Mille, on Monday night Rocky cast his vote for the Octo Finissimo Ultra.",

    "title": "5 Best Aesop Fragrances of 2025 According to Our Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Since 1987, Aesop has been slinging science-forward products with a leafy green heart, blending plant-based ingredients and clinical precision like a chemist in a linen shirt. It's mastered everything from sought-afterbody washesto foolproofskincare routines—and let’s not forget those subtle flexhand soapsperched proudly on the sinks of anyone with taste (and a well-lit bathroom). No flashy colors. No miracle claims. Just understated luxury in minimalist packaging. My first real-life Aesop moment came in 2014, working at a men’s boutique that carried theGeranium LeafandRindhand and body balms. I may or may not have “accidentally” emptied most of the sample bottles. Those two scents planted a flag in my nostrils and sent me spiraling down the most fragrant rabbit hole straight to Melbourne. I’ve always hadsensitive skin, so I can’t dive headfirst into their fullskin carelineup like I want to. Butfragrance? That’s where I go full cannonball. Aesop divides its scents into four families—floral, fresh, woody, and opulent—to help you vibe check a bottle before even taking a whiff. It's pared-back packaging coupled with a beautifully complex nose, and this intuitive system keeps things feeling curated, not confusing. Noperfume jargon: Just an elegant little scent map for your soul (and wrists). Over the years, I’ve had the pleasure of sampling some of Aesop’s finest fragrances. And let me tell you: Each one has me sniffing my wrists every five minutes and lifting my shirt to my nose every thirty like I’m on some kind of scent schedule. Here’s our breakdown of five fragrances from this iconic Australian label—and why we're customers for life. Aesop Aesop Hwyl is a Welsh word meaning “a stirring feeling of inspiration and emotional motivation”—which, frankly, couldn’t sum up a scent better if it tried. This is my all-time favorite fragrance, partly because it’s not out here trying to mimic fragrance notes. It doesn’t remind me of any other cologne, perfume, or candle I’ve ever encountered. Nothing. Ever. It’s entirely its own thing: deep, smoky, and meditative—like an ancient forest, and I’m not looking forward to the day this runs out. Inspired by the serene, earthy stillness of Japanese Hinoki forests, Hwyl is one of Aesop’s more introspective and unconventional blends. It opens with a smoky, green brightness, thanks to cypress and thyme extract, before drifting into vetiver and frankincense. The vetiver brings an earthy, rain-on-soil vibe—moody in the best way—while the frankincense adds that dry, resinous incense smoke you might catch wafting from a temple altar. As it settles, oakmoss rolls in to anchor the whole experience with a woody, slightly leathery base that clings to skin like you’ve washed your favorite cashmere sweater into the fresh forest air. It smells like solitude—but the kind you actually want—like a long walk in the woods with bare branches overhead and phone on silent mode. Aesop Aesop Inspired by Marrakech’s sun-baked streets, spice markets, and intricate tilework, this fragrance from Aesop doesn’t just smell good—it smellsalive. From the first spritz, it’s spicy and vibrant, with clove, cardamom, and bergamot leaping out like they’ve got something to prove. It’s sharp, peppery, and unapologetically bold. As it sits in your skin (or your shirt), it reveals a softer heart—jasmine, rose, and a smudge of neroli. But don’t expect anything too pretty or pristine. These are earthy florals, dried and sun-warmed. There’s a resinous quality that adds heft, grounding the scent with sandalwood, cedar, and patchouli. It’s warm, woody, smoky, and just a little bit dirty—in a good way. (Think sun-kissed skin after a long day.) This isn’t a fragrance that fades into the background. It’s decisive. You’ll either love it or politely back away. Sure, it smells great—but more importantly, it smellsmemorable. And in a world of forgettable scents, that might just be its greatest charm. Aesop Aesop This is one of the Australian brand’s more enigmatic, artful scents—less about instant gratification, and more about quiet complexity. It’s part of its Othertopias collection, a conceptual series inspired by liminal spaces—those dreamy, in-between zones where reality and imagination get a little fuzzy. Now, let me put it this way: if Le Labo Santal 33 is the extrovert’s woody cologne—bold, talkative, always in the spotlight—then Eidesis is the introvert’s incense trail—subtle, moody, and made for people who don’t want to smell like anyone else in the room. This is my second all-time favorite scent, and here's why: After the first spritz, you get this wet, resinous freshness—courtesy of black pepper and petitgrain—with an initial green, slightly bitter hit that feels like someone just cracked open a forest. But give it a minute, and it quickly deepens into a smoky, spicy swirl of frankincense, cumin, and cedarwood that smells like a centuries-old library. As it dries down, sandalwood and vetiver step in to anchor everything, giving it a warm, woody base with a slightly leathery edge. The result? A super intimate scent that’s hard to spray just once. Two sprays if you're trying to impress—three if you're trying to seduce someone who reads poetry. Aesop Aesop Aesop’s fragrances typically offer more than just a scent—they tell a story that tickles your nostrils and your imagination. One of their newer creations, Aurner, takes its name from an Old Norse verb meaning “to be adorned, to be embellished with flowers”—a subtle wink at what’s to come once you give it a spritz. It opens with an aromatic, slightly medicinal blend of Roman chamomile, cardamom, and pink pepper—like a stylish herbalist's apothecary. As it settles, the heart notes unfold with the fresh, green lift of magnolia leaf and geranium. And then the base kicks in: sandalwood, cedar heart, and cypriol heart add a grounding woodiness that keeps things balanced. This is easily Aesop’s most floral-forward fragrance I’ve smelled—floral, yes, but not in a sneezy, grandma’s soap kind of way. It’s sophisticated, complex, and just restrained enough to keep your nose intrigued instead of overwhelmed. Aesop Aesop Another fresh addition to Aesop’s unforgettable fragrance lineup is Virēre—a green, crisp, and slightly unexpected scent. Picture stepping into a greenhouse after a summer rain, but make it high-design. It’s Aesop’s take on the in-between: the transitional spaces where nature meets polish, and where earthy meets elevated. Their longtime fragrance collaborator found inspiration while cycling past orchards, sniffing fresh figs, and sipping green tea somewhere along the Mediterranean. (Your dream vacation—now bottled.) Pop the cap and you’re hit with bright bergamot and a jolt of astringent galbanum. But give it a moment, and it settles into something softer and warmer—vegetal, but not in a salad-y way. There's a grassy, leafy depth here—more greenhouse than garden party—with hints of green tea and maybe even crushed pink pepper. As it dries down, you get an earthy, elegant finish: cedar, green maté, or a touch of hay. Not smoky, not sweet—just a calm, grounded note that lingers in the most pleasant way possible.",

    "title": "Of Course André 3000 Has Elite Taste in Underrated Nikes",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. André 3000is one of a kind. Always has been, always will be. What’s always set him apart as a musician, a designer, and a cultural institution is his insistence on going against the grain and zagging in a world full of zig. It’s long made manifest in his wardrobe, which often sidesteps designer labels for independent brands, workwear, and bohemian flourishes most of his fellow emcees wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole. 3K hastaste, an aesthetic instantly recognizable as his own. It was certainly on display when he hit theMet Gala red carpetwitha piano strapped to his back, a fit connected to a quirky EP of piano tracks he dropped during the event. He channeled it intothe fit he designed forGQglobal editorial director Will Welchfor the gala, reviving his defunct label Benji Bixby in the process. And it was, of course, present in his sneaker game during Welch’s pre-Met fittings. Across the fitting process—which took place in both Amsterdam and New York—Dré stepped out in selections from Nike’s Air Trainer and Tech Challenge lines, far from the obvious sneakerhead pulls.Air Jordans,Air Maxes, and anything and everythingTravis Scott,Fragment, andA Ma Maniéreare commonplace these days amongst those immersed in the sneaker world. 3K has never seemed all that concerned with what’s popular in any sartorial space, instead sticking to his own sense of style and taste. It explains the less-than-obvious kicks he laced up ahead of these sessions. André 3000 at a pre-Met fitting in Amsterdam. The Nike Air Tech Challenge 4 OG ‘Dark Grape.’ While theAir Tech Challenge 2is a capital-I important sneaker—Andre Agassi’s most iconic signature shoe and one of the crown jewels of designerTinker Hatfield’s Nike tenure—the later silhouettes in the series aren’t quite as revered in the broader sneaker world. That doesn’t seem to matter to 3K, who knows heat when he sees heat. For an early fitting in Amsterdam, he pulled up in navy coveralls and a grey hoodie, sporting a pair of the colorful Air Tech Challenge 4s in the ‘Dark Grape’ rendition. Predictably they served as the perfect finishing touch on a fit that sprinkled multicolored details across sturdy neutral pieces. Will Welch and André 3000 at the final fitting before the Met Gala. The Nike Air Trainer 1 ‘Chlorophyll.’ For the final fitting in New York on Friday, he pulled out another pair of archival Nikes—this time the Air Trainer 1 in ‘Chlorophyll,’ which features touches of deep green across a silhouette of toned-down black, grey, and white. 3K paired these with a rustic workwear suit and a crewneck knit in bright gold and navy, proving that wearing sneakers with suit is a rule meant to be broken. People overthink their sneaker rotation, buying into hype cycles and falling into existential crises over whether or not they should keep wearingSambasorPanda Dunks.

    "title": "How Honey Became an All-Purpose Wellness Hack",
    "article_text": "Magnesium.Ginger.Tongkat ali. Honey? Of all the supplements and foods currently trending in the wellness space, the stuff that comes in the bear-shaped bottle is perhaps the least exotic. And yet influencers and normie gymgoers alike are using it for energy boosts before they work out, to add flavor to their high-protein meals, and just generally as a substitute for sugar and artificial sweeteners. The growing popularity of less traditional options—likeraw honey, which retains enzymes and antioxidants that are linked to improved immune function and reduced inflammation, and chili-spiced hot honey—have also given the sticky stuff a healthy new sheen. Eating it by the spoonful, topped with salt, as a form of pre-workout fuel is now aTikTok trend. You can also find one dude’srecipefor a “honey pump cocktail,” made by adding water, Himalayan salt, and glycerol powder, on TikTok. Honey is now a starring ingredient in high-protein meals, too, like thesehot honey garlic tendersandNashville-style chicken tenders. Honey even made a cameo inAshton Hall’s viral morning routine video. He used it to flavor his breakfast after he scrubbed his face with a banana peel. (Beekeeping is also a thing now, at least among celebrities: Jennifer Garner, Beyonce, David Beckham, and Ed Sheeranall have their own hives. Social media helped popularize this, too. See:The Bee Lady.) But is honey all it’s cracked up to be? Here’s everything you need to know. Honey sales have been on an upward trajectory for a decade and have risen especially fast in the last five years, hitting$1.1 billion in 2024, “which is a record high,” saysMargaret Lombard, CEO of theNational Honey Board. One of the biggest reasons for this, according to Lombard, is that more people are looking for an alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners, whicharen’t much healthier than sugar. (While sugar consumptionison the decline, it remainsfar higherthan that of honey.) Hot honey, which is made by infusing honey with chili peppers, is particularly, well, hot right now; sales, according to the National Honey Board, have grown 128% in the last four years. On social media you’ll typically see hot honey used in high-protein recipes (like the chicken tenders above), as opposed to traditional or raw honey, which are used as pre-workout fuel, often garnished with salt. “I use hot honey in a bunch of ways, like drizzling it on my homemade protein pizzas—a total game-changer—or mixing it into glazes for recipes like my sticky honey sriracha chicken tenders,” saysZach Rocheleau,the creator ofThe Flexible Dieting Lifestyleand a fitness influencer with 1.6 million Instagram followers. “There’s something about that sweet-heat combo that makes a macro-friendly meal feel way more indulgent. It’s a simple trick that instantly upgrades flavor without requiring a ton of ingredients or calories.” Using honey instead of sugar can be a smart swap. The main reason is that honey is absorbed in the bloodstream more slowly than sugar, saysDan Benardot, PhD, RD, FACSM, a professor at Emory University, registered dietitian, and the nutritionist for several US Olympic teams. The slower absorption rate impacts health in a few different ways. There issome scientific evidenceshowing that honey causes less weight gain than sugar. Honeycan also improvelipid profiles by decreasing cholesterol and triglyceride levels and influence appetite-regulating hormones. “Since you’re not throwing as much sugar into cells faster than they can deal with it, you aren’t storing as much fat as when you eat sugar,” Dr. Benardot says. The antioxidants in honeycan also help decrease inflammation, which is often high in people with obesity. (Whyis honey absorbed into the blood more slowly than sugar? Here’s a quick chemistry lesson. Table sugar is half fructose, half glucose.Honeyis 40% fructose, 30% glucose, and 17% water, with the remaining 13% a mix of other sugars, carbs, and nutrients. Honey also containstrehalose, an enzyme that’s not present in sugar. The trehalose, Dr. Benardot explains, releases glucose into the bloodstream at a slower rate than table sugar.) While honey does have benefits, beware of weight-loss fads likethe honey diet, which involves replacing all sugar with honey, eliminating potatoes and grains, eating unlimited veggies but only two servings of fruit a day, getting protein with every meal, and replacing simple (or refined) carbs with complex carbs. “Substituting carbohydrates with protein doesn’t work because this requires that much of the consumed protein be used to satisfy the carbohydrate energy requirement,” Dr. Benardot says. (Can westop giving carbs a bad rapalready?) In general, Dr. Benardot says, the best diet is a varied one. In deciding whether to incorporate honey into your pre-workout routine, it’s important to keep the differing absorption rates of honey and sugar in mind. Sugar will give you quick energy, Dr. Benardot says. That’s why a lot of long-distance runners snack on gummy bears or energy gels, both of which typically contain sugar. But Dr. Benardot says it can be beneficial to eat a spoonful of honey (or a meal that includes it) about 1.5 hours before working out for more sustained energy. The fructose and glucose in honey are converted into glycogen in the liver, andglycogen is the most important energy source during exercise, especially high-intensity exercise. What about throwing glycerol powder into the mix, as the creator of the “honey pump cocktail” does? Dr. Benardot says that this is only beneficial if your sweat rate is going to be super high, as it would be, for example, on a run in the summer afternoon heat. This is because glycerol helps the body hold onto water longer. And if you want to have salt with your spoonful of honey, Dr. Benardot doesn’t see a problem with it—but he recommends just a sprinkle. “Roughly 100 milligrams of salt is enough. If you’re working out in a hot environment, 200 milligrams is okay,” he says. “You don’t want to overdo the salt because if you have too much, you can have too much fluid in your blood, which raises blood pressure.” The only question left is whether you should become a beekeeper. If you do, Lombard recommends learning best practices from a local beekeeping organization, so you don’t do more harm than good to those precious bees.",

AtMonday night’s Met Gala, Khaby Lame—the most-followed man on TikTok— arrived with over 20 pocket watches pinned to his waistcoat. But Lame was far from alone in embracing the antiquated technology. With fashion’s biggest night themed aroundBlack dandyismthis year, many of the event’s A-list attendees reached for age-old accessories: canes, top hats, monocles, and, yes, pocket watches. Dapper Dan andAyo Edebiri both dialed up vintage Cartier pocket watchesfor their looks; the former wore his like a necklace. Leon Bridges flaunted the evening’s most technical pocket watch—a tourbillon-equipped Urban Jürgensen number. Russell Wilson opted for an intricately engraved modelfrom the Bulova archives. But arguably the night’s coolest pocket watch of all appeared on the afterparty circuit, where Jenna Ortega sported a 14-karat gold Heuer pocket chronograph from 1914. The century-old piece was loaned to theWednesdaystar by Heuer super collector (and Watch Illuminati high priest) Jeff Stein. Between its gold composition and split-second chronograph function, Stein told me over email, “ this would have been among the most expensive timepieces in the Heuer catalog, and was the ultimate timepiece for the sports enthusiast.” Stein imagines the piece would have been used for horse racing, track events, and swimming over 100 years ago. “Think of the wealthy industrialist attending the Kentucky Derby or training horses,” he added. “This was the cool guy’s watch. [The] Richard Mille [of] 110 years ago.” In that sense, Ortega’s pocket watch managed to follow suit with one of today’s defining trends: wearing a sporty (but still luxurious!) timepiece to a fancy red-carpet event..

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Thebest shampoofor curly hair differs from one guy to the next, since no two curl patterns are the same. There are a ton of variables that can influence and inform which shampoo you should use, from your scalp oil levels, strand density, and porosity to showering habits, which other hair products you use, and more. (And, when you add in environmental factors like humidity, things get even more hairy.) “That’s what makes curly hair so bomb!” says celebrity hairstylistAshley Streicher, anR+Cohair care ambassador. She explains that most curly-haired men have alldifferent kindsof curls on their heads. That’s also why “choosing the right shampoo with moisturizing (not just hydrating!) ingredients, and that cleans without stripping is nonnegotiable,” adds celebrity hairstylistDavid Cotteblanche. “The best shampoos respect the curl, leaving your hair soft, clean, and never thirsty.” So, how do you go about finding the best shampoo for your specific mane? Because there are hundreds of products to choose from, and no two ofthoseare alike, either, we put together this short list of our favorite picks for the best curly hair shampoo for men, along with a few key pieces of advice. Sachajuan Sachajuan Key ingredients:Wheat protein and red algae extract provide fortification and prevent frizzing and split endsSize(s):8.4 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Salon-favorite Sachajuan is among the most universal curl shampoos, providing strands of all densities with its signature “Ocean Silk Technology” composed of marine extracts and strand-strengthening proteins. It’s especially great for dry hair or if you just use shampoo in the shower—and reserve any conditioning efforts for a leave-in conditioner or a styling cream—since it’s one of the most nourishing, conditioning, and hydrating shampoos you’ll find. Kevin Murphy Amazon Key Ingredients:Vitamins A+C boosts and fortifies; evening primrose oil hydrates and softensSize(s):8.4 fl. oz. Why it's great:Kevin Murphys brings salon-grade haircare to the masses and that distinct IYKYK packaging that's chic enough to earn a spot in any shower caddy. And while this wash could easily claim the crown for its ultra-hydrating formula, it deserves a shoutout for how quickly it feeds curly hair the nutrients it needs (it's so darn hydrating and packed with natural goodness, you couldalmostskip conditioner). The magic lies in the antioxidants and fruit extracts: vitamin A softens curly hair and boosts elasticity, vitamin C (via the kakadu plum) helps seal in moisture, and evening primrose oil hydrates. If your curls feel parched from dry or cold climates (or just life in general), reach for the replenishing mojo of this Kevin Murphy classic. Suite Reyad Suite Reyad Key Ingredients:Organic date seed oil promotes hair growth and softens while natural antioxidants maintain moisture.Size(s):9.2 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Cotteblanche describes Suite Reyad's Curl Shampoo as “luxurious, effective, and very Paris-meets-New-York chic,” thanks to its moisture-loving ingredients, lack of harsh surfactants, and ability keep frizz in check. The brand’s shampoo is a clutch for guys with longer curls, delivering deep hydration without stripping strands. With glycerin and a lush blend of oils (like organic date seed), it softens and defines curls, all with a stellar luxe scent of tobacco leaves and palo santo to boot. Salon-developed and expert-approved, this shampoo has that quiet luxury vibe. Aveda Amazon Key Ingredients:A peptide blend strengthens and enhances curls; kokum seed butter nourishes and conditions.Size(s):8.3 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Via science-backed research, natural ingredients, and decades of expertise under its belt Aveda is an OG in the shampoo game. Case in point: the Be Curly Shampoo: a rich, sulfate-free formula that enhances your unique curl definition and fights frizz using plant-powered ingredients. It’s got a rich, creamy texture, and infused with a strengthening peptide to boost volume and lift without compromising your natural texture, i.e. it works with your curls, not against them. If you want to amplify the definition you were naturally born with, this Aveda shampoo is a must-try. Olaplex Amazon Key Ingredients:Coconut Oil-Derived Surfactants cleanse and condition hair; bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate (bond builder) repairs.Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Curls are wonderfully unique in texture, and while they’ve got that enviable, luscious-locks thing going on, they also tend to run drier and are more prone to breakage. If your curls are feeling a little worse for wear—maybe from recent bleaching, heat styling, or just over-manipulation—Olaplex No. 4 is your fix. It uses patented bond-repair tech and coconut-derived surfactants to rebuild broken hair bonds. The result is stronger, softer curls that bounce back from brittleness and dullness. The scent is subtle and the lather is rich in this RX-adjacent shampoo. Bumble and Bumble Amazon Key Ingredients:Avocado oil nourishes and strengthens; shea butter detangles and hydrates; coconut oil moisturizes and smooths; jojoba oil conditions.Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:My stylist colleague with curls swears by Bumble and Bumble’s Curl Moisturizing Shampoo for how effortlessly it detangles. It’s loaded with nourishing oils—avocado, coconut, jojoba—plus rich shea and cocoa butter that flood the hair with moisture, allowing a brush to glide through knots effortlessly. The texture is viscous—almost like a hair mask—and melts through tangles while cleansing as a proper shampoo. The trick, the brand says say, is to work it in with small circular motions while applying to let it work its mojo. Ouai Amazon Key Ingredients:Apple cider vinegar to deep cleanse; hydrolyzed keratin to strengthen and smooth; chelating agents to remove heavy metals and chlorine.Size(s):10 fl. oz. Why it’s great:A good clarifying shampoo is key for a deep cleanse to clear away the buildup curls tend to hold onto. Cotteblanche explains, “These deep-cleaning formulas remove buildup from styling products, minerals, or pollution. Use them once every few weeks.” Ouai’s cult-favorite formula uses apple cider vinegar to break down residue without stripping strands, plus keratin to smooth frizz, and boost shine. Use it when your curls need a good reset or detox, but as Cotteblanche notes: “Follow with a deep conditioner to restore moisture afterward.” R+Co BLEU R+Co Key ingredients:Banana fruit extract, black seed oil, and vegan keratin combine for a strand-smoothing, curl-defining reset| Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Naturally curly fine hair strands need a shampoo that won’t cause dryness or drown your strands with too many conditioning agents. R+Co Bleu’s top-shelf curl wash will give thinner curls maximum buoyancy—the perfect warm-up for a leave-in conditioning spritz. American Crew Ulta Key ingredients:Panthenol floods strands with moisture| Size(s):15.2 fl. oz and 33.8 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Moisture, moisture, moisture—that’s what thick, coarse strands need. American Crew is a salon and barbershop staple for good reason: Their products, including this nourishing shampoo, work on a wide variety of styles. This moisture-preserving shampoo is great for strands of all curliness; if you have thick, coarse, or frizzy hair, then this formula will smooth out the cuticle and set you up for cooperative hair days on the regular. Davines Amazon Key ingredients:Plum “phytoceuticals” pump strands full of fortifying antioxidants| Size(s):8.4 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Davines’ curl-care lineupis a knockout assortment, including a dedicated shampoo that could have also taken the top spot on this list. However, this Replumping formula deserves attention for anyone with thinning or receding hair: It can reset hair of all curl patterns and strand densities, which helps to promote thicker hair growth and fuller expression after a rinse. Chase it with a targeted lightweight conditioner or curl cream for perfect definition every time. IGK Amazon Key ingredients:Spirulina protein nourishes strands while a blend of seven plant-based oils smoothes, calms, and fortifies hair| Size(s):8 fl. oz. and 33.9 fl. oz. Why it’s great:If you’ve never used the phrase “life-changing” to describe a shampoo, then here’s where that changes: IGK’s hair wash is the fastest U-turn for frizzy and damaged hair—and for keeping split ends and breakage at bay. Its oil-rich recipe is a super-smoother for even the coarsest strands, and the perfect foundation for thick- and straight-haired individuals, too. Frederick Benjamin Walmart Key ingredients:Natural oils from spearmint and clove stimulate the scalp while hemp seed calms inflammation or itching| Size(s):12 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Frederick Benjamin’s paraben-free shampoo is great in curls of any length, but it’s especially good for short styles of all textures. The invigorating recipe takes a scalp-centric approach, leaving your hair feeling tingly fresh thanks to its spearmint-powered recipe. If you want to use one shampoo until the end of time, then here’s your choice. (As an added bonus, it’s extremely cost-effective.) Prose Prose Key ingredients:Changes with each formula to target the needs of the customer| Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Prose switches up the formula based on everything from your strand density and scalp oil levels to your styling goals, hair dye, water hardness, and more. You’ll get a recipe that suits your specific needs—and curls. Carol's Daughter Walmart Key ingredients:Shea butter and panthenol provide nourishing, smoothing reset| Size(s):12 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Pro Tip: Don’t overwash your curls, even if you have oily hair. Too much shampoo could be overstripping that much-needed moisture they need for definition and bounce. So, every second (and maybe third) wash, swap in aco-wash—that is, a conditioning rinse, like Carol’s Daughter’s Hair Milk. It provides enough of a cleanse to keep your scalp refreshed while flooding strands with moisture and conditioning agents. It’s a perfect pick for the minimalist, as well as for the light-packing traveler who wants to lather on a hero hair care product while away from home. Bumble and Bumble Amazon The last thing you want when you have curly hair—or any type of hair, really—is a shampoo that's going to dry you out and overly strip your hair of its natural oils. This curl moisturizing shampoo works into a great lather, smells terrific, and leaves your hair feeling soft and supple. Davines Davines GQ's senior commerce editor Ian Burke loves this bottle from Davines. “It smells great and doesn't dry out my scalp at all,” he says. The ingredients in this bottle not only moisturize your hair, but also help boost the elasticity of your curls. Amazon Dermstore Sachajuan Yes, even Sachajuan's Moisturizing Shampoo—though not specifically designed for curls—is great for curly hair. We're huge fans of the brand's entire line of products, and this unbelievably good-smelling bottle will have you feeling like you're at a fancy hotel. Cécred Ulta This color-safe shampoo from Cécred is a great choice for all hair types and textures, and uses a blend of baobab, moringa, and black seed oils to leave your strands feeling hydrated and strong. (OneGQstaffer swears by this stuff.) Before you start adding anything with aloe and coconut oil into your Amazon cart, start by identifying your curl type and the texture of your curls, Streicher says. Most people will default to choosing a shampoo based on curl pattern (think: wavy hair, coily hair, etc.). However, that part factors in more when it comes to styling—instead, focus on your hair needs and whether you have fine, coarse, or thick hair. “For fine, thin texture, you’ll want a shampoo that’s hydrating but not too heavy,” Streicher explains. “For curls and hair textures that are a bit coarser and thicker, you will want something a bit [more moisturizing].” That same logic goes into straight hair shampoos, too—thicker and coarser hair usually requires more heft from nourishing ingredients, while fine strands can’t risk any weighing down. However, that doesn’t mean your search ends there: It’s possible to optimize your best hair routine even further by assessing everything from curl pattern and hair type to humidity levels, oil levels, dandruff, buildup, and more. For that, you may need to call in the help of a barber, stylist, skin care professional, or dermatologist who can help you work towards specific hair goals. Streicher says that finding a great hair routine and products that work with your particular needs is part of a hair-care professional’s responsibility and that you should take the opportunity to talk through it next time you’re at the barber or salon. Remember: Shampoo is only the start of any hair care regimen; think of it as clearing the canvas upon which you’ll apply a deep conditioner and/or styling products. (Read: If you only use shampoo, you’ll be much more susceptible tofrizz—ditto if you touch your curls throughout the day, Streicher says.) So, don’t rely solely on a clarifying shampoo to keep your curls defined and healthy; incorporate shampoo & conditioner along with other products in your regimen so you can keep your hair strong and style-ready every day.

We found the best drugstore shampoo for curly hair to beAmerican Crew Daily Deep Moisturizing Shampoo. What makes curly hair unique—and why does that matter when choosing a shampoo? “Curly hair isn’t just about texture,” says Cotteblanche. “It’s about structure, moisture retention, and how it responds to its environment.” Because curls bend and twist, the cuticle doesn’t lie flat—making hair more porous, prone to moisture loss, and sensitive to humidity and friction. In short, curls are delicate. “They’re especially fragile at the bends, and natural oils also struggle to travel down the hair’s spiral shape,” he adds. That fragility is why shampoo choice matters. “Harsh formulas can strip moisture,” Cotteblanche explains. “That disrupts the curl pattern, leaving hair frizzy, dull, or brittle. So, the right shampoo isn’t optional—it’s essential to clean but also support health and structure.” What ingredients should men with curly hair look for in a shampoo—and why? “Look for moisturizing—not just hydrating—ingredients,” says Cotteblanche. Curly hair craves moisture, but not just on the surface—it needs nourishment that supports structure, seals in hydration and defines curl shape. Humectants like glycerin draw in moisture and boost elasticity, while aloe vera soothes the scalp, softens strands, and adds shine. Emollients like shea and cocoa butter deeply condition, and nutrient-rich oils help lock in moisture and tame frizz. “Coconut oil helps prevent protein loss,” he suggests, “while argan adds gloss and controls frizz, avocado or castor nourishes dry curls, and jojoba mimics natural sebum to protect.” What ingredients should men avoid in a curly hair shampoo—and why? “Rule number one: avoid sulfates,” says Cotteblanche. These harsh detergents strip your natural oils and leave curls frizzy and dull. “Curly hair thrives on moisture, so anything that depletes it—like sulfates, which can leave curls dry and brittle, or drying alcohols that roughen the cuticle and dehydrate strands—is a no-go.” “Also say non merci to non-water-soluble silicones,” he adds. “They weigh curls down, cause buildup, and block moisture.” Bottom line: The right shampoo will care for your curls byleaving outingredients that strip, smother, or dry them out. Can you tell us about frizz and why that’s such an issue with curly hair? How does the right shampoo help? Frizz isn’t just a cosmetic issue—it’s all about moisture management. “Frizz happens when curls are dry or disrupted—often by humidity, but also by rough towel drying or using the wrong products,” says Cotteblanche. It’s one of the most common and misunderstood curly hair concerns. “When the hair’s cuticle is raised, moisture from the air enters the shaft, causing it to swell and lose definition,” he explains. Because curly hair is naturally drier and more porous than straight hair, it’s especially prone to this. The fix? Use shampoos with moisturizing, smoothing ingredients. “Butters like shea and cocoa are great—they help flatten the cuticle, lock in moisture, and prevent curls from absorbing excess humidity.” How often should men with curly hair shampoo—and does it vary by curl type or lifestyle? “It depends on your curl pattern, lifestyle, and product use,” says Cotteblanche. “If your routine is pretty low-key, two washes a week is fine. But if you’re hitting the gym, dealing with humidity or pollution, or using heavy styling products, you’ll need to shampoo more often. Guys with looser curls might shampoo three to four times a week, while tighter curls or coils—since they’re drier and more delicate—usually do best with just one wash a week.” For in-between days, he recommends a co-wash to refresh curls without stripping moisture. “Consistency is key,” he adds. “Over-washing dries out hair, under-washing leads to buildup—finding your balance keeps curls healthy, defined, and manageable.” How do common styling habits (like using gel, mousse, or pomade) affect the kind of shampoo a man with curly hair should use? Styling products—like gel, mousse, cream, or pomade—can leave behind residue that builds up over time. “Even if you’re not styling every day, buildup is inevitable,” says Cotteblanche. That residue can weigh curls down, dull their shape, and leave hair feeling greasy or limp. If you use heavier stylers often, your shampoo needs to work harder without stripping moisture—which is where a gentle clarifying formula comes in. “A monthly or bi-weekly clarifier resets the scalp and strands, giving curls a clean slate.” Just be sure to follow with something hydrating to keep curls soft and defined.",

But when I’m not holding up my hands to block my view of the gruesome things happening on screen, I am grateful to seeNoah Wyle, formerERstar, doing his thing. His calm, handsome presence almost makes up for all the blood, stress, and misplaced invertebrates. And sinceThe Pitt’s undeniable success means Max is currentlygearing up for a second season, Wyle is still on the promotional trail, bringing his even-keeled vibe to the late-night circuit. Since he’s been playing a TV doctor on and off for the last 15 years, it’s rare that we get to see the actor in his off-duty attire. We got a rare glimpse, though, when Wyle headed into theJimmy Kimmel Livestudios in Los Angeles earlier this week. Noah Wyle heads into theJimmy Kimmel Livestudios in Los Angeles on Monday. He was dressed comfortably in a coffee-toned knit varsity jacket from Dehen 1920, a century-old clothing brand based in Oregon. The rest of his outfit was equally unassuming and refreshingly age-appropriate: well-worn Jack Purcell sneakers in navy—a color that Converse doesn’t even manufacture anymore, meaning Wyle’s presumably hung onto these for a while—and slim blue jeans. (It doesn’t feel like a coincidence that, at 53, Noah Wyle is the exact same age asWalton Goggins, who is also a slim-jeans loyalist.) In theanything-goes era of celebrity menswear, Wyle looked just about as un-hypey as you could get. In other words, he dressed exactly how a veteran star should. Dehen 1920 Dehen 1920",

No watch brand is better at leveraging its roster of handsome, perfectly coiffed celebrity ambassadors thanOmega. Up to this point, the watchmaker has mostly stuck to trotting out Daniel Craig to tease its upcoming releases: The former 007 hashelped whet collectors’appetites forpieces like the white-dial Speedmasteranda special variant of the Seamaster Diver 300M. At Monday night’sMet Gala, Omega went back to the well with the ever-dapperColman Domingo. And unlike Craig, who wore his never-before-seen timepieces somewhat stealthily, Domingo debuted a new watch on the highest-voltage red carpet of the year. The piece certainly seems deserving of such a stage. Squinting at closeups of the watch, it appears to be a yellow-gold Speedmaster with a black dial and white subdials. At first glance, I thought there might be diamonds on the bezel, but I feel fairly certain now it was just a trick of the light. One important note of distinction: Earlier this year, Domingo wore another very special $160,000 version of the Speedmasterto the Oscars. The diamond-set, “Canopus Gold” Speedy—made from a mixture that includes platinum, gold, palladium, and rhodium—was a made-to-order piece. While elusive, it’s a different beast than the actor’s Met Gala ticker, which, like Craig’s preview pieces before it, appears to be set for an eventual wider release. The Swiss watchmaker wasn’t able to clarify much in an official statement (emphasis mine): “Concerning the OMEGA timepiece worn by Colman Domingo at the Met Gala 2025, this is anunreleased Speedmaster modelthat has not been announced publicly. The brand will not be revealing any details about thenew watch until a later date.” Sounds like we’ll be seeing this watch in boutiques at some point in the future.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Vacation on the brain and a wad of PTO burning a hole in your company portal? Not so fast, fella. Identifying the best resort wear for men is an art you shouldn't leave to the day before your flight, lest you arrive at your next destination looking like a hapless tourist. (Free game: don’t be that obnoxious American). Don’t get us wrong, the point of a summer trip is to decompress, let the stress melt away, and make some memories. That said, you might not remember what you wore, but your camera roll doesn’t lie. And having your outfits on point and lined up will make you feel even better about your trip. To quote Coach Prime, “If you look good, you feel good. If you feel good, you play good. If you play good, they pay good.” Can’t say that you’ll get paid in money, but you can’t bet you’ll get paid in compliments. And that’s not nothing. To get you geared up, we’ve broken down everything you need for vacationing in style. From breezy linen shirts to don’t-bother-me shades, easy-living sandals to scuba-ready watches, here’s all the resort wear to pack for your summer getaway. When trading snow for sand, the first step is to make sure you’re sorted for shorts and swimmers. You might not have worn them for six months, but no matter the itinerary, you’ll want to set your knees free. Cotton shorts, the pairs below are a little looser and a touch more formal—both good moves to make right now. On the swim trunks front, assuming you’re not out surfing or tackling anything too technical, the below have you covered for comfort, style and versatility—meaning you could even get away with wearing them without a body of water in sight. Uniqlo x JW Anderson Uniqlo Lululemon Lululemon Patagonia Patagonia Bather Bather Your vacation shirts and polos should do more than just cover you—they should be equally suitable for breakfast and dinner, and breathable while still shielding you from the sun in all the right places. The below are ready to be dressed up under a jacket in the evening, but can also rock with any of the shorts above. Just note: We hit peak camp collar in 2024, so expect none of that here. J.Crew J.Crew Corridor Huckberry Banana Republic Banana Republic Kardo Mr Porter They say your shoes are the first thing people look at when checking out your style—and that applies to vacation fit pics too. The below shoes aren’t just nice to look at, they’re comfortable too, and low-profile enough to give your ankles a tan so good you’ll consider buying an anklet to draw attention to them. Our only tip is to wear them for a day or two at home before you go—nothing ruins a vacation like a blister. Gucci Gucci Tecovas Tecovas Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Vans J.Crew Vacation pants might have the biggest mental effect of your whole vacation wardrobe. Truly, nothing switches the mindset like swaddling your thighs in soft linen after months of heavy denim. Breezy, rumpled, free-flowing—these are the pants that let you lounge. They move with you, not against you. Wear them like you’re wearing sweats, and you’ll look even better for it. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Frescobol Carioca Mr. Porter Alex Mill Alex Mill Buck Mason Buck Mason Sometimes we’re so excited to escape to warmer weather that we forget the sun won’t be out all day. In fact, the desert can get surprisingly chilly at night, and sea breezes often sweep onto the shore, leaving you wishing—usually around 5PM—that you’d brought a light layer. That’s why it’s always a good idea to pack a casual sport jacket—something not too heavy, that also adds a touch of put-togetherness without ever feeling too formal or weighing you down. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Levi's Levi's No Maintenance No Maintenance Ralph Lauren SSENSE Once you’ve reached your destination, it won’t be the snow blinding you any longer—just the blazing sun. Protect your eyes and make an entrance with a classic pair of sunglasses that arejustbold enough. A light, durable acetate frame is a solid choice, and from there, it's all about finding the shape and color that best suits you. For a sharp look, a solid black pair will do the trick. Too harsh? Tortoiseshell shades are a little softer, but still just as iconic. Chanel Chanel Port Tanger SSENSE Thistles Thistles Cartier SSENSE Wearing a fragrance while on vacation isn’t about masking the scent of sunscreen or sweat—it’s about creating an atmosphere. You want something fresh, light, and a little unexpected. It’s all about amplifying the essence of your escape, whether that’s the salty breeze of the beach, or the fragrant flowers on the hillside. This way, the right fragrance will take you straight back to your destination, long after you’ve returned home. D.S & DURGA SSENSE Le Labo Nordstrom Hawthorne Nordstrom Malin + Goetz Malin + Goetz You’re on vacation, which means some well-deserved R&R next to the pool, by the ocean, or in the hot tub. Your clothes will be scant so it’s all up to your wrist to carry your vacation style. And unless you don’t really care about whether your watch actually tells the time or not, you’ll want a ticker that can take to the water like the dolphins you’re trying to swim with. Even if you aren’t planning on hitting any bodies of water on your summer vacation, it’s still smart to have a piece of wrist candy that’s as charming as it is ready for action.

    "title": "These $4 Uniqlo Socks Just Scored a Major Fashion Cosign",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The fashion world is catching on to what so many of us have known all along: Uniqlo socks are almost undeniably the best socks on the market. We’ve oftensaid as much! But the latestLyst Index—a periodic popularity vote ranking the 10 “hottest products”, collated by the global e-tailer Lyst—has included Uniqlo’s Colorful Socks, sharing space with runway luminaries like Celine, miu miu, and Saint Laurent. Not that Uniqlo’s socks needed the affirmation, but it’s nice to see even fashion obsessives catching on to what millions have understood for years: Uniqlo socks >>> all other socks. As with everything Uniqlo, the allure comes from combining stellar quality with “Wait, is that right?” prices. You can buy Uniqlo Colorful Socks as loosies for $3.90, but four pairs will run you only $12.90 (saving you $2.70—so you’re gettingmostof a pair for free). You might think you don’t need that many more socks, but have you put on a fresh pair mid-day, just because? Or found yourself packing bonus “in case” socks while traveling? Wishing you hadjustthe right shade of blue? Uniqlo understands. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Here’s where I make a confession: I own an embarrassing array of supposedly fancy socks. My favorites come from brands likeAnonymous Ism,Front General Store, andCorgi, and regularly cost $20 or more for just a single pair. But I’d be lying if I said wearing Uniqlo socks feels like a notable downgrade from any of the above. They’re soft, they stay up, they last through lots of washes, the ribbing means they can hold down a suit if need be, and there are more colors to choose from (51) than your local nail salon. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Granted, saying that “Uniqlo Socks Are Good, Actually” isn’t breaking news. Pointing out that any Uniqlo staple punches far above its weight is like pointing out that the sky is blue. But it’s easy to forget how good Uniqlo’s Ribbed Socks really are, especially when a single pair costs less than a McDouble. If there’s anything actionable here, it’s that a quick assessment of your sock drawer is probably in order. If you’re maxed out on Uniqlo’s Colorful style, I also highly recommend the brand’sStriped Pile Socks,Pile Half Socks, andMelange Half Socks(which I’ll use for relaxed hiking, since they hold up on the trail as well as anything else). Variety is the spice of life, but Uniqlo’s socks are meat-and-potatoes perfection. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo",

    "title": "Lewis Pullman Steps Out of the Shadows",
    "article_text": "It’s a sunny Saturday in April, and in about two weeks, Lewis Pullman’s life is going to change. On May 2,Thunderbolts*—Pullman’s first foray into the industry-defining, fan-obsessing, billions-of-dollars-generatingMarvel Cinematic Universe—will debut in theaters around the world, to above-average reviews and a weekend-winning $76 million domestic gross. In the film, which at press time remains the number-one movie in America, most of Pullman’s co-stars (including Sebastian Stan and Florence Pugh) are reprising roles they've played in previous Marvel movies. Pullman, on the other hand, plays a new character named…Bob. Sounds underwhelming, but as comic-book fans figured out the minute the trailers dropped, Bob is also the Sentry, aSuperman-esque figure who’s canonically stronger than the Hulk and almost as smart as Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four—and who, in the course of the film, loses control of his malevolent alter ego and becomes the movie’s primary antagonist. We’ll refrain from further spoilage, but Marvel has already announced that Pullman will be part of the upcomingAvengers: Doomsday, the 2026 event film that Marvel hopes will restore the studio to its Phase Three glory; the Sentry will presumably play a key role in that film as well. But at this moment in April, Bob is not yet a household name, and Pullman, 32, is still able to go unnoticed on the patio of his favorite burger place in Silver Lake. He’s still got some superhero bulk to his body, there’s a smattering of faint tattoos on his forearms, and he’s wearing a sick vintage T-shirt with a dragon on it, but the other customers pay more attention to a friendly dog who is enjoying the weather. Pullman, whose only public social media profile isa sporadically-updated Letterboxd account, seems like the kind of guy who’d want to maintain this low-key presence for as long as he can. Besides, during his decade inside the entertainment industry, he’s realized there are no guarantees. Pullman is best known for playing characters with a dopey naivete or a churning intensity. InThunderbolts*he gets to do both. The film is also the first time he’s been part of a project that’s kicked off the summer movie season, but he’s trying to moderate his expectations. A little while later, once he’s devoured a burger and repaired to a dark bar up the street, he offers his sensible perspective. “If there’s anything I've learned—and I learned this from my dad too—it’s that you hear often,This is really going to move the needle, or whatnot,” he says. “That can be a kind of dangerous thing to think if that's something that you want and it doesn’t happen. I've heard that enough times and the needle remained stagnant.” Pullman’s aforementioned dad isBill Pullman, the veteran actor who’s probably best known for his role inIndependence Day, where he plays an American president who not onlydelivers a rousing speech as the score swells behind him, but also blasts alien spacecraft out of the sky during air-to-air combat. Lewis’ mom, Tamara Hurwitz, is a modern dancer and instructor. Pullman is the youngest of the couple’s three children, and the whole family remains close-knit. “It’s the nucleus in my life,” he says. This connection has helped his performances in some unexpected ways. Pullman recently finished filmingAnn Lee—a new film from Mona Fastvold which stars Amanda Seyfried as the founder of the Shakers, an 18th century charismatic Christian sect. His mom helped with the dancing the role required and his sister Maesa, who performs and teaches music, worked with him on his singing. Pullman was born in Los Angeles in the early 1990s and was raised in Beachwood Canyon, a neighborhood on the eastern edge of the Hollywood Hills that seems magical to live in, as long as you were able to buy a house before real estate prices skyrocketed. His fatherfilled their property with a vertically-stacked orchard—tangerines, oranges, grapefruits, mulberries, sapotes, and other exotic fruits—and still enlists the rest of the Pullmans when it’s time to harvest and preserve the bounty. When a movie required Bill to shoot in some far-flung location (Finland, Prague, Portland), the whole family would come along, relying on homeschool teachers to get the kids through the study packets they’d been assigned. Pullman did some acting when he was younger, appearing in school plays and short films his friends made, but his main focus was drumming in bands. Academics didn’t come easily to him. “All those other classes were just tormentingly difficult for me to keep up with,” he says. “I didn't really learn on the graph paper well.” He was ready to spend his post-graduation years on tour, but his mom told him that she thought he should go to college. His parents had generally taken a hands-off approach to his upbringing, letting him figure things out on his own and gently guiding him when they could, so in the rare instances when they gave him a clear directive about what he should do, he figured they probably knew what they were talking about. He ended up at Warren Wilson, a small, non-traditional college of a few hundred kids in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. The school put an equal emphasis on study, work, and community service, so he explored the arts, drove a tractor as part of the groundskeeping crew, and volunteered at a homeless services center in nearby Asheville. When it was over, he hoped to return to L.A. with a three-pronged plan to explore acting, make music, and put his social work major to use with the city’s unhoused population. But when he was in Austin on his road trip back home he got a call from Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the directorial couple behindLittle Miss Sunshineand an array of classic alternative rock music videos. Their daughter had co-starred with Pullman in a high school production ofFranny and Zooey, and they remembered his performance as they were trying to castHighston, a quirky comedy pilot for Amazon about a kind, possibly disturbed young man who gets dubious advice from the celebrities he has for imaginary friends. He eventually booked the gig (as didFleaandShaquille O’Nealfor the first episode), but the series wasn’t picked up. I tracked it down on what appears to be Russia’s version of YouTube; although it’s his first real acting gig, Pullman is already an endearing screen presence, maintaining his sweet-natured smile as he bombs a job interview and checks into a mental health facility. WhenHighstondidn’t go forward, Pullman dedicated himself to getting better at auditions, since the idea of doing them terrified him so much. “That's scarier than any other part of the process. It's just so many unnatural elements in that room,” he says. “I grew up a very anxious kid and not very socially apt in a lot of ways. I was like,If I can do this, I can be a ninja conversationally outside of that.” As Pullman honed those skills, he started appearing in his friends’ movies and music videos as they too were entering the industry. “I said yes to everything,” he explains. “I wanted to just do as much as possible, no matter how embarrassing or humiliatingly clownish it was. I was like, it doesn't matter, because I just need to be able to not treat the camera like a villain and treat it like a friend.” Then he adds, “There's so much blackmail material out there of me where I was just trying to figure it out.” Pullman got his first big break with 2018’sBad Times at the El Royale, a Tarantino-ish film from writer-director Drew Goddard, set in a hotel that straddles the California-Nevada border, and might also be purgatory. He played an outwardly meek bellboy harboring his own sinister secrets; it was the last role cast in the movie, because they couldn’t find the right young actor. Too many of them played up the damage and potential danger in the character, but Goddard was searching for something else, and immediately saw it in Pullman. “It's what you're looking for in casting, which is someone who is deeply connected to the soulfulness of the character, and Lewis just accessed that,” Goddard says. ”There's something about men, and young men in particular, where they're afraid to be compassionate and earnest. Whereas Lewis—his beating heart just comes out on the screen immediately.\" ThoughEl Royaleunderperformed at the box office, critics took note of Pullman, even as he shared scenes withJeff Bridges,Chris Hemsworth, andJon Hammgiving uninhibited performances. Over the course of his brief career, he’s also performed alongside consistently great workhorses including Lili Taylor, Bill Camp, Kyle Chandler, and Jason Clarke. Pullman is an eager student of the acting craft, but has realized that maybe not everyone on set is as down to talk shop as he is. “I always want to get right into asking questions and geeking out about it, but everyone's different and everyone has different processes and sometimes don't want to crack their bubble of imagination to be like, ‘How wasHell or High Waterfor you?’” he says. That wasn’t his experience onTop Gun: Maverick, the domestic box office champion of 2022. In that movie, Pullman played another character named Bob, whose bad-ass call sign is also… Bob. In a room of cocksure alphas, Bob is an oblivious beta. The supporting cast of the Tom Cruise vehicle was stacked with hotly-tipped young actors—Glen Powell,Miles Teller, Monica Barbaro,Jay Ellis, Danny Ramirez—but the star at the center of the film made himself readily available to them. “I think he saw himself in all of us…and was so very much wanting and willing to give us gems,” Pullman says. “In between takes, we'd all be gathered around and he'd be telling us justgold. Just gold stories after gold stories. I don't want to speak for him, but I do feel like he was so driven and had done so much on his own for himself, and I'm sure that he had a lot of mentors, but that he worked his ass off to get them. And so I think he wanted to bridge that gap for us in a way that maybe hadn't been bridged for him.” Filming onTop Gun: Mavericklasted for 10 months, and the younger members of the cast remain close. Pullman grew especially tight with Ramirez, who played Fanboy, one of the other weapons systems operators. They bonded as they rode in the van to shooting locations together and shared approaches on how to feel less nauseous when filming the flight sequences. After the film wrapped, Ramirez ended up living in the small guest house behind Pullman’s place in Los Angeles for a while. \"We all gravitated towards Lew because he has a superhero power of holding space,” Ramirez says. “Through his honesty, it allows others to be really honest around him. It creates a really beautiful dynamic where there is no judgement. I've felt able to fully be myself around him since the first day we met.” Thanks toTop Gun, Pullman came into the MCU with at least a degree of blockbuster experience under his belt. But he's given some of his best performances on TV, particularly his two-season run on Amazon's now-cancelledOuter Rangeas Rhett Abbott, a well-meaning cowboy and bull rider prone to drinking and poor decisions. Josh Brolin played Rhett's father, a Wyoming rancher with a cosmic vortex at the corner of his pasture. Brolin’s daughter Eden, as it happens, has been playing music with Pullman since high school in a band called Atta Boy. He and Brolin had previously met only a few times before he was cast; when Brolin heard the news, he opened his congratulatory phone call with a gravelly “What the fuck is going on here?” “He was so sweet, though,\" Pullman is quick to add. \"He was so excited that there was already some history there that we could mine.” Pullman is even better known for his stint on the Apple TV seriesLessons in Chemistry, where he played the brilliant and eccentric partner of Brie Larsen, and who is also an unfortunate early adopter of jogging. The role earned him an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. (He lost out toLamorne MorrisinFargo—but so didRobert Downey Jr., John Hawkes, and the late Treat Williams.) Despite these accomplishments, Pullman has been hesitant to take on more TV roles, given that they have the potential to lock him into one character for years. For that same reason, he was unsure about joining the Marvel franchise. HisThunderbolts*co-star Sebastian Stan has been playing Bucky Barnes since Trump was just starting to spread birther conspiracies about Obama. Thunderbolts*hasn’t had the smoothest path to screens. Filming was delayed by both the Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes, causing its release date to be pushed back twice. Steven Yeun was originally cast in the film, but had to drop out following scheduling conflicts, and it’s been assumed that Pullman took over his role. Marvel is also in the midst of a slump, in which its successes (see:Deadpool and Wolverine) have become more infrequent than its failures (see:Captain America: Brave New World,The Marvels,Secret Invasion,Echo, and so on). Yet it remains the biggest franchise on the planet. Due to secrecy concerns, Pullman wasn’t allowed to read theThunderbolts*script before committing to the project, but the film’s director Jake Schreier described its entire plot and themes in detail during an intensive meeting. “I basically just told him the story ofThunderbolts*, almost like a campfire story,” Schreier says. “What I was trying to explain to him is that the superhero part is probably the least interesting side of what Bob can be,” he continues, “and that there was this really interesting character created by [comics writer] Paul Jenkins and what we were trying to do with it. We had set it up as this spectrum between hubris and despair.” In the comic books, the character of Bob/The Sentry has been a means for writers to explore mental illness and substance abuse, and those ideas have carried over into the film. “Once [Schreier] described the character, I was like, I can't actually imagine myself being any other Marvel character,” Pullman says with a self-deprecating laugh. “The superhero whose weakness is his depression and trauma—I think there's a lot to mine there.” Though there have been previous Marvel films that have touched on societal issues—from the growth of the surveillance state inCaptain America: The Winter Soldierto the legacies of colonialism and racism inBlack Panther—Thunderbolts*is the first one whose cultural subtext is the loneliness epidemic. Pullman knows how it sounds, getting high-minded about a movie that has an estimated budget above $150 million and alimited-edition Wheaties tie-in, but he saysThunderbolts*gave him some emotional opportunities that even his indie-heavy filmography hadn’t allowed. “In some ways I always had this naive dream about blending my social work experience with film, which has been kind of hard to do, but in a lot of ways this character and this film feel like the first time I've been able to weld those things together because this character deals with some stuff that I've dealt with,” he says. “It felt very personal to depict it in an accurate and sensitive way that is also digestible to people all over the world.” Pullman also had to adjust to life on a Marvel set, a work environment he says is unlike any other in the entertainment industry. “I learned a lot through observation,” he says. “I was scared because it is a kind of musicality and type of storytelling that takes a lot of skill to make it look easy. What Florence [Pugh] and David Harbour and Wyatt Russell and everyone in that movie is doing looks easy, and take it from me, I've tried and it's fucking hard as hell and I don't know if I was successful.” At the same time, Pullman was pushing himself physically. After getting off set at 9:30 at night, he’d work out with a trainer until midnight so he could convincingly look like someone imbued with the power of a million suns. After that he’d study his lines until two in the morning before waking up at 5:30 to head to set. Though he now realizes he may not have had to train quite as hard as he did, it did give him the strength to pull off the stunts and demands the role required. “The main difference between an indie and a movie of this size is they have the resources to do it as many times until they get it right,” he says. “Every department is the best of the best, and you don't want them to finally get in their groove and then you're burnt out by the end and then you're the weakest link. I just was terrified of being the stick in the spokes.” Ramirez joined the MCU a few years before Pullman, taking on the role of the new Falcon alongside Anthony Mackie’s Captain America. When the Sentry offer came, he encouraged his friend to suit up and he’s been impressed—but not surprised—by how fast Pullman’s been able to excel at this type of performance. “It's this beautiful universe that started before we joined and is going to continue after, and to fully trust fall and be as vulnerable and open in those moments, it feels different than doing it for an indie, obviously,” Ramirez says. “For him to do that and to be caught by the filmmaker and the rest of the cast, and to continue delivering every day, it shows the stamina he has as a performer and the willingness he has to investigate the truth.\" Before Pullman returns to the world of superheroes withAvengers: Doomsday, he’s been doing some more low-key work. He just returned from Vancouver, where he filmed a Netflix movie calledRemarkably Bright Creatures, based on Shelby Pelt’s enormously popular novel. The film mainly revolves around him, Sally Field, and an octopus inside an aquarium—though the octopus will be added entirely as a special effect in post-production. “We were just looking at an empty tank the whole time,” Pullman says. “The amazing part about that though is that if I ever was looking in the tank thinking,How do I imagine the fucking beauty of this alien creature?, I would just look over at Sally Field. It was like she was fuckingseeingthe octopus.” The commercial success ofThunderbolts*could put Lewis, for the first time in his career, in a position where his involvement might help a movie get made. To this end, he recently started a production company, Buckwild Pictures. He has plenty of friends who write or direct and can’t get the money to move beyond the short film stage and make something bigger. “There was something really alluring about that maybe I could be some sort of an asset for driving these things to the finish line, if possible,” he says. I asked Pullman if he ever talked to his dad about how his life changed afterIndependence Day. He has; Bill told him the best thing about starring in the highest-grossing movie of 1996 was the possibilities it opened up. “That's what I'm most curious about, is if something does shift, whether that will give me the opportunity to potentially tell stories that I've always wanted to be a part of, but was never really considered for—whether that be because they couldn't imagine me in it, they hadn't seen me in anything, or because I didn't have any sort of pull in this demographic and couldn't get financing here or there or whatever,” he says. “I'm not looking forward to it, because I don't want to say that, but I am curious about if that were to happen.” PRODUCTION CREDITS:Photographs byJames EmmermanGrooming byChristine Nelliusing Bumble and bumble",

    "title": "‘Andor’'s Benjamin Bratt Takes On an Iconic ‘Star Wars’ Role",
    "article_text": "This story contains spoilers for episodes 7-9 ofAndorseason two. Andorjust went there. Over the last few weeks, the Tony Gilroy-created,Diego Luna-frontedStar Warsseries'second seasonhas been ramping up the tension as the Empire slowly and steadily built a foothold on Ghorman. The wealthy planet is home to a mineral called Kalkite, critical to constructing the Death Star. Over several years, the Empire has been sowing a misinformation campaign, allowing pockets of rebellion to form in order to eventually justify invading the planet (and stripping it of its resources.) This week, the powder keg finally ignited, resulting in a harrowing sequence where Imperial forces commit genocide against the Ghorman, with Andor (Luna) caught in the middle. After one of the most intense and distressing moments in the franchise's history, it’s comforting to see a familiar face. Episode nine, which takes place in the aftermath of the attack, opens on Bail Organa, father to Princess Leia and stalwart figure of the rebellion.Star Warsfans will undoubtedly remember Jimmy Smits' appearances as Organa across a handful of projects, including theGeorge Lucasprequels andRogue One. However, due to scheduling issues, Smits could not return, which led Gilroy to tap veteran actor Benjamin Bratt for the role. Bratt appeared briefly in episode six in a passing appearance, but takes on a much more active role in episode nine, the last of the three episodes that dropped last night on Disney+. His calming presence and leadership allow Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) to take a stand against the Emperor in the Galactic Senate before Andor whisks her off to lead the soon-to-be united pockets of rebel forces. Ahead of this block of episodes, GQ jumped on the phone with Bratt to talk about stepping into Smits’ shoes, his history with the world ofStar Wars, the stakes of rebellion, and more. GQ: When were you first approached about coming in for season two? Benjamin Bratt:It was a little over two years ago, during the pandemic, pre-writer's strike. I got a call that Tony Gilroy wanted to have a conversation with me aboutAndor. At that point, I hadn't watched any episodes. As a huge fan of Tony, my immediate fantasy was, \"Ah, [laughs] he's probably peeped some of my independent film work and wants me to come on board as kind of intergalactic Emiliano Zapata [laughs] and lead a small resistance faction on some foreign planet.” Within the first two minutes of our conversation, he immediately dashed that fantasy. He said, \"We have that. We have that in the form of Cassian Andor, so this is something a little bit more staid,\" if you will. He explained that Jimmy was not available to come back. Although there wasn't a whole lot to do, [the role] was very important; [Organa] holds a very important place in the canon, of course, as one of the known architects of the rebellion, [and] it was important to get it right, and would I be interested? That began the initial conversation, and for me, it was an immediate yes. I didn't really have to think about it too much for all the obvious reasons. I mean, chiefly,Andorwas a celebrated spinoff of theStar Warsuniverse, all the players involved, obviously led by Diego, and everyone else. But as a longtime fan of Jimmy's, I thought it would be a unique challenge to come in and both honor what he did originally with the character and try to do something unique with it from my own perspective and still stay true to what Bail Organa is expected to be. What's your history withStar Wars? I'll take you to it, man. 1977, San Francisco, my hometown, standing in line with hundreds of other people outside theCoronet Theater on Geary Boulevard, waiting to see what, by all accounts, was expressed to be a mind-blowing experience. It's the stuff of childhood memories. It's the film that everyone was talking about. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine it was something that I could participate in years down the road. So, an early fan like everyone else. Then, when I had children through the aughts, my children became fans. SoRevenge of the Sithand all the other later films that came out. I had a passing familiarity with all of the different appendages of stories that spun off from the original canon. Were your kids excited for you that you were able to join in this and be a part of this experience? I think they're pretty happy about it. Probably less so than if I had a lightsaber in my hand or was part of the Jedi fighting contingent. But no, they haven't seen anything I've done yet. And obviously, just the one episode came out last week, from where they introduced the new Bail, so they haven't really seen it yet. In terms of taking over for the role while still honoring what came before, how do you go about doing that from a process perspective? Are you watching previous material, or are you just going off of what’s on the page? It always starts with the script, but that in of itself was a challenge because Tony, Beau Willimon, and everyone else that writes for the show—they're extraordinary, but they share a similar style. The writing feels, at least from an actor's point of view, very spare. It's terse, it's muscular, it's very to the point. It's a lot of declarative sentences, but succinct. It really gets to the essence of what the scene is about, and there's no fat on it at all. So stylistically, it takes a mental adjustment to jump into something like that and still make it feel real, first of all to yourself and then in what you do with it, so that the audience believes it. So you study the script, you read it over and over again. But then, yes, I revisited the various films in which Bail appears. I watchedRogue Onea couple of times. Quite frankly, I've always felt Jimmy got a little bit of the short end of the stick, very underused for the massive amount of talent that he has as an actor in everything he's appeared in. This is not on Tony or the show at all, I think that, historically, it's been a missed opportunity for Jimmy and how tremendous he is as a performer with the amount of material—or the lack of material—that he was given over the course of however many years it's been. I found myself interestingly faced with a similar prospect: how do I take what looks like so little on the page and make just enough of it to make an impact? It's a real danger for any actor to step into any role, really, and attempt to overdo it in an effort to make an impression. That's a fatal mistake. For me, it was a calibration of coming in and putting fans at ease. They're a particular fan base [laughs], very devoted to their legacy characters, and not afraid to express their opinions about things. I had to give that consideration a nod and then forget it entirely so I could go to work and do what I do. What that really amounted to was a focus on trying to create circumstances in which whatever I was dealing [with] was thought to be believable. It certainly helped, working opposite Genevieve O'Reilly, who is just a tremendous actor and a wonderful person. We became very good friends in my short time there in London, and we all spent some time together shooting in Valencia, Spain, but very generous, incredible to work opposite of. In terms of what she gives within a scene, in the absence of words, she says almost more with the emotions that play out on her face. I found that inspiring, and it reminded me that's also what Tony is known for. Sometimes, often actually, more is being said within a scene and the silences than when words are being spoken. When the script is so sparse, are you using more physical tools to convey those emotions? It's all of a piece. There's an old anecdote where Sir Lawrence Olivier, it's been said, never understood the character that he was meant to play until he put that character's shoes on. In a similar way, once you don the costumes created by Michael Wilkinson, it just changes your posture. It changes your stance, it changes the way you walk. It changes everything about the way you carry yourself physically. It certainly did for me anyway. Playing someone who is known to be measured, calm, honest, earnest, a consummate politician, all of the things that imply, in terms of physicality, a steadiness, was helped and enhanced by the wardrobe. I mean these fabulous flowing capes, amulets appointed on the breast of the jacket, and these boots that come up to your knees. It was a constant physical reminder that you're playing in a totally different space. It's not a jeans and a t-shirt moment, and it obviously affects the way that you speak as well. I was always conscious about trying to stay within the essence of what Jimmy had created, not to veer too out far the line of what he had done, which I hope I succeeded in. At the beginning of episode nine, there’s a moment in your performance where it looks like you’re trying to restrain yourself from doing something as one of the senators is being taken away. Were you trying to layer in that complexity in your performance? I recall filming the scene you're talking about, and it circles back to what we had just spoken of, which is so much more going on in the silence, in the reaction between two people, in the absence of words than within the exchange of words themselves. In that particular scene, it's for good reason because saying anything that would betray what their real concern is or was would get them taken away. The stakes really couldn't be higher, as even their well-regarded peers are being carted off for speaking out against some of the actions against the Ghormans. One of the themes that’s struck me aboutthis seasonis what someone gives up on a personal level in service of something larger. How much of the play that Bail makes in becoming a hostage is rooted in serving the rebellion versus ensuring a level of protection for Leia? I would say not unlike Luthen, but certainly to a different degree, given the circumstances, Bail has enough wisdom and experience to keep an eye on the larger play. If part of that play is putting himself at personal risk by staying behind, because certainly if he leaves, it perhaps reveals too much and puts him in jeopardy. It's the lesser of the two dangers to stay behind and potentially be discovered for some of the interplay he has going on with Senator Mon Mothma. I wasn't thinking about his relationship to Princess Leia and protection of her so much as a protection of the mounting Rebel Alliance and keeping that safe and secret while forces and support are being gathered. That surprises Mon, that in fact, [that's] he's willing to do that. It's a reminder, I think, for audiences, as I've come to learn as I did more reading on Bail and his history, that it's partly—that level of self-sacrifice he's going to put himself into—is why he's considered one of the architects of the rebellion. Any revolution, any rebellion that involves risk to self, to family, to community, to anything you hold dear, is considered honorable. In the research you did, was there another aspect you discovered that gave you another way into the character that wasn’t in your initial consideration of him? I would love to say yes, but the answer is no. Bail is truly one of the more straightforward, reliable characters within the canon. I don't want to say this side of boring, but he's a stalwart from day one through the entirety of his history within the canon as it plays out in the various forms that we can see as an audience. He remains consistently who he is, which is, yes, a pragmatist, but honest, sincere, earnest, a fighter of justice, a fighter for justice, and a fighter for what is right. In terms of his presence within the larger narrative, that's the responsibility of his character. That's the nature of what his character was designed for. You need that to be a foil to whatever villainy is trying to supplant the good that exists within the universe. I guess what I'm trying to say is he's the personification of good, and that in and of itself, as I started saying earlier, is a challenge for me because, while it's a kind of role, I get offered a lot, I'm reluctant to take them because there's not a whole lot of dimension there. As an actor, where I had the chance to do my best work is [when] there's always some internal conflict that's going on and that's at play. That's much more interesting to watch, even as it is someone who's particularly more villainous or less apt to do good. Those kinds of roles are certainly more interesting to play from my point of view anyway, but I was up for the challenge because he's iconic. At the end of the day, Bail Organa is an iconic figure, and the size of the sandbox I was asked to come playing in was one that I've never had the pleasure of stepping into before. I wish, instead of a plastic pail and a little spoon, I was given a dune buggy. But that may come, who knows? What was it like to shoot that sequence with Mon’s big speech, seeing Genevieve's performance, and playing off of that? Well, I don't want to disappoint you, William, but that scene you're referring to it's all shot in pieces, and so her speech was shot on a different day than the day I shot mine. I wish I had a more compelling answer than that. Let me reframe the question: Was there a standout moment you remember from the shoot? I remember the scene where I walked down the hallway of the Senate just before we both entered the chamber. I remember it well because it was my first day, and it felt like an out-of-body experience. It was completely surreal. While I had come to Pinewood a couple of times in the days leading up to my first day of shooting for costume fittings and meetings, et cetera. I'd never actually been on the stages where there were all the artifacts of the universe of Star Wars, including droids and creatures of different sizes and appearances walking around as I had seen them since I was a boy. It was a little disconcerting, and it took a minute for me to get my bearings, but I was essentially thrown into the deep end and said, \"Here's where you start. Here's where you end up and go the opposite Genevieve.\" As I said, she couldn't have been more generous, lovely, and immediately put me at ease. But even between takes on that first day, I remember thinking, \"Is this really happening? Am I really inStar Wars?\" The droids, they're walking around, and the seven-foot-tall creatures—it still hasn't really hit me that I'm part of the universe, but it sure is a pleasure. Was there one piece of history you saw that sticks with you? Yeah, one of the starships outside—there's all kinds of larger set pieces that are sitting outside to be taken up for whatever scene they're going to be useful for. The place they store them was right outside the stages in the open air. To see all of those different things on display as if in a large flea market was part of a surreal daydream.",

    "title": "Why Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Went on a Christian Podcast to Spread the Anti-Trump Gospel",
    "article_text": "Just three weeks ago, New York’s junior senator,Kirsten Gillibrand,popped up as a guest in an unexpected place:Holy Post,a popular Christian podcast colaunched byPhil Vischer,theVeggieTalescocreator whose animated takes on Bible stories made him an evangelical icon. Gillibrand’s appearance was part of her effort to rebrand herself as a faith-driven Democratic politician. “I love discussing my faith, in particular how it informs my work and makes me a better senator. It’s important to me and I was excited to share it with theHoly Postand its audience,” the senator tellsVanity Fair. Gillibrand broke down her reasoning during the podcast interview itself. “I asked my staff, ‘Please find venues and platforms and stages I can be on to talk about faith and to talk about how faith motivates me as a public servant, as a lawmaker, and as somebody in public life,’” the senator told podcast cohostSkye Jethani.She emphasized that, counter to claims from the right, she doesn’t believe Democrats are out of step with Christian values and language: “‘Love your neighbor’ I see as much more aligned with the brand of who the Democratic Party is than who the party of[Donald]Trumpis today.” Gillibrand’s faith isn’t news—she has attended a bipartisan Bible study on Capitol Hill since at least 2017—but she seemingly has a more vibrant religious life than she has previously let on. In her conversation with Jethani, she mentioned that she often travels to churches around New York State to give sermons on Sundays, adding that she has wanted to write a book about her faith but has had trouble finding a publisher. Jethani, who previously served as a pastor and also writes an online devotional series called With God Daily, has been cohosting the podcast with Vischer for more than a decade. The media company, which has 112,000 subscribers on YouTube, is a small but influential outpost in the world of conservative Christians who have bristled at Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party, but have felt hesitant to consider themselves Democrats. Before the 2024 election, Vischer, Jethani, and their cohost,Kaitlyn Schiess,a popular Christian speaker and author, all discussed the idea of rethinking the Christian approach to voting. In the months since, they have criticized Trump without throwing their allegiances completely to his Democratic opponents. Jethani tellsVanity Fairthat he thinksHoly Post’s anti-Trump reputation might have attracted the attention of Gillibrand’s team. “We have been very, very critical of Donald Trump, and that’s partly because we come out of an evangelical community that has sold its soul in many ways to this person,” he says. “I think some people who come to our podcast go, Oh, finally here are some Christians talking about Trump in a significant and critical way. They make assumptions, therefore, that we are completely on board with everything that the Democrats say and do and stand for, and we’re not. We have critiques there as well.” Jethani says he hopes that politicians will be circumspect about the lessons learned from 2024 and the impact ofJoe Rogan’s platform. “The Joe Rogan lesson is not ‘do more podcasts.’ The Joe Rogan lesson is that people want long-form conversations with their political leaders and candidates that are not just a series of talking points. That’s easier to do on a podcast than a televised interview or a radio interview because of the format,” he says. “I agree with Senator Gillibrand that [Democrats] do have a messaging problem and getting on more podcasts would help, but then they also have to let their guard down in those settings, which I understand is risky and dangerous for a political leader.” The stakes were high when Jethani asked Gillibrand about abortion, an issue on which the hosts ofHoly Posthave found themselves at odds with Democrats. “I know Senator Gillibrand’s position and I had no interest in challenging her on that,” he toldVF.“I know the plank of the Democratic Party, and I know that it’s a fool’s errand to say, ‘We’re just going to sweep that away and change it.’ My concern is: Is this party open to people who don’t share their perspective entirely being a part of the party?” Gillibrand’s answer on the podcast was definitelyin linewith Democratic rhetoric on abortion dating back decades. “I think it’s important that we as a party believe in bodily autonomy and equality and civil rights and civil liberties. And literally making health care decisions for women on any level is antithetical to that value. I think that value is a preeminent value,” she answered. “But if any candidate has their own view about whether they would ever seek an abortion or whether they would urge a family member to seek or not seek an abortion, that is entirely their right to have whatever beliefs they have. I would argue strongly, however, that trying to assert your beliefs on someone else is morally wrong and not consistent with, certainly, my faith, and it’s not consistent with the Constitution.” Still, her emphasis on civil liberties left Jethani and his cohosts groaning in their debrief of the interview. Jethani tellsVFthat he bristled because of the presumption that his position entailed “trying to impose this on other people for nefarious reasons.” Ultimately, though, Gillibrand’s decision to highlight individual rights might have been a misstep. In the years following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization,some advocates have spearheaded a new approach for responding to the deadly outcomes of the post-Roeworld. In 2024, Democratic strategists hoped the party would make inroads among voters who had previously considered themselves pro-life, andKamala Harriswas an ideal messenger for the moment. During her speech at the Democratic National Convention last August, and during remarks at a high-profile Texas campaign rally in October, the former vice president spoke movingly of women whose lives were endangered or lost because they couldn’t access a timely abortion. It was an issue Harris cared about deeply, which stood out in a campaign that otherwise played it safe. Though Gillibrand gestured at health care, she ultimately brought the abortion conversation back to her personal faith, arguing that she sees the separation of church and state to be her fundamental value. “Churches who want to protect life as a sacred life, they need to be evangelizing. They need to be spreading their message,” she said. “That is the role of the church, to convince people that their view of these issues is the right view. But I do not think it is right for a politician to impose that view.” It was an understandable answer coming from a lawyer. Still, it provided little information about her own beliefs and how her experiences in a faith community have informed them, and those are things a Christian listener would want to know. America is full of faith traditions and congregations that see reproductive justice as an important part of their political theology, and some of the moment’s most robust challenges to the post-Dobbsabortion landscape have been coming from organizations associated with Reform Judaism. Jethani says he’s worried her answer is a sign that Democrats are still struggling with speaking to “sincerely religious” people on a variety of issues. “I totally respect Senator Gillibrand’s view on abortion. I might disagree with it in some parts, but I respect it,” he says. “I think the rhetoric that’s come from the left is that religious voters who are pro-life don’t deserve respect. That is what needs to be combated.

    "title": "“People Feel Like They Are Friends With Us”: How ‘The Bulwark’ Is Thriving in a New Trump Era",
    "article_text": "Last Thursday evening, members ofThe Bulwark’s paid-subscriber Substack community were invited to ask hostsSarah Longwell,Tim Miller,andJonathan V. Lastanything that was on their mind. Several wanted to know how to engage with MAGA supporters in everyday life. “We’re all gonna have different answers,” Last said, kicking things off. “I will give you my answer as somebody who lives his entire life in the real world surrounded by Trump people: In my view, the best thing I can do is to—” “Rub their face in shit,” Miller interrupted. Last, entirely unfazed by Miller’s quip, continued, saying, “Live my life with love and generosity, to sort of show them that people like us don’t have horns.” Longwell chimed in, “You guys, he’s lying to you right now!” Last protested: “I am not lying to you! Hand to God, that’s how I roll in the real world.” Miller and Longwell rolled their eyes, suggesting Last was less charitable in private. “I get a string of text messages from him,” Longwell said. “‘These fucking idiots,’” Miller joked. At its peak, the livestream saw more than 3,000 active viewers, including fellow SubstackerChris Cillizza,with many chatting it up throughout. To Longwell, publisher ofThe Bulwark,this type of unfiltered community conversation is what subscribers are truly paying for. “I think the alchemy between us has been the parasocial relationships,” she tells me. “People feel like they are friends with us. One of us represents them.” The media upstart,launchedin 2019 by “Never Trump” Republicans, is thriving in a secondDonald Trumpterm, with the outlet expecting to reach 100,000 paid subscribers by the end of May and 1 million general subscribers by the end of June. SinceThe Bulwarkpublishes little content behind a paywall, readers are presumably dropping $100 or more annually for a Bulwark+ membership to engage with the site’s prominent voices—and one another. “The thing that people really pay for is to go deeper with the community,” says Longwell, adding that the site could easily “convert much more aggressively if we put more things behind a paywall. But we like to say you can’t save democracy from behind a paywall.” The Bulwarkhas already evolved since its earlier incarnation, which came in the wake ofThe Weekly Standard’s demise; it’s now meeting a new Trump era—and the resistance emerging alongside it—by expanding its capabilities for original reporting and video. The outlet boasts 1.25 million subscribers on YouTube, though, like other outletstrying to grow audienceson the platform, it’s still honing its strategy, wary of how an algorithmic tweak can throw things off course. Still, even while enjoying recent success, Miller says he would trade it all to not have to live through another Trump presidency. “I’d gladly not be hitting this milestone and be covering whatever is happening inKamala Harris’s first 100 days,” he tells me. “But you know, that’s not what the fates had in store for us.” Early in his career as a Republican operative, Miller saw his future self serving as an administration’s press secretary. That’s now “a dream that’s dashed,” he says, due to his willingness to express a point of view throughThe Bulwark.Miller, who previously served as a top aide toJeb Bushduring the 2016 presidential campaign, argues that he has since been “exiled by our party”—something he discusses regularly in content—though he adds that “the audience appreciates that candor.” (Miller has also been willing to acknowledgehis own misstepsin GOP politics that helped give rise to the Trumpist right.) Recently, Miller has been channeling his full energy into the outlet’s YouTube offerings, posting videos on the platform usually six to eight times a day. The channel features a range of content with headlines like “Trump’s Latest Interview Should FREAK YOU OUT” and “MAGA Cultists Are IN FOR IT! Tariff Agony INCOMING!” Many videos include a thumbnail picture showing Miller with a look of astonishment mixed with disgust on his face, and many feature discussions with a range of guests, includingMichaelSteele,Tom Nichols, Derek Thompson,andGeorge Conway. Around the time of heightened discussion around whetherJoe Bidenwould drop out of the 2024 presidential race, Miller started putting more effort into the outlet’s YouTube content, with Longwell agreeing that they needed to not only meet their audience on the medium, but also understand “that the platform demands a certain way of presenting oneself.” It’s “just the language that people on the platform speak,” Longwell adds, also admitting that it was “difficult” at first to translate their written commentary—the presentation of which “looks a lot more likeThe Atlantic”—for the YouTube crowd, but “engaging in that platform’s language has really helped us grow there.” Once they saw steady growth, Miller noticed what the platform’s algorithm was rewarding, leading to the channel’s transition into its current style. “There’s an adjustment to: How are we going to package the content in a way that will do well on YouTube so we can maximize the number of people that see it?” He remains acutely aware of not going “overboard,” saying that “you don’t want to mislead,” but adding that “it’s just the nature of the game.” While initially known primarily for commentary, the outlet has invested in a lean but effective newsroom, one led byPolitico,Daily Beast,andHuffPostveteranSam Stein,who was drawn to whatThe Bulwarkwas building. Stein had a desire to get back to the “upstart mentality,” which he experienced early in his career at places likeHuffPost,where he was thesite’s first reporter. “You have more freedom to be punchier and more direct with your reporting and more provocative with your headline writing,” he says. “That was all really alluring.” By the spring of 2024, Stein took matters into his own hands, reaching out to Miller to inquire ifThe Bulwarkwas hiring. “He’s like, ‘No, we’re not hiring. We have enough reporters.’ And I was like, ‘What about me?’” Stein recalls. Miller put him in touch with Longwell, to whom he pitched his experience at establishment outlets as an asset to help the independent media venture “operate and grow.” Something that also made “the jump attractive is thatThe Bulwarkhad a more multimedia dimension to it,” compared toPolitico,Stein tells me. “The chance to do some video was an added bonus.” (Stein, like Miller, is a familiar face to MSNBC viewers.) However, Stein expressed a bit of concern about “overinvesting” in YouTube, given how the news media has been burned before by social media algorithm changes. “It’s just—we’ve all lived through those episodes where you rely a lot on third-party platforms. We’re highly aware of that,” he says. “I just don’t want to get to a place where something changes and we’re like, Oh no, we overdid it.” With that being said, Stein is ensuring the editorial future of the publication by building out the outlet’s reporting prowess through Substack newsletters. “It was really Sam’s vision to bring on a SEAL team of really talented people who he thought could takeThe Bulwarkfrom a niche commentary space to a mainstream publication that still had a certain perspective,” Longwell tells me. That team has included the likes ofAdrian Carrasquillocovering immigration,Jonathan Cohncovering the administration’s institutional dismantlement, andLauren Egancovering how Democrats are fighting back. The “cherry on top” for Stein was poachingWill SommerfromTheWashington Postto cover the online right. “Over the years, the weird characters that he came to cover with his expertise, they’ve become like power brokers,” Stein adds, specifically referencing Sommer’s coverage ofLaura Loomer.“There was, from the top down, a recognition that we are at a place editorially where we need to supplement our great essay writing, commentary, and analysis with original reporting, and that there’s almost a moral rationalization around hiring people who can dig in” on these specific subjects, Stein says. Still,The Bulwarkwon’t allow recent success to provide a false sense of confidence about the “economics of this industry,” according to Stein, who tells me, “We’ve seen plenty of outlets overextending in times of success.”The Bulwarkis “doing things strategically,” he adds, “and with an eye toward making it sustainable from a business standpoint.” The Bulwarkhas an opportunity to differentiate itself in the marketplace, suggests Longwell, as consumers see major media and tech companies as “kowtowing” to the administration. “Our authenticity has been a big part of the draw,” Longwell says, adding, “There’s a combination of the fracturing of the old media environment, along with Trump coming in, that has just created kind of the perfect storm in which we’ve been able to really thrive and grow.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Colorado’s Jena Griswold Got Over 1,800 Death and Harm Threats Last Year for Defying Trump: “It Pisses Me Off So Much”",
    "article_text": "Colorado’s secretary of state,Jena Griswold,is used to random men on the internet explaining how they want to kill her. “What color rope do you want when we punish you?” one user messaged Griswold, adding, “It’s called treason you chicken shit cunt.” “Start with a 2x4 across the face of the hag, then go from there,” another wrote online. “I hopeDonald Trumpwins and he sends his Department of Justice to investigate you and throw you in prison,” another person wrote. “You stupid fucking bitch. Fuck off. I can’t wait to find you and follow you to your house and expose your address.” Other messages say Griswold ought to be in jail, and they detail the sexual violence they hope she experiences there. Ever since Griswold began topublicly defyDonald Trumpon everything from his unfounded assertion that he won the 2020 election to his attacks on voting access and abortion access, she has becomeaccustomedto the onlinevitriolsent from users who opt for profile photos of the president. She became the youngest elected Secretary of State in the US in 2018 and told me that “the hardest part” of her last six and a half years in office has been the perilous environment. “Women who stood up to Trump after he tried to steal the election—and after he lied through his teeth to the American people in 2020—have been faced with major retribution.” Still, despite, or maybe because of, the persistent threats to her life, Griswold, who is nearing the end of her two terms as secretary of state, is running to stay in the Colorado government as attorney general. She announced her run in early April,tellingThe Colorado Sunthat she can be the “strong, proven leader” who can “stand up” to Trump. TheSunalso reported that Griswold “faced scrutiny last year over how a staffer in her office accidentally posted election system passwords online.” The mistake did not give outsiders access to sensitive election systems, according to statements from Griswold and her team, because multiple passwords are required to gain access. Griswold is probably best known nationally for hertestimonyin front of the Supreme Court in January 2024, when she urged the justices to keep Trump off her state’s 2024 ballot because he is an “ineligible insurrectionist.” In an interview withVanity Fair,which has been edited for length and clarity, Griswold explains why she’s hell-bent on holding the president to account, despite death threats. Vanity Fair:It’s been one month since you announced your run for attorney general. How is it different from when you announced your first run for secretary of state? Jena Griswold:It’s night and day. When I announced for secretary of state, I was 32; I had never run for office before; I announced I was going to run against a Republican incumbent for a seat a Democrat had not won in 60 years. So it’s very much a different situation. On the campaign trail, it’s been—I guess I wouldn’t say great—but very motivating to meet with Coloradans. Nothing that’s happening in this country right now is great. But you see Republicans, Democrats, and unaffiliated people who clearly recognize that Trump is a threat to our freedoms and our democracy, and are willing to put in the work to win in 2026 and protect, really, the soul of what it means to be the United States. What are you hearing? It’s interesting that since 2020, at nearly every event I’ve had, someone will come up to me and say, “I want to let you know I’m a Republican, and I support you.” And they think they’re the only Republican. But really, there’s a lot of fear, and to an extent, I think despair from what is coming from the Trump administration. Trump is breaking the law and undermining the Constitution on a daily basis, and there is so much illegality and bad decision-making happening from Trump that it’s overwhelming to people, and I think it’s really important to recognize that, because the chaos is part of the strategy. Trump is trying to overwhelm the American people. He’s trying to overwhelm Coloradans, but I think that they do not understand that Americans will not accept his unlawful and cruel behavior. Overall, I think folks are really fired up. Colorado, along with other states,suedthe Trump administration in April over an executive order targeting voting access. Can you talk about how that came about? Trump is trying to power grab in an unlawful and unconstitutional way. He issued an executive order that had the potential of disenfranchising Coloradans and Americans all across the country in a way that he does not have the power to do. So we ultimately filed a lawsuit. Anything that we can stop, we’re going to stop. You’ve also been vocally against theSAVE Act, which, among other things, would require all voters to provide proof of US citizenship when first signing up to vote or updating their voter registration. It would disproportionately affect blue-collar folks, the middle class, and women. This is more of what we have seen from Republicans who cower to Trump, who tried to take away Americans’ voices because they’re afraid to actually compete on their ideas. This bill is disastrous to the right to vote. It doesn’t matter if you have disposable income in your bank account; you should be able to cast a ballot. It doesn’t matter if you’re a woman who got married and didn’t change the name on her birth certificate; you should be able to make your voice heard. With Colorado being one of the states that hasfurthered protectionsfor those seeking abortions, I’m wondering, what attacks are you seeing statewide? Well, I think Colorado has shown time and time again, in a bipartisan way, that we trust women and women’s rights to choose. I’m really proud of the work we did last year to pass the initiative to really codify rights into our Constitution. With that said, what happens across the nation affects us. Pregnant women should be able to travel without worrying that they may lose their lives if they go to the wrong state. We have seen talk from MAGA Republicans about attacking birth control, about attacking IVF. In our pregnancy journey, we used IVF. Ultimately, if there is federal legislation, it will affect every state in this country and every American in this country. It’s a grand irony that the MAGA Republicans say they care about families when they were willing to threaten me when I was pregnant. They threatened my little baby. This comes down to basic human rights and human respect. Holding the line in Colorado affects not just Coloradans, it affects the families and the women who flock to our state because they are not being respected in their own state, and it puts their lives at risk. Similar to what happened with the New Yorkproviderwho was charged with allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a Louisiana resident, would you also be protecting doctors who may choose to travel to, say, Texas or Florida, or help provide abortion care in those states, and face threats and potential repercussions from local elected officials? I will do everything in my power to make sure that doctors, medical care providers, women, and families do not face prosecution for making deeply personal choices and practicing modern medicine. I’m curious if running for attorney general was always in the plan, or if you were inspired to do this, perhaps, by your experience following 2020 or just your experience in these past six years in office. When you grow up like me, you don’t have a plan to run for office. That was no grand plan. You know, I grew up in a canyon leading up to one of the most beautiful towns in the United States. I started working the summer after seventh grade. I was never pushed to go to college. After I started working so young, it made me realize that there wasn’t something wrong with my family. There was something wrong for a lot of families. A lot of families were struggling, and ultimately, that’s why I went to college. That’s why I went to law school. I just wanted to make things more fair for blue collar families like mine. Trump lied through his teeth to the American public, saying that he would help blue collar families like mine. That guy cares about one thing, and it’s himself. That’s it. I’m running for AG because I believe it’s one of the best positions in elected office to help people and to protect our rights. If you become attorney general for Colorado, how much of the work do you think will be holding the Trump administration to account? I think a lot of the work. The country is in crisis. We have an administration trying to power grab, trying to stomp on our fundamental freedoms—from the freedom to vote to the freedom of bodily autonomy for women. We have an administration that is unlawfully sending the country into economic chaos. Over the last six and a half years, I’ve been the youngest Secretary of State in the nation; I’m one of the few women to ever win statewide executive office; I would guess that I am the first statewide elected official in Colorado to have a baby while in executive office—and I was pregnant post-Dobbs.Even as a statewide elected official, I had to ask myself, while pregnant, am I willing to go to a state like Texas or a state that has rolled back reproductive freedoms? If something happens to my pregnancy, does that mean my life, because I’m traveling? Is it just Trump? The answer to that is absolutely not. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress bend to the will of billionaires and give anunelected billionairethe ability to gut protections of the federal government. I know what it means to struggle. I’m going to be standing for the middle class, taking on corporate polluters, defending families, and pushing for common sense gun reform. We also have an issue in the state of Colorado that if a woman is raped, ittakesup to a year and a half to process the rape kit. That’s absolutely unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable. So there’s so much work that needs to be done. I would encourage everybody to think about, what does it take to meet this moment? And honestly, the answer is complex, but I think it comes down to courage and bravery to be able to stand up to protect our freedoms against a machine that is looking to grab. And when you stand up to them, it will come with retribution. Speaking of retribution, I wanted to ask you about the death threats that you’ve received. I was sent some of them, and one that stood out to me was a message asking you what color of rope you would prefer to be punished with. Do those threats scare you? Absolutely. I think any person, when they are repeatedly told how someone is going to come kill them, would be scared. But I think again, the question isn’t “Is there fear?” The question is, “Is there courage?” I’ll tell you, the hardest part of the last six and a half years has been the threat environment. Women who stood up to Trump after he tried to steal the election—and after he lied through his teeth to the American people in 2020—have been faced with major retribution. You know, there’s so much that I could say about what it means to be a woman in statewide office right now. Like, even in some of the most personal moments of my life, including when I was in the hospital delivering our baby, someone was arrested for threatening my life. I think at the end of the day, it’s important to understand that these threats are intentional. The goal is to discourage women like me from holding office or giving a name to what is happening in this country. I will never be silenced from standing up for our fundamental rights in our democracy. I will never be deterred from protecting our Constitution and our nation. But with that said, this threat environment is so unacceptable. This is the moment where we need brave people to lean in, but we also need states to protect women elected officials so that we can do our jobs. When I started to get threats, people would ask me how I was dealing with stress, and it’s like, well, I’m dealing with stress fine, but someone just told me seven times they’re going to come hang me from a tree and I really hope someone would take this seriously. So many of these threats are using such specific gendered language—or bringing up your children. Do you still read them? Do you suggest that other people read them? How do you even think about consuming that amount of vitriol? Again, this has been the hardest part of my term. I started to receive threats in the summer of 2021 whenLauren BoebertandTed Cruzlied and said that I had stopped bipartisan audits of elections. They were lying, and I started to get people sending me messages. “I’m going to hang you from a tree. Tell me how long you want the rope to be.” There was no one looking at the threats. In 2021, there was no way to gather the threats, and so I literally would have to go through social media and screenshot it all and give it to the State Patrol. Trailblazing comes in so many shapes and forms, and many trailblazing opportunities you do not even want to have. One of the things that I was able to set up is a law enforcement apparatus so that I myself do not have to go through all of these threats. And I hope that makes the path easier for other women who run for office. With that said, I still do see a lot of the threats. They’re coming to me in all different ways—voicemails, text messages to my personal phone, DMs. So I think there’s a balance. But ultimately, if there is a real, serious threat, I need to know about it. This is a tool of the MAGA movement. Trump tweeted out—or “untruthed” or whatever—a video about me during the lawsuit to disqualify him from president. He posted the biography ofShenna Bellows,the Secretary of State in Maine. He didn’t even have to say anything, and she wasSWAT-ed. It is a tremendous toll on me and my family. But I have security in place, and I am not going to allow someone like Trump to ever intimidate me to stop. And it’s actually the opposite. It pisses me off so much that they would use threats of violence to try to go uncontested in their unconstitutional and unlawful behavior, that it makes me want to work even harder.

    "title": "The Golden Globes Will Have a Best-Podcast Category in 2026",
    "article_text": "And the Golden Globe for best podcast goes too…. Yes, you heard that right. The Golden Globes will introduce a best-podcast category starting with the 83rd annual ceremony in 2026. Information regarding the specific criteria that will be used to determine what the best podcast is scant as of now. The organizationannouncedthat “the top 25 podcasts” each year will be up for consideration, and a total of six will be chosen as nominees. Eligibility requirements regarding how, exactly, those top 25 podcasts will be determined will reportedly be announced in the coming weeks. “As the world of entertainment continues to evolve, we are excited to recognize new forms of storytelling,” said Golden Globes presidentHelen Hoehnein the press release. “Podcasts have emerged as a profound medium for sharing narratives and building communities across global borders and generations. By celebrating achievements in both audio and visual podcasts, we aim to honor our heritage categories while making room for new voices and formats to be heard.” The Golden Globes will become the first major awards body to recognize the burgeoning audio medium, even beating the Grammys to the punch. (That organization hasan awardfor best audio book, narration and storytelling recording, but no award for best podcast.) Podcasters have plenty of other ways to receive recognition via digital-forward awards shows like the Webby Awards and the Shorty Awards, as well as podcast-specific awards like the iHeartPodcast Awards and the Ambies. After facinga string of scandals in the early 2020s, the Golden Globes were acquired by Dick Clark Productions in June of 2023. Best podcast marks the third new category for the revamped Globes. In 2024, the awards bodyintroducedthe categories for best stand-up comedian on television and cinematic and box office achievement, which went toRicky Gervais: ArmageddonandBarbiethat year, respectively. They went toAli Wong: Single LadyandWickedin 2025. So, who will win the inaugural Golden Globe for best podcast? Will it beJoe Rogan?Alex Cooper?Hawk Tuah? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s a safe bet thatreturning hostNikki Glaserwill have something hilarious to say about the whole thing when the 83rd Golden Globes air on January 11, 2026.

    "title": "Norah Jones Talks About Her 9 Albums, 2 Kids, and 11 Billion Streams",
    "article_text": "“That was a crazy phenomenon, a moment in time,” saysNorah Jonesabout her massive success andGrammysweep—five wins, including best new artist and record of the year—for her2002 debut album,Come Away With Me.“By the fifth time I got up there, I didn’t have anyone left to thank. I don’t think anyone wanted me up there—everyone wasexpectingBruce Springsteento win. It doesn’t matter now, and I’m proud of it, but awards are weird.” What of the fact that her first single, “Don’t Know Why,” is considered one of the most beloved songs of the 21st century? “It’s really nice,” she says, “but who would ever say that about their own work? I try to distance myself from that kind of thinking. I do feel proud that my new album [Visions] won a Grammy this year.” Jones has the kind of longevity that doesn’t come around often for a musician who defies categorization. With her unique, jazzy, and enduring voice, she’s recordedninesolo albums and sold 53 million of them. Her songs have been streamed worldwide 11 billion times, according to record label Blue Note. She continues to perform live and tour (she has shows in South America at the end of May, with dates in Europe and Japan in the summer and fall), and she hascollaboratedwith many of the greats. In the recording studio at her New York City home, where she lives with her husband, musicianPete Remm,and their two young children, Jones speaks about her Texas roots, her relationship with her father—the late, great Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar—motherhood, and herpodcast,Norah Jones Is Playing Along. Vanity Fair:Your career is special: You survived a huge—some would say “overnight”—success; you never went crazy, and you’re still making music. Are you enjoying it? Norah Jones:I do feel proud that people still want to come out and hear me play, and I’ve managed to keep it fresh for myself and try new things without trying to do new things. After that first record I felt like, What the hell am I going to do now? How can I top that? I realized that I couldn’t, so after the first or second album, I started playing in a bar with my friends for tips. I wore a hat, nobody knew who I was, I was singing country songs, and when people were drinking a lot and playing pool, they didn’t pay that much attention. When you’re on a roller coaster sometimes you just want to get off. I didn’t want to maintain that level of success. It kind of took the joy out of music for me. Sometimes, it just wasn’t fun anymore, [but] I realized how fun it was, so I decided to keep it fun. Before you moved to New York, when you were 20, to be a jazz musician, you grew up in Texas with your mother, but were estranged from your father, Ravi Shankar. Were you aware of his music, or that George Harrison had toured with him and brought him to the attention of American rock fans? Growing up I would visit him maybe once a year until I was nine. I wasn’t really aware of his music until I was 10 or 11, but I didn’t see him again until I was 18. When I saw him, I would see him maybe in a hotel somewhere, and when I was very little, I went to India, maybe twice. I would see his instruments lying around, but I really didn’t give it much thought until I saw George Harrison make a speech about him at the Billboard Music Awards. When I was 18, I went to see my dad and we got back in touch, and I had a nice relationship with him. But it was very complicated, and then it became a million times more complicated when I became well-known. People started writing about my relationship with my dad and none of it was accurate. No matter what I said, one side of my family would be bummed. But when I reunited with my dad, I connected with my Indian heritage, even though I always felt like a bit of an imposter. I’m not a real Indian, I’m not a real musician, I’m not a pop musician—so how did I end up there? I’m not a folk or country or strictly a jazz musician. I feel like I’m on the periphery—with a lot of different influences. I guess that’s a plus. You’re not in any genre. You’ve recorded jazz, country, soul, standards, and have collaborated with so many great, and diverse, musicians—too many to mention—but among them: Willie Nelson, Mavis Staples, Q-Tip, Dolly Parton, Keith Richards, Jeff Tweedy, and Ray Charles. What was it like recording “Here We Go Again” with Ray Charles? Were you with him in the studio? We were, and Billy Preston was in there too. We did three takes, live, and I brought my mom—who had seen him play a high school gymnasium in the 1960s, and she flipped out. My musical influences come from my mother, who had great taste.Dolly Partonalso was just great; she took me to dinner.Mavis Staplesis incredible—we’ve toured a lot together in the past few years. Is there anyone you haven’t collaborated with that you would like to? This is why I’m really enjoying my podcast,Playing Along:because it lets me do that in a different way. I’m in a room with someone, and we just talk and play songs together. It’s been all over the map—Jeff Tweedy, Dave Grohl, Logic, Lucinda Williams.We’ve already done [33 episodes]. Dolly [Parton] would be the dream guest, but she’s so busy being Dolly. What was it like growing up in Texas? There’s a rich history of country and Western music there, but jazz? Soul? I never saw a bad side of Texas. There was a large Mexican community where I grew up, and everybody thought I was Mexican. I almost let people down when I didn’t speak Spanish. I would say I’m half Indian, but I didn’t grow up around Indian culture at all. There is a rich, diverse musical community; we had a Black history program in the performing arts high school that I went to in Dallas, and the Black musicians were my heroes. They all grew up playing in church. They had been playing all their lives, and they were on another plane. As a child, I sang in church, but we sang hymns. After I stopped taking piano lessons at 12, I was focused on becoming a jazz musician; I saw a big band concert and started taking saxophone lessons and listening to Sarah Vaughan, Bill Evans, and Billie Holiday. Were you aware that you sounded like Billie Holiday? It’s the first thing I thought when I first heard “Come Away With Me.” I tried really hard to sound like Billie Holiday in high school, and I even played her in a program—I sang “Strange Fruit.” But I learned later on that I didn’t want to sound like anybody else. And a friend of mine said, “I really hear the Texas in you,” and I was like, “Oh, that’s cool.” I don’t think of jazz singers as sounding very Texas, so that was kind of my little thing. It was the first moment that I realized I can sing these old songs and still sound like myself, so maybe I’ll lean into that rather than try to sound like Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holiday or my favorite singers. In 2004, before the Bush election, you wrote a song called “My Dear Country,” which has the line “maybe he’s not deranged.” It certainly is applicable today. It definitely could apply now. It’s getting really crazy. There’s a lot of weird shit that’s going on that’s not even talked about. But I think people on the other side could relate to that song too. When you first started in the music business, you worked closely with two men, producer Arif Mardin—who had worked with Aretha Franklin—and the then head of Blue Note, Bruce Lundvall, who had worked with so many jazz greats. Did you find yourself in any uncomfortable situations common to so many young female musicians? I was super lucky. I avoided all of that. I was so looked out for, I didn’t even realize it. The whole team at Blue Note was like family and I felt so comfortable with them. Both Arif and Bruce were gentlemen, and they were my friends. I never thought I would have friends who were in their 70s when I was in my 20s. I would have a three-martini lunch with Bruce, and he was amazing; he had so many great stories. And Arif was so proper; he would work in the studio until 5 p.m. and then go home to his lovely wife. I drank a lot in my 20s, but not in the studio—except once when we were recording my second album. Arif and I went to [a recording studio in] Woodstock, and we stayed up for three nights drinking and recording. You have two young children and a busy career. How do you combine your work with family life? Every working mother has to juggle. All of my friends who have kids juggle, and they’re not even musicians. Even people who have no jobs who have kids have to juggle taking care of their kids—because kids are a lot. But you goon the road, you tour. Well, my husband is a really great dad. He’s a brilliant musician, but he doesn’t want to travel anymore. I’ve had the luxury of choosing my schedule. I can have a tour bus and I do pretty well, and sometimes I take the kids on the road and it’s fun. I tailor my life around the kids, so I tour a little longer in the summer. I do more one-offs, or I do two weeks somewhere, but I can’t be away from them that long. You’re always trying to find a balance, then next year you try something different. My favorite thing now is to do a one-off festival on a weekend and bring one kid. I brought my daughter to Jazz Fest in New Orleans and she had the time of her life. Do you remember doing theall-womenVanity Fairmusic issue cover in 2002? We had to wait for Gwen Stefani to come from London after her Concorde flight took a dive and she had to take another flight. We were in the Meatpacking District for hours in the sweltering heat. I was thrilled to be there. That was the pinnacle of all that success. Everyone was so nice—I lovedDebbie Harry,andJennifer Lopezwas darling. The pressure on women in entertainment to deal with image, clothes, and glam is intense. How involved do you get with that? I get stressed out when I have to get dressed up for something and I always turn my face to the right angle—God forbid they take the wrong side. You have a wrong side? Heck yeah, I do, and the sooner you know that when they’re taking pictures, the better. I think it’s fun doing glam for the right purpose, but I do my own hair and makeup for shows, because I don’t have the patience to sit there. How do you feel when your voice is described as “sultry,” which I think means “sexy”? I’m fine with that. I’ll take it.

    "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene For Senate? It Sounds So Awful, Even Republicans Are Freaking Out",
    "article_text": "Three years ago, Republicans saw an opportunity. They anticipated a “red wave” and thought they could knock down Democratic rising starRaphael Warnockin purple Georgia. Then,Donald Trumpgot involved, encouraging football legendHerschel Walkerto run for the Senate seat. Republicans hadreservations, though—and for good reason, it turned out. Walker’s candidacy was a scandal-ridden disaster;Warnock won out, giving Democrats a two-seat Senate majority and amisplaced sense of confidence. Things have changed since then, of course. Trump surged back into power, putting democracy on its heels and making a mockery of Democrats’ previous optimism. And Republicans, enjoying a governing trifecta in Washington, have spent the past six months dancing on various third rails of American politics. But, in Georgia, a state seen as key to their effort to expand their upper chamber majority, some in the GOP are worried they could find themselves reliving their Walker nightmare. They’d been hoping thatBrian Kemp, Georgia’s governor, would mount a challenge to Democratic SenatorJon Ossoff. He’s been a popular leader in the state—aTrump supporterwho has defied Trump enough to earn himself a derogatory nickname by the president (“Little Brian Kemp”) and some credibility with more moderate figures. But Kempdeclineda Senate run, opening the Republican field and, potentially, the door to aMarjorie Taylor Greenebid. Indeed, the MAGA firebrand has said she isweighing a Senate campaign, which could excite the most fervent parts of Trump’s base but also comes with the vulnerabilities that weighed down Walker. “She can win a primary,” Georgia GOP strategistBrian RobinsontoldNBC News. “She cannot win a general [election] in Georgia.” Greene has been a defining figure of this political moment: a hardcore Trump loyalist with a penchant for conspiracy theories and outrageous antics. But she is in Congress not because her act has broad appeal, but because she hails from a deep red district where having an R next to your name is probably enough to get you elected. Winning statewide would be different than winning in the 14th district,the most conservative in the state. “It’s very difficult to apply a formula for a very gerrymandered, very conservative congressional district into a statewide election with as much diversity as Georgia has,” as Republican SenatorKevin Cramerof South DakotatoldThe Hill. “If I was to put my political science hat on and look at all the criteria, she wouldn’t be high on my list of recruits.” Democrats—and whatever passes for “establishment Republicans” these days—would be wise not to discount Greene or the threat she poses. Walker was such a trainwreck that his campaign staff didn’ttrust him, but he lost by fewer than three points in a run-off. Anyone who thinks Greene—running as a sitting member of Congress in a political moment like this—couldn’t win does so at their own peril. Georgia may be purple, with two Democratic senators. But it’s also a state thatTrump won in 2024despite facing racketeering charges over his effort to overturn its 2020 results. Then again, Trump’s acolytes have never quite been able to defy the political laws of gravity the way he has. Voters have fallen for the bully. But his toadies?Not so much. And if recent history were to repeat itself for Republicans in Georgia, they’d have only themselves to blame.

    "title": "The 42 Best Romantic Comedies of All Time",
    "article_text": "Reports of the death of the romantic comedy have been greatly exaggerated. Sure, the always endangered genre has lost some of its luster since its heyday in the 1990s. But even now, audiences are still hungry for witty banter, unexpected meet-cutes, and a happy ending. Streaming platforms like Netflix and Max have releasedscores of rom-coms;Anyone But Youmade bank at the box office in 2023;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boyrecently made our critic’s list of thebest movies of 2025 so far. But what are the best romantic comedies of all time—the films that rank as the paragon of the genre? A group ofVanity Fair’swriters and editors compiled a list of their own top 10 rom-coms. Then—after some number-crunching and establishing what met our unimpeachable rom-com standards (extra points for a running-through-the-airport or musical serenade scene)—we landed on 42 films that ultimately made the list. It’s comprised of undeniable classics likeNotting Hilland10 Things I Hate About You,underrated gems likeNever Been Kissedand 2025’sThe Wedding Banquet, and, yes, even a few debatable picks. (Wait… IsAnoraa romantic comedy?) While each entry on the list may not be exactly your cup of tea, they all fit the American Film Institute’sbroad definitionof what it takes to be a romantic comedy. Rom-coms are, by definition, “a genre in which the development of a romance leads to comic situations.” So grab your popcorn and take a gander atVanity Fair’s42 favorite romantic comedies of all time. The ’90s hadMy Date With the President’s Daughter, and the 2020s hasMy Date With the President’s Son. Based on the 2019 novel of the same name byCasey McQuiston,Red, White, and Royal Bluefollows the unlikely romance between Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine). The fact that they’re both guys isn’t the only thing that makes their courtship difficult: Alex is the aforementioned president’s son, and Henry happens to be third in line for the British throne. Their international affair may quite literally affect international affairs. Directed by Tony winnerMatthew López,Red, White and Royal Blueis both a queer romance and a White House romp. Galitzine and Perez are charming as the two lovebirds, discovering their sexuality on a very public stage. The film also features a daffy performance fromUma Thurmanas a very Southern president of the United States. —Chris Murphy Julia Robertswasn’t the only redheaded rom-com actress of the ’90s. There was alsoNatasha Lyonne,delivering a wonderful performance in the campy and fun lesbian rom-comBut I’m a Cheerleader. In the film byJamie Babbit,Lyonne stars as Megan, a closeted cheerleader sent to conversion-therapy camp by her parents. While this may not sound like the best setting for a romantic comedy, she meets a host of other closeted teens there—including the edgy and cool Graham (Clea DuVall), who captures her heart.But I’m A Cheerleaderalso boasts a hilarious performance by none other thanRuPaul,playing a counselor at the conversion-therapy camp who may be struggling with many of the same issues his campers are. For anyone looking for truly comic yet surprisingly sincere exploration of queerness with a happy ending,But I’m a Cheerleaderis the girl for you. —Chris Murphy Here’s a little ditty aboutJack (Nicholson)andDiane (Keaton),the silver-haired leads ofNancy Meyers’sbest romantic comedy. Though some industry insiders may have been wary of a film about people in their 50s and 60s falling in love, audiences were ready for a mature romance—one that involved a hilarious sex scene in which Keaton’s character takes Nicholson’s blood pressure to make sure he doesn’t have a heart attack during the act. The film grossed over $266 million worldwide and nabbed Keaton an Oscar nomination. It also gave us a heartsick Nicholson, a lady killer on-screen and off, crying over a girl for a change.—Anna Lisa Raya Sometimes the greatest love of all is actually your best friend. InSweethearts, a Max romantic comedy fromJordan Weiss,college BFFs Ben (Nico Hiraga) and Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) make a pact to break up with their respective partners while they’re both home for Thanksgiving break. Of course, that’s easier said than done.Sweetheartsis a sweet look at love and friendship and the many ways they intertwine. It also boasts a standout performance from comedian and podcasterCaleb Hearon,who steal scenes as Palmer, Ben and Jamie’s gay best friend. —Chris Murphy Shakespeare really knew how to write a romantic comedy, didn’t he? Loosely based on the Shakespearean comedyMuch Ado About Nothing,Anyone But YoustarsSydney SweeneyandGlen Powellas Bea and Ben, a modern-day Beatrice and Benedick. Despite having an amazing first date, Bea and Ben’s initial attraction quickly turns sour. When they unexpectedly find themselves at a destination wedding in Australia, the pair pretend to be the perfect couple for contrived reasons—but in the process, they find out that there’s a fine line between love and hate The film was a sleeper hit, earning $220 million worldwide. It might have helped that the world was also quite interested in Sweeney and Powell’s off-screen relationship, withrumors of romancecircling the rising stars. Based onAnyone But You, it’s undeniable that the pair has chemistry. —Chris Murphy Romantic comedies have traditionally been tough territory for queer characters, who tend to fall into simplistic, stereotypical best-friend roles when they’re allowed to join the party at all. (We can never forgive theSex and the Citymovies for what they did to Stanford and Anthony.) EnterKissing Jessica Stein,which even 16 years later remains one of the few mainstream, widely distributed romantic comedies to focus on same-sex attraction—and between queer women, no less, who are even tougher to find in these sorts of movies than queer men. Even discounting its milestone elements, the film does an admirable job of balancing rom-com clichés (the overbearing Jewish mother! The heroine with a job in New York media!) with more offbeat flourishes, making it anAnnie Halldescendent tailor-made for a new millennium.—Hillary Busis If nothing else, the rom-com genre has given us the scene in which an ever-anxiousAlbert Brookswatchesa near-angelicMeryl Streepslurp down a never-ending noodle. The pair’s chemistry as Daniel and Julia is on full display inDefending Your Life, a witty exploration of the afterlife written and directed by Brooks. In the film, the pair’s post-death fates are decided in Judgment City, where their actions (or inactions) on Earth are litigated. Unsurprisingly, meeting the love of your life in the place where you’re forced to defend your own is a bit of a drag. If Daniel can’t properly justify his way of living, he’ll be forced to do it all over again, leaving Julia behind. And if you thought running through the airport was a wildly romantic gesture, try chasing after a tram headed to the next plane of human existence.—Savannah Walsh Jane Austen’sPride and Prejudiceis the narrative basis for this queer romantic comedy, written by and starringJoel Kim Booster. Set in the LGBTQ+ destination of Fire Island, Booster plays Noah, a proudly single nurse whose outlook on dating is rocked by the film’s Mr. Darcy, Will (Conrad Ricamora). Faced with a similar transformation is Howie (Bowen Yang), whose burgeoning courtship with Charlie (James Scully), gets mixed reviews from his friends, including Keegan (Tomás Matos), Luke (Matt Rogers), and Max (Torian Miller). “We made something really, really special and unique and gay,” BoostertoldVanity Fairof his celebratory rom-com. “The fact that we did that feels miraculous, considering what we were up against.” Added Yang, “A Jane Austen narrative meeting an Asian American narrative meeting a queer narrative: Those three helices come together in a way that’s greater than the sum of their parts. And to say that something is greater than a Jane Austen narrative is insane—unhinged of me—to do. But I said it.” Even wilder: the movie manages to prove just that. —Savannah Walsh Here comes the bride, and a newWedding Banquet.Fire IslandfilmmakerAndrew Ahnre-teamed withSaturday Night Live’sBowen Yangto remakeAng Lee’sfabulous 1993 wedding comedy, which centered on a closeted Taiwanese man in a long-term relationship who agrees to an arranged marriage with a woman in order to satisfy his traditional parents. In Ahn’s remake,The Wedding Banquetnow follows two queer couples in Seattle: Yang’s Chris and Min (Hang Gi-chan), and Angela and Lee, played byKelly Marie Tranand Oscar nomineeLily Gladstone.  When the Korean Min’s student visa is about to expire, Min and Lee hatch a plan: Min should marry Angela for a green card, and in exchange, Chris and Min will pay for Lee’s fertility treatments. What could possibly go wrong? Ahn’sWedding Banquetremake was positively received, proving that adding a modern touch to the best romantic comedies is always a winning formula.—Chris Murphy In 2011,Adelerevealedthat the soaring bridge of her song “One and Only” was inspired by thisDrew Barrymoreclassic. “You know at the end, when she describes being kissed as the whole world slows down and goes in slow motion, everything else goes blurry…I kind of see it like that,” the Grammy winner explained. “Whenever I hear the bridge…it’s quite epic. I mean, I don’t thinkNever Been Kissedis a particularly epic movie…” Apologies to Adele, but on this point we’ll politely disagree. Barrymore plays Josie Geller, a junior copywriter at the Chicago Sun-Times who poses as a student at her former high school for an ill-conceived undercover piece. In between trying pot brownies and getting a sex-ed lesson from her co-worker (played by the scene-stealingMolly Shannon), Josie (hold the Grossie) falls for her dreamboat English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan). Although the specifics surroundingthatromance are slightly problematic, the slapstick sweetness of the movie’s premise endures. So much so that Barrymore oftenreprises the rolefor segments on her similarly spirited daytime talk show. —Savannah Walsh Renée Zellweger’shapless yet winning British heroine returned to the silver screen once again inBridget Jones Diary: Mad About the Boy. The fourth film in the beloved franchise finds Jones a single mom in London, raising two children and still grievingthe loss of her husband, Mark Darcy(Colin Firth)—who has been killed during a humanitarian mission in Sudan.Michael Morris’smovie really takes off when Bridget falls head over heels (sometimes literally) for a younger man: Roxster, played byWhite LotusbreakoutLeo Woodall.She also keeps having chance encounters with her children’s science teacher, Mr. Walliker, portrayed byChiwetel Ejiofor.As Bridget navigates the pitfalls (and pratfalls) of middle-aged romance, we catch up with some of our favorite friends fromBridget Jonesfilms of yore, including Dr. Rawlings (Emma Thompson) and Daniel Cleaver—now Uncle Daniel, but still played with devilish charm byHugh Grant.Zellweger’s performance is as endearing as ever; watching this movie, you can’t help but root for Bridget Jones to gether groove back.–Chris Murphy WhenCrazy Rich Asiansopened to blockbuster numbersin the summer of 2018, the world was ready for a different kind of romantic comedy. It had been decades since 1993’sThe Joy Luck Club—the last major American studio release to feature a predominantly Asian and Asian-American cast—and the rom-com genre was experiencing a dry spell. Then along cameJon M. Chu’s sparkling adaptation ofKevin Kwan’sbestselling novel, centered on the love story between Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding)—and how their romance is tested by the latter’s exorbitantly wealthy, slightly unhinged family. Every frame bursts with opulence, fromMichelle Yeoh’s steely performance as Nick’s elegant mother Eleanor or one of themost lavish wedding scenesever committed to film. Sequels arereportedlyin the works—and they couldn’t come soon enough. —Savannah Walsh You don’t getCluelesswithoutEmma. Jane Austen’s seminal novel brings us into the world of Emma Woodhouse, a girl who’s “handsome, clever, and rich”—and can’t help but matchmake and meddle in the lives of her friends and neighbors. In 2020,Anya Taylor Joyplayed the titular role in a new film adaptation that allowed the star ofThe Witchto show a whole new side of herself as the daffy, well-intentioned but sometimes vain teen heroine. She would soon go on to star inThe Queen’s Gambitand cement herself as an A-list talent. InEmma, she’s matched by a wonderful ensemble of actors includingJohnny Flynn, Josh O’Connor,Mia Goth,andBill Nighyas her overly cautious father, Mr. Woodhouse. If you’ve binged all ofBridgertonand are in need of some more Regency-era England,Emmais waiting for you.—Chris Murphy One of the most refreshing rom-coms in recent years was inspired by the real-life courtship between starKumail Nanjianiand his wife,Emily V. Gordon, with whom he wrote the film’s screenplay. In the movie, their burgeoning relationship is stopped dead in its tracks when Emily (played onscreen byZoe Kazan) experiences a major medical crisis and falls into a coma. While she’s sleeping, Kumail attempts to bond with his future in-laws (a perfectly-matchedHolly HunterandRay Romano) and contend with the cultural obstacles he faces as a Muslim, Pakistani man who wants to forego his family’s plans for an arranged marriage. “It sounds so serious on paper: A Pakistani guy whose parents want him to have an arranged marriage has his white girlfriend go into a coma,” NanjianitoldEntertainment Weeklyupon the project’s release. “But itisa comedy!” Produced byJudd Apatowand directed byMichael Showalter, the tonally trick film earned Nanjiani and Gordon a best original screenplay Oscar nomination and helped reinvigorate the genre. —Savannah Walsh One of the most unconventional yet life-affirming comedies ever made comes from auteur Hal Ashby.Bud Cortstars as Harold, a troubled youth whose fascination with death colors his entire worldview. That is, until Ruth Gordon’s Maude—a lively septanagerian who forces her younger counterpart to acknowledge life’s beauty—enters the picture. Like its titular characters, the movie is both sweet and sour in its depiction of the pair’s bizarre friendship. While the couple spends most of the film having philosophical chats and walking through fields of flowers, their dark ending looms. But leave it to Ashby to make even a character’s inevitable death feel oddly uplifting. —Savannah Walsh Who hasn’t dreamed of meeting a pop star at a music festival, then having them fall head-over-heels for you? That’s exactly what happens toAnne HathawayinThe Idea of You.Based on the book of the same name, Hathaway stars as Solène, a divorced art gallerist living in Los Angeles. When she takes her teen daughter to Coachella, she stumbles into the wrong trailer and has a meet-cute with Hayes Campbell—a member of the extremely popular boy band August Moon, played byNicholas Galitzine. Despite a bit of an age gap, sparks fly between Solène and Hayes, and a May-December romance begins. Directed byMichael Showalter,The Idea of Youis fun and flirty, and showcases Hathaway at her best—charming, wry, and emotionally available. It also helps that the August Moon songs written bySavan Kotechaare legitimately catchy, and Galitzine pulls off hisHarry Styles—esque pop star character with aplomb.The Idea Of Youis the perfect rom-com for anyone with a song in their heart. —Chris Murphy In retrospect, it’s sort of a miracle that anything about this (mostly) live-action spin on the Disney princess works. So much of it is an uphill battle—long segments are told via old-school animation; there are several splashy musical numbers (some of which feature singing vermin); and the ending hinges on a truly frightening sequence involvingSusan Sarandondressed as an evil hag, then disguised as a CGI dragon. Yet the biggest victory may be in selling the romance betweenAmy Adams’ Gisele (who, again, is a cartoon princess brought to life) andPatrick Dempsey’s straight-and-narrow divorce lawyer Robert. What could’ve been mawkish is grounded by the pair’s crackling chemistry and rounded out with a downright award-worthy performance byJames Marsdenas the Prince Charming who was never destined to get the girl.  —Savannah Walsh IsThe Apartmenteven really a romantic comedy? Re-watching it recently, I was struck by how tragic it is: a comedy that goes out of its way to remind you of the pitfalls of falling in love, especially with married men, or someone who’s in love with a married man. It’s also a comedy in which the ostensible “nice guy” lets himself be drenched in the muck of all the bad men working above him, a hardly willing enabler of their secret sex lives. I guess the term we use nowadays for a guy like C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is “cuck,” and it’s true that one of the genius moves Billy Wilder makes in this movie is to make it seem so unlikely, from the start, that a pushover nebbish like Baxter and the heartbroken, helplessly charismatic Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), an elevator girl in Baxter’s building, will even wind up together. We’re not even sure it’s a question worth asking—it’s beautifully implausible. One of the brilliant things aboutThe Apartment—especially now, with our new sensitivity to workplace harassment and the bad behavior of men in power—is that even from the vantage of 1960, the movie knew just how transactional sex and romance could be, sometimes willingly and often not. It’s one of the great workplace comedies—a movie worth watching again with fresh eyes.—K. Austin Collins Only in the rom-com to end all rom-coms would you have leads named Andie Anderson and Benjamin Barry. From the jump,How to Lose a Guy in 10 Daysis precisely as frothy as it sounds—a film that centers on a Cool Girl, before the term came into vogue, whose chemistry with a mildly chauvinistic man’s man is undeniable even though their romance is doomed from the start. She’s a writer at a women’s magazine trying to carve out a space where she can write about subjects ofsubstance—which, for the moment, requires her to ensnare a man and torture him to the point of breaking up. He, meanwhile, is simply trying to prove he can make any woman fall in love with him.Kate HudsonandMatthew McConaugheysold their characters with wit and panache—throwing themselves into the roles completely, but delivering certain lines with just a whiff of irony. By the end, Andie has dragged “Benny Boo-Boo . . . Boo-Boo-Boo” to aCéline Dionconcert, and he’s dragged—I mean,brought—her to Staten Island to meet his family after just a few days of dating. Yet as they kiss and make up on the bridge after a truly humiliating karaoke-fight in front of everyone they know, it’s basically impossible to do anything but cheer.—Laura Bradley Who doesn’t love a movie that opens with characters shouting “fuck fuck fuck” as they scramble wildly to make it to a friend’s wedding? Everything aboutRichard Curtis’sFour Weddings and a Funeralseemed determined to unravel the traditional rom-com, even as it wore its sentimentality on its sleeve. Instead of one marriage, there are a whole slew of them. A fairly central character is killed off (precipitating the funeral of the title). And the movie’s object of desire, an American woman played byAndie MacDowell,actually marries another man at one point. The ensemble cast is charmingly quirky (particularly the late Charlotte Coleman), butFour Weddingsis best known for launchingHugh Granton his long career as an awkward, floppy-haired, stuttering romantic hero who somehow overcomes his deeply British reserve to confess his true feelings. It’s a messy romp that opened up territory for decades of rom-coms to come.—Joy Press Nearly two decades beforeJohn Patrick Shanleyearned the Pulitzer Prize and Tony for penningDoubt,the revered writer won an Academy Award forMoonstruck—one of the few romantic comedies so superb that even Hollywood’s genre-snob voters fell victim to its charm. (In addition to Shanley’s win,CherandOlympia Dukakisalso won Oscars for their roles as mother and daughter.) Directed byNorman Jewison,Moonstruckfeatures Cher as an Italian-American widow living with her parents in Brooklyn, when she falls for her fiancé’s younger brother, played byNicolas Cage.Though Cherhas saidthat she has a narrow range as an actress, and claimed that she only plays variations of her real-life persona, her performance as Loretta Castorini attests that her “narrow range” is anything but.—Julie Miller Though his previous contributions to pop culture went criminally under-appreciated—it would take years forFreaks and GeeksandUndeclaredto get their deserved due—Judd Apatow’s2005 feature directorial debut,The 40-Year-Old Virgin,was a career turning point. The uproarious comedy—co-written by Apatow and starSteve Carell,though also heavily improvised—proved Apatow’s unique ability to interweave original, laugh-out-loud humor with surprising sweetness. In addition to cementing Carell as a Hollywood star, the ensemble blazed a new comedy sub-genre (men-children—and later, via HBO’sGirls,women-children—clumsily coming to terms with adulthood) and launched Apatow as something of a Hollywood tastemaker, whose mere association with a project signaled that it would be funnier than most, and full of performers who should be on audience’s radars.—Julie Miller In Hollywood, leading men are often much older than their female love interests, but it’s still a rarity to see that reversal for women on screen. Enter Stella and her need to reclaim that titular groove.Angela Bassettstars as a woman in search of her next great adventure, coerced into a tropical getaway by her best friend Delilah (a perfectly castWhoopi Goldberg), and swept off her feet byTaye Diggs, a younger island local who urges her to set fear about their (retrospectively pretty tame) age gap aside. What follows is a fun, sexy, proto-Eat Pray Love-style romp that still manages to pack an emotional punch. In honor of Bassett’s frontrunner status at the 2023 Oscars, the time for a rewatch (or introduction) is now. —Savannah Walsh We know what you’re thinking… IsAnorareally a romantic comedy? But hear us out.Sean Baker’s2025 Oscarbest-picture winner—starringsurprise best-actress winnerMikey Madisonas a sex worker from Brighton Beach who falls for Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the immature son of a Russian oligarch, then embarks on a whirlwind romance—certainly isn’t a traditional exemplar of this genre. While there are plenty of laughs to be had, Ani and Vanya’s dream of a relationship soon becomes a nightmare. But the trick ofAnorais that the real romance isn’t between Ani and Vanya: it’s between Ani and Igor, a quiet but wise member of Vanya’s security team tasked played by Oscar nomineeYura Burisov.Ani and Igor’s relationship is surprising and unexpected, sneaking up on you over the course of the film. Eventually, it becomes evident that Ani’s knight in shining armor may have been standing beside her all along. A modern-dayPretty Womanwith a ton of laughs and an ambiguous but arguably sweet ending? Yes,Anoraearns a spot on this list.  —Chris Murphy Peyton Reed’ssleeper classic, starringRenée ZellwegerandEwan McGregor,wasn’t especially well-received when it was released in 2003, which I have a theory about. The movie is an unabashed confection: candy-coated to the point of causing cavities, and excessively rich with wink-winking nods to the Doris Day movies that inspired it.Down with Lovewas definitely a tough sell in the midst of a brewing Iraq War; it couldn’t have seemed more frivolous. But all that sugar was just a cover for what’s really at stake here, which is a re-writing of movie romances and their ongoing battles of the sexes. The film, about a star writer’s proto-feminist attempt to get women to live and fall in love on their own terms and the magazine writer trying to bring her down, doesn’t have an outwardly cynical bone in its body. But its characters do: these are people who know the strategic ins and outs of romance, and spend an entire movie one-upping each other. It all builds toward one of the finest moments of Zellweger’s acting career (which is saying a lot): a heart-stopping monologue about the things a woman might do just to get noticed by the man she loves. At the center of all this silliness is a character who truly deserves a happy ending—but not at the expense of the newfound freedom she inspired in everyone else.—K. Austin Collins Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell teamed up for this fast-talking newspaper screwball comedy from director Howard Hawks. The film is older than most of the other rom-coms on our list, but in many ways, it was before its time—a media-world romance fueled by talky, mile-a-minute romance banter that posited the chemistry between Grant and Russell as a meeting of equally sharp minds with the same nose for news. In adapting the 1928 playThe Front Page,Hawks altered the workplace dynamics of workaholic crack reporters in Chicago with one fell swoop: he turned Hildy Johnson into a snappy, bold female reporter—and the ex-wife of Grant’s Walter Burns, the sly, knowing editor ofThe Morning Postwith a booming voice and irresistible charm.His Girl Fridaylays on the paternalism of the 40s pretty thick—Walter sabotages Hildy’s relationship with another man, and delights in cornering her into doing more work—but her final decision, between the monotony of domesticity and the thrill of chasing the next story, rings true nearly 80 years later.— Sonia Saraiya Julia Robertsrebounded from a little career slump (if you love trouble and want something to talk about, watchMary Reilly) with this utterly effervescent anti-romance, a prickly and witty comedy of jealousy that finally let Roberts show the hard edge lurking behind her thousand-watt smile. (We’d argue she never again played a true innocent afterMy Best Friend’s Wedding.) InP.J. Hogan’sfilm,Dermot Mulroneyis the perfect soft surface for Roberts to throw darts at, whileCameron Diazis hateable and relatable in a committed performance that solidified her star. But it’sRupert Everett,playing one of the early rom-com gay besties, who nearly saunters off with the movie. When he and Roberts are a’banter,My Best Friend’s Weddingmakes its most salient observation: sometimes it’s friendship, not romance, that rescues us—and redeems us, too.—Richard Lawson Come for Nora Ephron’s first hit as a director with this unlikely 1993 romantic comedy, which begins withTom Hanksmourning the loss of his beloved wife and mother. Eventually, he finds a second chance at love via a radio show, an homage toAn Affair to Remember,and a manipulative 8-year-old, played with aplomb byRoss Malinger.Stay for a youngGaby Hoffmannand her precocious pre-iChat lingo, and Annie’s (Meg Ryan) journalistic tenacity, which allows her to track down Mr. Sleepless in Seattle even in a pre-Google, pre-LexisNexis environment. The movie verges into stalker territory with Annie’s willingness to cross the country in search of her true love, but Hanks is pitch-perfect as the bereaved husband and doting father. (The scene with him describing to Jonah how his mom could peel an apple in one long slice while “Bye Bye Blackbird” plays in the background is still a stunner.) And questionable elements or not, you’ll still wind up rooting for the duo’s long-awaited meet-cute atop the Empire State Building.—Nicole Sperling James L. Brookswrote, produced, and directed this seven-time Oscar nominee, which put a slight little Southerner namedHolly Hunteron the map and predicted the slow decline of American journalism. But above all,Broadcast Newsis a love story—between three career-minded journalists and the industry they adore, which tangles them into an achingly empathetic love triangle that puts each character on a path to heartbreak. Hunter’s character, a TV news producer, is as smart and honorable as her best friend, a journalist played byAlbert Brooks.But she’s taken by the new anchor, played byWilliam Hurt,and ends up in a quandary that tests her heart, in a competitive environment with very little room for softer emotions. Every performance in this film is a gem, and James L. Brooks guides the viewer so expertly that its paces feel inevitable, even as they jerk tears. Unlike most rom-coms on this list,Broadcast Newsdoesn’t end with a happily paired off couple. But it does feature Hunter in a fabulous polka-dotted dress on her way to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which is just as good.—Sonia Saraiya Eddie Murphyenjoyed a string of comedic hits in the ‘80s, includingTrading PlacesandBeverly Hills Cop—but no vehicle captures him at the height of his powers likeComing to America. Murphy plays Prince Akeem, a royal heir who finds himself disillusioned with life in his African country and journeys to Queens, New York in pursuit of a wife who can be his equal. Thanks to prosthetics from makeup artistRick Baker, Murphy and his co-starArsenio Halltake on multiple supporting roles in the film, which also starsShari Headleyas his one true love. The enduring love forComing to Americaspawned amiddling 2021 sequel, which only solidified the original’s lightning-in-a-bottle synergy. —Savannah Walsh A rom-com made in an era when the production code discouraged scenes of “excessive passion,”It Happened One Nightcaptures falling in love and even lust without a whole lot: an expertly displayed leg, an instantly iconic shirtless Clark Gable, and a road-trip plot repeated endlessly in the decades since but never quite matched. A model of the screwball-comedy era, when dialogue came quickly and women behaved wildly—but lovably—It Happened One Nightholds up particularly well thanks to the chemistry between Gable and Claudette Colbert, who plays the heiress on the run being hunted down by Gable’s enterprising reporter. Their relationship is sparring and hilarious, the two clearly perfectly matched in wits, until it turns irrepressibly romantic, with Colbert’s Ellie running away from her unwanted wedding to “pill of the century” Westley (Jameson Thomas) to be with her hunky newspaperman. The Walls of Jericho tumbled, five Oscars were won, and the cinematic template was set for pairs who just can’t stop arguing, so they may as well kiss already.—Katey Rich Let the record show thatDaniel Day Lewis’s (allegedly) final film role was in his first romantic comedy. On the surface,Paul Thomas Anderson’s meditation on marriage is too deranged and dark to be considered alongside the works ofNancy Meyersor Nora Ephron. But look more closely, and you’ll see that the budding relationship between Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis), a renowned dress designer in 1950s London, and Alma, (Vicky Krieps) an unassuming waitress decades his junior, fits the rom-com formula. Alma literally trips upon her awkwardly endearing meet-cute with Reynolds; they spar over their opposing lifestyles and backgrounds; there’s even aWhen Harry Met Sally-esque New Year’s Eve scene.Reimagined as an ‘80s romantic comedy, nothing aboutPhantom Thread’s core DNA changes. AsVanity Fair’sRichard Lawson, who deemed it “the most surprising love story” of 2017,concludes, “There’s a ‘you and me babe, against the world’ kind of vibe toPhantom Thread—it winks with the conspiratorial coziness of a private joke. It’s fiercely romantic, in its improbable way.” —Savannah Walsh ThisBringing Up Baby-esque slapstick comedy is made picture-perfect thanks to the onscreen trifecta ofBarbra Streisandas freewheeling college dropout Judy Maxwell,Ryan O’Nealas uptight musicologist Dr. Howard Bannister, and Madeline Kahn in her first onscreen role as Howard’s shrill fiancée Eunice Burns. Their performances soar under the direction of Peter Bogdonavich, working from a quick-witted script byGraduatecowriter Buck Henry andBonnie and Clydecowriters David Newman andRobert Benton. The enduring legacy ofDocremains its comedic set pieces, including an elaborate car chase through the hills of San Francisco and a sequence in which Howard pretends not to know Eunice in a restaurant while hiding beneath a table with Judy. Khan’s well-executed indignity steals the scene—and threatens to run away with the whole movie. —Savannah Walsh They don’t often come as irresistible or instantly rewatchable asLove & Basketball,Gina Prince-Bythewood’s hoops-heavy fairytale starringSanaa Lathanas Monica Wright—an aspiring basketball player who falls in love with her neighbor and childhood confidant Quincy, played byOmar Epps.Nearly 25 years later, Prince-BlythewoodtoldVanity Fair(viaGabrielle Union, who stars as one of Quincy’s other love interests) that her first film “absolutely set the tone” for the dynamic career that would follow. “I think it is so important for your first film to do that, to reflect who you are, say who you are, introduce yourself,” she continued. “Which is why I'm so glad it wasLove & Basketballand not something I had almost done.” Consider us similarly grateful. —Savannah Walsh Groundhog Dayis the ultimate rom-com for curmudgeons who don’t like rom-coms, the perfect salve for a hardened cynic’s heart. After all, its hero is himself exquisitely sour: Phil Connors, a weatherman sent to Punxsutawney, P.A., to cover the pointless annual ritual of a groundhog looking for its shadow, may beBill Murray’sideal role. Bored with life, he gets caught in a time loop in which he’s repeatedly forced to relive the previous 24 hours. That means that day after day, he gets turned down by his producer, Rita, played with twinkly self-possession by Andie MacDowell. By dilating each moment, the movie expands Phil’s sense of wonder exponentially. He gets to know the inhabitants of this tiny town, to learn kindness and curiosity. And the repetition of time gradually washes away his misery and egotism. Phil spends a big chunk of the movie trying to figure out fraudulent ways to seduce Rita, but it’s only when he stops trying to trick her into bed and has fun being with her (and he, in turn, becomes a human being she can enjoy) that the romance clicks. It’s an amazing emotional and structural feat, a movie that I would happily watch again and again and again.—Joy Press One could credit or blame this film for inspiring everything fromThe Prince and Meto Netflix’sThe Princess Switchfranchise. The well-worn formula began with Audrey Hepburn’s Princess Ann fleeing from her gold-plated prison for adventure in the Eternal City. While taking her trip on the wild side, she encounters American journalist Joe Bradley (a smoldering Gregory Peck), who takes his royal run-in as the perfect opportunity for an explosive article. Hepburn and Peck’s chemistry is undeniable, and watching them fall in love while riding a Vespa or grazing near the Trevi fountain is a breezily comforting affair. That is, until Joe’s deceit is revealed and the reality of their different stations in life comes rushing back into focus. The film’s final scene remains one of the most quietly heartbreaking in romantic comedy history. Directed by William Wyler,Roman Holidaywould prove to be Hepburn’s own crowning achievement, earning her an Oscar for best actress in the process.—Savannah Walsh 10 Thingsis right on the line between teen movie and romantic comedy, but what elevates this film past high-school drama is the mature performances fromJulia Stilesand the late, great Heath Ledger, who personify the frustration of being over high school but too young for college in separate, equally winning ways. In a way, the incredibly juvenile premise—a spin on Shakespeare’sTaming of the Shrewin which Ledger’s character is paid to take out Stiles’s, so that a whole other set of characters can go out with her younger sister—is just there to be transcended, as sparks fly between two people who had long ago given up on this dumb school (and, by extension, this dumb town).Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Krumholtz, Susan May Pratt,andLarisa Oleynikround out the cast for an especially endearing view of high-school power dynamics and the banal cruelties of teenage heartbreak. All that, plus a public display of affection on a football field using Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You.”—Sonia Saraiya She was just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her—exceptshewas Julia Roberts, fresh off the success ofMy Best Friend’s Wedding,andhewas Hugh Grant, post–Sense and Sensibility.In other words, these were two beloved actors stretching some already toned muscles, and it showed.Notting Hillunfolds like a modern-day fairy tale, as a wildly famous actress falls in love with a humble shopkeeper. The clothes might be dated—1999 was a truly embarrassing year for all of us—but the appeal is eternal. It checks all the boxes: the meet-cute, the wacky friends, the lovable stars with electric chemistry and a skill for adorably awkward entanglements. (In what world would anyone say “no” to having orange juice spilled on them by a 1990s Hugh Grant?) In fact,Notting Hillexceeds these conventions to a degree that, in any other film, might have been cloying and excessive. (Really, there aremultiplemeet-cutes; Hugh Grant isexceedinglyawkward.) But thanks to its stars, as well as the careful writing by Richard Curtis, who had made magic with Grant inFour Weddings and a Funeraljust a few years before,Notting Hillhits all the requisite notes just right.—Laura Bradley To kick off a four film franchise, the first movie out of the gate has to have the juice—andBridget Jone's Diarycertainly does. For anyone who’s ever found herself sitting at home with dangerous quantities of wine and cake, belting out “All by Myself” alone, this one was bound to be a home run—and apparently, quite a lot of us could relate. Renée Zellweger’s hapless heroine Bridget Jones and her competing love interests—played with distinctly British charm byColin Firthand Hugh Grant—became an instant hit in 2001. Although the sequels never lived up to the promise of the original—that is until the fourth one came along—it’s hard to think of anything that could erase the legacy of blue soup, ugly Christmas sweaters, and embarrassing fights in the street. Besides, it’s hard to think of a more satisfyingly absurd, distinctly “rom-com” climax than the moment Bridget chases Mr. Darcy down a snowy London street in nothing but a pair of sneakers, a jacket, and zebra-print undies.—Laura Bradley In adapting Jane Austen’sEmma,about a scheming matchmaker surprised by her own romance, for mid-90s teenagehood, writer-directorAmy Heckerlinginvented her own idiom. Baldwins, Monets, and Cake Boys all swirl happily in the orbit of Cher Horowitz, a shallow Beverly Hills princess of hidden depth played brilliantly byAlicia Silverstonein a generation-defining performance. (There would be no Regina George without Cher.) Heckerling’s world—which includes an adorablePaul Ruddas a just slightly problematic love interest—is lively and silly, but also sharp. The movie’s critique and veneration of teen culture may look quaint in this era of Instagram stars, butCluelessstill stands sturdily in its platform sneakers as one of the best of the genre—of several genres, in fact. Has there ever been a better teen comedy? As if.—Richard Lawson You’ve Got Mailis the last of Nora Ephron’s genre-defining romantic comedies, arriving in theaters afterWhen Harry Met SallyandSleepless in Seattle,but before the new millennium. It’s the second film Ephron made with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, who circle each other easily as sparring partners Kathleen Kelly (who owns the Shop Around the Corner children’s book store) and Joe Fox (who runs the capitalist scourge Fox & Sons Books). They fall in love, using technology that would eventually put both characters out of business if cameras kept rolling for another decade: the Internet. Though a film about romance in the age of America Online was always going to be hopelessly dated, it was also the first rom-com to normalize the thrill of flirting via chat box with an anonymous stranger (even while talking about innocuous things like butterflies and buying school supplies in the fall). It was the first rom-com to castDave Chappelleas a best friend; the first to use a dial-up modem as the opening credits song; and the first to playfully skewer how easy it is to catfish a potential mate. And while it also wasn’t the first romantic comedy to have its male character gaslight his love interest, Fox does come clean about it in the end.—Kenzie Bryant It launched the rom-com career of the singular Nora Ephron. It established Meg Ryan as America’s sweetheart. And it became the gold standard that Hollywood tried to emulate for the next decade. 1989’sWhen Harry Met Sallyand all its talky, charming smartness felt revelatory upon its release, and still resonates today primarily because it so thoughtfully examines the central question posed at the beginning: can (straight) men and women really be just friends? While those stark gender lines, and Sally’s obsession with marriage, feel a bit dated in 2018, the film is still a near perfect execution of the genre. Ephron and directorRob Reinerachieve that alchemy by combining the sweet quirkiness of Ryan’s Sally Albright with the cranky pessimism ofBilly Crystal’sHarry Burns, all swirled together with Ephron’s endlessly quotable dialogue (as well as more than a few memorable improvised lines): “Baby Fish Mouth is sweeping the nation!”; “Waiter, there is too much pepper on my paprikash!” Of course, you also can’t forget the charming faux-documentary vignettes of longtime married couples sprinkled throughout the piece, and the stellar supporting performances by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. Re-watching the film today is a bleak reminder of all that on- and off-screen talent that is no longer here—but thankfully, Ephron’s intelligent wit, and those who sold it, will live on forever. “I’ll have what she’s having.”—Nicole Sperling",

    "title": "Angela Bassett on the Look That Made Her Feel Confident, Powerful, and Sensuous at the Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "“I feel super and I feel fine,” actorAngela BassetttoldVanity Fairwhile reflecting on her incomparable acting career. Going into her firstMet Gala, Bassett was excited to be on what she described as a “world stage for fashion.” This year’s Met Gala theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” also made it even more “thrilling” for her to be in attendance. “You know, when you hear ‘superfine,’ just the connotation is extraordinary, fun, and exuberant. It just represents, for me, creativity and fearlessness and impeccable dressing and style,” Bassett explained. So when it came to observing this year’s dress code, Tailored for You, Bassett joined forces with heritage British house Burberry—a first-time partnership for the two icons. The actor worked with her stylist of more than a decade,Jennifer Austin,andDaniel Lee,Burberry’s chief creative officer, to create something that would make her feel “confident,” “powerful,” and “sensuous” at the Met Gala 2025. The result? A blue-and-black vine-jacquard velvet tuxedo cape, waistcoat, and tailored trousers—styled with a sheer black blouse, a black silk tie, leather cameo fringe pumps, and jewelry by Messika to add more elements of dandyism. For this year’s Met Gala, Lee tappedLaw Roachas a consultant because of the self-proclaimed image architect’s knowledge of style and culture, asking him to aid in curating the brand’s looks and guest list for the evening. Leaning on the prints utilized in Burberry’s fall-winter 2025 collection, but slightly tweaking the color story, Roach wanted to make sure there was cohesion between Bassett and her fellow Burberry-clad attendees, who includedAndré 3000,JalenHurtsand wifeBryonna “Bry” Burrows,Cardi B,Jodie Turner-Smith,Liu Wen,Roberto Bolle,and Roach himself. “There’s an overarching theme of opulence and luxury that is told through textile and fabric…. It’s a lot of rich velvet that we’re wearing,” Roach toldVF.“It’s beautiful. It’s luxury. These fabrics are based on the elegance and opulence of antique furniture. It’s a really beautiful story.” While this year marked Bassett’s Met Gala debut, the veteran actor is no stranger to the red carpet. In getting ready for the Met Gala 2025, she was also preparing for a press tour tied to the upcoming release of action filmMission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning.“This franchise is so thrilling and so important, and to have been asked to come along on that journey by T.C. [Tom Cruise] has been tremendous,” Bassett said. Bassett’s connection to the Met Gala 2025 theme is a throughline to how she presents herself daily, with the performer being a firm believer in finding the good in everything and praising it: “Somebody’s always watching you, so be your superfine self in all things that you do when you step out of the house.” For more from the Met Gala 2025, revisitVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblogfor the evening’s highlights includingevery look, thebest-dressed of the night, our experts’ picks for whobest embodied the theme, avideo replay of the red carpet, and more.

    "title": "Vanity Fair and Peacock Go All In on ‘Poker Face’ Game Night",
    "article_text": "Start counting your chips. On Tuesday,Vanity Fairand Peacock cohosted the game night to end all game nights ahead of the season two premiere ofRian Johnson’sEmmy-nominated series Poker Face,which begins streaming on May 8. Le Chalet at L’Avenue, a venue famous for often hostingSNLafter-parties, was transformed into an intimate poker den for the event, hosted byPoker Faceexecutive producer, director, writer, and starNatasha LyonneandVanity Fair’seditor in chief,Radhika Jones.Multiple poker games unspooled simultaneously, with dealers plucked fromLeonardo DiCaprio’sprivate poker nights at Casa Cipriani. AsDJ Rare Gemsspun on the decks,Poker Faceguest stars likeKatie Holmes,Chloë Sevigny,andSteve Buscemimixed and mingled with celebs likeJanelleMonáe,Michelle Buteau,andAlex Edelman.The crowd dined on light bites, sipped themed cocktails, and called each others’ bluffs—at the poker table, of course. Natasha Lyonne, Radhika Jones, and Cynthia Erivo Wicked’sCynthia Erivomade it to the function despite having attended the Met Gala the night before. Although she performed at the legendary shindig last yearwith herWickedcostarAriana Grande, this year, Erivo was delighted to simply be a guest. “I love it when I get to just be a spectator and enjoy and dance,” she said. Erivo was certainly put to work in the season two premiere ofPoker Face.She playsfive characters simultaneouslyin the episode—a challenge even for someone talented enough to make singing “Defying Gravity” look like a walk in the park. “I’m excited for it to come out,” Erivo said of thePoker Facepremiere. “I’m excited to sit and watch it, and a little bit nervous.” While she’s adept at playing multiple characters at once, it had been a minute since she’d played a game of poker. “I haven’t played poker in a long time,” she said. “I used to play poker. I used to be quite good it, but I don’t know if I’m good at it now.” The Practice’sCamryn Manheim, however, was a bit more confident in her poker-playing abilities. “I’m good enough,” she said. “Not only am I patient, but I’m very interested in all the stories people are telling me by their bets. I watch very carefully what the story is of their hand.” Later on in the evening, this writer would lose multiple hands in a row to Manheim at a table that also includedLake BellandShowgirlsstarGina Gershon. While Manheim was the most consistent winner, the most daring poker player of the night was Bell, who went all-in multiple times—and won each time she did. Eventually, Lyonne made her way into the shindig, decked out in a white minidress and sunglasses. Fresh off the Met Gala herself, Lyonne said that she feels “tremendous” about the 12-episode second season ofPoker Face. “I’m proud of the work we all did,” she said. “It’s a beast, this show because it really is 12 movies, and week to week…” She pauses, taking a moment to reflect. “Man, oh, man. Those are logistics. You got to really commit and lock in, because we got 10 days to get it right. So, go big or go home.” Lyonne stars on the series as wisecracking Charlie Cale, a crime-solving ex casino worker who has the peculiar gift of being able to tell whenever someone’s lying. Lyonne herself has a similar ability. “I can sniff out bullshit pretty well,” she said. “It’s sort of like Charlie says in the pilot: ‘People lie all the time. The question is why they’re lying.’ I think there’s a fair amount that happens just to get by. People come by it honestly. But sometimes it’s weird and wacky, huh?” Lyonne’s also not afraid to go big at the poker table—as long as it’s just for fun and games. “I do play a little bit of poker,” she said. “Not competitively. I’ve been asked, but I wouldn’t do that to myself.” As the party continued, more stars joined in on the fun. Lyonne’sOrange Is the New Blackcast matesTaylor Schilling,Alysia Reiner,Adrienne C. Moorecaught up at a small table over a game of cards, laughing together.Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’sCarol Kaneand Steve Buscemi chatted in the corner. After a long conversation with Sevigny on a couch, Holmes snacked on french fries; she put them down to take a photo with Bell, remarking on their similar blue floral pantsuits. PlaywrightJeremy O. Harrismade it to the game night despite being out withCharli XCXuntil 11 a.m. in the morning post-Met Gala. “I’m not a 365 party girl,” he quipped. Rosanna Arquette and Katie Holmes Poker wasn’t the only game of the night.Ronan Farrowplayed a riveting game of Uno; in another corner of the room, Jenga towers toppled over next to TikTok star andPoker Faceguest starVeronikaSlowikowska.And new card games were tried as well. A long table was formed for Monae, Buteau,Orange Is the New BlackstarDascha Polanco,The Undoing’sNoma Dumezweni,and a bevy of other guests so that they could play one calledKaBoom!“I have never played poker. I don’t gamble,” Dumezweni said. “I gamble with my heart.” Just as it does onPoker Face,everything came back to sniffing out bullshit. The long table ditchedKaBoom!and went back to that classic card game. Buscemi, Polanco, Manheim, Moore, Monae and, yes, Lyonne played Bullshit well past closing time. We’ll let you guess who won.

    "title": "To Adapt Judy Blume’s Forever, Mara Brock Akil Made a Banned Book Even Bolder",
    "article_text": "Before we’d even sipped our spicy margaritas, TV mogulMara Brock Akiland I realized we’d experienced most of our adolescent firsts in the same place. Akil was born in Los Angeles, but like me, grew up outside of Kansas City, Missouri. “LA is the dreamer in me, and Kansas City is the hard worker in me,” she says from a cozy table at Corner Bar on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. “It’s been one of my most beautiful combinations, the tale of those two cities in me.” Kansas City is also where Akil, now 54, first opened the pages ofJudy Blume’sForever—a controversial coming-of-age novel published in 1975 that’s often beenblacklistedfor its frank depictions of sex. Blume isnotoriously protectiveover her vast literary catalogue, permitting only a handful of screen adaptations of her works—including 2023’sAre You There God? It’s Me Margaret. But Akil, who was drawn to Blume’s flawed, authentic characters, earned the author’s blessing to make a modern series adaptation ofForever,which streams May 8 on Netflix. Akil’s star-crossed lovers, Justin and Keisha (played by relative newcomersMichael Cooper Jr.andLovie Simone), are Black teenagers in Los Angeles who cross paths on New Year’s Eve 2017. Their first meeting, in an episode directed byRegina King,is charged with the kind of adolescent desire a person only experiences once. “Yearning lives on in us, even as we get older and date,” says Akil. “But to fall in love for the first time? That’s a high we keep chasing for the rest of our lives.” Over the course of eight stirring episodes, Justin and Keisha are pulled apart and pushed back together—often because of their parents’ strong beliefs about who they should date—as they navigate their final year before college at separate schools. There are no murder mysteries or car chases here, just the universal experience of wanting. Says Akil, “The journey of love is fearful enough.” Justin and Keisha’s courtship is a slow burn of miscommunication exacerbated by technology that was supposed to simplify connection. “The phone can bring you together, tear you apart, be an extension of sexuality,” says Akil. “That’s hard to negotiate for adults, let alone for a child.” While the biggest sexually related fear for past generations might have been getting pregnant or contracting HIV, “now anything we do in the digital imprint could ruin our whole lives before we even know who we are and have a chance to grow up.” Blume wroteForeverfor her daughter, who requested “a book about two nice kids [who] fall in love and do it and nobody has to die.” Akil, too, was inspired by her experiences raising two Black sons with husbandSalim,a fellow writer-producer whom she met during her four-season tenure on the beloved sitcomMoesha. “Judy and I talked about this. In the ’70s, parents—especially white parents—were like, ‘They’re safe in the world. Give them some independence until their choices are challenging their future.’” In Blume’sForever,for instance, narrator Katherine intends to follow her boyfriend Michael to college, until her parents intervene. “But other than that,” says Akil, “those parents are like Charlie Brown’s parents—they’re not there.” That hands-off approach informed Akil’s reimagining. Especially in the period between Trayvon Martin and George Floyd’s murders, she says, Black parents “were kind of screaming into a vacuum of fear, just discovering that moving up the hill or sending your kids to private white schools are not going to save your children. There was this catastrophic parenting happening that I participated in and witnessed. Police brutality against young Black men and the oversexualization of young Black women hang heavily over Akil’sForever. “I just had a lot of compassion for the Justins and Keishas,” she says. “Katherine and Michael got the whole world to figure some things out, with a bit of guidance when they got off the rails. But our kids are having to find out who they are in the narrowest of gaps.” Halfway through happy hour, I share one of my favorite lines from Blume’sForever:“It’s strange, but when it comes right down to it, I never do fall apart—even when I’m sure I will.” Akil closes her eyes, leans forward, and asks me to repeat the quote. “I wish I had pulled that one,” she says. “That speaks to our humanness—that we can put ourselves together and deserve other people to help us put ourselves back together.” Akil was nurtured by several Hollywood heavy hitters, includingDebbie Allenand the late Garry Marshall. After graduating from Northwestern, she launched her career as a production assistant on Fox’s short-lived 1993 sitcomThe Sinbad Show,then became an assistant on the one-season Fox seriesSouth Central. Her work dried up, but Akil stayed connected to her mentor on both shows, writer/executive producerRalph Farquhar.“Though I was broke as a joke, I stayed believing in myself by writing scripts,” she says. During a fateful 1996 catch-up, Farquhar offered Akil her first staff writing job onMoesha. “I was literally thinking I was going to get some notes, and he’s offering me a job,” she says with a shake of her head. “I lost it. It’s a great story, right?” Akil would go on to write forThe Jamie Foxx Showbefore creatingGirlfriends,her answer toSex and the Citylong before that show rememberedBlack women also live in New York. When she created that hit series, Akil became TV history’s youngest Black female showrunner—and the first Black female showrunner with two shows concurrently on broadcast network TV when she launched its spin-off,The Game. Then cameBeing Mary Jane,a starring vehicle forGabrielle Unionthat ran for four seasons. Akil cemented herself as the only Black showrunner or executive producer to have a show on TV every year from 2000 to 2017—both a testament to her talent and an indictment of the industry in which she flourished. “There’s times when you don’t know that you’re the first. I’m just trying to tell the best story I know how to tell,” says Akil now. She’s reminded of a line she wrote for Keisha’s mother, Shelly (Xosha Roquemore), who tells her lovelorn daughter in theForeverfinale: “If God takes something away, God’s going to give it to you, the same or better.” Akil’s mother told her those very words when she broke up with her first boyfriend, a Kansas City boy named Stan. “That’s what I survived on—that belief,” says Akil, who credits her mom’s mantra with all the success that came later. “I’ve been loved so well by the women in my life—my mother, my grandmother, my aunt, those three pillars. The community helped me feel safe enough to trust who I am, what I want, and what I like. So going back to that quote: ‘You think it’s all going to fall apart.’ And then you remember who you are and who loves you, and you get to work.” Akil hopes to cultivate those same feelings with the next generation of Black writers through the Writers’ Colony, a Los Angeles–based nonprofit writing residency she founded in 2021 andexpandedwith an on-set shadowing program onForever.“Writers’ Colony is an answer to the changes that are happening in our industry. There isno place to develop writers anymore,” says Akil. “It’s very difficult for showrunners to even get professional writers on set for their own script, let alone new voices.” Places like the Writers’ Colony foster community, as well as distinctive voices: “Don’t come here trying to be me. I’m still working on being me.” All of this has led Akil toForever—the second project under her overall deal with Netflix, following the 2024 Oscars shortlisted documentaryStamped From the Beginning,for which she served as an executive producer. That project was also based on a blacklisted book, this one byIbram X. Kendi.“I’ve had no IP in my career, and with these two, I’m like, ‘Damn. Did I just back into being producer of the banned book?’” Akil laughs. In truth, everything that madeForeversuch a contentious read in the 1970s has gotten more complicated in the decades since. Thanks to the internet, kids know more about sex at a younger age than ever; at the same time, access to reproductive healthcare has gotten scarcer than it once was. Blume and Akil discussed that during their first COVID-era Zoom about a potential collaboration, each one wearing blue, thick-framed glasses. “To meet someone that actually helped form my own voice was divine,” Akil says. She prefers not to share many details of their conversation, but adds, “I’m ultimately just grateful that we could have a real, substantive conversation about who we were as women, where we were in our lives, and why I wanted to adapt her book.” Blume entrusted Akil withForeverand joined the series as an executive producer. “Come on, a Judy Blume green light?” Akil exclaims. “A little flex too is that I believe before I got to Netflix, they tried to get Judy Blumes—and they couldn’t land that deal,” she adds with a triumphant giggle. (Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.) Blume allowed Akil to make significant changes to her story so long as Akil captured the essence of her book: “to allow young people to explore their feelings and curiosity around sexuality in a healthy way, and not jeopardize one’s future.” And devotees of the novel will be tickled to see that at least one infamous detail from the book remains: Our male protagonist still bestows an unforgettable name upon his penis. “I almost called him Jerome, a name traditionally associated with Black men,” says Akil. “But decided to honor the original and stayed with Ralph.” Akil’s most personal touch onForevercan be found in the show’s matriarchs—particularly Justin’s mother Dawn, as played byKaren Pittman,a close friend of the showrunner wholeft theSATCspin-offAnd Just Like That…to shootForever.It’s a gift, as Akil phrases it, to “put some meat on the table” and know Pittman “is going to eat, as the kids say. The more she eats it up, the more you are inspired to give it.” When asked just how much of Dawn’s strong-willed parenting style is based on her own, Akil lets out a knowing laugh. “Honey, writing is therapy. Dawn has allowed me to offer up a lot of my humanness, my vulnerability, my mistakes as a parent.” Dawn and Shelly both represent how “Black mothers specifically love so hard,” she says, in a way that can shape their children’s anxieties. “Wanting your parents’ approval and love—I think that’s where most kids are, versus this idea of rebellion and hating their parents,” says Akil. “Justin can’t tell his parents who he really is” for fear of making it seem like he doesn’t value the sacrifices they’ve made for him, she says. “And Keisha feels like she can’t tell her mother because, ‘I’m the smart one. I’m Urkel. I don’t know how to tell you about who I am while trying to keep up perfection.’” Writing Justin and Keisha’s adolescent romance at this point in her life “only made me more proud of little Mara” for choosing Stan to be her first love. “I think I made a good choice for myself,” at the time, says Akil. And just as her young lovers discover, finding peace with our path is all we’ve really got. “The only forever love is really self-love,” she says. “That’s the only thing you can really promise—and in a relationship, we should be evolving to our better self.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Janelle Monáe on “Getting Ready In a Time-Travel Machine” for the Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "Janelle Monáehas attended moreMet Galasthan she can remember. “I may have missed one or two since my first [in 2011]. I’ve been to over 10,” she toldVanity Fairon the eve of this year’s event, which celebrated the opening ofthe Costume Institute’s new exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” The actor and musician was fresh off a flight from Miami, where she had performed and DJ’d the night prior, and her transformation for this year’s look involved its own unique form of “travel,” she shared: “Let’s just say I’ll be getting ready in a time-travel machine.” Given that Monáe isa Met Gala regularof sorts, she and her team have established some pre–Met Galacustoms that will likely endure, regardless of the setting. “We’re listening to music. We’re eating, snacking, laughing—laughter has to be in the room,” she said. And music too, especially scores from movies. “Each time I go to the Met, I am a character. My mind works very cinematically in that way, and so I try to center everything around, Who is my character for Met? How does my character need to get in the zone?” This year’s character required two looks, both designed byThom Browneand the Oscar-winning costume designerPaul Tazewell,who joined Monáe on the red carpet and previously worked with her on the 2019 filmHarriet.The first, a boxy oversized cape featuring a trompe l’oeil suit—briefcase included—on its front, from which Monáe’s character emerged wearing a sharply cut suit. “This is Jane, the time traveler,” she said. The skirt suit was fashioned inside out to reveal the stitching and handiwork that went into making such a garment—a nod to the gala’s dress code: Tailored for You. The deconstructed style, as well as the masculine-feminine components of the suit, align with Monáe’s work as an artist too. Onstage, she frequently performs in suits that reference various eras, often in outlandish proportions. At this year’s Costume Designers Guild Awards, for example, Monáe donned a Viktor&Rolf plaid suit jacket with shoulders wider than a typical doorframe. “I try to deconstruct social norms, and I’ve tried to deconstruct respectability politics, even when it comes to wearing the suit,” she said. “I’ve always been in constant communication with the past, present, and future in all that I do, especially in my music and in my style,” Monáe explained. She, Tazewell, and Browne wanted to showcase dandyism through that same lens, but having the singer show up in a standard-issue suit was off the table. “I do that on a Thursday,” she said. When Monáe wore a look by Browne to the Met Gala two years ago, when the evening honored the exhibition “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” a dramatic red-carpet metamorphosis involving the removal of layers occurred too. This year’s theme and dress code called for another collaboration with the designer. “When we thought about who could nail the tailoring and who could nail the storytelling and who had the imagination, we all just agreed unanimously: It’s Thom,” she said. Capping off the look, quite literally, was a matching bowler-style hat, complete with an attached clock monocle that actually kept time. “It just takes it to that next level,” Monáe enthused. “This is the movie. If it doesn’t make me say, ‘Where’s the script? Where’s the movie?’ I’m not going to wear it.” For more from the Met Gala 2025, revisitVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblogfor the evening’s highlights includingevery look, thebest-dressed of the night, our experts’ picks for whobest embodied the theme, avideo replay of the red carpet, and more.

    "title": "Top of the Popes: 10 Actors Who Would Ace Our Conclave",
    "article_text": "Let the conclave begin. On Wednesday, the ancient ritual to elect the next leader of the Roman Catholic Church kicks off in Vatican City. And as we know from the wildly popular filmConclave,everything about the papacy is cinematic: the mystery, the sacred vestments, and, above all, the dramatic way a new pontiff’s selection is announced via the release of white smoke. Plenty of great films have focused on the process ofannouncing a new pope. But even more movies (and at a few TV shows too) have focused more broadly on charismatic pontiffs played by a variety of actors at the top of their game.Jonathan Prycewas witty;Jeremy Ironswas scheming; Peter O’Toole was corrupt,Liv Ullmannwas secretly a woman; andJude Lawmade history as the first Holy Father to rock a Speedo. When the pope is relegated to a secondary or supporting role, though, he’s often portrayed as an antagonist. Such was the case with Rex Harrison, who, inThe Agony and the Ecstasy,played a stiff and dull Julius II—a character constantly berated by Charlton Heston’s Michelangelo. As we wait for the white smoke to rise, let’s look back at the 10 best actors who have played the pope—starting with Harrison. Harrison plays the austere and boring Warrior Pope in Carol Reed’s film. His character duels with Heston’s impetuous Michelangelo, who is engaged in the titanic task of painting a fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) confesses his gravest sins to Cardinal Lamberto, a fictional character deeply troubled by the crimes he haers about. He eventually becomes a fictional version of Pope John Paul I, someone determined to confront the scandals and corruption rocking the Vatican, just as his real-life namesake did—or at least tried to. Peter’s successor carries the weight of the entire Catholic world on his shoulders. In this film,Nanni Morettioffers an ironic portrait of a fragile pontiff: Cardinal Melville, who is elected pope against his will and succumbs to the anguish of the role, overwhelmed by sudden stage fright. Set during the Cold War, this film chronicles the extraordinary rise of Kiril Lakota, a Ukrainian archbishop freed after years of imprisonment in Soviet gulags. Upon arriving in Rome, he is unexpectedly elected pope. What about the patriarchy of Catholic rule? The German actror stars here as a mythical papess who, according to legend, ruled the Church for two years in the ninth century, concealing her identity as a woman. This pontiff observes decadent Rome with ironic detachment. Amid the pranks of Marquis Onofrio (Alberto Sordi), Pius VII is the symbol of a creaking power. Stoppa offers a humane and disenchanted portrait, playing a pope who, rather than ruling, seems to resist amidst corrupt nobles. Jonathan Pryce’s beautifully empathetic and wry performance as Pope Francis (who is still, for much of the film, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio) probably helped shape the memory of the most recent Holy Father, at least for the secular world. The future pope is humble but troubled, with a folksy touch that irritates the then reigning pontiff—stern and conservative Benedict XVI, played byAnthony Hopkins. The holy grail of the Showtime series. The drama needed an actor of extraordinary caliber to play the corrupt Pope Paul III, who was capable of sustaining a confrontation with Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) during his attempt to divorce Catherine of Aragon. Henry’s challenge to the pontiff, and his resulting break with the Catholic Church, mark one of the most momentous turning points in world history. Winner of three Emmys, this Canadian series created byNeil Jordantells the murky story of one of the most powerful and corrupt dynasties of the Renaissance. The plot follows the rise of charismatic patriarch Rodrigo Borgia to the papacy, revealing a world marked by intrigue, sex, and blood, all under the shadow of the Vatican. Jude law deserve all the white smoke inPaolo Sorrentino’s dramedy. His Lenny Belardo is devoted to tobacco and gives us the sinful vision of a muscular pontiff walking on the beach, dressed only in a bathing suit.

    "title": "For Genevieve O’Reilly, Mon Mothma’s Explosive ‘Andor’ Speech Was 20 Years in the Making",
    "article_text": "Star Warsfans knew this moment was coming. With the Ghorman Massacre imminent, lore had it that Mon Mothma—the politician from Chandrila fighting for peace and democracy, while secretly serving as an informant for the Rebellion—would give an explosive speech before the Senate that would officially end her double life and turbocharge resistance to the Empire. In the ninth episode ofAndor’s second and final season, we reach that point. An elaborate plan comes together to allow Mon Mothma (Genevieve O’Reilly) to speak from the dais, against the wishes of her colleagues and the Empire’s leadership—and more surprisingly, we hear her unshakable remarks in full. “I believe we are in crisis. The distance between what is said and what is known to be true has become an abyss. For all the things at risk, the loss of an objective reality is perhaps the most dangerous,” she says. “The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil. When truth leaves us—when we let it slip away, when it is ripped from our hands—we become vulnerable to the appetite of whatever monster screams the loudest.” Andorhas been profoundly resonant this season, perhaps never more than with that rousing, devastating polemic. It’s delivered with exacting delicacy by O’Reilly, who’s been waiting 20 years to deliver this very speech. Caroline Blakistonoriginated the role of Mon Mothma in 1983’sReturn of the Jedi.O’Reilly, fresh out of drama school at the time, was eventually cast as a younger version of the senator in 2005’sRevenge of the Sith.O’Reilly’s scenes were largely cut from that prequel, and she left theStar Warsfilms for a decade, untilRogue One—the movie cowritten byTony Gilroy,the mastermind behindAndor,and whose events lead right intoA New Hope.Her role then expanded inAndor. This speech gives us our richest insight yet into Mon Mothma. “It’s the fulcrum, the crux of who she is,” O’Reilly tellsVanity Fair.“The opportunity to get to do that as an actor was everything.” Genevieve O'Reilly with Ben Miles inAndorSeason 2. Vanity Fair:I know Tony likes to outline storylines for actors as much as he can. When did you know you would be getting to make that speech? Genevieve O’Reilly:I knew from the very beginning—from the very early stages, even when we were talking about [the show] being five seasons—that the escape from the Senate, that threshold that she had to cross, was always part of her story. Tony said to me that the weight of her emotional work and her value as a character would really be in episodes seven, eight, and nine. I knew that we were heading for that. I was desperate. What was it like when you got that script? I’ll tell you something unique about how it landed. Tony is quite engaged as a showrunner. When scripts would land, he would ring; he was often in New York and we were in London. But whenthatscript landed, episode nine in particular, he was in London and he came into my trailer.Dan [Gilroy], his brother, wrote that script. But the speech wasn’t the speech we have now. The speech was moments of the speech. So they create this within the architecture ofAndor:There are these big moments, but there are multiple things going on. TheDiego [Luna]storyline, the dissident groups, there’s all happening around her speech. In the initial script, you only heard the odd line of her speech. It was peppered with bits. But Tony came in and he said, “What do you think of the script?” I said, “I love where you’re going. I love the dexterity of it and I can’t wait to get into it.” And then I leant forward and took a breath, and he said, “You want me to write the whole speech, don’t you?” And I said, “Yeah, I do. I want you to write the whole speech.” It was a real mark of him understanding me as an actor: how I like to work, and what I was reaching for, and also what I really wanted for the character. Within two days he had written that speech then. It waseverythingto work on it. And I went to the director that we were working with,Janus Metz,and I said, “Listen, Tony’s written the whole speech.” And he said, “Okay, well, you have to do the whole speech.” It was a really interesting way to end up on that day on that very lonely dais in the middle of a cavernous soundstage in front of a green screen, giving that speech to our very beautiful crew. So there was no speech written out, beyond short excerpts, until you spoke to Tony? There were only a few lines in the script. Theideawas she was giving a speech, but you didn’t hear the whole speech. You came intoStar Warsas a very small player in a very big world. But here, you’re an anchor. It sounds like Tony ultimately handed you the baton. This character has always been an expositional force:This is your mission—go off and do it.She is this pillar of leadership, but there was never exploration around that. He knew that, and he has learnt, in working with me over the years, that I’m really interested in the nuance and the mess and the knotty parts. I think he instinctively understood that I wanted to give this speech. They could do with it what they wanted afterwards, but it was important for me to have that moment to give that speech in the whole—to really understand and discover and wrestle with it. That speech itself is actually a piece of music, almost, in the way it’s been written. It starts with her history. It moves through what was important to her, and then it gets to the crux. And then it hits a punch. I want to know what it is to have to stand up in front of all those people and carve that speech. It was quite a moment for me that day, because you’re also isolated in just climbing up those stairs and standing on that dais. The very act of having to carve a whole speech, rather than grab moments, gives you the synergy of character. It’s especially rare—maybe unprecedented—for that moment of synergy to come after playing a character for 20 years. Yeah, it’s been a long wait. But I’m really grateful that I’ve been given the opportunity to explore her and wrestle her and fight for her in a way that I’ve just never had before. And how wonderful that it’s happened now at this age, with my life experience and my experience as an actor, to be able to infuse that in a way that I just wouldn’t have been able to do 20 years ago. Allistair Mackenzie, O'Reilly, and Stellan Skarsgård. The speech has undeniable, powerful real-world resonance. Is there a line or an aspect of it that has stuck with you? I remember shaking when I was giving it, and this was two years ago. It was as potent then as it is now, perhaps even more—the idea of truth being lost, the idea of there being a chasm between what is said and what is true. That has stayed with me. I wonder what you remember most? I think it’s when she’s reflecting on her own life and, in so many words, communicating the decision to come forward—the personal side. It’s a very human moment amid such a brave political act. Yes, and that’s what the speech gives—the idea that she doesn’t quite know. She knows it has to be a speech, she knows she has to hit things, but she doesn’t quite knowhowshe’s getting there. I feel that. For me, it didn’t feel like standing and giving a speech. It felt like standing and opening your rib cage and exposing yourself. This is a woman who has lived with masks in this cage of secrets. These masks, she wears perpetually, because if she doesn’t wear them, she’s useless to the Rebellion. But this is a moment that she can rip open her sternum and be vulnerable to her truth, and really risk speaking truth to power. Indeed, this is her point of no return. How do you think she gets there over these three episodes? There are several moments in the lead-up where she’s like, “I don’t think I can do this”—understandable expressions of reluctance. We don’t understand a heroic moment when we’re in it. There is an inevitability to her giving that speech, because if she doesn’t, then what’s it all for? That’s whatAndoris exploring. It’s exploring not just the archetype of heroism; it’s the messiness it takes to get there. It’s the lack of the conscious understanding that the moment might even be heroic. She knows it’s dangerous. She knows it’s not just crossing a threshold—it’s crossing a Rubicon. There is no point of return. She is setting fire to her life. It is in her self-doubt that I recognize her. How does Luthen fit into that, in your mind? This whole season he’s been an almost adversarial figure to Mon Mothma, in trying to get her to see the state of things as he does. This goes back to the beginning of the season, when he has her old friend Tay Kolma killed after realizing he’s too much of a liability. The tectonic plates under her have shifted to a point where she has no steady footing. She needed Luthen. That moment of idealism in regard to Tay Kolma, the idea that she thought she could work her way out of it—Luthen is a brutal realist at that point, and she carries the guilt and the pain of that. But his singular drive and his blinkered vision is what gets the Rebellion there. All her ties are broken, and with Luthen in that, she’s afraid of him. She’s so afraid of him at the beginning. Without that fear, maybe she couldn’t have burned it all down, but everything’s a step. Have you been reflecting back to when you first stepped into this character’s shoes, so long ago? That was back in 2005. I was a young actor out of drama school. I was living and working in Sydney, and they were shooting these big films in Sydney, and they were populating the small roles with those of us who were around. Caroline Blakiston had played her inReturn of the Jedi.They were looking for someone who would look like her or be her, and I swear I got the job because I was the palest person in Sydney. [Laughs] I was just really pale. Stepping onto those sets and getting to work withNatalie PortmanandJimmy Smits,andGeorge Lucasbeing there—I was just a wide-eyed young actor, soaking it all in. Of course, I was cut from those films; I mean, that was Anakin’s story, and it was always right that they did that. But it was such a positive experience for me. I just took that with me. I learned so much by being there, just by watching, just breathing it all in. And although those scenes were never in what they call the canon or whatever, they live in me. There are those experiences that you take as an actor that shine a light at some point. I just could never ever have imagined that it would’ve beensovaluable however many years later. It’s just been such a surprise to me. What struck you about these episodes when you watched them? We spent five years making these two seasons, and everyone who was a creator and an artist in season one came back for season two. We knew that it was going to be our last shot. So this might sound strange, but the collective ambition of everyone on, particularly, season two was palpable. What I was struck by when I watched it was that I thought itcaughtthat. It doesn’t always catch it. That collective ambition—I could see it there, and I felt deeply proud to be a part of that. I could see that magic that everyone was reaching for.

    "title": "Nod for law changes allowing small-scale harbour reclamation in Hong Kong",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers urge government to raise awareness among residents about the changes Legal amendments allowing small-scale reclamation in Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour were passed on Wednesday with the support of most lawmakers, who called on the government to raise the public’s awareness of the changes. The second and third readings of the Protection of the Harbour (Amendment) Bill were held in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. Lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who abstained from voting, argued that the changes would allow the government to vet its own proposals for reclamation. Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho said the new legislation could provide flexibility for the authorities to connect the harbourfront. She said administrative guidelines were being prepared and were expected to be completed in the next few months. Under the current legal framework, reclamation in the harbour is forbidden unless it is proven to have an “overriding public need” supported by “cogent and convincing materials”.

    "article_text": "Government says residents need clarity on fees in private sector, otherwise healthcare system will ‘fall into a vicious cycle’ Private hospitals in Hong Kong may be required to provide price estimates to patients and release information about past fees and charges under the government’s proposals to increase transparency in the sector. The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that residents needed clarity on charges in the private healthcare system. “Price transparency is crucial for the public in determining whether to choose private medical services,” the bureau said in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council. “If it is not handled well, Hong Kong’s medical system will fall into a vicious cycle.” The bureau said unclear pricing made residents hesitant to use the private sector, which put further pressure on the public system. The consequences could be detrimental to the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system, the bureau added.",

    "article_text": "While revising the public hospital fee structure was a much-needed move, more can be done to improve efficiency and resource allocation By pushing for a capitation payment system – with fixed fees for the entire coverage agreed upon in advance – instead of volume-based payments, the law forced healthcare providers to produce the best possible health outcomes without unnecessary expenditure, allowing successful institutions to retain excess funds. As health expenditures surge, it is irresponsible to ignore the ticking time bomb. And subventions – grants from the government – should not be seen as unlimited. Patients will always ask for more health services, yet they are shielded from the costs. For too long, overlooking the elephant in the room to prevent political fallout seems to have been the solution. The Health Bureau stepping up to reform the fee schedule of public hospitals is commendable, not least because directing resources towards patients crippled by catastrophic illness is the essence of hospitalsab initio.",

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris and The Catholic Project executive director Stephen White join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss as the cardinals prepare to choose a new leader for the Catholic Church. The leader of theRoman Catholic Churchdoes not get paid what many consider a traditional salary. Instead, the Vatican provides for the pontiff's needs, from housing, food, transportation and other expenses in the form of stipends and allowances. The Vatican,referred to as \"the world's smallest country,\" is sustained by \"an economy that relies on a combination of donations, private enterprises, and investments to generate revenue,\"according to Investopedia. Pope Francis declined any sort of salary when he took office in 2013,The Economic Times reportedback in February, adding that the pontiff at the time had a net worth of \"around $16 million, which includes various assets provided to him as the pope.\" The Vatican's financial situation has been in peril for years, with its annual operating deficit growing to over $90 million in 2023, according to reports. In November, Pope Francis warned that the Vatican's pension fund — which provides pensions to employees of the Holy See and Vatican City State — has been facing a \"severe prospective imbalance\" that \"tends to grow over time in the absence of interventions,\" according to theVatican News.

However, the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook estimated its revenues and expenditures in 2013 notched $315 million and $348 million, respectively. It generates this money through various avenues. According to the Michigan Journal of Economics, the Holy See generates some of its revenue through Peter’s Pence, which is a term thatdescribesdonationscollected from Catholics around the world and given to the Pope on an annual basis.

    "title": "UN experts demand action to avert ‘annihilation’ of Palestinians in Gaza – as it happened",
    "article_text": "More than 20 experts call on countries to act or ‘witness the slaughter of innocents’ United Nationsexperts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict inGaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”. This live blog will be closing shortly. You can find all the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the latest key developments: United Nations experts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict in Gaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory.“The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the humanitarian situation inGazahad reached “critical” levels unseen in the past and that it was urgent to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.Macron also said that whileIsraelwas entitled to fight a terrorist organisation, it was “unacceptable” it acted without respecting any rules. The UN’s human rights chief told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday that Israel’s plan for an expanded offensive in the Gaza Strip represented “a very dangerous moment” for civilians there.“What we see is only more destruction, more hatred, more dehumanisation,” said Volker Türk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, during a visit to Copenhagen for a UN meeting. “It’s a very dangerous moment for civilians,” he added, criticising the Israeli plan for an expanded offensive in theGazaStrip. The blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip “needs to be lifted immediately”, Türk told AFP.“Humanitarian assistance needs to come in. That’s an obligation, that’s an obligation under international law,” he added. The Dutch government, seen as one of Israel’s most loyal allies in the European Union, is calling for an urgent review of the EUIsraelassociation agreement, the basis for the EU-Israeli free trade agreement, the Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp told the Guardian.Veldkamp described the Israeli ban on the supply of aid into Gaza as “catastrophic, truly dismal” and in clear breach of international humanitarian law. Spain will present a draft resolution at the UN general assembly aimed at “proposing urgent measures to stop the killing of innocent civilians and ensure humanitarian aid” in Gaza, prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Wednesday.Sánchez told the Spanish parliament that “the international community cannot remain indifferent to what is happening” in the Palestinian territory. Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 59 people, including women and children, hospital officials said on Wednesday. The strikes included one attack on Tuesday night on a school sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians, which killed 27 people, officials from the al-Aqsa hospital said, including nine women and three children. An early morning strike on another school turned shelter in Gaza City killed 16 people, according to officials at al-Ahli hospital, while strikes on targets in other areas killed at least 16 others. Aid agencies have criticised Israeli plans to take over distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza and use private companies to get food to Palestiniansafter two months in which the military has prevented supplies from entering the territory. It comes asGazahas been hit by a wave of looting and theft as increasingly desperate Palestinians struggle to get food while criminal gangs exploit a breakdown in law and order. Medical officials in Gaza report rising cases of acute malnutrition, and community kitchens that served 1m meals a day are shutting down for lack of basic essentials.Aid agencies say they have distributed all remaining stocks of food. “By the time a famine is declared, it will be too late. The crime wave is because you have 2 million or more desperate, traumatised people packed together with virtually no policing,” said one humanitarian official in Gaza. Israel’s hostages coordinator on Wednesday said the number of living captives held in Gaza since Hamas’s October 2023 attack remained unchanged, contradicting US presidentDonald Trump’s announcement that three more had died. “The terrorist organisation Hamas is currently holding 59 hostages. 24 of them are on the list of living hostages. 35 of them are on the list of hostages whose deaths have been officially confirmed,” Hostages and Missing Persons coordinator Gal Hirsch wrote on X. Donald Trumpplans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the “Arabian Gulf” or the “Gulf of Arabia”, according to two US officials.The move has prompted a push back from Iranian leaders. Iran has welcomed the end of US attacks on Yemen, its foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesdayafter president Donald Trump announced Washington would stop bombing the Iran-aligned Yemeni Houthi militia. Trump said Yemen’s Houthis had agreed to stop disrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East. Yemen’s Houthi rebels said on Wednesday that they would continue targeting Israeli ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden despite aceasefire deal with the United States.“The waterways are safe for all international ships except Israeli ones,” Abdulmalik Alejri, a member of the Houthi political bureau, told AFP. US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday described US talks with Iran as “so far, so good”and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon. Syrian interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on a visit to France on Wednesday met a whistleblower, previously known only as ‘Caesar’, who smuggled out tens of thousands of pictures depicting the tortured corpses of detainees under ousted ruler Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa and foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani “met with Farid al-Madhan, known as ’Caesar’, on the sidelines of their visit” to Paris, the Syrian presidency said in a statement, posting images of the meeting. Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa is to meet French leader Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, marking his first visit to Europe since overthrowing longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.In Paris, al-Sharaa will discuss postwar reconstruction and economic cooperation during his meeting with Macron, a Syrian government official has said. The Israeli government “must immediately abandon its plans for expanded military operations … in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip”, said Amnesty International.The organisation said the plans, including annexing territory and forcibly displacing Palestinians in the occupied and besiegedGazaStrip, would “gravely violate international law”. An Israeli drone strike on a car in southern Lebanon killed a Hamas official early on Wednesday, authorities said. Hamas said in a statement that Khaled Ahmad al-Ahmad, who was a member of its military wing, was killed while he was on his way to a mosque to attend dawn prayers. The Israeli military confirmed that it had targeted al-Ahmad, saying he was a commander with Hamas in south Lebanon and was behind several attacks againstIsrael. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has set up a backchannel for talks between Israel and Syria, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as Syria’s new rulers seek regional help to manage an increasingly hostile relationship with their southern neighbour. The indirect contacts, which have not been previously reported, are focused on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building between two states with no official relations, a person with direct knowledge of the matter, a Syrian security source and a regional intelligence official told Reuters. Greece backs an Arab plan for the reconstruction ofGazaonce a ceasefire is achieved, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday.“The first priority is for hostilities to stop and restore the flow of humanitarian aid to civilians,” Mitsotakis said after meeting Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Athens. UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions to Israel despite the governmentsuspending key arms export licences to the country in September, new analysis of trade data shows.The research also raises questions over whether the UK continued to sell F-35 parts directly to Israel in breach of an undertaking only to sell them to the US manufacturers Lockheed Martin as a way of ensuring the fighter jet’s global supply chain was not disrupted, something the government said was essential for national security and Nato. More than a dozen senior Conservative MPs and peers have written to the prime minister calling for the UK to immediately recognise Palestine as a state, breaking ranks with their own party to do so.Seven MPs and six members of the House of Lords have signed the letter toKeir Starmerurging him to defy the Israeli government and give formal recognition to Palestine in advance of key UN talks next month. Protesters interrupted the opening minutes of Barclays’ annual general meeting (AGM) in London on Wednesday. One protester said that Barclays “provides loans worth billions to armed companies”, while people outside gathered to shout “free Palestine” and “stop arming Israel”. Barclays’ chair, Nigel Higgins, responded that the bank would be “more than willing to answer questions on the topic during the Q&A” session. Some global airlines have again halted their flights to and from Tel Aviv after a missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels towardsIsraelon Sunday landed near the country’s main international airport.KLM, Ryanair, Wizz Air, United Airlines, Air India and the Lufthansa group are among the airlines that cancelled flights after Sunday’s attack. Israel’s attack on the airport in Yemen’s Houthi-controlled capital Sana’a destroyed terminal buildings and caused $500m in damage, its director told Houthi media on Wednesday. He said earlier in a statement on X that the airport was suspending all flights until further notice after sustaining “severe damage” in the Israeli strikes. Israelistrikes acrossGazakilled at least 59 people, including women and children, hospital officials said on Wednesday, reports the Associated Press (AP) The strikes included one attack on Tuesday night on a school sheltering hundreds of displacedPalestinians, which killed 27 people, officials from theal-Aqsa hospitalsaid, including nine women and three children. It was the fifth time since the war began that the school in centralGazahas been struck.An early morning strike on another school turned shelter inGaza Citykilled 16 people, according to officials atal-Ahli hospital, while strikes on targets in other areas killed at least 16 others.A large column of smoke rose and fires pierced the dark skies above the school shelter inBureij, a built-up urban refugee camp. Paramedics and rescuers rushed to pull people out from the blaze, reports the AP.The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes, according to the AP. Spainwill present a draft resolution at theUN general assemblyaimed at “proposing urgent measures to stop the killing of innocent civilians and ensure humanitarian aid” inGaza, prime ministerPedro Sánchezsaid on Wednesday. Sánchez told the Spanish parliament that “the international community cannot remain indifferent to what is happening” in the Palestinian territory, whereIsraelresumed its offensive againstHamasin March after a two-month ceasefire, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The socialist premier has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel’s devastating war in Gaza, which has caused shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Spain also broke with someEuropeanallies and infuriated Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu’s government last year by recognising aPalestinianstate. USvice-presidentJD Vanceon Wednesday described US talks withIranas “so far, so good” and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon, reports Reuters. Vance said presidentDonald Trumploathed nuclear proliferation and would be open to sitting down withRussiaandChinain the coming years to discuss reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world. United Nationsexperts said on Wednesday that countries were at a moral crossroads over the conflict inGaza, facing the choice between acting to halt the violence and witnessing “the annihilation of the Palestinian population” in the territory, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The decision is stark: remain passive and witness the slaughter of innocents or take part in crafting a just resolution,” more than 20 independent UN experts said in a statement, urging the world to avert the “moral abyss we are descending into”.

Trump said Yemen’s Houthis had agreed to stop disrupting important shipping lanes in theMiddle East. Under the agreement, neither the US nor the Houthis would target the other, including US vessels in theRed Seaand theGulf of Aden’s narrowest point, thestrait known asBab al-Mandab,mediatorOmansaid. Syrianinterim presidentAhmed al-Sharaaon a visit toFranceon Wednesday met a whistleblower, previously known only as‘Caesar’, who smuggled out tens of thousands of pictures depicting the tortured corpses of detainees under ousted rulerBashar al-Assad, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Al-Sharaa and foreign ministerAsaad al-Shaibani“met with Farid al-Madhan, known as ’Caesar’, on the sidelines of their visit” toParis, the Syrian presidency said in a statement, posting images of the meeting. Syrian state media earlier reported that al-Sharaa had arrived in Paris, where he was due to meetFrenchleaderEmmanuel Macron, on his first visit toEuropesince overthrowing Assad in December. Madhan revealed his identity in February during an interview withQataribroadcaster Al Jazeera after being known for years only as a Syrian military photographer under the pseudonym ‘Caesar’. He fled Syria in 2013 with 55,000 graphic images taken after Syria’s war erupted two years earlier with the brutal repression of anti-government protests, smuggled in a flash drive. The photos, authenticated by experts, show corpses tortured and starved to death in Syrian prisons. He testified to aUS Congresscommittee and his photographs inspired a 2020USlaw which imposed economic sanctions on Syria and judicial proceedings in Europe against Assad’s entourage. Germany, theNetherlandsand France have since 2022 convicted several top officials from the Syrian intelligence service and militias. After war erupted, Madhan told Al Jazeera he was tasked with “taking pictures of victims of detention”. He had said that these included “old men, women and children, who were detained at security checkpoints in Damascus, and from protest squares that called for freedom and dignity”. He said he postponed his defection from the government forces and fleeing the country in order to be able to “collect the largest number of pictures documenting and incriminating the Syrian regime apparatuses of committing crimes against humanity”. In March, al-Sharaa signed into force a constitutional declaration for a five-year transitional period during which a “transitional justice commission” would be formed to “determine the means for accountability, establish the facts, and provide justice to victims and survivors” of the former government’s misdeeds. In Paris, al-Sharaa will discuss postwar reconstruction and economic cooperation during his meeting with Macron, a Syrian government official has said. Syria’s new authorities are seeking the full lifting of Assad-era sanctions but are under increasing pressure from Europe to show their commitment to protecting minority rights. Donald Trumpplans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the United States will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the “Arabian Gulf” or the “Gulf of Arabia”, according to two US officials. The move has prompted a push back from Iranian leaders. On Wednesday,Iran’scurrent foreign minister weighed in, saying that names of Mideast waterways do “not imply ownership by any particular nation, but rather reflects a shared respect for the collective heritage of humanity”. “Politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on the social platform X. “Any short-sighted step in this connection will have no validity or legal or geographical effect, it will only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life and political persuasion in Iran, the US and across the world.” Arab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the gulf. The two US officials spoke with the Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The White House and national security council did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The Israeli government “must immediately abandon its plans for expanded military operations … in the occupied and besieged Gaza Strip”, said Amnesty International. The organisation said the plans, including annexing territory and forcibly displacing Palestinians in the occupied and besiegedGazaStrip, would “gravely violate international law”. Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns, said: Israel’s declared intentions to expand its already devastating military offensive, further entrench its unlawful occupation of the Gaza Strip, and forcibly displace Palestinians could inflict a final blow leading to the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, who for months on end have been struggling to survive amid Israel’s ongoing genocide. Any attempts to weaponise humanitarian aid, use it to coerce forced displacement, or establish discriminatory aid distribution zones would violate international law and must be rejected. The international community must reject these dangerous plans and pressure Israel to comply with its obligations under international law and ensure unhindered humanitarian aid access throughout Gaza. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the humanitarian situation inGazahad reached “critical” levels unseen in the past and that it was urgent to allow the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Macron also said that whileIsraelwas entitled to fight a terrorist organisation, it was “unacceptable” it acted without respecting any rules. Israel announced plans on Monday to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza as part of an expanded operation it says could include seizing the entire Gaza Strip. Greece backs an Arab plan for the reconstruction ofGazaonce a ceasefire is achieved, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday. “The first priority is for hostilities to stop and restore the flow of humanitarian aid to civilians,” Mitsotakis said after meeting Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Athens. He added that the plan was a realistic basis of discussion for the day after the war.",

    "title": "Netherlands urges review of EU-Israel trade deal over ‘catastrophic’ Gaza aid block",
    "article_text": "The Dutch government, seen as one of Israel’s most loyal allies in the European Union, is calling for an urgent review of the EU Israel association agreement, the basis for the EU-Israeli free trade agreement, the Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp told the Guardian. Veldkamp described the Israeli ban on the supply of aid into Gaza as “catastrophic, truly dismal” and in clear breach of international humanitarian law. He has written to the head of the European Union foreign service Kaja Kallas requesting an urgent review, saying he believes Israel is now in breach of the association agreement. Veldkamp, a former Dutch ambassador to Israel, said he expects the issue to be discussed at a two day informal EU foreign ministers meeting in Poland starting Wednesday. The EU is Israel’s largest trade partner. The Dutch government has in the past led moves to block discussion of the association agreement’s suspension, a lever most persistently advocated by Ireland and Spain. Explaining his position Veldkamp said: “You cannot starve the people of theGazaStrip. It is against international law. It’s morally wrong. It’s dangerous. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s own interest.” Chances for a ceasefire appeared “very, very slim,” he said, making the situation “unbearable”. The Dutch government would veto any extension of the EU-Israel action plan, the agreement implementing the association agreement that came into force in 2000, he added. Article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement stipulates that their relations are based on respect for human rights and democratic principles. NGOs have repeatedly pressed a divided EU to take a stronger stand, but no moves were made to suspend the agreement in its meeting with Israel this February. In his letter to Kallas, Veldkamp said Israel’s proposed system of aid distribution appeared incompatible with the “principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence”. Speaking to the Guardian in London following a meeting with the British foreign secretary David Lammy he said that theNetherlandswas was “very concerned about the current conduct of the war, especially since the ceasefire’s end on 18th of March, and the blockade of humanitarian aid”. He also challenged Netanyahu’s priorities saying a ceasefire was the most effective way to get hostages released. “The criticism in Israel is increasing against [the] prime minister that he does not give enough priority to the release of the hostages, and he has now stated also that he doesn’t give that ultimate priority, but he gives the priority to fighting Hamas,” he said. “Now, Hamas has to release the hostages as soon as possible. Hamas has to lay down its weapons. Hamas cannot be part of the future governance of the Gaza Strip,” he said, “I know there are also plans by Egypt, one of the facilitators of ceasefire talks wants to see Hamas leadership leave to a third country.” With the International Court of Justice sitting in the Hague, the Dutch government feels it has an added duty to uphold ICJ judgements. “I don’t have any illusions that Hamas will ever apply international humanitarian law, but from a democracy such as Israel, democracies fight differently, and Israel has to abide by international humanitarian law, and with the latest statements by Israeli ministers, such as minister Smotrich that he aims for a total destruction of the Gaza strip, we cannot ignore any longer such statements. “I say this as someone that feels close to Israel, and as a former ambassador, this is not a sustainable policy by Israel, and it is time to work for peace”. His remarks, and the potential impact on the European Union come days before Donald Trump flies to the Middle East for his first major overseas visits since his inauguration. Trump has not so far criticised Netanyahu’s strategy.",

    "title": "Actor Michael Pitt, know for \"Boardwalk Empire,\" arrested on sex abuse charges",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 7, 2025 / 4:56 PM EDT/ AP Actor Michael Pitt, known for his TV roles on \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"Dawson's Creek,\" is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend, choking her, and attacking her with a cinder block and a piece of lumber at his New York City home, according to a grand jury indictment. Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment. Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed. \"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt — an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes — can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press. He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\" Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done. The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of lumber. The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021. TMZ reported in 2022 that Pitt was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly punching a man after taking his phone and, two months later, was brought to a hospital under police escort aftera public outburstin New York. Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire,\" with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show alsowona Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011. His first major role came in the 2001 film \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" In 2005, he starred in \"Last Days,\" director Gus Van Sant's film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB's \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1999-2000. © 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Over the last few years, however, we've found a growing number of cases where bacteria have evolved the ability to break down such chemicals, like industrial contaminants and plastics. Unfortunately, these bacteria are all different species, target different individual contaminants, and thrive in different environments. But now, researchers have developed a new way to take the genes from all these species and place them in a single bacterial strain that can decontaminate complex waste mixtures. The inspiration for this work was the fact that a lot of this industrial contamination contains a mixture of toxic organic molecules that are commonly found in brackish or salty water. So, the research team, based in Shenzhen, China, started by simply testing a number of lab bacteria strains to develop one that could survive these conditions. The one that seemed to survive the best wasVibrio natriegens. These bacteria were discovered in a salt marsh, and their primary claim to fame is an impressive growth rate, with a population being able to double about every 10 minutes. Unfortunately,Vibrio natriegensdoesn't have the sophisticated molecular tools that are available in a commonly used lab species likeE. coli. So, the researchers spent some time makingVibrio natriegensa bit more amenable to manipulations, making it more capable of taking up DNA and incorporating it into a specific location in the genome. Once that was done, the researchers started looking through the genomes of species that have been identified as breaking down industrial contaminants. The breakdown of complex molecules typically involves more than one enzyme, and the genes for these enzymes tend to end up clustered together so they can be produced as a single, large RNA that encodes all the proteins needed. This simplifies regulating their production, making it easy to ensure the bacteria only make the proteins if the molecule they break down is actually present. In this case, the clusters ranged from just three genes all the way up to 11. Once nine of these gene clusters were identified, the DNA that would encode them was ordered and assembled into a single DNA molecule in yeast. The researchers took some time while ordering this DNA to better optimize the genes to be active and produce proteins inVibrio natriegens, as opposed to whatever species the genes were normally used by. From yeast, each of these individual gene clusters was inserted intoVibrio natriegens, creating different strains that could digest one of the following: benzene, toluene, phenol, naphthalene, biphenyl, DBF29, and dibenzothiophene (DBT). (Some of the nine clusters target the same contaminant.) Each of these bacterial strains was then put in a solution with the chemical they were engineered to digest. Five of the nine worked, giving researchers strains that could digest biphenyl, phenol, napthalene, DBF, and toluene. From there, the researchers developed a system that would enable them to iteratively insert a new gene cluster at the tail end of a previously inserted gene cluster. This allowed them to build up a cluster of clusters, eventually including all five of the ones that had shown activity in the earlier tests. Given two days, this single strain could remove about a quarter of the phenol, a third of the biphenyl, 30 percent of the DBF, all of the naphthalene, and nearly all of the toluene. All those contaminants came from a mixture created by the researchers specifically for the test. To get a better sense of its capabilities, the team got hold of two wastewater mixtures that also included some salt in the water. Here, the engineeredVibrio natriegensstrain proved highly effective, eliminating over 95 percent of most chemicals and about 80 percent of phenol. The strain also worked against contaminated soil. That said, this shouldn't be seen as the solution to contamination with organic chemicals. For starters, there were a number of chemical targets that weren't digested—not to mention a huge range of chemicals that weren't tested. In addition,Vibrio natriegensdoesn't grow especially well when salt isn't present, so it can't just be unleashed on all of our contamination. But perhaps the biggest problem is that, unlike the bacteria that the gene clusters originated in,Vibrio natriegenshas no way of using the broken-down products of these reactions. Other bacteria evolved these gene clusters because the clusters allowed them to incorporate the breakdown products as if they were food. In contrast,Vibrio natriegenslacks the enzymes that enable this sort of incorporation; instead, these chemical products just end up sitting around when the bacteria are done digesting. That means that, while this engineered strain gets rid of dangerous chemicals, it will leave a variety of less dangerous chemical contaminants. And, since theVibrio natriegenscan't use this material as food, there's no evolutionary selection going on for the activity of these engineered gene clusters. That means that there's no pressure to even keep the gene clusters around (though the researchers confirmed they weren't lost during these experiments). Also, no pressure that could improve their activity further. So, in the long term, it might be best to start plugging in to the pathways that break down contaminants into the cell's basic metabolism. Despite these limitations, though, the work is a clear demonstration of the potential of bacteria to help us clean up some of the messes we're making. Nature, 2025.
